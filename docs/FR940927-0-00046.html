			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. Substantive Revisions to the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and Navajo Nation Rules Implementing the Code That Are Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of SMCRA and the Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Navajo Nation proposed revisions to the following sections of its code and rules that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantively identical to the requirements of the corresponding SMCRA and Federal regulation provisions (listed in parentheses).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Title II, section 201(b), Duties of NAMLRD (Title II, section 201 of SMCRA), <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, sections 401(c)(5) and (8), Navajo Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and Purposes (Title IV, section 401(c) of SMCRA), <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, sections 403(a) and (b) and deletion of (a)(4), Objectives of Fund (Title, sections 403(a) and (c) of SMCRA), <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, section 404, Eligible Lands and Water (Title IV, section 404 of SMCRA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, section 409(b), Filling Voids and Sealing Tunnels (Title IV, section 409(c) of SMCRA), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, section 411, Certification [of Completion of Coal Reclamation] (Title IV, section 411 of SMCRA).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Navajo Nation Rules:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> II(D)(1) and (2), Reclamation Priorities (Title IV, sections 403(a) and 411(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 874.13 and 875.15),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II(L)(1)(a) through (c) and (e) through (g) and (2), General Reclamation Requirements (Title IV, sections 404 and 411(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 874.12 and 875.12),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II(M)(1) and (2), Certification of Completion of Coal Reclamation (Title IV, Sections 411(a) and (f) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.13 and 875.15),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II(N)(1), Eligible Lands and Water Subsequent to Certification (Title IV, section 411(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.14),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II(O)(1), Exclusion of Noncoal Reclamation Sites (Title IV, section 411(d) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.16),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II(P)(1), (2), and (3), Utilities and Other Facilities (Title IV, section 411(e) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.15), and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III(E)(1), Future Reclamation Set-Aside Program (Title IV, section 402(g)(6) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 873.12).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the proposed revisions to these sections of the code and rules are substantively identical to the corresponding provisions of SMCRA and the Federal regulations, the Director finds that the proposed revisions meet the requirements of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed revisions to these sections of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and the implementing Navajo Nation Rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> c. Title IV. Section 401(b)(5), Interest Credited to the AMR Fund <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Navajo Nation proposed new language in its AMLR Code of 1987 at Title IV, section 401(b)(5) to provide that the Navajo AMR Fund shall consist, in part, of amounts derived from ``interest credited to the fund under subsection (e) of section 401 of SMCRA.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 401(e) of SMCRA provides that interest can be earned on that portion of the Federal AMR Fund (administered by the Secretary) not required to meet current withdrawals. Interest earned on the invested portion of the Federal Fund is distributed only to the Secretarial share of the Federal Fund. Therefore, none of the interest earned on the invested portion of the Federal Fund is distributed to any portion of the Tribal or State share of the Federal Fund which each Tribe or State receives in annual grants as provided at 30 CFR 886. Section 401(e) of SMCRA does not restrict a Tribe or State from earning interest on the AMR fund created by a Tribe or State as part of its AMLR program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, section 401(b)(5) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 is interpreted to mean that the interest credited to the Navajo AMR fund is not the interest earned on the Federal Fund but is limited to interest credited from the deposit of other monies as provided in the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 by sections 401(b)(2), (3), (4), and (6) which include reclamation fees, user charges, donations, recovered monies, and other reclamation fees lawfully imposed by the Navajo Nation. The Director approves proposed section 401(b)(5) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 with the understanding that the interest earned is limited to the aforementioned monies deposited to the Navajo AMR fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

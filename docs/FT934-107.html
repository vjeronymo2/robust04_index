			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Britain to start Belize pull-out The British government said yesterday it would begin pulling its troops out of Belize this weekend, Reuter reports from Guatemala City. The UK, which announced last May that it would end its 45-year military presence in the former British colony, has about 1,350 troops there. By the end of next September all but 50 will be gone, the government said in a statement issued by the British embassy in Guatemala City. Those remaining will run a jungle training school for British troops. British troops have been stationed in Belize to counter possible aggression from Guatemala, which claimed the country as its own until recognising Belize's sovereignty in 1991. A border dispute continues but the British government said the pull-out reflected confidence in improved relations between the two countries.</p>

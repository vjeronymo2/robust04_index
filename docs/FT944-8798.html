			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Welsh power pay deal accepted Trade unions at South Wales Electricity have negotiated a wage agreement that will reduce pay levels for workers who join the company after December 5. The deal will extend performance-related pay or annual appraisals for wage increases to all the company's existing employees from April. The pay of existing workers will be protected. Existing staff will receive a 5.9 per cent backdated increase, made up of 2.9 per cent for last year and 3 per cent for this year, as well as lump sum one-off payments ranging from Pounds 350 to Pounds 1,250 to buy out allowances. Mr Andrew Walker, the group's chief executive, said: 'I consider the new agreement is at the forefront of deals across the electricity industry. 'We have placed great importance during the negotiations on improving employee flexibility and cost effectiveness.' The company insisted that there should be market related pay scales for all new recruits to ensure greater flexibility. Employees have accepted a range of new working practices under the deal. These include the introduction of flexible working hours for everybody, with an average 37 hours a week. A single pay structure is to replace the three-tier wage scale and single table bar-gaining is to be introduced for all five unions in the company. The agreement will introduce monthly credit transfer for paying all workers and extend maternity leave to 14 weeks on full pay. The agreement guarantees a role for the trade unions. The company said it would recognise the 'full value of collective bargaining arrangements' for which their 'support and commitment' were necessary.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / CBI chief calls on ministers to end policy 'vacuum' MR Howard Davies, director- general of the Confederation of British Industry, yesterday called on ministers to develop strategies to counter what he called 'the current vacuum' at the heart of government economic policy. He also outlined the areas the CBI would like to see reformed. They will be included in its new policy document, The Competitiveness of British Industry: the role of government, to be published next week. Mr Davies said: 'The government needs a framework of policy guidelines setting out its industrial strategy. It is no good if the Department of Trade and Industry produces a new definition of policy if it fails to get its message across to other departments.' The CBI's industrial paper outlines seven areas in which it would like to see significant changes in government policy. These include public expenditure and taxation, education and training, transport planning, trade and investment and regulation. 'This should provide the framework for a restatement of government industrial policy,' Mr Davies said. He described the present government spending round as a 'ridiculous horse trade' which inevitably resulted in unsatisfactory decisions. 'It often ends in government investing in failure instead of investing in success.' Speaking earlier at a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in Blackpool, Mr Davies said nothing short of a new definition of the aims of government industrial policy would do. He warned his audience against believing that each government department was formulating its own policy towards industry. 'That is not adequate to fill the vacuum at the heart of government economic policy. Businessmen do not understand the government's objectives.' Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, replied that manufacturing industry was crucial to Britain's economic success, but said it would not be politically sensible for the government to publish its industrial objectives which could be open to criticism.</p>

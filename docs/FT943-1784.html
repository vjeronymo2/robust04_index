			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Arjo allays fears of large rights issue Shares in Arjo Wiggins Appleton rose by 12p to 263p yesterday after the Anglo-French paper group denied that it would bid for SD Warren, owner of four big US paper mills. Warren is being auctioned by Scott Paper Company. Arjo said, however, it was 'investigating ways whereby it might participate in a significantly smaller proportion of SD Warren's business in conjunction with a partner.' Analysts described the share price rise as a collective sigh of relief that Arjo would not be launching a substantial rights issue to fund an acquisition. Mr Mike Brown of SG Warburg Securities said: 'The statement was overdue, because the market was rife with these stories. It was emerging that there were one or two favoured candidates at Warren and people were beginning to put some numbers together.' Arjo is likely to face stiff competition to buy the more attractive operations at Warren, the world's largest maker of coated free-sheet paper. The auction is due to close next week. Arjo has been hit by wood pulp price increases of 45 per cent this year as the recovery in the paper industry has led to a shortage of raw material. With little pulp production of its own, it has been forced to pass on higher costs. See Lex</p>

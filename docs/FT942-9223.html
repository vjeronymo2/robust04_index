			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Barclays hedges its property portfolio Barclays is to hedge itself partially against further losses on its Pounds 4.2bn UK property loan portfolio by issuing Pounds 150m of derivative debt securities to offset the risk. The issue - the first attempt by a British bank to balance risks in this way  -is intended to protect Barclays while it reduces its exposure to property. A further Pounds 100m securities may be issued. Barclays, which made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m in 1992 after allowing property loans to grow to 9 per cent of the total, decided to hedge because it did not want to sell property loans rapidly at a heavy discount. The capital sum from the Property Index Certificates, which will be sold to institutional investors in minimum tranches of Pounds 250,000, will only be partially repaid if property values fall, allowing it to offset losses on its own book. Mr Alan Brown, Barclays' director of group credit policy, said it was 'not trying to call the market' by betting on which way property prices would move, but wanted to reduce potential losses if prices fell. This would allow the bank to reduce property loans further from the current 6.5 per cent of total lending over the next two to five years. Without a hedge, it would face pressure to refuse new property loans, or sell old ones. Barclays is marketing the certificates, indexed to the Pounds 40bn Investment Property Databank (IPD), as a chance for investors to gain exposure to recovery in the UK property market without having to buy and manage properties. If the IPD index rises, a premium will be paid along with the capital on the redemption date. The quarterly income from the certificates is fixed at 7.3 per cent this year, but will then vary with the yield of the index. Although many investors want to increase their holdings of commercial property, they have until now had to buy and manage properties, or invest in unit trusts. This makes it hard to invest quickly, and can involve high costs and charges. Mr James Woodlock, managing director of BZW Investment Management, which devised the certificates, said the size and diversity of Barclays' portfolio offered an unusual chance to devise a security which tracked the property market.

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIKE PATH SHUTTLE TO NOWHERE AND BACK  </P> <P> The city of Huntington Beach seems preoccupied with making visitors happy with  a free shuttle on the bicycle path where on the weekends pedestrians vie with  bicycles for space.  </P> <P> Walking as a form of exercise seems unrelated to the unnecessary use of  gasoline to transport one or two persons from one end of the path to the other,  for no apparent reason, as there are no destinations at either end.  </P> <P> The pier, of course, is closed.  </P> <P> I wonder how many of the good citizens of this city realize how much in debt  the city is to someone's unfortunate idea of service.  </P> <P> GLADYS LORENZO  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

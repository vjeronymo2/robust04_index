			<p>BFN     [Text] On 17 May, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy  attended a meeting in Sao Paulo with businessmen and Sao Paulo  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho to discuss a specific  subject: U.S. dissatisfaction with the manner in which Brazil  handles its wheat purchases on the international market.    Brazil purchases wheat from Canada, the EU, and Argentina.  The United States argue that the Canadian wheat is subsidized  and represents unfair competition. "Brazil must adopt an  antidumping measure against Canada," said Espy, who occupied a  seat in the U.S. Congress since 1986, has a long career lobbying  [preceding word given in English] in favor of U.S. wheat  producers, and was a member of the Agriculture and Budget  committees since 1986.  <H5>  Negotiated Solution </H5>   After the meeting, Gov. Fleury Filho said the Brazilian  Government will receive the U.S. proposal with reservations.  "Our solution must be negotiated. Wheat purchases should be  discussed based on some reciprocity regarding orange juice,  shoes, and alcohol," said the governor, who believes Brazilian  interests were not well defended during the GATT negotiations.    The U.S. agriculture secretary seems to be willing to leave  Brasilia today with some results. "If the talks in Brasilia are  satisfactory, we may include Brazil in our program of exports  incentives," Espy said in reference to the EEP (Export  Enhancement Program) [preceding three words in English] that,  with subsidies, could reduce the price of U.S. wheat offered to  Brazil. Notwithstanding, Mike Espy pointed out that the measure  would be adopted "in coordination with Argentina" in order not  to harm its wheat sales to Brazil.</p>

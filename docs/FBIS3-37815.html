"We are satisfied with the dialogue," the leader of the  Russian delegation to the talks, Deputy Foreign Minister  Aleksandr Panov told the press on Tuesday morning the  consultations have confirmed Japan's support for Russian  reforms. The process is already underway of turning the Group  of Seven into a group of eight by admitting Russia to the club  of the world's strongest powers. Japan has also showed a full  understanding of the need to help the United Nations in solving  international problems, Panov said.    As concerns the peace treaty between Russia and Japan, the  Russian deputy minister said it was necessary to "set the scene"  for a favourable dialogue on this subject. To facilitate the  creation of a favourable atmosphere, the two delegations decided  not to emphasize the territorial issue at their Tuesday meeting.    Panov said a decision is due to be reached on Tuesday on the  date of the Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's visit to  Moscow.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television The central idea in Sleepers, of two Soviet agents, posted to Britain in 1966 and forgotten, who have become pillars of their respective communities  -the City and a northern brewery - is so good that the details scarcely matter. However, the details in the first episode were also pretty impressive, so this looks like being an unusually successful spy comedy (9.25 BBC2). The BBC has produced a documentary about policing in South Africa. No doubt you realised that when black policemen hit black citizens over the head it is not worth making programmes about it. And when the police come overwhelmingly from one tribe and the policed overwhelmingly from another that doesn't matter either, unless their skins are different colours. Then it matters terribly . Hence, presumably, tonight's Inside Story concentrating on the Cape Town riot unit. Unfortunately the version of Brimstone And Treacle being shown in C4's 'Banned' festival (11.00) is the one made for the cinema with Sting in the diabolical role. The BBC television version was superior.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Bank warned on settlement role THE Bank of England should be wary about taking on the operation of an equities settlement system because it might interfere with its role as a regulator, a study sponsored by the Corporation of London has concluded. In the aftermath of the collapse of Taurus, the Stock Exchange settlement system, the Bank has proposed a successor system, to be known as Crest, which it said it or a commercial vendor might operate. The report notes that in other centres, responsibility for equity settlement tends to be shared between the stock exchange, banks and brokers.</p>

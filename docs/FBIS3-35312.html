			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The assassination of a French citizen in Algiers and  the violent incidents of the past few days in several Algerian  cities confirm that opposition has rekindled after about one  month of calm. The recent clashes between government forces and  Islamists resulted in 30 deaths on both sides. Opposition  forces in Sidi Bel Abbes have attacked and set fire to  government offices and institutions and gas station workers have  gone on strike.    The resumption of such incidents in Algeria shows that the  period of optimism toward the government of Algerian President  General Zeroual has ended and, having given up all hopes for any  type of political reform by the government, the opposition has  once again resorted to struggle.    Since coming to power one month ago, General Zeroual, who  was  designated as president by the former coup council, has been  constantly announcing that he will soon pave the way for a  national reconciliation and will start talks with the  opposition. However, he has not taken any steps toward this;  and possibly, this is the main reason for the resumption of  violence in Algeria.    Algerian prisons continue to be filled with political  prisoners. Some of Algeria's political parties remain illegal  and are unable to carry out overt activities. By taking  advantage of the state of emergency regulations, which have not  yet been lifted, Algerian forces carry out attacks on  residential areas on a daily basis and every so often they kill  several opposition members. The newly established statesmen in  Algeria have not taken any steps to reinstate the rights of  those who were elected by the people--rights that were usurped  by the former coup council. Moreover, by ordering the Islamists  to refrain from opposing the current rulers, the statesmen  continue the former suppressive conditions.    These suppressive conditions show that the current situation  in Algeria is not very different from the situation that  prevailed a month ago. The only difference is that the ruling  pawns have changed. The continuation of the suppressive climate  in Algeria has destroyed all grounds for goodwill by the  opposition and is gradually returning Algeria to the past  violent situation. In this climate, the current Algerian  Government is responsible for the blood that is shed and the  destruction that is done.</p>

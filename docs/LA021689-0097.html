			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUXURY LINER RAMS ANCHORED NAVY SHIP  </P> <P> A 400-foot luxury liner attempting to dock in the Port of Palm Beach Wednesday  night hit an anchored Navy ship and tore several holes in the 110-foot vessel,  the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> The accident involving the Viking Princess and the unnamed naval cargo loading  craft caused no serious injuries to passengers or crew, Coast Guard Petty  Officer Jerry Snyder said.  </P> <P> "It's a very small harbor," with only two shipping channels and a small area  where the cruise liners have to turn around, Snyder said.  </P> <P> Two Coast Guard utility boats plugged three holes below the Navy vessel's water  line, and minor flooding was quickly brought under control, Snyder said.  </P> <P> Some passengers of the Viking Princess were shaken up, but the crew was able to  care for them without assistance, he said.  </P></p>

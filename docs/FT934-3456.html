			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Haiti could suffer army power struggle Low on fuel and unsure where the next paycheck is coming from, the Haitian army is facing a crisis which diplomats said yesterday could mean a power struggle between the military and right-wing groups, Reuter reports from Port au Prince. Army-backed groups such as the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH) are expanding their operations, threatening rank-and-file military men who see their power being eroded, said one western diplomat. That might help push the army back to the negotiating table after weeks of the military thwarting a United Nations-brokered plan to restore ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, experts said. Haiti Prime Minister Robert Malval was to meet UN officials in New York yesterday and then fly to Rome to seek the Vatican's support for a new initiative. Mr Malval said on Monday he would hold a national meeting as early as next week to bring various national and business leaders together to negotiate a solution to the crisis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Borisenko] </F>   [Text] Washington April 1 TASS -- Secretary of the Russian  Security Council, Oleg Lobov, ended a series of meetings with  high-ranking officials of the U.S. Administration.    On Thursday [1 April], Lobov met with the presidential aide  for economic issues, Bowmen Catter, and political adviser of the  U.S. President for health care, Richard Cronik.    Earlier, Lobov thoroughly familiarized himself with the  structure and functions of the U.S. national security council.  In particular, Lobov extended an invitation to the presidential  aide for national security, Anthony Lake, to pay a visit to  Moscow. The invitation was accepted with gratitude.    During Lobov's talks with top-ranking officials of the U.S.  Administration, the sides discussed, in particular, the U.S.  stance on the development of relations with Russia. The sides  pointed out the importance of deepening interaction and  partnership between the two countries. Considerable attention  was paid to economic problems which were thoroughly discussed at  a meeting between the Russian delegation and representatives of  U.S. business circles.    After the talks in Washington were completed, the Russian  delegation went to Honolulu at the invitation of the governor of  the state of Hawaii. During a series of meetings with local  businessmen the sides are expected to discuss possibilities for  establishing mutually advantageous ties between American  companies and Russian organisations in the Far East and problems  of stepping up cooperation in the Asian-Pacific region. This  subject is expected to be brought up at a meeting with members  of the council for international affairs in Honolulu.</p>

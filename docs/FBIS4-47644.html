			<p>SUMMARY                                 The overwhelming Communist Party (CPU) victory in the Donetsk  Oblast election of Ukrainian Supreme Soviet deputies appears to  reflect a groundswell of anti-Kiev public sentiment rather than  just orchestration by the pro-communist oblast leaders, auguring  serious trouble for the Ukrainian Government.  Donetsk leaders  themselves did not appear to control the election and, despite  their connections to the CPU, did poorly.  The Donetsk public's  alienation from Kiev was especially clearly demonstrated in the  vote on referendum questions on the Russian language and on  joining an economic union with Russia, all of which passed by  over 10 to 1.  Donetsk's pro-communist sentiment did not extend  to the neighboring oblasts of Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk,  however, where communists won few seats and a strong, well-  financed campaign helped industrial and agricultural leaders  predominate.                       END SUMMARY     The Communist Party of Ukraine was virtually the only winner in  Donetsk.  Of the 43 seats settled by the election (four are still  vacant), the CPU won 23 (22 CPU and one joint CPU-Socialist-  Labor), while in eight other districts the CPU candidates came in  second (getting into the runoffs but losing).  CPU First  Secretary Petro Symonenko won on the first round in district 150.  In addition, seven deputies from parties close to the CPU won  (three Socialist Party (SPU), two Labor, one Peasant Party  (SelPU), one Civil Congress of Ukraine), according to Post-Inform  (Post-Postup News Agency) identifications.     Other than the CPU, no party or group or category elected many  representatives:     -- Government officials lost about as many races as they won,  suggesting that officeholding did not translate into control of  the elections and that prominence and name recognition did not by  themselves help much.  While the winners included Deputy Chairmen  of the Donetsk City Executive Committee Volodymyr Shcherban  (nonparty) and Yuriy Boldyrev (Civil Congress of Ukraine and,  according to Donetsk Television on 3 April, one of the initiators  of the referendums), deputy chairman of the Kramatorg City  Executive Committee Pavlo Kuznetsov (CPU), and chief of the  oblast agriculture administration Anatoliy Petrenko (SelPU),  losers included oblast soviet chairman Vadym Chuprun in district  147, deputy Donetsk City Soviet Chairman Burikh in district 118,  deputy oblast administration chief Hennadiy Molodan (Liberal  Party) in district 110, and deputy presidential representative V.  Nakonechnyy, who failed to get elected in district 152 because of  insufficient turnout (Post-Inform, 11 April; Holos Ukrainy, 27  April).     -- Even the prominence of Acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and  Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk, both formerly important figures  in Donetsk, did not bring them easy victories, and both won only  in runoffs.  In particular, zvyahilskyy, who was a local mine  director and Donetsk city mayor before being named first deputy  premier in June 1993, demonstrated little local popularity.  In  the first round he ran second to a CPU candidate (Vechernyy  Donetsk, 5 April).  An article in the 17-24 March Post-Postup  reported that the independent union at his old mine had opposed  the mine's nomination of Zvyahilskyy.  Zvyahilskyy's son-in-law,  Volodymyr Vechirko, running in district 109, lost when neither  candidate won a majority in the runoffs (Post-Inform, 11 April).  A 15-21 April Post-Postup article asserted that Landyk and  Shcherban won votes by having clerks identified with them sell  food at cutrate prices in key precincts and that Boldyrev and  zvyahilskyy were aided by local officials who barred outside  observers at voting precincts and appeared to add ballots.     -- Incumbent Supreme Soviet members did badly.  According to the  25-31 March Post-Postup, 14 Supreme Soviet members ran for  reelection.  Only four were among the winners and two of them ran  on the CPU ticket--Oleksiy Shekhovtsov, Anatoliy Khunov (CPU),  Oleh Panasovskiy (CPU), and zvyahilskyy--while even one of the  most prominent leftist-conservative deputies, Oleksandr  Charodeyev (running as nonparty), lost in district 116.     -- Industrial and enterprise leaders did better, but "red  directors" did not appear dominant.  The winners included  Chairman of the State Committee for the Coal Industry Mykola  Surhay (nonparty), head of the Donetsk Railway Oleksandr  Kozhushko (nonparty), President of the Aton Corporation Yevhen  Shcherban (Liberal Party), mine director Volodymyr Ampilohov  (non-party), deputy plant director Borys Kozhevnykov (CPU), chief  of a mine construction trust Valeriy Pudryk (CPU), coal  construction trust official Anatoliy Tatarynov (nonparty), farm  enterprise head Oleksandr Shamaryn (CPU), and power station  director Oleh Panasovskyy (CPU).  But metallurgical combine  deputy director M. Khromov lost in 134, and mine director  Teslenko lost in district 144 (Post-Inform, 11 April).     -- Almost no union leaders won, despite the importance of unions  in Donetsk and the miners' political activism and repeated  strikes.  While one minor union official won (Anatoliy  Khmelyovyy, head of a union at a locomotive depot), Cochairman of  the Donetsk Strike Committee Mykola Krylov lost in district 113  to a CPU candidate, chairman of the trade union at the Azov Steel  Plant (Azovstal) lost in district 137, and a rayon trade union  head lost in district 151 (Post-Inform, 11 April).     Factors in Victory     Donetsk's pro-communist tide appears to reflect longstanding  communist strength in the oblast and public dissatisfaction with  Kiev's economic policies and its ptomotion of Ukrainian  nationalism.  An article in the 25-31 March Lviv weekly Post-  Postup discussing reasons for the communist victory argued that  the Donetsk CPU organization, one of the biggest in the old  Soviet Union, is still strong and was able to put up far more  candidates than other parties (52 in the 47 districts).  The  article also maintained that Donetsk has an especially high  number of pensioners, who are inclined to prefer the past and who  are inclined to go out to vote, while young people were simply  ignoring the election.     Local Leadership     The Donetsk leadership is close to the CPU, even though it did  not do as well as the CPU itself in the election.  The local  government leadership consists of many of the same individuals  who ran the oblast before the overthrow of the communist system  in 1991.  The top Donetsk leader, Presidential Representative  Yuriy Smirnov (who did not run for the Supreme Soviet), was CPU  oblast first secretary and then oblast soviet chairman before  being chosen by President Leonid Kravchuk for the top local  government post when Kravchuk created this new post of  presidential representative in early 1992.  The No. 2 man in the  province, Oblast Soviet Chairman Chuprun, had been CPU oblast  secretary until succeeding Smirnov as soviet chairman.  He was  defeated by incumbent Supreme Soviet deputy and CPU candidate  Panasovskyy.  Chuprun recently renewed his membership in the CPU,  and a 26 April Donetsk CPU conference nominated him for  reelection as oblast soviet chairman (Post-Inform, 29 April).     Moreover, the top Ukrainian republic leaders from Donetsk were  also part of the party or government establishment there.  Acting  Premier Zvyahilskyy was elected Donetsk City Soviet and Executive  Committee chairman in the fall of 1991 (Nezavisimost, 21 July  1992), while Deputy Premier Landyk was director of a prominent  Donetsk enterprise.   Present Ukrainian Communist Party First  Secretary Symonenko was Donetsk CPU second secretary in 1990 and  founded the new CPU, now the Ukraine's biggest party, in 1993.                        Donetsk Leadership                              1990            1992            1994     Communist Party:     Oblast first secretary   Mironov         (CPU banned)  Oblast second secretary     Symonenko  Oblast secretary            Chuprun     Government:     Presidential representative  ---         Smirnov         Smirnov  Oblast soviet head         Smirnov          Chuprun         Chuprun  City soviet head           Makhmudov      Zvyahilskyy   (apparently                                                            vacant)  eot     Public Attitudes     The local leadership, sympathetic to Russia and the old system,  has pressed for autonomy from Kiev and closer ties to Russia and  took advantage of the election to put on the ballot referendum  questions designed to promote a course opposite from Kiev's.  In  mid-1993 the oblast soviet had passed a resolution calling for  regional autonomy and expressing no confidence in President  Kravchuk (Rossiyskiye Vesti, Izvestiya, 16 June 1993), and on 22  February it adopted a decision to put questions on the 27 March  ballot on making Russian, in addition to Ukrainian, the official  language, either in Ukraine as a whole or at least in Donetsk  (Donbass, 25 February).  Also added to the ballot were questions  on having Ukraine join the CIS economic union and on changing the  Ukrainian Constitution to provide for a federal system that would  enable Donetsk to become autonomous.     The results of the referendums reflected the strong public  alienation from the Kiev government, its promotion of Ukrainian  nationalism, and its conflicts with Russia.  Donetsk voters  clearly backed more use of the Russian language, closer economic  ties with Russia, and autonomy for Donbass to pursue its own  policies, judging by the results reported in the 1 April  Vecherniy Donetsk:                                     Yes            No  Should the constitution make     Russian a state language     in Ukraine along with    Ukrainian?                    2,430,821      238,017     Should the Russian language     be the "language of work,     business, and documentation     and also education and     science" along with    Ukrainian in Donetsk Oblast?  2,455,949      191,791     Should Ukraine become a full     member of the CIS economic     union and parliamentary    assembly of states?           2,481,981      190,907     Should the Ukrainian Constitution    establish a federal system?   2,227,538      419,794  eot     Opinion Polls     Opinion polls in Donetsk have also suggested antagonism toward  Kiev and President Kravchuk.  A mid-April poll of Donetsk voters  on support for presidential candidates showed 38 percent for  Kuchma, 21 percent for Kravchuk, 8 percent for reform economist  Volodymyr Lanovyy, 5 percent for Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan  Plyushch, 4 percent for CPU leader Symonenko, and 3 percent for  SPU leader Oleksandr Moroz (Post-Postup, 29 April-6 May). Another  such poll showed Kuchma with 24.1 percent, 20.7 percent for  Symonenko, and 13.8 percent for Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil,  while Kravchuk got only 3.4 percent, falling behind them and also  behind Zvyahilskyy, New Ukraine leader Volodymyr Hrynyov, and  Moroz (Aktsent, 30 April). (See Note 1)  Lviv's Vysokyy Zamok on  23 April cited a recent poll by the Ukrainian Center for  Political Psychology showing that in Donetsk and Luhansk only 40  percent support Ukrainian independence now while 37.1 percent  oppose it--less than half the 83 percent who voted for  independence in December 1991 in both these oblasts  (Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 December 1991).     (Note 1) In an effort to boost his sagging popularity, Kravchuk  in mid-May visited Donetsk and delivered a speech to industry  leaders supporting "the broadest regional independence" and  recalling his recent decree allowing four eastern oblasts to  conduct an economic experiment.  He also called for postponing  the presidential election and won support for this from others at  the meeting (UNIAN, 17 May).     Role of Press     The local newspapers, although calling themselves independent of  the oblast leadership, have appeared to promote the communist  cause and the position of local leaders.  The oblast paper with  the biggest circulation, Aktsent, on 18 March argued that Kiev's  bureaucracy is draining and holding back Donetsk and that the  oblast needs economic independence to extricate itself from  economic crisis.  The same paper on 1 April enthusiastically  lauded the communist victory and ridiculed the nationalists' poor  showing and declared that "for the communist majority of voters  and in general for this region the very word 'liberal' . . . is a  swear word and 'bourgeois.'"     Some papers appeared to have ties to some establishment  candidates.  The weekly Donetskiy Kryazh, according to a 17-24  March Post-Postup article, promoted Zvyahilskyy's son-in-law as a  "talented doctor and active public figure" who is developing a  "super-modern" medical center to aid invalids and pensioners.  Vechirko leads the scientific-industrial firm Interbis, which  also happens to be one of the sponsors of the paper.  The 17-24  March Post-Postup article by Serhiy Furmanyuk also asserted that  city executive committee deputy chairman Volodymyr Shcherban, who  heads the stock company "Delo Vsekh" (Everybody's Cause), shortly  before the campaign became a publisher of the popular local paper  Gorod, "thereby reliably protecting his candidacy from any press  criticism."  Furmanyuk, who worked for the paper Gorod, was  subsequently fired by its chief editor for trying to discredit  Shcherban and impugning the honesty and independence of Gorod  (Post-Postup, 8-14 April).  Donetsk City's paper Vecherniy  Donetsk did not provide much coverage of the election or  candidates but did appear to give special coverage to a few  selected candidates--Zvyahilskyy (16 March, 8 April), Ampilohov  (23 March, 7, 8 April), and V. Shcherban (25 March, 6 April), and  it also carried a 1 April report on a press conference by the  victorious CPU.     Contrast to Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk     The pro-CPU tide in Donetsk was also evident in neighboring  Luhansk and Zaporizhzhya, where the party took 18 of the 23 seats  settled and 7 of 16, respectively, but anti-Kiev sentiment did  not translate into communist victories in neighboring Kharkiv and  Dnipropetrovsk, where the CPU was seriously outspent by  industrial-agricultural forces.  In Dnipropetrovsk the CPU won  only one seat of the 21 settled and in Kharkiv only six of the 24  settled, based on identifications in the list of winners in the  21 April Uryadovyy Kuryer (see table).  Although these oblasts  also oppose Kiev's nationalistic policies and economic decisions,  they elected mainly industrial and agricultural leaders, rather  than CPU candidates.  Thus, Kharkiv elected nine such industrial  and agricultural officials (three of whom were also CPU  candidates) of their 24 elected, and Dnipropetrovsk elected eight  of its 21.     The fact that the main winners in these oblasts were industrial-  agricultural forces at least partly reflected the efforts of the  Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR) organized by former Premier  Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr  Hrynyov to compete with the leftists.  While it is hard to assess  MBR successes because its winning candidates usually identified  themselves as nonparty or members of the Party of Democratic  Revival of Ukraine (PDVU), the 15-21 April Post-Postup reported  five MBR candidates elected in Kharkiv City, and Post-Inform on  11 April reported three MBR candidates elected in Dnipropetrovsk  Oblast.     In Dnipropetrovsk the MBR appeared to put on a strong campaign  and spend large sums of money the leftists could not match.  The  MBR ran many ads in the local paper Dneprovskaya Panorama listing  a ticket of candidates in 13 districts plus support for five  independent candidates, and seven of these won, judging by the  list of winners in the 12 April Dneprovskaya Panorama.  A 15-21  April Post-Postup article argued that leftists simply could not  compete with the big money of the MBR and industrialists and  quoted one SPU candidate complaining on television that the MBR  was spending enough on the election to feed the whole population  of Kharkiv for one year.  By contrast, the MBR appeared inactive  in Donetsk.  The 19 February Vecherniy Donetsk's complete list of  candidates for Donetsk City's 10 districts included no MBR  candidates.     The industrial-agricultural leaders, although presumably broadly  reflecting the establishment, appeared to include some reformers  and democrats.  MBR leader Hrynyov is clearly an economic  reformer, and one of the MBR candidates spoke of MBR's candidates  as "marketeers" (rynochniki), according to a 5 April Dneprovskaya  Panorama article.   The party representatives elected in the three contrasting  oblasts, judging by official identifications in the list of  winners in the 21 April Uryadovyy Kuryer, were:                  CPU   SPU   Labor  SelPU   Civil    PDVU  Nonparty                                          Congress  Dnipropetrovsk  1    1     2      3       0      1       13  Kharkiv         6    2     0      0       1      1       14  Donetsk       22*    3     1*     1       1      0       15     *Post-Inform identifications differed slightly, listing 22 CPU  winners plus one joint CPU-SPU-Labor and two Labor.  Two winners  listed as nonparty in Uryadovyy Kuryer were listed as Labor and  joint CPU-SPU-Labor, respectively, by Post-Inform on 11 April.  eot     Implications     Ukraine's biggest oblast is at sharp odds with the government in  Kiev at least partly because of widespread public sentiment  hostile to Ukrainian nationalism and the prospect of economic  reform.  Its deputies in the Supreme Soviet will probably play a  key role in organizing a bloc against reforms, and President  Kravchuk will have difficulty winning much support in Donetsk in  his bid for reelection.  Fortunately for Kravchuk and reformers,  pro-communist sentiment is not dominant everywhere in the east,  as the success of the strong, well-financed campaign by MBR-  industrialists demonstrated in the nearby provinces of Kharkiv  and Dnipropetrovsk.

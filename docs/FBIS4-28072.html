			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 7 (ANTARA) -- The ministerial meeting  of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] in Cairo has suggested  Indonesia, as NAM chairman, to hold a dialogue with the group of  seven industrialized countries (G7) when they meet in Napoli,  Italy, chief executive of the NAM chairman Nana Sutresno has  said.    "The G7 summit will soon be held in Napoli, and the Cairo  ministerial meeting has asked NAM to continue making an approach  to the forum by having the chairman of G77 [developing  countries] and the chairman of the Cairo ministerial meeting to  take part," Nana Sutresna said upon arrival at the Sukarno-Hatta  Airport in Jakarta Monday after attending the NAM ministerial  meeting in the Egyptian capital.    This means, he added, NAM has taken concrete steps in facing  further developments on the basis of the breakthrough made by  President Suharto in the course of his meeting with the G7  recently.    "This is obviously a commitment of whoever is to succeed  Indonesia to meet the seven industrialized countries," he said.    President Suharto's meeting with the G7 member countries in  Tokyo last year was considered a performance of high strategic  significance in Indonesia's leadership of the 111-member  Nonaligned Movement.    "The meeting has already been followed up by making the  Tokyo  resolutions a decision of the United Nations General Assembly.  This is of strategic significance because it was the first time  that the NAM's initiative has been supported by the entire  international community, including the industrialized nations,"  Nana said.    One of the follow-up measures of the historical Tokyo  meeting, he added, was the formation by the New York-based NAM  coordinating bureau of a working group asking for the views of  experts of the Geneva-based South Centre to see what has to be  done by NAM in the implementation of the resolutions.</p>

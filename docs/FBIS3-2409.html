			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- A recently-completed  Ministry of National Defense (MND) white paper on Taiwan  security issues concluded that Beijing remains Taiwan's top  security threat and would be most likely to attack if the island  declares independence.    The soon-to-be released white paper discussed events which  would provoke a mainland attack and detailed possible military  tactics Beijing would use against Taiwan.    The paper also listed the six most likely ways Beijing would  attack Taiwan with an airstrike across the Taiwan Strait topping  the list.    Communist forces might opt for a sudden missile attack  against targets on Taiwan's west coast, the paper said, or seize  the pretext of fishing disputes to confront Taiwan's navy.    The MND said that Beijing may prefer to lure Taiwan air and  sea forces into battle after first attacking Taiwan-held islands  or supply vessels plying the Taiwan Strait.    Another tactic would be a rapid invasion and takeover of  Taiwan-held islands using a small combat force, the paper noted.    And rounding out the list would be a conventional,  full-scale  assault on Taiwan using a combination of strategies and forces.    The white paper said that Taiwan faces an increased threat  from Beijing since the Communists have stepped up the pace of  their military buildup.    Sources from Beijing confirmed recently that Beijing's  defense budget will increase 20 percent this year to top 50  billion renminbi (US$5.75 billion).    The paper also noted that Taiwan is facing increased  security  threats from other Asia-Pacific nations, especially over  disputes concerning the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands.    Defense Minister Sun Chen said Tuesday [8 March] that a  10-year plan, launched this fiscal year, will upgrade the  efficiency of the military in both hardware and software buildup  while cutting the number of personnel.    The white paper was the second of its kind. The MND  published the first edition in February, 1992.</p>

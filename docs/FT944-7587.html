			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / BBC to push ahead with digital television The BBC has decided in principle to push ahead with the launch of digital terrestrial television and a near-national service could begin as early as the autumn of 1997. A BBC study of the issue following the government white paper on the future of the corporation has come to a positive interim conclusion. Terrestrial digital television involves turning the conventional television picture into digits, the language of computers, but broadcasting through land-based transmitters rather than by satellite. The technology would allow the launch of wide-screen television - giving a picture shaped like a cinema screen - and a number of extra channels. As many as 12 new digital television channels could be created in the UK and broadcast alongside the conventional four national channels. The BBC believes digital technology will win over existing analogue technology in the end. A crossover period of 10 to 15 years is likely, however, when the two systems will have to be broadcast at the same time so that no one is deprived of their basic television service. The BBC may carry out its first public technical trial in March and a limited regional trial could get under way in 1995 or 1996. The BBC, as a publicly funded organisation, can initiate the first steps in creating a digital terrestrial service. Executives emphasise, however, that nothing of substance will happen unless the project is supported by other British broadcasters and by the consumer electronics companies which would manufacture the set-top boxes and new television sets. Mr Charles Allan, chief executive of both Granada Television and LWT, recently expressed interest in digital terrestrial television and the possibility of creating new channels that it offered. The BBC has been having talks with consumer electronics companies such as Sony and with representatives of the ITV system. In its white paper on the corporation's new Royal Charter the government appeared to link a BBC move into digital television with privatisation or partial privatisation of its transmitter network. The assumption appeared to be that some of the money raised could be used for funding the launch of digital. The BBC argues that keeping it intact will increase its ability to make the investment and commitment needed for digital. The hope in the BBC is that a digital terrestrial service might be launched by 1997 covering up to 80 per cent of the UK, possibly with a private-sector partner. On Monday the BBC will announce it is going ahead with two 24-hour a day satellite channels for Europe in a joint venture with Pearson, the media and entertainment group that owns the Financial Times.</p>

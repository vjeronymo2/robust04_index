			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The Corfu Summit: Disquiet over island facelift From the gleaming salmon-pink paint on Corfu's crumbling seafront mansions to roads unusually free of potholes for a Greek island, it is clear that an expensive facelift has been carried out in preparation for staging this weekend's European Union summit. The government says it has spent Dr14bn (Pounds 36.8m) on the Corfu summit, though local officials say the bill is likely to be nearer Dr20bn. The scale of government spending for the summit in Corfu, which receives Dr2bn a year in EU structural funds, has been criticised by left-wing Greek politicians and some EU diplomats, who argue it is too much, given Greece's position as the union's poorest member state and its high level of debt. Comparatively little EU funding has been disbursed for the summit. According to the regional government office on Corfu, the main expense is a Dr3.3bn upgrading of Corfu airport. Mr Nikos Hytiris, in charge of EU disbursements in the Ionian islands, says: 'Like other improvements carried out for the summit, it will help to boost the island's tourist industry long after the summit is forgotten.' This weekend's summit is shorter than usual, with only one formal working session of three hours, squeezed between the siesta hour and an official dinner. The main reason for restricting official working hours is that the Greek prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, who will chair the meeting, has a heart problem that requires him to rest frequently. The Dr1.9bn being spent on renovating the 19th-century palace of St Michael &amp; St George, formerly home to the Greek Royal Family, includes Dr160m for a temporary structure to serve as the meeting room for government leaders from the 12 EU countries and the four new member states. Because the council chamber, constructed of metal and bullet-proof glass with a dramatic view across the Corfu strait to Albania, was built over the palace's main courtyard, it is due to be removed the day after the summit. 'The courtyard was the only space in the building big enough for a European council meeting, complete with interpreters' booths. But the state archaeological service insists it has to come down immediately afterwards,' said Mr Konstantinos Kouvaras, managing director of Avax, the Greek construction company responsible for the turnkey project. It is some consolation that the German government, which takes over the EU presidency from Greece on July 1, has offered to buy the oval conference table and chairs specially made for the meeting, he added. The other main renovation project is the international press centre, a Dr3bn conversion of an 18th century fortress designed for a garrison considerably smaller than the 3,000-strong contingent of journalists covering the event. Afterwards, the building will become Corfu's conference centre.</p>

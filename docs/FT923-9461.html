			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific optimistic after loss in first half CANADIAN PACIFIC, the diversified holding company, yesterday unveiled disappointing second-quarter and first-half results. However, the group said heavy grain movements, strong oil and gas output and improved forest products markets would help in the second half. CP subsidiaries in trans-portation, energy, and forest products continued to feel the recession, while real est-ate and hotels improved their performances. Second-quarter profits were CDollars 21m (USDollars 17.7m), or 6 cents a share, against CDollars 30.9m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.5bn against CDollars 2.6bn. But the first half showed a loss of CDollars 18.7m compared with profit of CDollars 25.6m on revenues of CDollars 4.89bn, against CDollars 5.06bn last time. CP Rail weakened in the second quarter when grain movements declined. Overall traffic dipped 7 per cent because of labour disputes in some western industries, but it said that grain movements should recover in the second half. The coal unit's performance improved in the first half. A strike has halted coal shipments from Vancouver but talks are under way to try to resolve the dispute. Forest products losses rose in the first half, but pulp and newsprint prices have recently firmed and markets should strengthen in the second half. The deterioration in the first half was partly offset by a lower Canadian dollar and reduced production costs. Marathon Realty had first-half operating income of CDollars 123m, up CDollars 50m, from higher sales of land and buildings. Rental income fell because of the recession while hotels gained from higher efficiency and improved average room rates. The US Doubletree hotels also did better. The machinery group improved with a strong performance by the Litwin petrochemical engineering unit. The recession continued to affect 19 per cent-owned Laidlaw, the big North American waste management group. Cascades, a fast-expanding international packaging group, earned first-half profits of CDollars 12.3m, or 23 cents a share, against CDollars 3.4m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 425m against CDollars 422m.</p>

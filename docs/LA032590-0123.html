			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> SOME GIANTS OF TURF TO MEET TODAY  </P> <P> Without question, the $315,000 San Luis Rey Stakes today at Santa Anita is one  of the more attractive races of the year.  </P> <P> The prelude to the season-ending San Juan Capistrano attracted only six  entrants, but three of them are Prized, Frankly Perfect and Hawkster. Each  boasts outstanding credentials on the turf, and a fourth, El Senor, also is no  slouch. The eastern-based 6-year-old has earned almost $1.1 million.  </P> <P> Best known for his upset of Sunday Silence in last summer's Swaps Stakes,  Prized has earned recognition as one of the the nation's best grass performers.  </P> <P> He made his debut on the surface in the Breeders' Cup Turf and came through  with a narrow decision over Sierra Roberta, Star Lift and 11 others at  Gulfstream Park.  </P> <P> Given a vacation after that huge payday, the 4-year-old Kris S. colt returned  in the Arcadia Handicap March 4 against Breeders' Cup Mile and Eclipse Award  winner Steinlen.  </P> <P> Dismissed by a lot of serious handicappers who felt a mile was too short for  him, Prized trailed with less than three furlongs to run, then, helped by the  sizzling pace in front of him, took off and won going away with Steinlen -- who  bled -- well beaten.  </P> <P> Three weeks later, Prized gets the Breeders' Cup Turf distance -- 1 1/2 miles  -- and it is apparent, despite his latest success, the more furlongs the better  for trainer Neil Drysdale's colt.  </P> <P> Frankly Perfect, owned by Kings' owner Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky, is the  defending San Luis Rey champion, having defeated heavily favored Great  Communicator a year ago.  </P> <P> Since then, the 5-year-old son of Perrault has victories in the Golden Gate  Handicap, the Hollywood Turf Cup, and on Feb. 19 he was much the best in  winning the San Luis Obispo Handicap. Frankly Perfect was also beaten by a nose  in the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park, and he was runner-up to Alwuhush in  the Carleton F. Burke at Oak Tree, so consistency hasn't been a problem for  trainer Charlie Whittingham's horse.  </P> <P> However, neither Prized nor Frankly Perfect have come close to duplicating the  effort Hawkster turned in on Oct. 14 in winning the Oak Tree Invitational.  </P> <P> In improving his record, at the time, to 4-0 on the turf, the Silver Hawk colt  opened up on his eight rivals from the start, lengthened his margin on the  backstretch while setting blazing fractions and cruised home by four lengths in  a world-record 2:22 4/5 for 1 1/2 miles.  </P> <P> However, Hawkster hasn't seen the Santa Anita grass since. After returning from  a fifth-place finish in the Japan Cup, he made two starts on the dirt, even  though it's obvious he's nowhere near the same horse on that surface. He hasn't  won on the dirt since the 1988 Norfolk.  </P> <P> Helped by the off track, Hawkster ran third in the Charles H. Strub, then beat  only stablemate Bayakoa in the Santa Anita Handicap, finishing 22 lengths  behind Ruhlmann.  </P> <P> Take out those two efforts and most would probably consider him the horse to  beat today. Instead, the question is whether Hawkster will be able to bounce  back or if those two races took their toll.  </P> <P> Delegant and Just As Lucky are the other San Luis Rey entrants, but it's  virtually impossible to give them serious consideration in a race in which  everyone is carrying 126 pounds. Delegant was getting eight pounds from Frankly  Perfect when he was second at 38-1 in the San Luis Obispo. Just As Lucky got 10  pounds and was third.  </P> <P> Making her first start since finishing ninth in the San Gorgonio Handicap in  early January, Stylish Star rallied to win an eventful $80,850 Las Cienegas  Handicap Saturday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> There was a lengthy stewards' inquiry involving the first four finishers in the  six-horse field, resulting in the disqualification of Stormy But Valid, who  originally finished second. She was placed fifth, behind Sexy Slew, who was  impeded badly nearing the sixteenth pole.  </P> <P> The stewards ruled that Stormy But Valid, ridden by Gary Stevens, came out,  albeit slightly, triggering the trouble, which also involved Hot Novel -- who  was moved up to second -- and Stylish Star.  </P> <P> "There was contact," said Chris McCarron, who was aboard the winner, the 9-2  fourth choice. "The bumping went all the way out to me. I was turned in a  little bit because another horse hit me in the rear.  </P> <P> "She was best. I've been on her during her last three works, and she had been  working very well."  </P> <P> Stylish Star, winner of the Del Mar Oaks and a division of Hollywood Park's  Dahlia Handicap, had never won a sprint before Saturday. At the end, her margin  was a little more than a length in 1:13 for about 6 1/2-furlongs on the turf.  </P> <P> "Once she ran badly in the San Gorgonio, it made us realize she'd been running  steadily from May to January," trainer Dan Hendricks said. "She just needed a  rest. We gave her a month and this fit perfectly into the schedule.  </P> <P> "She's been so good to me. As long as the inquiry took, it worried me. It  looked like the other horses came out and bumped us. That's what saved us  because we tightened it up a bit. When a horse gets hit like that, it naturally  drops in toward the horse that bumped it."  </P> <P> Hot Novel, who had just won an allowance race over the course, didn't have  clear sailing and never really got her best chance. "I got bothered a lot,"  said Eddie Delahoussaye. "I got it coming out of the gate, down the hill and in  the stretch. I just couldn't go anywhere. I was trapped."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Trainer Sandy Shulman has been fined $300 by the stewards for a medication  violation. Fill A Fair Pocket, who was unplaced in the ninth race March 15, had  an excess level of Butazolidin . . . Santa Anita will spend about $1.8 million  to renovate the hillside part of its turf course when the meeting ends April  23. Last year, the infield portion of the course was redone at a cost of $3.1  million.  </P> <P> Kent Desormeaux scored a consecutive triple Saturday with Kaboi in the fifth,  favored Toby Jug in the sixth and 12-1 outsider Peppy's Kingdom in the seventh.  Peppy's Kingdom's victory gave trainer Bob Hess three consecutive victories in  the seventh race. He won Thursday's seventh with Sumthing Rare and came back  Friday with Twombly. Hess also took the ninth Saturday with Buckland's Halo. .  . . Gary Stevens and Chris McCarron each had two winners Saturday.  </P></p>

They called on the international community to take  serious action over the Zionist regime's continuous creation of  catastrophes. In this connection, and in a telephone interview  with us, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spokesman Ibrahim  Ghawshah said:    [Begin Ghawshah recording, in Arabic with superimposed  Persian translation] Such a crime reflects the true criminal  nature of Rabin and the Zionist regime. The Palestinian  community will continue to walk on the path of martyrdom and  struggle until the full liberation of the occupied territories.  [end recording]    Ahmad Jibril, general secretary of Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine -- General Command [PFLP-GC], also spoke  to us in an interview. He emphasized: The ugly crime at the  mosque of his holiness Abraham, peace be upon him, today in the  holy month of Ramadan reflects the height of savageness and  terrorism by the Zionist regime and adds a bleak page to their  ugly record alongside the Sabra-Shatila [massacre in September  1982]. He continued: We know the true nature of Zionism, and on  this bleak day we say: Has not the time come for the Islamic  and Arab world to stand up to rescue the Palestinian people and  support them in their struggle against the Zionists and America?</p>

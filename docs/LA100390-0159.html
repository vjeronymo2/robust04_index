			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOTER REGISTRATION FOR 'PANIC TIME' LATECOMERS OFFERED  </P> <P> With less than one week left to register for the Nov. 6 general election,  government offices are trying to make last-minute registration easier for  county voters.  </P> <P> Two official registration sites will be open late Oct. 9, the last day to  register, and mail-in registration forms are available at most government  offices.  </P> <P> Late filers are often people who have recently moved and did not realize that  they need to fill out new voter registration forms, registration clerk Ann  Halford said Monday: "People move and they think their new address follows them  there. All of a sudden they learn they have to register, and it's panic time."  </P> <P> The mail-in forms can be picked up at most city halls, public libraries, post  offices, Department of Motor Vehicles offices and chambers of commerce. The  forms must be signed and postmarked before midnight Tuesday and must be  received by Oct. 12.  </P> <P> The county's registrar of voters office -- at 1300 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana --  will remain open until midnight Oct. 9. Mission Viejo City Hall will remain  open until 10 p.m. that night as a South County site for late registration.  City Hall is at 26522 La Alameda, Suite 190.  </P> <P> The county's Grand Avenue office will also be open Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3  p.m. for in-person registration, as well as during the week from 7 a.m. to 6  p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Pinochet given permission for UK visit CHILE's former president General Augusto Pinochet has been given permission by the Chilean government for a private visit to Britain which could involve meetings with defence manufacturers. Organisers of a British arms fair yesterday denied that Gen Pinochet, who remains army chief, had been invited to attend the exhibition in Birmingham on May 14-16. However, British government sources said yesterday there had been a 'number of exchanges' between his office and the British defence company, Royal Ordnance, over a possible visit to Britain.</p>

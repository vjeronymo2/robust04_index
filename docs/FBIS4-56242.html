			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem today stated that the "same kind of people General  (Juan Domingo) Peron expelled from Plaza de Mayo" in the  seventies are waging a campaign against the Armed Forces.    The president added that "the very same group of young  people  who advocate Marxism and had nothing to say when vandals  attacked La Tablada Regiment" are waging the campaign to  besmirch the Armed Forces.    Menem met the crew of the Granville corvette that had  participated in the Haiti embargo at the request of the United  Nations. The ceremony took place this morning at the northern  docks of the port of Buenos Aires. Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion and high-ranking military officers also attended the  ceremony.    In his speech to welcome the sailors, Menem accused those  who  are signing proclamations and staging demonstrations to demand  an investigation into the death of Private Omar Carrasco of  "trying to resuscitate the conflict between the Armed Forces and  the people."    He thus criticized "those who take advantage of the  unfortunate death of one soldier to pit sectors of Argentine  society against one another." The president added that "these  are the very same people who did not criticize the attack on La  Tablada Regiment."    Speaking to Radio Municipal earlier, the president warned  that certain youngsters, "incensed by fashionable ideologists,  play the role of useful idiots" in an effort to "make certain  ideas prevail through the use of violence."    He compared these groups to those "once expelled by General  (Juan Domingo) Peron from Plaza de Mayo, although they bore  different names and belonged to a different generation." Menem  was referring to the Montoneros, who were forced to go  underground after the Plaza de Mayo event.    At the welcoming ceremony for the Granville corvette, Menem  said: "We are sorry for what happened to the soldier in Zapala,  and are making an effort to find those responsible" for the  murder of Private Omar Carrasco.    "The very same people who now exude hatred had nothing to  say  about the soldiers who were shot down during the attack" on La  Tablada Regiment, on 23 January 1990, "although they, too, had  fathers and mothers," the president said.    Without calling them by name, Menem also lashed out at those  in the south who are "staging demonstrations and signing  proclamations which, based on crude lies, advocate hatred rather  than peace."    Menem stated that the murder of Private Carrasco "is  something we are all against," but he criticized "those who  always try to take advantage of this kind of thing to cause  chaos and anarchy."    Menem said that "this should never again happen in  Argentina," and voiced his hope that "there should never be a  repetition of Argentina's sorrowful and tragic recent history."    In his statement to Radio Municipal, President Menem  indicated that "the signs, the posters, the hatreds, the people  who made armed struggle a common event in this part of the  continent, are back."    Although Menem said that "there are few of them," he added  that they could "prepare the ground for what could come if we do  not stop them in their tracks in time."    He stated: "Many of these young people play the role of  useful idiots." He pointed out: "If you were to ask some of  these -- fortunately few -- people who Che Guevara was, you will  find that they do not have the slightest idea."    He added: "They know about Che's appearance, his personal  style, his look [preceding word in English] as they say  nowadays, but they know nothing about his ideology."</p>

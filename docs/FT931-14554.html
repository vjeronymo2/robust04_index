			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Mergers forecast to surge this year THERE IS a possibility of a 'mini-boom' in merger and acquisition activity in the UK this year, Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Finance says today. It says in its monthly review that, after 'probably the most dismal year ever' for corporate financiers, the level of company acquisitions should increase in the coming year. The review acknowledges that economic uncertainty has left companies reluctant to embark on corporate acquisitions, an activity which always involves considerable risks. But it says that 'as and when there are real, sustained signs of an improvement in the economy', many of the medium-sized and larger, cash-rich public companies will decide the time is right to buy. Mr Richard Mead, national director of corporate finance for Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'The aftermath of Black Wednesday means that British companies may now provide good value for money to foreign buyers. When combined with the larger UK-based companies that have been sitting on cash during the recession, they provide a pool of potential buyers.' Ernst &amp; Young also says it expects the upturn in buying interest to coincide with the emergence of more companies for sale. It envisages that companies financed in the mid to late 1980s by venture and development capitalists - often as management buy-outs - will come on the market as backers seek to realise their investments. Companies that are financially stretched but are going concerns are also likely to look for new owners, it concludes.</p>

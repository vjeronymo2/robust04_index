			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Bank of England The Bank of England's new repurchase operation seems to be an acknowledgement of the deficiencies of the commercial bill market. Monetary objectives require the Bank of England to lend to the private sector. Prudence requires the Bank to secure that lending against readily available collateral. Yet since the government's monetary manipulation of the early 1980s, when the Bank drained many of the bills from the market, the commercial bills traditionally used as collateral have become less liquid. As a result, the money market has become more volatile and adding money to the banking system has become more difficult. One option would be to use gilts as collateral, though this might require the development of a full-scale repurchase market. Besides the tax complications of this, it could also undermine the existing stock lenders which serve both the gilt and equity markets. That would have knock-on consequences on a scale which would make the Bank wonder whether wholesale reform of that kind was worth the candle. The Bank's inelegant but practical half-way house is to add medium-term gilt repurchases to the existing bill operations. This may hold the line for some time. This means that the Bank will continue to signal interest rate changes in the same way as before. Nor will the fact that a repo has recently been completed deter the Bank from changing policy, as some suggest. After all, an informal repo was completed the day before the last interest rate cut. Volatility may also persist, given that commercial banks will still be able to throw their weight about. So a full switch to gilt repos may yet be needed to iron out the historical quirks of the money market.</p>

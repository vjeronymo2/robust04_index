			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL OIL, EX-MANAGER CLEARED IN BLAST CASE  </P> <P> Mobil Oil and a former refinery executive were found innocent of criminal  charges Tuesday that they obstructed a Torrance Fire Department investigation  into a July 15, 1988, explosion that killed one man and injured two others.  </P> <P> After Jesse Rodrigues, an assistant Torrance prosecutor, presented the city's  case -- and without hearing any Mobil witnesses -- South Coast Municipal Judge  Josh Fredricks decided that the city had not proved its case and entered a  verdict of not guilty for Mobil and the now-retired executive, Thomas Gregory.  In 1988, he was the second-ranking manager at the Torrance refinery.  </P> <P> "We're pleased with the way this thing went," said Mobil spokesman Jim  Carbonetti.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Shops Defy Sunday Trading Ban: Hundreds of stores in England and Wales opened  in defiance of Sunday trading laws, taking advantage of one of the last two  shopping days before Christmas.  </P> <P> The open violations of the law, in some cases advertised in the newspapers,  followed similar openings last week. For the large stores, drawing thousands of  customers, the fines levied against them are not a hardship. Some managers  reported "absolutely fantastic" business, the shop workers' union said it  wasn't fair to the staffs, and the Keep Sunday Special campaign said people  were complaining that the shop openings disrupted family life.  </P></p>

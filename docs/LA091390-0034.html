			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating.  </P> <P>  This ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just about  everything a scary movie should, without benefit of fake decapitations and  gallons of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb  black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and  Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COACH'S SON HURT SLIDING INTO 3RD  </P> <P> A Baldwin-Wallace College baseball player was in critical condition after  surgery for a neck fracture suffered while sliding head-first into third base  during a game at Otterbein College, a Baldwin-Wallace spokesman said.  </P> <P> Guy Fisher, 21, was recovering from surgery at St. Ann's Hospital in  Westerville, said Kevin Ruple of Baldwin-Wallace. "He had some feeling in his  hands and his arms," Ruple said today. "There was nothing from the waist down."  Doctors said there was a high possibility that Fisher would be paralyzed from  the waist down, Ruple said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred in the seventh inning of Sunday's first game at Otterbein  when Fisher, trying to reach third on a wild pitch, collided with the third  baseman, Ruple said. The business major and honors student is the son of  Baldwin-Wallace baseball Coach Bob Fisher, Ruple said.  </P></p>

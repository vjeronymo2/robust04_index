			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORIAL ELECTION / REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> 2 CANDIDATES USE SIGN LANGUAGE TO STAKE OUT MOLINA'S EAST SIDE TURF  </P> <P> It is a little-discussed fact of political campaigning that the brightly  colored signs placed by candidates in front yards and on telephone poles have  virtually no effect on the decisions voters make.  </P> <P> But a forest of signs appeared last week on the East Side of Los Angeles  touting state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Sarah Flores, former aide to  Supervisor Pete Schabarum. They are running in the special election Jan. 22 for  county supervisor in the 1st District.  </P> <P> "These signs are the dumbest expenditure I have ever seen," said veteran  campaign consultant Richard Ross, who is working for another candidate, state  Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), and is buying no lawn signs. "They are  spending money in a sweaty panic."  </P> <P> Flores' people said they spent $26,000 on signs knowing that they "will not  really alter how people vote." But they hope to demoralize City Councilwoman  Gloria Molina's campaign workers by studding her turf with somebody else's  name.  </P> <P> Torres' camp allowed only a few days to pass before posting his signs next to  virtually every Flores sign. Was it also to demoralize Molina?  </P> <P> "It's almost like marking our territory or something," said Torres spokeswoman  Dee Dee Myers. "I don't think it's a big vote-getter. . . . But maybe people  will see some lawn signs and say hey, there must be a campaign going on here."  </P> <P> For several months now, there's been a deep rift between Schabarum and his  former longtime aide Flores, who is running for his job.  </P> <P> Last spring, when Schabarum decided to leave the political seat he had held for  years, he threw his support to a Superior Court judge and attacked Flores in  the acerbic style for which he is noted, remarking: "Sarah does not have the  educational background . . . the organizational talents . . . nor the personal  skills that are simply required to fill this job."  </P> <P> Flores' campaign managers say Schabarum's comments "actually helped Sarah"  finish first in the June primary race for his seat, an election since  invalidated by the courts.  </P> <P> Schabarum's comments are still smarting, apparently. At Flores' home in  Glendora recently, her relatives showed off her trophy room -- a comfortable  den where the framed plaques and parchment commendations she received while  working for Schabarum are proudly displayed.  </P> <P> Strangely, none of the commendations displayed on the walls mentions Schabarum.  Flores' relatives say the candidate does have a pile of plaques and letters  that also thank the lame-duck supervisor.  </P> <P> They are kept in a cupboard in the laundry room.  </P> <P> Automobile insurance was the subject of a recent debate between the 1st  District supervisorial candidates. It is an issue over which Californians are  very angry, but over which the Board of Supervisors has no say.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the event sponsored by a group of insurance agents drew all four  major candidates seeking to become the first Latino county supervisor this  century.  </P> <P> Molina admitted that she found it odd to be speaking about auto insurance -- a  state issue. But, she said, she receives many invitations to events that don't  seem to have anything to do with the office she holds or is seeking.  </P> <P> Of the insurance agents who sponsored the discussion, she said: "They sort of  pressure you, saying the other candidates are coming and this is an important  issue to your voters. . . .  </P> <P> "The other thing they did," she added, "is they called the press and (then)  said the press will be here."  </P> <P> A three-man band was wailing away at "Mirasol," a slow rumba, when Flores  brought her campaign to the cafeteria of the Fairmount Terrace Senior  Apartments in Boyle Heights.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, 73-year-old Jaime Ramon Carlos took her by the hand and  began to dance, deftly wrapping an arm around her waist and slowing spinning  her around a couple of times for good measure.  </P> <P> Afterward, Carlos was asked what he thought of the candidate:  </P> <P> "She's got a good sense of rhythm. . . . What's her name?"  </P> <P> More problems followed for the 53-year-old candidate. She addressed the  gathering of about 40 seniors, speaking at length in English and Spanish about  her concerns for the elderly. Then came the first question.  </P> <P> "What are you running for?"  </P> <P> Flores politely explained, throwing in a brief description of the duties of a  county supervisor.  </P> <P> She took a second question:  </P> <P> "What's your name?"  </P> <P> Times staff writers Rich Simon and Hector Tobar contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to include Treuhand bonds in futures contract BONDS issued by Treuhand, the German agency charged with the privatisation of former eastern German assets, will be accepted for delivery in the German government bond futures contract, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) announced yesterday. The announcement was welcomed by bund market participants who said the decision to include Treuhand issues in the list of deliverable bonds for Liffe's bund contract would improve the attractiveness both of Treuhand bonds and the Liffe bund futures contract. The Treuhand bond issue is already included in the list of deliverable bonds for the bund futures contract on Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB). However, the difference in the DTB and Liffe contract specifications has led to a widening of the price gap between the two contracts: this arose because the Treuhand issue is the cheapest to deliver into the DTB contract, and so the DTB bund future is priced lower than the Liffe contract. Liffe has 67 to 70 per cent of the bund futures contract business, against the DTB's 30 to 33 per cent share. But some market participants warned that Liffe would risk losing market share if it did not include the Treuhand bond issue in its list of deliverable bonds. The German finance ministry recently said there would be no further 10-year Federal issues as this maturity area would be left free for the Treuhand. The statement led to concern that Liffe might suffer in the longer term as the number of bund issues declined. Liffe said Treuhand's bonds would be accepted for delivery in the June 1993 contract. The June 1993 delivery will be listed for trading on November 20.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: AMBURGEY LEADS IN FUND RAISING  </P> <P> Orville Amburgey, who is seeking reelection to the City Council, leads fund  raising among five candidates seeking two seats in Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> According to records filed with the city clerk's office, Amburgey has raised  $46,527 so far, about $10,000 more than incumbent Mayor Peter F. Buffa.  </P> <P> Buffa, who got a late start in campaigning this year, has raised $35,659. About  half of that has been raised since Oct. 1. Buffa has also raised the most money  -- more than $3,000 -- from political action committees.  </P> <P> Challenger Arlene Schafer raised only $3,895 in the October reporting period,  but has accumulated a total of $21,355 this year. Schafer, who is a former  mayor, is seeking a third non-consecutive term on the City Council.  </P> <P> Although Amburgey has raised the most money, he has spent only $8,290 in the  same period on advertising, signs and fund-raisers. Both he and Buffa have  hired professional consultants to help run their campaigns.  </P> <P> "I will assure you that it all has a place to go," Amburgey said.  </P> <P> Trailing in fund raising are challengers Jay Humphrey and Karen McGlinn.  Humphrey has raised $5,707, while McGlinn has raised $2,908. MARY ANNE PEREZ  </P></p>

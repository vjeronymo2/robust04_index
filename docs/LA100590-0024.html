			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A FASCINATION WITH SOCIETY'S OUTCASTS  </P> <P> Borrowing a few riffs from Sam Shepard's idolization of Old West desperadoes --  and desperadoes in general -- Thomas Babe's 1977 black comedy "Billy Irish"  goes Shepard one better. In "Irish," at the 3rd Street Theatre, Babe uses those  riffs to make a few very lucid points about modern America's fascination with  bad guys, from Jesse and Frank James, through Bonnie and Clyde, and culminating  with the cult worship of Charles Manson.  </P> <P> The action explodes on a ruined front porch, all that's left of a Vermont  farmhouse, in 1976. Brothers Billy Irish and Joe Witness (short for Jehovah  Witness) consider themselves modern forerunners of a new breed of outlaw,  spinning their own history out of the same pure imagination that spawned their  "outlaw" names. Their pipe dream idyll is suddenly interrupted by the arrival  of a young couple who claim to be the modern Bonnie and Clyde, operating under  explicit instructions from the "savior," Charlie Manson.  </P> <P> Spiraling to an inevitable conclusion, much of the play is as silly as  Shepard's untrue West, but Babe's fascination with language and the games that  can be played with it is often intriguing and generally quite funny.  </P> <P> At his older brother's deadpan suggestion that they "finally get it on"  together, Billy says, "But we'll have to do unnatural acts." Joe mumbles, "This  is incest -- we can do anything we want." Babe has an infallible flair for  making a line say one thing while meaning something else.  </P> <P> The dialogue is crisp and rife with subtle twists and turns of meaning and  shading, and requires a close listen to catch all of Babe's convoluted sendups  and the rough-edged poetry that flows through the writing. Though the shape of  the playwright's statement has a ring of nostalgia today, much of what he says  about the public and the media's hero worship of society's mistakes is still  valid.  </P> <P> Jonathan Mittleman and Grant Brittan are excellent as the brothers,  particularly Mittleman's kinetic, detailed portrait of Billy, with a mind  seemingly garbled from 10 years as a junkie, but more lucid in his imagery than  the others and frighteningly logical in the play's denouement. Juliet Landau is  often touching as the lost flower child grasping at any affection to salve her  half-imagined torments, but Lance Brittan barely makes a dent into the  character of her bubble-headed boyfriend, and he's the only member of the cast  who looks like he's acting.  </P> <P> Directed by Michael Ewers with a keen ear and a solid feel of tension in his  staging, the production looks very good on Devin Meadows' ramshackle porch.  </P> <P>  At 8142-A West 3rd St.; Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends Oct. 28. $10;  (213) 447-0534.  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (4): Testing time for the coalition - Politics: A look ahead to a year that will bring a series of elections NEXT YEAR will be a lively one in Austrian politics. With four provincial elections, a general election and the possibility of a referendum on European Community membership - coinciding with the arrival of a new party that threatens to draw support away from the establishment - politicians will be more than usually busy. The voting season kicks-off in March, with provincial elections in Carinthia, Tyrol and Salzburg providing an important test of the electorate's mood. The vote in the southern province of Carinthia will attract most attention. There, Mr Jorg Haider, the controversial leader of the right-wing Freedom party (FPO), will try to recapture his governor's chair after being forced out of it more than two years ago following a speech in which he appeared to endorse Nazi employment policies. Mr Haider's blend of youthful populism and nationalism has been a magnet for those disenchanted with the political establishment. After he had become party chairman in 1986, the FPO's share of the vote rose from under 10 per cent to almost 17 per cent in the 1990 general election. There are signs that support for Mr Haider may have peaked, and a clear victory in Carinthia would give him a fresh impetus for the general election that is due in October at the latest. At stake will be the maintenance of the the current ruling 'grand coalition' of the Democratic Socialist party (SPO) and the conservative People's party (OVP), both of which have seen their popularity decline in recent years. In addition to Mr Haider, they now face another challenge from the newly created Liberal Forum. 'The liberals are a threat to all of us, but not to Haider,' says Mr Erhard Busek, vice-chancellor and OVP leader. The Liberals make strange opponents. They have only the bare bones of an organisation (to be fleshed out at their first national congress in November), little money, less than a handful of members of parliament, and they have yet to agree on a programme. But this did not prevent them from making a dramatic entrance on the political scene by winning 5.1 per cent of the vote in last May's provincial elections in Lower Austria, giving them three seats in the provincial parliament. Their success, less than three months after the party's birth, stunned the political establishment. The Liberals enticed voters away from the government parties, drew support that otherwise might have gone to the FPO, and won an unusually high proportion of women voters. Ms Heide Schmidt, the Liberal leader, hopes to repeat the performance in forthcoming elections. Some pollsters forecast that the Liberals could win up to 10 per cent of the vote in the general election, giving the party 15-20 seats, and making possible a coalition with the SPO which currently holds 79 of the parliament's 183 seats. Ironically, it was Mr Haider who precipitated the creation of the Liberal Forum which is now stealing some of the wind out of his sails. His launch of an inflammatory anti-immigration campaign in January was the last straw for a small band of liberals still in the FPO. Most liberals had either been forced out of the party or left in disgust at Mr Haider's policies. Under the wing of Ms Schmidt, who gained national prominence and respect as FPO candidate in the 1992 presidential elections, a small group decided to form their own party. The OVP stands to lose most from a liberal breakthrough, though Mr Busek, says there are no realistic alternatives to the current grand coalition. The coalition is not popular with all conservatives, some of whom have toyed with the idea of an alliance with the Freedom party. But Mr Busek is adamant that an OVP coalition with Mr Haider's FPO is out of the question on political grounds, while one with the Liberals could not gather enough support in parliament. The OVP has 60 seats in parliament, and on present standing looks unlikely to improve much on that score. Mr Busek says the conservatives will campaign for the maintenance of the coalition with the socialists as the best guarantee for stability and security. Ms Schmidt believes another grand coalition is the most likely outcome. 'It's not a good thing (for Austria), but it's the reality.' She says the coalition failed to carry out necessary reforms. 'Nothing has happened, only cosmetic changes.' Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor and SPO leader, dismisses the suggestion. 'There have been more reforms in the past three years than at any other time (in modern Austrian history), but not all necessary reforms are popular.' He believes dissatisfaction with the ruling parties is part of an international trend affecting all mainstream parties. Before the general election, in June or July, Austrians may have to vote in a referendum on EC membership - provided negotiations are concluded rapidly enough. If not, the referendum will take place in 1995. The ruling parties and the Liberals firmly support membership, with opposition from the Greens, and an ambivalent attitude from Mr Haider's FPO. But in spite of a cooling in popular enthusiasm for the EC, membership should not be a major issue in the election, unless the negotiations turn sour. 'I don't think it makes sense to speculate. We must concentrate on the negotiations and do our homework,' Mr Vranitzky says.</p>

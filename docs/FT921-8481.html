			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Observer: Rent-a-cop How much a year does the average London bobby spend on photocopying? Answer: Pounds 464. Another Pounds 198 is spent on postage and Pounds 927 worth of telephone calls are made, according to the Metropolitan Police's internal costs guide released by the Association of London Authorities. Chief Superintendents use the reckoner to cost local budgets and staff allocations for football matches and other public events. The figures give a fascinating insight into police priorities. A police dog costs Pounds 20.50 per day (what do they feed them?), but one can get 17 police dogs for the price of a commander (Pounds 349 per day). Police horses are a bit more pricey but you can still get six of them for the price of one constable (Pounds 145 per day). More conventional means of transport start at 70p a mile for police motorbikes rising to Pounds 2.38p a mile for a police coach. And the cost of investigating unauthorised leaks of such sensitive information? Alas . . .</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Ruling in Tupe test case Sixty-three employees who lost their jobs when IBM in Portsmouth changed its contract caterer could receive up to Pounds 500,000 in compensation in a further important test case for the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations. Southampton industrial tribunal has ruled that the Tupe regulations, which give workers some protection in business transfers, did apply to the transfer. Bromwich Catering, which won the contract from Gardner Merchant argued - along with IBM - that the regulations did not apply. The result could have implications for forthcoming Tupe catering cases.</p>

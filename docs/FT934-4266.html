			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat shareholders approve rescue plan Greycoat won a new lease of life yesterday when shareholders overwhelmingly approved an Pounds 86m rescue plan presented by South African financiers, the UK Active Value Fund. The agreement came just one week before trustees of the property company's zero coupon bond holders were due to pull the plug. Greycoat is now believed to be preparing an approach to work with Postel, the suitor whose Pounds 120m rescue plan investors rejected in October. Greycoat is thought to be seeking to implement some of the ideas discussed with Postel as part of its original rescue package. There has been some speculation that in the longer term, the pension fund group might join Greycoat on the Paternoster Square development, near St Paul's Cathedral in London, among other sites. Postel also has a Pounds 2.3bn property portfolio it is keen to exploit. In the past, Postel has developed its property through joint ventures. Such a strategy would suit the revived Greycoat, which will in future seek to fund its developments on a project by project basis. Greycoat is expected to set up joint ventures, where it would provide the site and/or development expertise. Financing would come from joint venture partners. Postel's strength lies on the financing side, with a Pounds 23bn fund at its disposal. Neither party would comment on such a proposal. Mr Alaistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, said yesterday he was not bitter about the decision by shareholders to accept the UKAV offer over his own. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, Greycoat's chairman, said the company was now 'back on a completely sound financial footing'. Each of the group's four classes of stakeholder voted in favour of the financial restructuring which will result in a 37 per cent reduction in borrowings to Pounds 234.5m, raise Pounds 86m before expenses and remove the breaches of covenant which threatened to sink the group. The deal also allows preference holders to convert all or part of their shareholding into ordinary shares. Postel is expected to have a stake of about 8.5 per cent in the company after the rescue deal. The other two largest shareholders will be UKAV, which will have between 22 per cent and 48 per cent, and Schroders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 1 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Defense and  Security Minister Edi Sudrajat said that arms purchases being  made by some Southeast and East Asian countries were not  motivated by offensive designs.    "So far, we do not think that certain countries in Southeast  and East Asia which recently acquired new armament, have a  tendency to be offensive. But I have no idea about what will  happen to (?them) 20 years from now," the minister told  legislators here on Tuesday. The retired general said that the  arms purchases were only intended to replace old weaponry and to  keep up with new technology.    "Just like us, we bought a few F-16 fighters with the  purpose  of keeping abreast of new technology," he said, adding that the  number was actually far from sufficient compared with  Indonesia's concrete defence needs. Sudrajat said that rapid  economic growth in the two regions was among the major factors  that had prompted the arms purchasing actions.    He said that some East European as well as Central Asian  countries were very aggressive and innovative in offering  products of their weapon industries. "Although in technological  terms the arms they offer cannot compete with those made by  Western countries, some Asian countries with limited funds for  armament seem very interested in the East European and Central  Asian products," he added.    The minister rejected the suggestion that the arms  purchasing  activity of the Southeast and East Asian countries amounted to  an "armament race."    During the hearing led by the chairman of the commission  dealing with security affairs, Mrs. Aisyah Amini, the minister  also touched on the "single majority concept" which had of late  become a widely-debated topic in the country.</p>

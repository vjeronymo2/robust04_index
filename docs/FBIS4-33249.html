			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar will now address  two issues: the OAS meeting to be held in Brazil, and the  preliminary meeting of the UN International Decade of World  Indigenous Communities to be held in Cochabamba.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The OAS ordinary  session will be held in Brazil this month. The foreign minister  has stated that, as usual, Bolivia will uphold a firm stance  regarding its landlocked situation, a more than century-old  problem with Chile, which that country has systematically  refused to discuss within the OAS framework.    [Aranibar] The current government, in practice and in  theory,  is tackling the maritime issue from the viewpoint disclosed both  by the president of the Republic and myself, and which has to do  with Bolivian willingness to strengthen relations with Chile as  long as there is a desire to discuss all the existing problems,  even the maritime problem. We are going to act at a bilateral,  trilateral, and multilateral level with that objective in mind.  This is one of the purposes of our presence at the upcoming OAS  assembly in Belem, Para State.    Changing the subject, I would like to tell you that  yesterday, together with the vice president of the Republic, I  had the pleasure of closing the preliminary meeting of Latin  American and Caribbean people, or better said their governments,  to discuss the UN's decade for indigenous communities. This was  a very important and far-reaching meeting, and it approved a  package of recommendations resulting from the consensus between  the governments represented on the occasion and the indigenous  people and communities that participated.

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLORIDA TEEN-AGER PITCHES TWO 5-INNING NO-HITTERS ON SAME NIGHT  </P> <P> In a year of no-hitters, Tom Laraway threw two in one night.  </P> <P> Laraway, 17, was unhittable in both games of an American Legion doubleheader  Wednesday as the DeLand Chipmunks twice beat Flagler Palm Coast, 10-0, in five  innings.  </P> <P> Each game was shortened because of the 10-run rule.  </P> <P> "The second game was great," Laraway said. "I had everything working for me.  The first game was good, but I threw much better the second game."  </P> <P> After the first no-hitter, DeLand Coach Paul Peacock decided to see how far  Laraway could go in the nightcap.  </P> <P> "Tom has a rubber arm," Peacock said. "He can just keep throwing. His arm was  feeling great in the second game, so I just told him to go out there and have  fun.  </P> <P> "He knew he had a chance to make history, but he kept his composure until the  end. He just went out there and threw strikes."  </P> <P> Flagler hit only two balls hard, both in the second game. A hard grounder down  the third-base line went foul, and a hard grounder was fielded by the first  baseman, who made the putout.  </P></p>

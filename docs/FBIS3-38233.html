He said that the country has already crossed the line  dividing the old and new political, social and economic systems.  To put it in medical terminology, the operation is over, but  the patient may be still be in a rehabilitation center curing  his muscles, Klaus added.    He predicted a 2-3 percent economic growth for the Czech  Republic this year. Inflation is expected to decrease to a  one-digit rate, which would be the first case in postcommunist  Europe, Klaus said and added that unemployment would probably  slightly grow above the present 3.5 percent.    He said that the Czech Republic did not need foreign loans,  but on the contrary, the influx of foreign capital hampers  currency policy management.</p>

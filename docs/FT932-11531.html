			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Pressure on Patten grows over tests OPPOSITION to the government's national curriculum tests hardened at the weekend. The National Association of Head Teachers is advising its members today to ask governors not to provide the Department for Education with test results necessary for school performance league tables. Two teachers' unions, the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers have voted to boycott the tests, which are due to take place in June. The National Union of Teachers seems certain to follow them next week. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT, said: 'There seems to be little point in sending the results through to local education authorities or to the examining groups or to the Department for Education if they are going to be used by the government to produce league tables which clearly are going to be something of a nonsense this year.' He said that the advice applied only to this year's tests because of the 'peculiar circumstances' of the boycott. The department deplored the move, saying it was the statutory duty of governors to assist in producing league tables. The position of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, could also be made more difficult by the resignation, expected today, of Lord Skidelsky from the Schools Examination and Assessment Council. Lord Skidelsky was an early enthusiast for the national curriculum reforms. All six teachers' unions have agreed on a submission to Sir Ron Dearing, who is chairing Mr Patten's review of the national curriculum. They will ask him to examine the curriculum in its totality, and broaden the remit given to him by Mr Patten. The NUT also released a survey of its members on the tests in technology for 14-year-olds. It found that 84 per cent said the tests interfered with teachers' professional discretion and choices.

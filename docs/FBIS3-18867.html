			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- The French Government  announced Wednesday [9 March] that the insurance group  Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and computer giant Bull  were the next state companies in line for privatization.    But the decree announcing the sell-offs made no mention of a  privatization date for vehicle maker Renault, giving weight to  reports that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur planned to delay  that highly-symbolic sale until after next year's presidential  elections.    The decree, signed by Balladur and Economy Minister Edmond  Alphandery and published Wednesday in the official gazette,  provided no details of the timing or procedures for shedding the  government's majority holdings in the two companies.    A statement released by the Economy Ministry said that the  sale of the loss-making Bull would probably take place in  several steps, but gave no details on how the government share  in the company would be placed in private hands.    It said the government's holding in AGF would involve  selling  state-held shares on the stock market.    Alphandery was scheduled to give a press conference later  Wednesday morning to discuss details of the privatization.    Industry Minister Gerard Longuet has repeatedly said that  Renault should be privatized by the end of this year. But  Balladur is reportedly concerned about the potential political  fall-out from the sale, which is strongly opposed by the  communist-led CGT [General Labor Confederation] union which  represents most Renault workers.    The government has already privatized the BNP [National Bank  of Paris], Rhone-Poulenc chemical group and oil firm  Elf-Aquitaine.    After Wednesday's announcement, 16 firms remain on the  government's sell-off list, including Renault.    The French economy minister later said the government would  take "whatever time we need" to privatize the computer firm  Bull, in an interview Wednesday morning on French radio.    He said the sell-off of Bull was not designed to "fill up  state coffers. This is not our aim."    "Bull must leave the state's embrace and learn to fly on its  own wings," Alphandery said.    "Naturally, we will take whatever time we need to carry out  this privatization," he said.</p>

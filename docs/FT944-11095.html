			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Gulf action - Legal Briefs British sufferers from 'Desert Storm Syndrome' have been allowed to join the class action brought by US service personnel against 30 manufact- urers of chemical or biological weapons materials supplied to Iraq before the Gulf War. A court in Houston, Texas, last week gave UK victims until November 22 to join the action which involves more than 1,000 US servicemen and women. Donn &amp; Co, the UK solicitors co-ordinating the British claims, have written to more than 400 people advising them of their rights. The action alleges negligence and a breach of US product liability rules.</p>

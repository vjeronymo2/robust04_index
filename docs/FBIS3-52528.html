"The two sides are expected at the end of the week to  announce the resumption of the Taba negotiations on the basis of  the document drawn up last Wednesday in Cairo," he said.    "But the Palestinians will be able to rediscuss the points  which they judge contentious," the negotiator told AFP, asking  not to be named.    The compromise allows both sides to argue that they stood  their ground on a draft document which Israel leaked after  negotiations last week in the Egyptian capital.    Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have fought  a battle of words over their different interpretations of the  last round of negotiations, but have been holding intensive  consultations in private.    "The PLO offered us a dozen compromise formulas before  giving  one that satisfied us," the negotiator said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Four people were arrested in Berkeley after they chained themselves to a  concrete slab poured over the weekend in an effort to build a permanent toilet  on University of California-owned People's Park. The protesters were cited on  misdemeanor charges of entering property with the intent to cause damage, said  university police. Campus workers later tore up the slab and carted it away.  There was no resistance by those arrested, although police said officers had to  use bolt cutters to remove them. On Thursday, 50 people commemorating the 20th  anniversary of the founding of the park started building the toilet, only to  have it torn up the next morning by campus workers and police. They returned  over the weekend. The park had its beginning on April 20, 1969, when activists  began occupying the empty 2.3-acre lot, which had been bought by the university  10 months earlier.  </P></p>

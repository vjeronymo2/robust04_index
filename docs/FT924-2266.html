			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / MPs to increase Maxwell pressure A COMMITTEE of MPs will step up efforts this week to help pensioners suffering because of the collapse of the Maxwell empire. It is expected to express concern at the cost of unravelling the complex deals involving pension funds' money. Moral pressure on banks and individuals who benefited from transactions with Robert Maxwell in the months before his death is likely to increase as the cross-party social security committee decides tomorrow who it wants to give evidence next year. The committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, is drawing up reports expressing concern at the time and cost involved in disentangling deals carried out by Mr Maxwell in the last year of his life. The committee's MPs are also disappointed at the relatively low level of voluntary donations to the fund set up to help Maxwell pensioners. One member estimated yesterday that the legal and accountancy fees around the world were approaching Pounds 100m. The committee now has a specialist accountant from the National Audit Office seconded to help its inquiries. The list of those called to give evidence is almost certain to include Lord Donoughue, the Labour peer and a former director of a Maxwell investment company, who has already given evidence once. Others with past connections with the Maxwell empire and expected to be asked include Lord Walker, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and Lord Stevens, former chief executive of Invesco MIM, the UK fund management group. City institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse may also be called to give evidence. Separately, the MPs are to urge the Goode inquiry into pension law, set up by the government after the Maxwell empire collapse, to take a wide look at the legal framework in which pension funds operate - and not just concentrate on the Maxwell affair. Most MPs on the committee are believed to back the setting up of a pension compensation scheme, although it might involve huge expense, or government involvement as an underwriter, if pension funds were to be guaranteed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The top adviser to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Tuesday that Hosokawa may  disband the cabinet and step down from power if political reform  cannot be achieved during the current session of the Diet ending  Saturday [29 January]. In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE,  Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to Hosokawa, said "the prime  minister is not the type of person who seeks to cling to a  position."    "The prime minister has made it his principle to live up to  his promises. His resignation is highly possible," Tanaka said.  Tanaka, a House of Representatives member belonging to Sakigake  (harbinger), was apparently referring to Hosokawa's promise to  "take the responsibility" if he failed to push the political and  electoral reform package through the Diet by Saturday's closure.  The pledge has been widely interpreted to mean that Hosokawa  would resign as prime minister.    In the event of the killing of the reform bills, Hosokawa  has  the alternative of dissolving the House of Representatives for a  snap general election, political sources say.    Soon after assuming the premiership last August, Hosokawa  vowed to take the responsibility if he could not achieve  political reform by the end of 1993. But because of delays in  deliberations in the House of Councillors, Hosokawa extended the  deadline to coincide with the end of the current extension of  the Diet session. The Diet session was extended once to last  through Saturday.    The upper house rejected the package last Friday.    Tanaka said the possibility remains that Hosokawa may opt to  dissolve the lower chamber and call a snap general election in  lieu of disbanding his cabinet.    Tanaka said, however, "the current economic situation does  not allow for dissolution." Many economists and legislators  say dissolving the Diet would further put off parliamentary  passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget, needed to revive the  floundering economy.</p>

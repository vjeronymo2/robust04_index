			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: A decline that emphasises depth of recession Sir, Although the UK construction industry has recently gained an unenviable credit and failure record, builders' merchants have long records of being well-established and financially sound. Sadly the current recession is destroying this reputation. The Builders Merchants Federation (BMF), whose members include the vast majority of bona fide builders' merchants, with a combined turnover of over Pounds 5bn, produces an annual comprehensive profits and costs report based on members' individual returns. The latest report for the year ending March 1992 contains some very disturbing results. Turnover, already in decline in the previous year, shows a further fall of 7.6 per cent, excluding inflation. The dire statistic, however, is that 35.2 per cent of all merchants lost money, and of these over half traded predominantly in the south-east. The decline continues and the next report is likely to show that losses will be much greater and more widespread. Many merchants are facing difficulties in spite of strenuous cost-cutting and staff reductions. If the trend is not halted in the very near future, many merchants will disappear and their vital role in the distribution chain, plus the credit facilities they provide will be severely and permanently diminished. This will be to the serious detriment of the industry and the country as a whole.

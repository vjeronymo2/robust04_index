			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IS LOWER FOR NIBBLERS, STUDY FINDS  </P> <P> Frequent nibbling may be better for a person's cholesterol level than eating  three square meals a day, Canadian researchers suggest in a study published  today in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol were 13.5% lower when study subjects ate small  amounts of food 17 times a day than when they ate the same food but in three  conventional meals, the University of Toronto scientists found. Total  cholesterol in their blood, a combination of LDL and a beneficial form, called  HDL, declined to 8.5% lower than on the three-meal plan.  </P> <P> The results indicate that a person trying to cut cholesterol and the risk of  heart disease could maximize the effects of a low-fat diet by also changing to  small, frequent meals, said Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, professor of medicine and  nutritional science, and chief author of the study.  </P> <P> "In terms of the average man and woman, they will never go out and eat 17 meals  a day," Jenkins said, "but we are saying that there seems to be some advantage  to spreading the intake load during the day."  </P> <P> If the idea sounds familiar, it is a basic tenet in dietary advice given to  diabetics, and also has shown up in the last decade among a group of Americans  the food industry refers to as "grazers."  </P> <P> Grazers nibble their way through the day, sampling many different types of  foods in small portions. The rise in appetizers on restaurant menus is one  result, restaurant industry spokesmen say.  </P> <P> In addition, in the 1960s a series of research studies compared the effects of  nibbling and gorging on cholesterol levels in the blood. The studies concluded  that nibbling was better, and gorging was bad -- but nibbling was abandoned as  a health strategy because overeaters who were urged to adopt nibbling tended to  overeat several times a day instead of three times a day.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Jenkins and his colleagues suggest that the strategy may be useful  as a cholesterol control strategy added to other dietary changes, if the  patient's preferred eating pattern is already toward nibbling.  </P> <P> "There are some people who can nibble or who can train themselves to nibble,  and they would get some material advantage from this," Jenkins said.  </P> <P> In addition to confirming the earlier studies' results, the Toronto team  suggests the biochemical mechanism for why nibbling suppresses cholesterol  levels: the maintenance of a steady level of insulin in the body is responsible  for this effect.  </P> <P> This is because when a large amount of food is eaten, the pancreas responds by  releasing a large amount of insulin, a hormone that is essential for the body  to use sugar. The insulin stimulates the body to produce an enzyme that in turn  causes the liver to produce cholesterol and dump it into the blood, they  report. Excess insulin also has been shown to stimulate changes in the arterial  walls that promote formation of fatty plaques, leading to coronary heart  disease.  </P> <P> The Toronto researchers put seven men -- ages 31 to 51 and with an average  total cholesterol level of 204 mg per deciliter of blood -- onto a 33% fat  diet. This proportion is similar to that being advocated as healthy by various  nutritional experts. The diet gave roughly 2,500 calories a day.  </P> <P> The federal government's cholesterol education program defines total  cholesterol levels below 200 as desirable, 200-239 as borderline high-risk and  240 or above as at high-risk of cardiovascular disease.  </P> <P> Each man spent two weeks on the nibbling diet, eating every hour during the  day, and another two weeks eating the same types and total amounts of food, but  in three normal meals. The test periods were separated by two weeks in which  the subjects ate their normal diets.  </P> <P> During the nibbling phase, a pocket timer reminded the subjects to eat their  small snacks prepackaged by the researchers -- for instance a half-slice of  bread, a bare smear of margarine and half of a banana. During a dinner-hour  splurge, subjects had three ounces each of broccoli, cauliflower and zucchini.  </P> <P> With nibbling, total cholesterol levels fell from an average of 204 to 172.  They also fell on the three-meal diet, to 189. Total cholesterol was 8.5% lower  on the nibbling diet than on the three-meal one.  </P> <P> The average levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol, fell from 127 to 105 on the  nibbling diet, 13.5% lower than on the three-meal diet. LDL levels on the  three-meal diet did not change significantly.  </P> <P> LDL levels below 130 are considered desirable and above 160 high-risk. Since  LDL is a major cholesterol carrier released into the blood by the liver, it is  considered the major indicator of potential problems.  </P> <P> Jenkins said reactions to the diet varied, depending on the person's normal  eating habits.  </P> <P> "Some individuals are nibblers, and some individuals are meal eaters," he said.  "Meal eaters detested the nibbling because they never got a meal, and they  hated eating all the time. The nibblers found being constricted to three meals  without snacks was rather unpleasant, and they found themselves getting  particularly hungry between meals."  </P> <P> Dieter Kramsch, professor of research medicine in USC's Atherosclerosis  Research Institute, said the Toronto study is noteworthy.  </P> <P> Jenkins gives this advice to Americans who want to apply the Toronto research  in their daily lives: "They should be very wary of the quick cup of coffee and  cigarette in the morning, further coffee and a Danish at lunch and the entire  balance of one day's intake at dinner time -- which is unfortunately a habit of  many tired people when they get home from work," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / US admits to over 200 secret nuclear tests The US admitted yesterday it had concealed more than 200 nuclear tests since 1945 for fear of giving information to the Soviet Union. Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the energy secretary, said yesterday the US had conducted 925 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1990, including 204 previously undisclosed. Mrs O'Leary said the announcement was 'a foot in the tub' for the energy department's plan to release far more information about its activities and restore public trust in the agency for the important debate about where and how to store nuclear waste. 'We were shrouded and clouded in an atmosphere of secrecy. And I would even take a step further - I would call it repression,' Mrs O'Leary said yesterday. Among the information emerging yesterday on the nuclear programme, Mrs O'Leary said the US had used 98 tons of plutonium in weapons production between 1945 and 1988, and that plutonium inventories at US nuclear weapons production sites now totalled 33.5 tons. 'This informs everyone as we begin to grapple with the problem in a very public way of the ultimate disposition of plutonium in the United States,' Mrs O'Leary said. The energy department also declassified much of its information surrounding inertial confinement fusion research, as well as data on mercury releases at the Oakridge plant in Tennessee. Mrs O'Leary said the department was reviewing 32m pages for possible release. The secrecy dates from the Manhattan Project, during which scientists built the atom bomb that devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War Two. Mr Christopher Paine, a nuclear weapons expert at the private Natural Resources Defence Council, said the number of previously secret weapons tests was larger than had been estimated by specialists. The government said 36 of the secret tests accidentally sent small quantities of radioactive gas into the atmosphere, but there was 'no lasting environmental impact, even in the immediate areas of the tests'. About 1,600 pounds (725 kg) of radioactive plutonium missing from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado has been found buried at a federal site in eastern Idaho, a Seattle newspaper reported, Reuter adds from Seattle. The Department of Energy acknowledged 'a discrepancy in records' accounting for the missing plutonium, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said. Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus said he is 'gravely concerned' about the plutonium, buried over several acres at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The buried plutonium is in particles, on contaminated tools and clothing and in sludge form, the newspaper said. Department of Energy officials in Washington say that despite the accounting mistake there was never any danger that the plutonium could have found its way into the wrong hands.</p>

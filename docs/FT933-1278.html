			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rules set for fledgling US industry THE Federal Communications Commission yesterday set in motion the creation of a new multi-billion dollar US wireless communications industry when it laid down rules for the auction of licences to operate personal communications services (PCS) networks. PCS is a form of wireless communications similar to the cellular telephone industry which has flourished in western nations in the past decade and involves calls being passed between radio relay stations, or 'cell sites', scattered across a city. PCS, with advanced digital technology and greater density of cell sites, should allow users to get clearer calls on more lightweight, lower-powered receiving sets. Many analysts believe the technology will usher in an age of genuinely mobile telephony, with individuals able to carry a tiny receiver at all times. For the first time in its history, the FCC is to grant radio licences for the new service by auction rather than through lotteries or hearings on the merits of applicants. The Clinton administration estimates this could raise Dollars 10bn. A controversial issue in the months leading up to yesterday's ruling was the extent to which the commission would favour large, existing telephone companies or encourage new entrants to the industry. Mr James Quello, FCC chairman, said he believed the plan struck a balance which would allow existing cellular carriers and mostly smaller new businesses to succeed in PCS. By a two-to-one vote, the Commission said it would set aside 160MHz of space in the radio spectrum for PCS - four times as much as for cellular - with 120MHz going to licenced carriers and 40MHz for unlicenced use. It would allow up to seven licences in each PCS market, with two for larger carriers and five for smaller ones. Firms would be able to bid for four 10MHz bands, one 20MHz band and two 30MHz ones. Existing cellular carriers would be able to bid on 10 MHz of the spectrum in their current markets and for any amount outside areas where they had cellular operations. Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest cellular service company in the US, applauded the ruling, saying that the decision to issue licences of varying size to both experienced providers and new entrants would ensure a wide variety of services at competitive prices.</p>

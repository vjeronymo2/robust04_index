			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Suharto trial is postponed President Suharto yesterday forced the postponement of his own trial in a landmark suit charging him with diverting state funds meant for preservation of Indonesia's rain forests. As no presidential lawyer turned up for the hearing on the opening day of the trial, Judge Benyamin Mangkudilaga of Jakarta's State Administrative Court said he had no option but to put it off until Oct. 31. Mr Suharto is not expected to testify in the trial, the first time he has been taken to court in his three decades of power. The suit, filed by six environmental groups in August, accuses Mr Suharto of ignoring ecological concerns by diverting Dollars 183m in state forestry funds as an interest-free loan to the state-owned Indonesian aircraft industry for a project to develop a passenger plane. The prototype of the 64-seat turboprop plane is scheduled to roll out of the plant next month, coinciding with a summit of heads of state from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</p>

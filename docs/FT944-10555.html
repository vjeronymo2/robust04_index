			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / One more blot in Howard's annus horribilis: The home secretary's reluctance to accept advice It has been a miserable year for Mr Michael Howard. Only 14 months ago he was cheered to the rafters at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool as he unveiled one of the toughest anti-crime programmes ever presented by a home secretary. Since then almost everything that could go wrong has. Two bills intended to implement most of the 27 points in Mr Howard's anti-crime programme were savaged by the House of Lords, big question marks have been raised over prison security and demonstrators managed to camp out on the roof of parliament. To cap it all, Mr Howard was yesterday judged by the Appeal Court to have abused his powers by implementing changes to the criminal injuries compensation scheme without parliamentary approval. Mr Howard will appeal to the House of Lords. But the ruling offers devastating ammunition to his critics, who were presenting it yesterday as a prime example of his refusal to accept advice, even from Conservative colleagues. Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, a former Tory cabinet minister who is chairman of the criminal injuries compensation board, accused the home secretary of ignoring him. Lord Carlisle said: 'We warned the home secretary that we felt that what he was doing was wrong, and that we felt it was probably unlawful.' Opposition MPs were even more dismissive, pointing out that Mr Howard was warned publicly about the weak constitutional foundations of the revised scheme by several eminent judges, including Lords Ackner, Bridge and Brightman. Lord Lester, a QC and Liberal Democrat peer, was one of many senior lawyers who warned that the home secretary's actions flouted the will of parliament by overriding the statutory scheme set up by the Criminal Justice Act of 1988. Mr Jack Straw, shadow home affairs spokesman, said the home secretary had 'arrogantly and foolishly' rejected attempts by Mr Tony Blair, then shadow home secretary, to put the revised scheme on a statutory footing. Critics of Mr Howard said his unwillingness to accept advice was in line with other aspects of his home office stewardship, which has been marked by a determined adherence to widely criticised policies. These include his proposals to quintuple fines for possession of soft drugs which have been derided by the Police Federation and the Magistrates' Association. Mr Howard's parliamentary problems have centred on the criminal justice bill, which implemented many of his 27 points but was mauled by the Lords. Many of the defeats were reversed in the Commons, but proposed changes to the right to silence were watered down after the home secretary was rebuked by Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice. Perhaps Mr Howard's worst moment came in the early stages of the police and magistrates courts bill, the other main home office bill of the year, which provides for reorganisation of police forces and police authorities. Mr Howard was forced to dilute plans for a big increase in the home secretary's influence over police authorities after Lord Whitelaw said they would 'politicise the police to an unacceptable degree'. Mr Howard has made light of many of his setbacks, describing criticism of his proposals from distinguished predecessors as part of the democratic process. He is likely to find the Appeal Court's verdict harder to shrug off.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Spain cool to UK ideas on EC spending BRITISH proposals on EC financing received a chilly reaction in Madrid yesterday. After a two-hour meeting with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, his British counterpart, Mr John Major, defended his plan to limit Community funding and to reduce transfers, in the form of cohesion funds, to its poorer partners. He said it was a 'compromise' between criticism from 'some that it is not generous enough and criticism from others who say it is too generous'. Mr Major, on a whistle-stop tour of European capitals in search of a basis for agreement at next week's Edinburgh summit, added that when his proposals were studied in detail 'many will have a different view'. Failure to reach agreement would be damaging both for the Community itself and for the economies of the member states. Mr Gonzalez gave little or no ground, however. He termed the proposal on Community's budgetary resources as 'insufficient' and its spending package as 'minimal'. He added that he had arrived at these conclusions after 'a technical study' of the proposals. Mr Major bravely rode the Spanish premier's punches. He said that he was seeing EC heads of government in order to 'identify areas of difficulty' and he conceded that in Madrid 'the areas of difficulties have become sharper'. He admitted that Edinburgh was building up to be 'more complex than any other EC summit for a long time'. Peter Wise adds from Lisbon: In Portugal, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, said he had explained his country's opposition to Britain's EC budget proposals in several hours of discussions with Mr Major. But he refused to be drawn on numbers. 'We consider this is not the right moment to deepen our differences. Mr Major is working for a solution that is acceptable to all the Community and that will result in a successful outcome at the Edinburgh summit,' he said.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / High-flyer at Lloyd's loses high-risk game YESTERDAY'S decision by Mr Stephen Merrett to resign his position as deputy chairman of the Lloyd's council following intense pressure from senior figures in the insurance market completes an unhappy few months for one of Lloyd's of London's most controversial underwriters. Mr Merrett joined the business built up by his father, Roy, in 1963, and became chairman of Merrett Group in 1976. Under his leadership the group grew quickly, specialising in a range of high-risk insurances ranging from satellites and oil rigs to war risks and US legal awards. By the late 1980s the group's main syndicate, 418, was one of the biggest at Lloyd's, and a leader in US liability business. Mr Merrett, now 53, won recognition as one of the most intellectually impressive of Lloyd's underwriters and played an important part in the Rowland taskforce report whose ideas for reforming the market are now being put into effect. But the past 12 months have seen his success unravel. Mr Merrett's election as deputy chairman last autumn was widely criticised by Names, the individuals whose assets support the market, because of what Mr Roger Pascall, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, describes as 'an evident conflict of interest'. Names said that Mr Merrett would be unable to combine his role as deputy chairman with his involvement as an underwriter for errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance policies, which insure agents against damages paid in legal actions for negligence. The council will play an important part in negotiating any out-of-court settlements that could lead to claims on E&amp;O policies. More recently Mr Merrett has been attacked on other fronts. Early this year Names on syndicate 418, the biggest Merrett syndicate, launched legal action to seek compensation for heavy losses from the 1985 year. The management of the Merrett Group has also faced mounting criticism from members' agents which channel Names onto their syndicates. 'There is a huge lack of confidence,' said Mr David Robson, a former colleague of Mr Merrett, who now leads the Anton members' agency. He says syndicate 418's losses in 1990, Lloyd's last reported year, more than offset the profits made in the previous three years. Mr Merrett has also been seen by Names to lack concern about their losses. 'In the eyes of many Names there has never been any acknowledgement of the grief and pain he has caused,' says Mr Robson. Over the past six weeks, two other incidents increased pressure on Mr Merrett. At the end of July he publicly criticised a Lloyd's report into losses at one of his own syndicates, alleging that the report was expensive in both 'time and money'. Matters came to a head after a meeting on August 31 when members' agents told Mr Merrett that Names could supply only about Pounds 50m to syndicate 418, compared with Pounds 151m in 1993. Such a sharp fall in capacity has forced Mr Merrett to seek capital from a reinsurance company set up earlier this year to provide reinsurance for the Merrett syndicates. At present Lloyd's rules do not allow new corporate Names to provide more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity. It emerged last week that Merrett would ask Lloyd's to make an exception, making his position increasingly vulnerable. 'This was the final straw,' says one senior figure. 'One of the rulemakers was asking for the rules to be bent.'</p>

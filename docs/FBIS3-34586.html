The representatives of the parties to  the dialogue committee took part in the meeting. The conferees  resumed discussions and deliberations on one of the topics of  agenda related to the implementation guarantees. A number of  the committee members presented their opinions, proposals, and  views that would produce the appropriate formula to achieve  national consensus and to define the real bases of the  guarantees of implementing the accord document following its  signing in the Jordanian capital, Amman.    Following a length discussion, the committee members agreed  to refer the various views and formulas presented by the  representatives of the parties to the political dialogue to a  mini-committee. This committee will review them as a first step  in preparing a unified formula to (?endorse it) within the  required guarantees in order to implement the document and to  present it to the expanded meeting which the committee will hold  on 10 February in order to endorse it and to discuss the rest of  the topics on the committee's agenda.</p>

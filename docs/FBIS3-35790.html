			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo February 1 TASS -- Tokyo now has practically  all main technologies and components to develop its own nuclear  weapons, since they were developed separately during civilian  research, two leading Japanese independent experts, Hisashi  Maeda and Haruo Fujii, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday [1 February] in  separate interviews.    They virtually confirmed the legitimacy of the conclusions  drawn by the British Defence Ministry which, according to press  reports, had warned its government way back last December that  Tokyo was close to developing a nuclear bomb.    Mr. Fujii believes, in particular, that Japan's strategy is  to distribute the formation of a nuclear potential among  civilian sectors which raise no suspicions. Under present  conditions Tokyo has no possibility to "hide" any large research  expenditure in the state budget without specifying the purpose  of the research efforts, Mr. Maeda pointed out, for his part.    Such a strategy yields certain results because, for example,  the country's companies have long devised unique explosive  devices for carrying out complex oil-prospecting operations, the  devices which may serve already now as finished detonators for a  nuclear bomb.    Of course, substantial technical obstacles still remain in  the path of the development of a combat nuclear capability.  However, the main problem, in experts' opinion, still is in  making a political decision on the establishment of such systems  in practice.    Japan is now obviously not prepared for such a dramatic  step,  considering the pacifist sentiments among the public, the  memories of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the  constitutional bans, and the government-adopted three  non-nuclear principles: Not to have, not to produce and not to  import nuclear weapons.    However, Mr. Maeda believes that Tokyo may seriously change  its stance if it encounters a chain reaction of the proclamation  of "nuclear sovereignties" by neighbouring countries. Japan is  extremely worried by sufficiently reliable reports about North  Korea's feverish nuclear efforts. There are suspicions that  Seoul may also embark upon the same road if it fails to contain  the military threat from Phyongyang by other means.    Mr. Maeda is of the opinion that Japan can well become a  third "new nuclear power of the region" after South Korea,  although, in his view, Tokyo would hardly make such a decision  easily.</p>

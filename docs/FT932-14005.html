			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: There's many a slip .. - Catherine Milton considers the judges' criteria HOW CAN a company which qualifies for a Queen's Award for Export go bust just weeks after accepting the accompanying invitation to tea at Buckingham Palace? In 1991 two of that year's 849 winners are known to have gone under. Mint &amp; Boxed, once a leading antique toy dealer, called in the receivers little more than a month after accepting the award. A fortnight before, the English Provender Company, an Oxfordshire-based preserves and pickles business, had gone into receivership. Mr Robin Ebers, deputy director general of the Institute of Export, is broadly supportive of the scheme which he acknowledges as the UK's most prestigious. He said: 'An award of this kind enables companies to show they are doing their best for the economy and expanding trade.' The employers organisation, the Confederation of British Industry, echoes this view: 'A lot of companies apply and are very unhappy when they don't win and delighted when they do. That must mean companies value the award and therefore it is a success.' Only a small number of the more than 2,500 companies which have won the award are known to have failed in the 27 years since the scheme began, but some industrialists have long raised questions about the criteria that award winners are required to meet. They say it is not surprising the judges failed to spot potential company failures. The scheme's literature says it is designed to recognise a 'substantial and sustained increase in export earnings to a level which is outstanding for the products or services concerned and for the size of the applicant unit's operations'. This basic criterion is then qualified by requirements for the applicants to explain fully how they achieved this. The judges require figures for three years and applicants are compared with their competitors' and the general export trend. Against this apparently comprehensive evaluation, critics cite the example of one small technical company, once an active part of a profitable conglomerate. The company, they say, won the export award in the middle 1970s partly on the strength of at least one deal which improved export figures but on which the company actually made a loss. 'It shows that any fool can get business on the other guy's terms. In the end the award was simply a nice warm glow', said an insider. Even the supportive Mr Ebers tells of a woman who became angry when he offered congratulations on her company's winning an award last year. She subjected him to a tirade about how the export team had been harried by the company's executives to meet orders and produce figures. 'There was no support for the export team and no training. They were virtually put in a room of darkness and told to get on with it. Some companies seek the status of the award without sustained improvement in the quality of their operations', Mr Ebers said. He believes that in general an emphasis on turnover figures can lead companies to over commit themselves, find themselves unable to deliver on time and then see overseas orders dry up with what can be catastrophic results. Mr Anthony Pierce, senior lecturer in international trade and finance at London's City University, agrees: 'The key criterion seems to be the incremental increase in exports the company achieves and that's just daft. It's such a fudgeable number.' Mr Pierce, who also runs his own consultancy, Export Risk Control, believes companies who make little effort to win export orders can win the awards if, for example, they have a new product and no competitors, or if competitor suppliers of the product dry up elsewhere. The department of trade and industry rejects these criticisms. It said: 'We are certainly entirely happy with our criteria. The sheer number of companies who apply, and the extension of the scheme to environmental awards shows that it is a success. 'Of course you can find companies that have won an award and gone bankrupt. You can also find MBE and OBE winners who end up with criminal records.' And a spokesman for one of this year's winners, the Really Useful Group, said: 'It's a great morale boost. It does give the workforce a nice warm glow and that is something a lot of companies place a very high value on.'</p>

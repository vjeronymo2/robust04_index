The committee is developing a corporate structure that would streamline procurement, simplify the personnel process, provide funding stability, and ensure continuity of leadership among the objectives. The committee is comprised of senior officials from the Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, National Economic Council, National Performance Review, and various other agencies. Alternative proposals are an FAA corporation and an air traffic control corporation. The oversight committee is soliciting suggestions and concerns regarding these proposals or any suggested alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Issues for Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are specific issues discussed in the following paragraphs on which the DOT's executive oversight committee seeks comment at the public meeting.

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Russian officials 'blocking oil funds from west' Official western efforts to pump investment funds into reviving Russia's ailing oil industry are being blocked by obstacles put up mostly by Russian officials, bankers say. A prime victim has been Dollars 2bn in export credits guaranteed by the US Eximbank and first made available last December to help speed aid to the Russian economy. The facility requires the Russian government to provide export quotas to Russian oil producers so they can repay loans to buy capital equipment. But the fate of the oil loans provides a clear illustration of just how difficult it is to channel money to support Russian reforms even when funds are available. Western bankers say that the oil quotas required by the US loan facility so far have not been forthcoming, though Mr Sergei Konychev, chairman of the Development Project Finance Bank, whose shareholders include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said that he was confident the quotas would be made available in a matter of weeks. He said officials were unfamiliar with the scheme, while one western banker said the Eximbank requirements were too complicated for most oil companies to bother with. Mr Konychev said oil producers were presently absorbed in an annual battle with the government for extra roubles to help deal with customers which are not paying their bills, such as state-owned oil refineries. Others bankers say some oil company managers were reluctant to take on new debt and export obligations at a time when the industry was over-taxed and saddled with non-paying customers. One said 'severe' congestion in Russian pipelines made it difficult to get oil out of the country. A Dollars 60m emergency loan by the EBRD for Nizhnevartovskneftegas, one of the country's biggest oil companies, has been held up for similar reasons. Many private western companies meanwhile have almost given up hope of making any meaningful large-scale investment in Russia. A presidential decree providing for production sharing, which would generate more secure revenues for western investors, has yet to be backed up by a vote in parliament. Designed to cut through red-tape, presidential decrees have increasingly lost their credibility, as they have been consistently blocked at implementation level.</p>

According to the sources, the post of the economic adviser  may be instituted in the near future and it is not ruled out  that Boris Yeltsin may offer it to Fedorov. The post envisages  work in the government as an expert or an observer.    The necessity of introducing the post and possible  candidates  to fill it in may also be discussed at the planned meeting, the  source said.    However, it is also possible that Yeltsin would prefer to  keep Fedorov in the State Duma where the reformer can work on  anti-inflation decisions. As a presidential aide, Fedorov will  have to give up his parliamentary mandate.</p>

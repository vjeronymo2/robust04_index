			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A demonstration of support for the resolution of the  popular congress held at the National Theater from 18 to 20  January in Port-au-Prince, is being held today in front of the  parliament. The delegates had decided, among other things, on  the formation of a three-member government and demanded from  parliament the ratification of the voted resolutions.    Today they are holding a demonstration in front of the  Legislative Palace from which Rothschild Francois reports live:    [Francois] Indeed, the demonstrators are gathered before the  Legislative Palace. They are severely criticizing the  legislators -- deputies, and senators. They are demanding the  dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate of the  Republic. The demonstrators are also chanting words hostile to  the embargo, to Aristide, and to the international community.    It should be noted that these demonstrators are not from  Port-au-Prince, but from the Plateau Central and from the North.  They came in response to a call by the Committee of Public  Security, which is determined to install a new government in  Haiti. So they came to Port-au-Prince this morning to  demonstrate. Let us listen to Mobile 18, who met Leveille, in  charge of the committee.    [Mobile 18] I am with Mr. Herve Leveille who is a member of  the Group of the Great North and of the national congress. Mr.  Leveille, did the mobilization begin today?    [Leveille] The mobilization has begun. Only the Plateau  Central is represented in this demonstration. The other  delegations will arrive later. There is a problem on the  northern road, so we might not have the delegation from the  North. Thus Plateau Central, the West, the Southeast, and the  South delegations are due to arrive during the week. I am taking  this opportunity to invite all the people in Port-au-Prince and  the people from Cap-Haitian living in Port-au-Prince to come  demonstrate with us their total rejection of the embargo and to  demand the immediate formation of the Government of Public  Security.    [Mobile 18] Mr. Leveille, we notice that you have gone to  great effort. We especially notice that you have used a state  bus to carry the people. Is this not prohibited by law?    [Leveille] If it is only this state bus that is available in  a faraway zone, where these demonstrators live, how could they  not use it? It is normal. Here, you have more options. But with  the embargo, there is almost no car running in the provinces.  And you should, instead of dwelling on these minute details,  note the effort behind bringing 500 people to the capital now.  You should understand what that means, with fuel at $20 a gallon  now. Even if a truck driver is willing to help us, his car gets  worn out. It is normal to use what is at hand.</p>

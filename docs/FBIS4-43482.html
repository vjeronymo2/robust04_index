			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. MEMO/94/38: "Partnership and Cooperation </F> Agreement Between EU And Ukraine"]    [Text]  <H5>  History to the Agreement </H5>   In October 1992 the EC Council of Ministers adopted  negotiating directives for the negotiation of partnership and  cooperation agreements with countries of the former Soviet  Union. In 1993, three rounds of negotiations with Ukraine were  held on the basis of these negotiating directives. On 7 March  1994, the EU Council of Ministers agreed to extend the  negotiating directives in order to meet a number of Ukrainian  requests, notably in order to reflect the prospect of future  free trade agreement. The enlarged mandate has enabled both  sides to conclude the negotiations and initial the agreement  today. The partnership agreement will replace the trade and  cooperation agreement of 1989 between the EC and the Soviet  Union as far as Ukraine is concerned.  <H5>  Details of the Agreement </H5>   General principles: The agreement underlines the importance  of democratic values, respect for human rights and the  principles of a market economy as essential elements of the  partnership established between the European Union and Ukraine.  The parties also consider it essential for future prosperity  and stability in the region of the former Soviet Union that  regional cooperation should be continued and strengthened.    The agreement establishes the prospect of a future free  trade  area. In 1998, Ukraine's progress towards a market economy will  be assessed in order to see whether negotiations can begin  towards free trade.    The preamble to the agreement states that support for the  independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine  will contribute to safeguarding peace and stability in Central  and Eastern Europe and the European Continent as a whole.    Political dialogue: the agreement foresees an intensive  political dialogue, opening the way for meetings at the highest  political level whenever appropriate    Trade in goods: In addition to the prospect of eventual free  trade, both sides will offer each other "most-favoured-nation"  (MFN) treatment, giving each other trading terms as good as  those offered to other trading partners such as those in the  GATT. Quotas will be removed, in line with the Community's new  commercial defence policy, while specific agreements will be  negotiated for coal and steel products and trade in nuclear  materials. An agreement on trade in textile products is already  in force.    Labour conditions: The agreement calls on the parties to  prevent discrimination between legally employed workers, and  provides for cumulation of pension rights for Ukrainian workers  legally employed in various EU member states.    Establishment and operation of companies: The agreement  establishes a liberal regime with Ukraine, offering MFN  treatment or national treatment (i.e. treatment as good as that  offered to domestic companies), whichever happens to be most  favourable, when EU companies establish and begin operations on  Ukrainian soil, with limited exceptions.    Services: The agreement aims at a progressive liberalisation  of the cross-border supply of services between the parties.    Maritime transport: Each side will offer the other national  treatment for access to ports which are open to international  trade, as well as for the use of infrastructure and auxiliary  maritime services, related fees and charges, customs facilities  and the assignment of berths and loading facilities.    Payments and capital: For trade in goods, each side  stipulates that imports may be paid for in freely convertible  currency. This important measure prevents European exports from  being submitted to general requirements on the use of local  currency. In the case of direct investment, companies will be  free to repatriate their profits in freely convertible currency,  and no new foreign exchange restrictions will be introduced  after the agreement enters into force.    Competition: The agreement lays down a number of principles  aimed at gradually increasing free and non-discriminatory  competition.    Intellectual property: Regarding the protection of  intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights, the  agreement provides that Ukraine will bring its levels of  protection up to EU standards within five years of the agreement  coming into force.    Economic cooperation: The agreement lists 25 areas where  both sides favour economic cooperation in future. They are:  industrial cooperation, investment promotion and protection,  public procurement, standards and conformity assessments, mining  and raw materials, science and technology, education and  training, agriculture and agro-industrial sector, energy, civil  nuclear sector (including cooperatIon on the consequences of the  Chernobyl disaster), environment, transport, space,  telecommunications, financial services, money laundering,  monetary policy, regional development, social cooperation,  tourism, small and medium sized enterprises, information and  communication, consumer protection, customs, statistical  cooperation, economics and drugs.    Cooperation in these fields may be supported as appropriate  by technical assistance from the EU through the TACIS [technical  assistance to CIS] programme.    Institutional framework: The agreement finally establishes  an institutional framework for future cooperation including a  cooperation council that shall meet at ministerial level once a  year, as well as a parliamentary cooperation committee.

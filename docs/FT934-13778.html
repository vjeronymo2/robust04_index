			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: SB's diluted tonic SmithKline Beecham has not shared in the rehabilitation of other pharmaceuticals companies this autumn. While Glaxo and Wellcome have risen by around 30 per cent from depths reached during the summer, and most US drugs companies have rallied by a lesser amount, SB has continued to languish. The company suffered less on the downswing by dint of its broad spread of business, so some underperformance might be expected. But SB cannot afford to match the inducement of rapid dividend growth now being promised by some of its rivals. True, the company finished the third quarter with net cash for the first time since the transatlantic merger in 1989. It now faces a direct choice between accumulating cash, increasing investment or raising the pay-out to shareholders. With a spread of business ranging from animal health to fizzy drinks, SB has plenty of opportunities for incremental investment. As long as the outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry remains clouded, it might also like the chance to build a Glaxo-style cash cushion against hard times. If so, dividend growth is unlikely to outstrip earnings by much. Since SB has only recently finished the cost-cutting associated with its merger, earnings growth stands squarely on the performance of the prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines business. There have been recent disappointments on both fronts, especially the reluctance of the US regulator to approve an OTC version of Tagamet, the ulcer drug which loses US patent protection in May. SB will need to demonstrate all its marketing flair and muscle if it is to shine through the difficult year ahead.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland likely to head Gatt - Search for Dunkel's successor FORMER EC competition commissioner Peter Sutherland is now the clear favourite to succeed Mr Arthur Dunkel this summer as director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Sutherland, an Irishman and currently chairman of Allied Irish Banks, has apparently changed his mind about not wanting to be considered for the job, following strong pressure from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Trade officials in Geneva said they thought Mr Sutherland, who has US as well as European Community support, would succeed in securing the necessary consensus of Gatt's 110 members. However, names of three or four developing country candidates, from Latin America and south-east Asia, may also be put forward for consultation among Gatt members. This will be conducted next week by Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador and current chairman of the contracting parties (members). One of those mentioned is Mr Julio Lacarte Muro, Uruguay's well-respected veteran Gatt ambassador, who helped found the Gatt in 1947. Mr Sutherland, regarded as an able and astute EC commissioner, is reckoned to have the two essential qualities for the job, apart from a commitment to open trade: the ability to master technical, often highly complex, trade issues, and the political authority required to deal on equal terms with government leaders. Whoever gets the job will need both qualities in good measure. The most urgent task will be to try to conclude the long-delayed Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks by the end of the year. This will mean knocking powerful heads together to secure the necessary compromises, notably among the leading traders, the US, the EC and Japan. Mr Sutherland's earlier reported rejection of the job, for family reasons, led to gloom and despondency among Gatt staff who feared a long period of uncertainty and lack of direction at this crucial stage in the round. Gatt's top post has traditionally gone to a European; Mr Dunkel is Swiss and his two predecessors were Swiss and British. A number of developing countries, which play an increasingly active role in Gatt, would like a third world national in the job, but this is opposed by the US and may not be pressed too far. 'It would be great to have a Latin American but the main thing is to have someone with the political stature and familiarity with trade matters,' said one Latin American diplomat. 'Mr Sutherland is that kind of person.' Some countries would still prefer to ask Mr Dunkel to stay on until the Uruguay Round is completed. Only then will Gatt members know for sure whether they are seeking a political heavyweight to run a powerful world trade organisation, or a technocrat who will oil the wheels of the present system. But Mr Dunkel, who was appointed in 1980, says he does not want another extension of his mandate when the first expires at the end of June. In any event, most Gatt members appear to see new blood as preferable to continuity. Among the leading traders, many of the key negotiating posts have already changed hands. The Gatt itself needs an invigorating force at the helm. In particular, Gatt members are keen to see the important deputy posts filled. Mr Charles Carlisle, Mr Dunkel's American deputy, wants to step down this summer. A second deputy job, traditionally held by an Indian, has been vacant for nearly two years. The Latin Americans have their eye on a proposed third deputy post, who might have responsibility for Gatt's economic analysis and research. Final decisions on all these jobs await the naming of Mr Dunkel's successor.</p>

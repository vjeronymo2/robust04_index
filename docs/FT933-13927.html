			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Olives settles out of court Olives Property has agreed an out of court settlement regarding the second of two claims outstanding at the time of the open offer and placing completed last month. The settlements together will give rise to an exceptional credit of over Pounds 900,000 to the profit and loss account. The shares rose 3p to 38p. The claim by Olives against the Church Commissioners relating to land in Avon Street, Bristol, was for breach of covenant. The Commissioners had acquired the site from Olives and had since sold it with the benefit of a more extensive planning consent than the company was originally granted.</p>

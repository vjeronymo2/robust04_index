			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Books: The man who dreamt of El Dorado - Anthony Curtis enjoys a new biography of Walter Ralegh A PLAY OF PASSION: THE LIFE OF SIR WALTER RALEGH by Stephen Coote Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 420 pages The two facts we all know about Sir Walter Ralegh - that he laid down his cloak so that Queen Elizabeth should not have to step in the mud and that he introduced tobacco into England - are, as Stephen Coote's lively new biography shows, false; or at best only partially true. The first was the kind of thing he might have done - its theatrical panache was typical of him  -but there is no evidence that he did. As for the second, tobacco was known and even grown in England from the mid-16th century but by the end of it, thanks to Ralegh starting a fashion for smoking among the smart set at court, the whole of London was smoking. England became the biggest importer and re-exporter of tobacco. If Ralegh is the hero of the anti-anti-smoking lobby he is also the champion of a number of other causes that are still alive. He was a great believer in entrepreneurial expansion and in exploiting emerging economies in places like South America. Ralegh nourished a lifelong dream of El Dorado, from where he believed endless amounts of gold would accrue to his own capacious pocket and the royal exchequer. The dream proved to be as illusory as the later vision on the same lines of Verity Lambert and her colleagues. Ralegh organised and participated in several explorations. His Discovery of Guiana (what is now central Venezuela and the Orinoco basin) is one of the key-works of Elizabethan voyage-literature. He was a pioneer of scientific experiment surrounding himself with a group of men like the astrologer John Dee, Richard Haklyut the younger, Thomas Harriot, Laurence Keymis. Coote sees this remarkable set of Ralegh's friends who would meet and discuss their findings at his London base of Durham House as being serious scholars as well as Elizabethan adventurers. Among his own observations Ralegh claimed actually to have seen those 'men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders' referred to by Othello. Indeed, the whole of the Moor's 'story of my life' speech, with its account of hairsbreadth escapes and exotic adventures, might have been compiled by Ralegh from his own experience. Whether it was just such a catalogue of wonderment, or sheer physical magnetism, that captivated Bess Throckmorton, the Queen's 20-year-old virginal lady-in-waiting we do not know. But when she encountered him at court where he basked in the queen's favour they fell passionately in love and before long Bess was pregnant. They were then secretly married. After the child was was born Bess returned to court under her maiden name as if nothing had happened. Her deception was soon discovered and both she and Ralegh were sent to the Tower by the irate sovereign. A diary shedding much light on these events kept by Bess's brother Arthur was discovered by AL Rowse. His Ralegh and the Throckmortons (1962) remains essential reading. But Ralegh was such a complex, fascinating figure that there is certainly room for a fresh look at him as stimulating and well-informed in all areas as this one. Coote shows just how much fight there was left in him during his imprisonment; the final spell lasted 13 years well into the reign of James I. Ralegh seems to have been reasonably comfortable in the Tower where he continued to pursue his botanical interests. While living there he produced his History of the of World full of subtle coded observations on Jacobean politics and he also wrote verse. CS Lewis divided Elizabethan poetry into Drab and Gold. Of Ralegh he wrote: 'Side by side with his Drab poetry we find weak Gold: 'Methought I saw the grave' or 'Like truthes dreames' or even (in 'What is our life?') a groping towards the metaphysical.' He never abandoned his dream of real Gold - a far-away land full of gold ingots to be gathered in and shipped home, and it was on the strength of it that he secured his conditional release to lead a fresh expedition to Guiana. This last voyage was the grandest folly and a disaster from the start, undertaken after he had suffered a mild stroke while in prison. It ended in the death of Ralegh's son Wat who accompanied him, and the loss of many other lives. Somehow Ralegh manged to lead his depleted company home where James, bowing to pressure from the Spanish ambassador, ordered a new trial and Ralegh was condemned to death. The account given here of his last hours, the power of his oratory beside the block, is heart-rending. He kept the executioner waiting while he addressed at some length a crowd that contained many of his peers. Coote describes it all well but it really needs Placido Domingo with full orchestral backing to re-create its grandeur. As one puts this engrossing book down one one seems to hear the final chords mixing triumph with defeat.</p>

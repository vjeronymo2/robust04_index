			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (3): Cold comfort after cold war - Defence contractors Norman Augustine, the chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta, has been negotiating some tough deals with the Pentagon recently. When the company agreed to acquire General Dynamics' Space Systems division in May, the Department of Defence agreed to pay for some of the rationalisation costs, and to allow Martin Marietta to keep half of the resulting savings. Such deals are likely to become more common if the Pentagon has its way, but it does not herald a sudden outbreak of altruism in Washington. The Department of Defence thinks that if the defence industry consolidates into fewer larger manufacturers it will save money. In the case of General Dynamics Space business, for example, paying Dollars 80m in restructuring charges may save Dollars 500m on the cost of launch vehicles over the next 10 years. If incentives from the Department of Defence are the carrots to encourage industry mergers and rationalisation, there are plenty of sticks, too. As US defence spending has been cut in the wake of the Reagan arms build-up and the end of the cold war, weapons procurement has been by far the worst hit section of the budget. Total defence expenditure is down by a third in real terms in the past decade, but weapons procurement has fallen by two-thirds. Since that is what puts bread into the mouth of defence companies, some people have gone hungry. The industry has had to respond rapidly to this rising pressure. Since 1990, employment in the US defence industry has fallen from 1.3m to 800,000. There has also been a string of deals with companies trading businesses. Yet, so far there has been no rout, and nor has the game of musical chairs turned nasty, despite the steadily reducing number of seats. The first to pull out were the predominantly non-defence companies who decided to leave the field to professional soldiers. So IBM, Ford and General Electric have sold their defence interests to the likes of Loral and Martin Marietta. The other big seller has been Bill Anders, the astronaut who was chairman of General Dynamics between 1991 and 1993. He sold his F-16 fighter plant to aerospace company Lockheed, his missile business to missile specialists Hughes Aircraft, his space launch business to Martin Marietta, and his non-military aircraft business to Textron. Other deals will follow and Dan Tellup, chairman of Lockheed, thinks that the US may end up with two combat aircraft manufacturers, two electronics giants and two missile companies. It is already down to one tank manufacturer, one submarine yard and one surface warship maker. Some systems are too expensive for even the US to afford. Strategic bombers may have come to the end of the line with the Dollars 850m-a-time B2, unless cheaper production methods are found. Yet the larger companies, such as Lockheed, Martin Marietta, Raytheon and McDonnell Douglas, have sufficient backlogs of orders to be relaxed in the short term. 'We have to be opportunistic' says Dan Tellup, 'because it is never completely clear where the opportunities will arise.' These companies have also become strongly cash generative as a result of the job cuts, and perhaps their biggest immediate fear is that their rising stock market values may attract cash-hungry predators. Smaller firms with weaker finances cannot be so relaxed, however. Those whose programmes are drawing to a close, such as Northrop and Grumman, may be forced into merger to spread the pain of remaining in the game. Others will be forced out altogether. Many US chief executives see the consolidation as a much-overdue rationalisation which only mimics the cuts in Europe over the past 25 years. This is a little ironic, since although many of the cottage industry manufacturers within Europe have been pushed together into larger national groups, they all have national markets which are in order of magnitude smaller than the US home base. When looked at from a European perspective, the European Union still has a smaller total defence market than the US and it is much more fragmented. Europe is nowhere near achieving the economies of scale which the US takes for granted. What is perhaps worse from the European point of view, is that the situation is unlikely to change rapidly. Some cross-border deals in less sensitive technologies are being done; for example, a merger between Giat of France and Royal Ordnance of the UK is being negotiated. Yet even here national sensitivities are such that the UK is only prepared to be dependent on French munitions to the extent that France is equally dependent on the UK. Such cross-border rationalisation of the missiles business, with Matra and BAe teaming up and Aerospatiale and DASA getting together, are also under discussion. Still, progress is painfully slow. The other great European experiment is in collaborative ventures, such as the Eurofighter. These seek to spread the cost of developing the most sophisticated systems across several countries with a sufficiently long production run to make them viable. Even here, the difficulty of co-ordinating several partners, the delays which politics can cause, the compromises and disagreements about specification and the spreading of work among the partners can mean that no-one gets the weapon they want and no-one saves any money. One national auditor of such projects doubted that any previous collaboration had actually proved cost-effective. European governments may be prepared to tolerate the problem, since from national perspectives, the alternative of common European defence policy and procurement may be worse. Yet such inefficiency means either Europe pays more for the same level of defence than the US would, or it settles for less sophisticated equipment, or possibly both. With the crunch to get value for money in defence spending growing, however, there will be increasing pressure to buy off-the-shelf US products rather than a tailor-made European solution. That problem is seen graphically in the present UK debate over the replacement of the RAF Hercules fleet, where a new European design is up against a proven US product. Even if the Future Large Aircraft were shown to have lower life-cycle costs than Lockheed's new C130J Hercules, the FLA group would have an uphill task persuading the UK to fund its share of development costs. There is also a crunch in export markets. Cost is only one of the issues for purchasing governments. Traditionally, the effectiveness of weapons systems and political ties between governments have been more important. But the culture of value for money is spreading to hard-pressed governments. Unless the European arms industry starts cross-border consolidation, it may face a choice between subsidising its arms exports and leaving the field to the US.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The chairman of the House of  Councillors' Special Committee on Political Reform resigned  Wednesday [12 January] after the panel passed a no-confidence  motion against him the opposition had submitted in protest  against his handling of political reform bills.    The ruling and opposition camps agreed later to pick panel  member Yubun Ueno as successor to Shoji Motooka as committee  chairman. Both Ueno and Motooka are members of the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest among the seven parties  in the ruling coalition.    The committee voted 17-16 to pass the motion submitted by  the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], the main opposition party.    Members of the LDP, the Japanese Communist Party and the  Niin  Club, a small group of upper house members, voted for the motion.    The resolution is legally not binding and only reflects the  committee's feelings, Diet officials said.    The LDP's motion was an apparent bid to slow the passage of  government-proposed political reform bills through the upper  house, coalition sources said.    The main opposition party accused Motooka of ignoring the  LDP's objections to the holding of a vote two days before to set  the date of a public hearing on January 17.    The setting of the hearing paves way for the ruling  coalition  to vote on the reform bills.    Coalition sources said the ruling parties may vote on the  package of four reform bills in the committee on January 18 and  at a plenary session the following day.    If the bills pass the second chamber without being modified,  they will become law since the House of Representatives has  already approved them.    The bills call for introducing single-seat constituencies  combined with proportional representation for House of  Representatives general elections and imposing stricter controls  on political funding. Both ruling and opposition parties say  the current multi-seat election constituencies are money  guzzling and the root cause of political corruption.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political  future on the enactment of the bills.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Deepening deficit at BBB Design Mounting losses continued to plague BBB Design, the USM-quoted marketing and media services company, in the year to April 30. At the pre-tax level the deficit increased from Pounds 246,000 to Pounds 389,000. That was struck after interest payable of Pounds 26,000 (nil) and an exceptional charge of Pounds 65,000 relating to property write-downs. Turnover fell by Pounds 866,000 to Pounds 1.65m and after a tax credit of Pounds 49,000 (Pounds 16,000) losses per share came out at 4.11p (2.78p). Mr Philip O'Donnell, chairman and chief executive, is to seek shareholder approval to introduce Pounds 200,000 in instalments between now and March 1993 by way of a loan to the group.</p>

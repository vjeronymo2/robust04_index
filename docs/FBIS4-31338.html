			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/6/1994 -- "Despite the drought  severely affecting a number of 13 counties in Eastern and  South-Eastern Romania, we still believe in a normal farm year,  real possibilities being in place to achieve good results at the  main crops," Ioan Oancea, minister of food and agriculture told  the government's daily VOCEA ROMANIEI.    According to estimations, the wheat crop could be at least  at  the level of 1993, with chances to top some six million tonnes,  "which exceeds the domestic consumption needs," the Romanian  minister said, referring to the "extremely good crops in Western  Romania". Mentioning that the spring sowing programme has been  fully completed, Minister Oancea considers that Romania can  count finally on a cereal production of about 18 million tonnes.    For the sugar beet crop, although sown on a smaller surface  as initially foreseen, but however exceeding the past year's one  by 50,000 hectares, during a normal agricultural year crops  would actually cover the current domestic needs. As for the  sunflower crop "it is looking very good, so we can count on a  surplus of edible oil that could go on foreign markets," the  minister said.    Referring to the harvest campaign, Ioan Oancea said that the  situation is extremely difficult, for agriculture is not  equipped with enough farm machinery, for the necessary credits  failed to be ensured for purchase of spares due to which repair  works were delayed. To cover this deficit "we have in view  cooperation actions with units in neighboring countries such as  Hungary, Moldova, Bulgaria, that would provide services on a  contract basis".    According to Minister Oancea, priority in this period are  the  irrigation works. "At the beginning of this month, irrigation  works were performed on less than 500,000 hectares," the  minister said, as a result of indiscipline in administering farm  equipment.</p>

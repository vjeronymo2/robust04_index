Over the past two days, villages in  the Lata ravine were shelled and the villages of Khutia,  Gentsvishi, Sakeni and Myasnikovka were burnt. Some of the  civilians were killed and hundreds of people found refuge in the  forests and mountains. The local population formed up units  which are offering stubborn resistance.    The same source announced that besides attacks in the Kodor  ravine, Abkhazian formations had launched an attack on the  village of Khurcha in the Zugdidi Region, and destroyed the  village of Ganakhleba in the Gali Region.    The Georgian Defense Ministry stated that Abkhazian units  were using heavy equipment, artillery and helicopters. However,  the Georgian and Abkhazian positions had not undergone any  significant changes.    Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's press service  announced  that since the escalation of the conflict in the Kodor ravine  two days ago, Georgia had lost 10 soldiers and 22 civilians.    The press service of the Abkhazian mission in Moscow stated  with reference to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry that Abkhazian  formations had eliminated the Georgian subversive groups based  in high-mountain villages of the Kodor ravine and restored peace  in them.    The same source reports that Georgians lost three tanks,  several anti-aircraft installations and an armored personnel  carrier. Large amounts of weapons were seized.    The press center of the Temporary Committee for Emergency  Situations in Western Georgia reports that the situation was  relatively calm on the border with Abkhazia along the Inguri  River and in the region of Zugdidi. Georgian Prime Minister  Otar Patsatsia, who earlier arrived in Zugdidi, and Chairman of  the Temporary State of Emergency Committee Dzhaba Ioseliani,  continue an inspection tour of the region.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Washington fights to save crime bill The White House and Congress are working feverishly to salvage the crime bill, which is stalled amid bitter disputes over race, the death penalty and a proposed ban on assault weapons. The proposed, multi-faceted law passed the Senate and House in varying forms last spring but has been held up for weeks in a joint House-Senate conference committee. After a week's postponement, the committee was due to meet yesterday for what could be final negotiations. If the committee does not this week release a bill which both chambers of Congress can pass, it is unlikely to be enacted this year, dealing a big blow to the Clinton administration. President Bill Clinton met leaders of the influential congressional Black Caucus yesterday to try to work out a compromise on a provision in the House version that would allow defendants to use statistics to challenge the death penalty as racially biased. Backers of the provision say the death penalty is applied disproportionately to black people. The Senate version of the bill does not contain this provision, and Senate Republicans have threatened a filibuster to kill any crime bill that includes 'racial justice' provisions. The White House initially favoured the so-called Racial Justice Act but has since retreated in the face of fierce Senate opposition, outraging the Black Caucus, whose votes may be essential to passing the crime bill in the House. The administration last week offered a compromise: Mr Clinton would sign an executive order mandating federal prosecutors to consider race in death penalty cases and appointing a commission to study the problem. But the Black Caucus baulked at the deal, vowing to fight on. It was not clear whether the meeting yesterday with Mr Clinton had changed their minds. Also causing trouble for the bill is a proposed ban on 19 kinds of assault weapons. The ban passed both the House and Senate, but is adamantly opposed by the Mr Jack Brooks, House chairman of the conference committee, who has attempted to weaken the ban. Many gun control advocates in both Congressional houses think the ban has the votes to pass in the final version of the bill. They feel the conference committee should not attempt to compromise with Mr Brooks, but the latter could further stall the crime bill in the committee, increasing the chances time will run out for it this year. The White House is eager to get a bill onto the floor of Congress this week to clear the decks for health care reform.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Nearly Unchanged: The Treasury sold $9.4 billion of new  three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.18%, down from 7.19% last  week.  </P> <P> Another $9.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.22%, up from 7.21% last week. The new discount rates understate the  actual return to investors -- 7.41% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill  selling for $9,818.50, and 7.60% for a six-month bill selling for $9,635.00.  The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government  securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

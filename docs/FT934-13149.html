			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after an opening upbeat note Wall Street AMID A flurry of corporate earnings reports and a sell-off in the bond market, US stock prices retreated yesterday after briefly flirting with record high levels, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 8.94 easier at 3,636.16 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.71 at 465.36. Secondary markets were more resilient, with the American SE composite firming 0.93 to 477.52 and the Nasdaq composite 3.03 higher at 771.28. NYSE volume was 287.2m shares. The session opened on an upbeat note following the decision by the German central bank to cut interest rates by  1/2 percentage point. The move appeared to improve prospects for US export opportunities to Europe. However, attention was mostly focused on a rash of quarterly reports, which were mixed to slightly better than expected, and equities registered early gains. As the morning progressed, share prices began to slip into negative territory, with investors taking their cue from an accelerating sell-off in US Treasuries. Long-dated bond prices fell sharply after the release of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey, which showed a surge in economic activity in the region. Bond traders interpreted the data as a signal of renewed inflationary pressure. In the afternoon, share prices managed to regain momentum before taking a second downturn in the last hour of trading. Banking issues were given a boost by a strong earnings report from Bankers Trust, up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 after its announcement of an 86 per cent increase in net income. The positive sentiment also gave a lift to Chemical, Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 42. Citibank put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 5/8 and Chase Manhattan was ahead Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 34 7/8 . Bankamerica recovered some ground lost in Wednesday's session, rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 1/2 . Dow Chemical was active and tumbled Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 3/8 , even though its third-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share were in line with analysts' expectations. Caterpillar climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to a 52-week high of Dollars 85 7/8 after the heavy equipment maker posted third-quarter operating income of 95 cents a share, well ahead of the consensus forecast of 57 cents. Telecommunications and technology issues were mixed. AT&amp;T shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 after reporting that its NCR operation had fallen into loss in the third quarter. Contributing to the Nasdaq advance, MCI gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 28 1/2 on news of a robust performance in the last three months. However, Microsoft dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 79 1/2 amid concern over weakening growth at the software company. Among energy companies issuing quarterly reports, Amoco declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 5/8 , while Mobil was unchanged at Dollars 80 5/8. Canada TORONTO closed lower in busy dealings as the recent rally in gold prices stalled. The TSE 300 index fell 19 points to 4,163.2. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 384 to 330. Volume was 63.7m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices declined, led by the gold group, off 2.6 per cent as the bullion price slipped 70 cents an ounce in New York to USDollars 371.85, after rising about USDollars 8 earlier this week.</p>

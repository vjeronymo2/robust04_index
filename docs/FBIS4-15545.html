			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr, (TANJUG) --Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic today received the Russian president's  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin who arrived in Belgrade last night  in the context of preparations for further negotiations between  the Republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia.    NATO's military operation against the Serbs in Bosnia last  night has obviously brought about a change to the agenda for the  talks between Milosevic and Churkin, as well as a change in the  timetable of the Russian envoy's visit. Instead of travelling to  Zagreb, as he initially planned, Churkin will pay an urgent  visit to Pale.    Following his two hour talks with President Milosevic,  Churkin described the latest situation in Bosnia in the wake of  NATO's military operation as a very serious one, stressing that  the peace process has been pushed down a dangerous ravine.    In Churkin's words, at the moment Moscow's diplomatic  efforts  are being invested in such a way whereby the tragic experience  in Gorazde will not be repeated anywhere else in Bosnia. In  this context he told reporters that he was immediately setting  off for Pale where he will talk to representatives of the Serb  republic. He did not rule out contacts with other sides,  including the Americans too.    The Russian envoy said that President Milosevic today had  asked him to try and help in order to have this present  dangerous situation overcome. We are aware of the problems  arising between the Bosnian Serbs and UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force]. I nevertheless believe that we can help in restarting  the negotiating process.    In Churkin's opinion, it is now of crucial importance to  reach a firm agreement on the cessation of hostilities across  the entire territory of Bosnia, including Gorazde.    One of the questions addressed to Churkin was whether NATO  had consulted Moscow before attacking the Serb positions around  Gorazde. No, we were not informed about the attack, Churkin  said. He added that Moscow had certain objections about the  level of communication between all factors involved in the  Bosnian conflict. He said that Moscow had received assurances  from the Bosnian Serbs that nothing serious would happen in  Gorazde. He stressed that if Russia had been more involved and  better informed about the situation around Gorazde, certain  things would not have happened, obviously hinting to last  night's NATO attack.    In the Russian envoy's opinion, NATO's military action will  have no influence on the relations between Moscow and  Washington. He said that Russia and the United States are  working together to solve the Bosnian conflict, that sometimes  they had different approaches, but that was not a reason to give  up on joint action. Churkin expressed hope that, by working  together, Moscow and Washington could achieve a lot in order to  bring the situation, which is now exceptionally dangerous, back  to normal.    Asked whether NATO's consultation with Moscow about  yesterday's action would have been necessary, Churkin said yes.  He believes that not only consultations between NATO and Moscow  would have been necessary, but that it was particularly  important that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali should have  informed Russia about what was going on around Gorazde.    However, Butrus-Ghali did not do that, and Churkin sees the  great speed in the development of the situation around Gorazde  as the only justification for that. In the end, stressing the  necessity of better communication between the crucial players in  the Bosnian conflict, Churkin said that he hoped that NATO would  learn a lesson from yesterday's action and not do that again.</p>

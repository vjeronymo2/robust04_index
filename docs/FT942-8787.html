			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gap widens in aircraft subsidy talks - The resumption of negotiations on limiting support for aircraft makers Amid modest hopes - and even more modest expectations - efforts get under way in Geneva today to break a six-month stalemate in negotiations aimed at agreeing stricter disciplines on government subsidies to commercial aircraft manufacturing. All the signs point to tough times ahead, likely to be marked by angry verbal sparring between the US and the European Union, the main protagonists. Few observers are optimistic about progress, and some fear the talks could even degenerate into a renewed bout of transatlantic trade hostilities. Industry attitudes have hardened before the talks. Some in the European industry say they may urge the EU to abrogate its two-year-old bilateral aircraft subsidy agreement with the US if the American side does not show more flexibility. US manufacturers say that if that happened they would re-open disputes procedures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade challenging the legality of government funding of the European Airbus. The European industry says it is preparing for that possibility by studying ways of invoking Gatt rules and EU trade sanctions to hit back at US competitors. Indeed, some European executives do not rule out acting first if the going got really rough. 'I wouldn't say we necessarily have a no first-strike policy,' says one. US manufacturers are making less bellicose noises, but seem determined to stand their ground. This month the chairmen of the country's biggest airframe and aero-engine makers wrote to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, urging him to 'proceed with extreme caution' and yield few concessions in the talks. 'The US and the EU remain far apart, and nothing we have seen suggests we are likely to bridge the gap,' says Mr Bob Robeson of the Aerospace Industries Association of America, the main industry body. These postures mark a reversal of roles. In the past the US, angered by government aid to Airbus, has made the running in demanding tighter subsidy curbs. But now the EU believes Washington is on the defensive about its own support programmes and scents blood. 'We are not returning to the talks as demandeurs,' says a European government official. 'We have a strong case, and the European industry is more united than ever before.' The negotiations broke up last December, two days before conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade deal, when the Gatt civil aircraft committee failed to agree the text of a draft agreement prepared by Mr Mikael Lindstrom, the committee's Swedish chairman. The EU and most of the 10 other countries on the committee were ready, albeit grudgingly, to accept the text. But it was rejected by the US government, which still opposes it as a basis for negotiation. Since the talks broke down, the political atmosphere has been further inflamed by the Clinton administration's role in clinching a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) Saudi Arabian order in February for US airliners. The Europeans are also critical of rapidly growing US support for commercial aerospace programmes. In addition to Pentagon funding for military contracts  -long a source of transatlantic controversy - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now generously funding industry research into supersonic and advanced subsonic airliner technology. At the same time, there are signs of growing tensions in talks between the four Airbus partners and Boeing on joint development of a 'super-jumbo' aircraft. The Europeans suspect Boeing's real motive may be to deter them from launching a rival to its highly profitable 747 range. The Geneva talks have resumed after frenzied French lobbying. In the hope of prodding the US back into negotiations, France has blocked an uncontroversial technical revision of the 1979 Gatt civil aircraft code, which has to be adapted to the rules of the new World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor. Though France's aggressive tactics infuriated other countries, they spurred a search for closer EU consensus. But there is no evidence that they have shifted the US bargaining position. Washington says it still wants to extend to other Gatt members, notably Canada and Japan, the principles of its bilateral pact with the EU. This limits the proportion of aircraft development costs that may be 'directly' funded by government and 'indirect' support for purposes such as research. However, the US continues to resist EU efforts to insert in the proposed agreement other provisions, several of them covered by Mr Lindstrom's draft text. They include: Tighter controls on 'indirect' government support. Extension of subsidy disciplines to aero-engines and parts. 'Grandfathering' (exemption) of government support for existing Airbus programmes. Changes in methods used in the bilateral agreement to calculate government support. US officials say a strengthened Gatt code covering all industrial subsidies, agreed in the Uruguay Round, provides adequate safeguards, making a separate agreement for aircraft no longer necessary. The EU says this argument is self-serving. Though the broader Gatt subsidies code would restrict 'direct' aid of the kind mostly used in Europe, it would have little effect on the 'indirect' support from which US aerospace companies mostly benefit. Such support is particularly prevalent in US aero-engines, many of which are derived from military designs. Last-minute objections to tougher Gatt disciplines by US engine makers were the main reason Washington rejected Mr Lindstrom's text last year. The EU says the US committed itself in the bilateral agreement to negotiate seriously on extending disciplines to engines. Mr Robeson of the AIAA concedes that such a commitment was given, but says it should no longer apply. In European eyes, this apparent ambivalence reflects a one-sided approach by the US which, they claim, colours its attitude to the bilateral agreement. Says one European industry executive: 'The Americans seem to think all the obligations are on us and none on them.' Some observers already suggest the best outcome in Geneva might be for the US and the EU to sink their differences by agreeing quietly to bury the Gatt negotiations. But while that would probably be welcomed in Washington, it is far less clear that it would satisfy a European industry which seems intent on exacting its pound of flesh.

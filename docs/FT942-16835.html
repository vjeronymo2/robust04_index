			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: Electricity project to go ahead in India The promoters of a planned Dollars 280m privately owned Indian power station yesterday announced the approval of bank loans for the project. They said it was the first new private sector electricity generating project to secure full financial support. GVK Industries, a diversified chemicals and property company, said that construction would start in June on the 235MW project at Jegurupadu in Andhra Pradesh. The company is developing the scheme in partnership with ABB, the European engineering combine, CMS Group, a US energy utilities company, and the Andhra Pradesh state electricity board. The Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, are also taking equity stakes. The project follows two years of Indian government efforts to attract private investment, including foreign capital, into the chronically underfinanced electricity supply industry. The government hopes the scheme will encourage the promoters of others. The power ministry has received expressions of interest from 75 groups, including 35 foreign companies, of which 22 were from the US, mainly from generating companies. However, only a handful have signed power purchase agreements - essential pacts between the would-be generator and the customer, usually the state electricity board. Other private sector schemes at an advanced stage of preparation include plans by Enron, a US energy group, to build a Dollars 900m 695MW station at Dhabhol in Maharashtra state, a 420MW scheme for Orissa, promoted by AES, another US generating group, and plans for a 1,000MW plant at Vizag in Andhra Pradesh sponsored by National Power of the UK and the Hindujas, a London-based Indian business family.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Contractors protest at debt burden Construction subcontractors could be losing about Pounds 1bn a year owed to them by clients and main contractors which have become insolvent, a survey of more than 800 specialist engineers published today indicates. The survey by the Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group (SECG), which represents heating, ventilation, electrical, plumbing and lift manufacturers and contractors, revealed that 889 companies had lost a total of Pounds 24m between January 1992 and July this year because of the failure of other companies. The losses represented 2.29 per cent of turnover on average. If the same trend occurred throughout the building industry subcontractors would have lost Pounds 1.1bn from bad debts from a total construction industry turnover last year of Pounds 47bn. The SECG called yesterday for a reform of UK insolvency laws. It wants ministers to abolish preferential creditor status, which gives secured creditors such as banks precedence when the money left by a failed business is divided up. The government recently announced it was considering whether the balance of rights between secured and unsecured creditors was right. The Confederation of British Industry has also called for insolvency laws to be reformed. Under the present arrangements there is usually very little money left for trade creditors once secured creditors have been repaid. The SECG said yesterday that all contractors should be classed as secured creditors if they were owed money for work that had been done. It said the collapse of a main contractor often caused a chain reaction which left subcontractors unpaid, forcing them and their suppliers to fail in turn. Some of the companies quoted in the survey had reported losses of as much as 8 per cent of their annual turnover. The SECG said procedures for channelling money from the ultimate customer through main contractors to subcontractors should be improved. Clients should be required to pay bills when the main contractor went out of business, it said. The group also criticised the practice of retaining part of the money owed to subcontractors as an insurance against defects emerging after work had been completed. 'The archaic system of retention money, applicable only in the construction industry, should be abolished,' said the SECG. It said contractors that were guilty of late payment or non-payment to their suppliers were causing serious financial problems for the industry and causing even more companies to fail.</p>

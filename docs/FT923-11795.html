			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Growth hope for Australia THE Australian economy is likely to grow about 4 per cent in the year to June 1993, after growing about 2 per cent in 1991-92, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said yesterday. Forecasts suggest Australia's real GDP grew about 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991/92, after growth of 1.4 per cent in the first three quarters. The government seems to have abandoned hope that growth would reach 4.75 per cent in the current year. The weakness of the recovery is reflected in the unemployment level, up from 10.5 per cent in February to 11.1 per cent.</p>

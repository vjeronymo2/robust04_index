			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Supermarket sales up in Japan Supermarket sales rose in Japan last month for the first time in 23 months, as tax cuts and a hot summer spurred spending, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. The Japan Chain Stores Association said yesterday that July data from member outlets showed an increase of 2.8 per cent on the same month of 1993. Food sales rose 2.6 per cent, with soft drinks in demand, while turnover in home electric appliances jumped 15.9 per cent, reflecting purchases of air conditioners and fans. Tax rebates accorded in a government stimulus package for the economy fed through into pay packets from late June, and have yet to show up in other consumer spending data. Tokyo department store sales for July showed no revival - nationwide figures are due today - although such store groups have suffered as a result of customers switching to discount retailers. Evidence of a consumer-led recovery durable enough to outlast the heatwave remains thin. Based on less timely figures covering the three months to June, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday sales of Japanese retailers as a whole were down 2.4 per cent from the second quarter of last year.</p>

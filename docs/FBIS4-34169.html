			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucio Vaz] </F>   [Text] The bloc of Protestant Church congressmen plans to  increase their number from 25 to 50 in this year's elections.  The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God alone hopes to elect  12 deputies.    With about 25 million followers, according to evaluations by  their congressional bloc, the Protestant Church has the  potential to elect an even greater number of deputies and  senators than that. Not all of the Protestant Church sectors  have, however, a centralized hierarchy like the Universal Church.    This religious group, headed by Bishop Edir Macedo, chooses  its candidates through a system resembling the "democratic  centralism" employed by orthodox leftist organizations.    The Bishops Council, which is comprised of eight to 10  bishops, holds a national meeting and chooses the candidates for  each state. Their faithful (nearly 1 million) are instructed to  vote only for those candidates.    This centralizing system is also partially adopted by the  other Pentecostal churches, such as the Assembly of God, the  Church of God, and the House of Blessings. The difference is  that in these religious groups decisions are made in each state  or city.    The historical divisions of the Protestant Church, such as  Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Lutheran, do not indicate  any preferred candidates. Clergymen who choose to follow a  political career, however, end up being supported by the  faithful.    Both the historical and the Pentecostal Protestants reject  political parties. They share, however, an interest in topics  linked to the family, such as abortion, divorce, homosexuality,  and prostitution.    The evangelical Christians follow the principle that  "Christians vote for Christians," independently of any party to  which the member of the Protestant faith is linked.    Of the current group of 21 Protestant deputies, 15 have  already changed parties after having being elected. In the  Senate, the bloc has four members.    The structure of the churches can be used to help elect  Protestant candidates. The Universal Church has a television  network (Record) and radio stations in several states.    During the electoral campaign, the clergymen of several of  these groups become voluntary campaign workers. The newspapers  that circulate among the faithful are also used to disseminate  news about the candidates.    Deputy Luiz Moreira (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia  State], of the Universal Church, says that all the clergymen of  their 160 churches in Bahia State will be his voluntary campaign  workers. "We will still have the support of these churches'  workers," he said.    Moreira asserts that the clergymen comply strictly with the  instructions of the Bishops Council. "Our hierarchy is  centralized," he explained.    Aware of the votes available in Bahia State, the Universal  Church has proposed a candidate for federal deputy and two for  state deputies.    The other religious groups are not as well organized. PFL  Deputy Arolde de Oliveira (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] asserts that the  2 million Protestant faithful of Rio de Janeiro could have  elected up to 20 deputies in 1990.    The excessive number of candidates from these churches,  however, allowed only seven of them to be elected. "The votes  of the Protestant faithful increased the support for the other  party candidates, and ended up getting non-Protestant people  elected," the deputy analyzed.    One of the things Protestant congressmen have in common is  their support of the government. Arolde de Oliveira explains:  "We want the freedom to disseminate our ideas, to address the  people in public squares, to have radio and television stations."    The Protestant congressmen's support of then President Jose  Sarney ensured them radio and television stations. These  congressmen also defended a five-year presidential mandate for  President Sarney at the 1988 Constitutional Assembly.</p>

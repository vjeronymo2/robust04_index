			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: Mugged by contrivance - Cinema THE VANISHING (15) George Sluizer CLOSE TO EDEN (15) Sidney Lumet SWING KIDS (12) Thomas Carter UNTAMED HEART (15) Tony Bill SOFIE (15) Liv Ullmann 'There must be other national disaster areas we can go to,' suggests the hero's girlfriend in the new thriller The Vanishing, as they drive through the stricken wastelands of Mount Saint Helen. There certainly are. All America is at their feet to judge by this week's movies. There is Hasidic New York as dottily depicted by director Sidney Lumet in Close To Eden: a place where each new day brings a fresh fall-out of cliches about Jewish life and tradition. There is the Disney-imagined 1930s Hamburg of Swing Kids, shot in Europe but spiritually based in Burbank. And there is the multi-ethnic Minneapolis of Untamed Heart where romance-bitten Latin waitresses jabber tirelessly about life and love. Multi-ethnicity is a la mode today. But Hollywood's grasp of how to deal with foreigners and immigrants sometimes seems no surer than in the bad old days when every Frenchman wore a beret, every Italian was Rossano Brazzi and every sortie into a European subject became a kamikazi raid on a hostile culture. The Vanishing, this week's only US film with all-WASP main characters, has a major country-of-inspiration problem. Directed by Holland's George Sluizer, it is a remake of his scarifying thriller about a Dutch girl's disappearance while holidaying in France and her boyfriend's confrontation with horror as  -years later - he tracks down her kidnapper-killer. Transplanted to an American setting and American genre tradition, the film withers on its stalk. Scripted by Todd Graff (Used People), it has no apparent understanding, even with the same man in the director's chair, of the Euro-spooky qualities that made the first film so indelible. From the continent of Kafka came a film with the courage of its comfortlessness. A true mystery (girl's baffling disappearance at motorway service area) turned into a true nightmare (hero's encounter with her abductor and voluntary re-living of her fate), passing through tunnels of fear, despair and horrific psychopathology. Now we have Jeff Bridges advertising that he is Mr Villain from scene one: playing with his chloroform bottle, waddling like Sydney Greenstreet and speaking with a clipped and 'sinister' accent. And we have a love interest (Nancy Travis) thrown in to keep the hero half-happy (Kiefer Sutherland) even as he pursues his monomaniac quest for his ex-love's destroyer. The final reel brings cross-country car chases, crunching fights in and around log cabins and hairsbreadth 'scapes from premature burial-places. Battered by melodrama and mugged by contrivance, the new Vanishing bears as much resemblance to the old Vanishing as Mickey Spillane does to Friedrich Nietzsche. Close To Eden is also about two races blindly, brain-damagingly colliding. For Dutch existential darkness meeting American action cinema, read New York policewoman Melanie Griffith meeting - nay, going undercover in - the city's Hasidic-Jewish community. 'What's new and exciting?' is Griffith's daily catch-line in the cop shop: to which the correct answer would be 'Nothing so far and the outlook is grim.' Sounding like a toddler on tranquillisers, Griffith pipes out her questions about Hebrew life and lore as she commutes between police HQ and the Jewish family with a murder in its midst. You know which place you are in from the lighting alone. Cameraman Andrzej Bartkowiak, of Lumet's The Verdict and Daniel, gives a harsh brusque daylight to the cop scenes while bathing the old-world Hasidic household in browns and golds and ambers. So subtle. One moment we could be in Cagney And Lacey; the next we feel we are drowning in a Rembrandt painting. The film's obviousness pervades every pore. To italicise her outsider status Griffith is scripted (by writer Robert J. Avrech) as if her character description read 'Single-figure IQ, dippy manner, could be convincing undercover agent in kindergarten.' When not reporting back to her boss with vital new findings on Jewish culture - ''Chutzpah'. It's a new word I've learned' - Griffith gropes towards a romance with a young aspiring rebbe or community leader (Eric Thal). 'Guess you're not used to a woman like me' she flutes one night out on the post-barmitzvah patio. 'Is anybody?' he replies. Close To Eden finally dies in a blaze of garish implausibility. We cannot leave without commenting on Griffith's disguise wig for Jewish ceremonies (Kiri Te Kanawa out of Norman Bates's mother); or on composer Jerry Bock's determination to accompany our heroine's trips to Little Israel with the kind of cod-Yiddish music that went out, or should have done, with Fiddler On The Roof. The only reason that Swing Kids and Untamed Heart seem preferable is that their foreignness/ethnicity are not rammed down our ears and into our brains. Swing Kids is a German-set film about the rise of Nazism. But no one, thank heaven, puts on a 'Cherman' accent. Not even Kenneth Branagh as the Gestapo officer bearing down on two jazz-loving Hamburgers, Robert Sean Leonard and Christian Bale, who insist on bopping to Herr Benny Goodman rather joining the Hitler Youth. Jonathan Marc Feldman's script claims - and who are we to argue? - that a whole generation of these rebel 'swing kids' actually existed before Adolf pulled the plug. It all ends in tears, as Nazi Germany herself did. The film is simplified, sentimentalised and directed with rationed bravura by TV graduate Thomas Carter. But at least it evades the worst strut-and-hiss nonsenses of National Socialist cinema. As for Untamed Heart, its 'at least' is Marisa Tomei. Miss T won this year's Oscar for best supporting actress - she was the human whirlwind in My Cousin Vinny - and now deserves another for best unsupported actress. As a lovestruck Minnesota waitress she wipes the screen with her co-performers: including Christian Slater as the heart-diseased, introverted busboy she loves, who when not clearing plates reads books and listens to music and rescues our heroine from rape attempts. Tomei's ethnicity is blissfully laid-back and unlabelled. (Is she Italian in origin? Hungarian? Spanish? The press notes are mute.) All we know is that she acts straight from the heart and funny-bone: a distrait diva whose line-readings have a concussed, eccentric, husky freshness we have not known since - well, I almost said since Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. But if I do that, Miss Tomei will end up playing undercover policepersons in certifiable crime dramas. Untamed Heart is directed by ex-actor Tony Bill. Hence perhaps its resemblance to a teledrama. The camera follows the human face, the close-up is king, and other cinematic values go hang. Liv Ullmann's directing debut Sofie has the same affliction. The screen-filling mug shots in this tale of a Jewish dynasty in turn-of-the-century Copenhagen are merciless. Unhappy Sofie (Karen-Lise Mynster), pushed into a loveless marriage by her matchmaking, prosperity-hunting parents (Erland Josephson, Ghita Norby), pines away under the giant lenses like a soul trapped in amber. We peer into her struggling features through the film's succession of amplifying golden twilights. And we are released from intimacy with Sofie only when the camera cuts to someone else's face and blows that up to fill the screen. We cannot fault the performances. Many of the actors come from the Ingmar Bergman repertory company and know how to suffer under all kinds of microscopes. But Ullmann has little sense of emotional rubato and less of visual rhythm. The sacrificial torments pound on through 2 1/2 hours. And while the faces register all the bruises that life and society can bring, the camera never pulls back far enough to show what that life and society really consisted of.</p>

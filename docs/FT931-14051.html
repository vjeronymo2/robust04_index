			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil and Colombia strike agreement on coffee quotas BRAZIL AND Colombia, the world's leading coffee exporters, will take an agreed set of target quotas for their shipments to the meeting of producer countries starting today in London. Brazil will propose that its quota be set at 27 per cent of the market, while Colombia will seek 18 per cent, according to Mr Rubens Barbosa, a Brazilian diplomat who is the lead negotiator for his country's delegation to talks on the International Coffee Agreement. The quota targets are based on exports in the two years to October 1992. The preliminary meetings among producer countries are a prelude to formal negotiations on the international accord set to reopen on February 1. At the end of last year, negotiators resolved to extend the deadline for completion of an accord to March 31. The two countries determined their quota targets this week in Brasilia, during meetings between Brazilian officials and Mr Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez, head of Colombia's Federacafe. Representatives of the Brazilian Coffee Committee, a private sector umbrella group, participated in the discussions. Officials from the two countries reached a consensus about selectivity for importers between different types of coffee - the lack of which was an important factor in the collapse of the last quota agreement in July 1989. Mr Barbosa declined to go into details, but said under the Brazil/Colombia proposals selectivity would be structured around the main four types of coffee. The rest, he said, 'is mechanics for the technicians to resolve'. Brazilian and Colombian officials habitually meet prior to talks on the accord in London. Mr Barbosa added that Brazil has held similar discussions recently with Central American producers. While producers appear to be forging a consensus, the position of consumers remains in doubt because of the change in the American administration. Mr Barbosa said the US has yet to reveal who will head the negotiating team representing President Bill Clinton.</p>

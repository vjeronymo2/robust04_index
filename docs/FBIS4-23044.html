Polyurethane coatings obtained by hardening of industrial  varnishes are readily contaminated with mold spores, especially  in warm and moist air. Tributyl tin is an effective fungicide  and tin-organic compounds are used as hardeners of polyurethane  varnishes. Taking this into account, industrial grade varnish  UR- 231 was modified with small quantities of tributyltin  dichloromaleanate (DKhMO). This substance was synthesized by  addition of tributyltin oxide to dichloromaleic acid. It has two  biologically active groupings (the tributylstannyl group and a  halogen at the double bond), each acting in a different  fungicidal mechanism. This combination could intensify the  activity of the compound through a synergistic effect. The  LD[.sub]50[/] (acute oral toxicity for mice) is equal to 200  mg per kg of the pure substance. DMKhO, being a trialkyltin  carboxylate, also acts as a hardener for polyurethane resins. On  hardening, this fungicide also becomes part of the composition  of a macromolecular coating and provides structural biocidal  protection. Bench tests demonstrated that the compound has  satisfactory adhesion and electrical insulating resistance (over  2 MOhms at 500 volts) which meets the standard. The test results  also showed that varnish UR-231 modified with 0.1 percent DMKhMO  has improved service properties for radio-electronic components  and extends their use to tropical conditions.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 May (ITAR-RASS) -- [Senator] Sam Nunn and  other U.S. senators will propose to President Bill Clinton that  the first joint U.S-Russian military exerises within the  framework of the peacekeeping forces should be held on the  territory of the United States and not Russia, Sam Nunn,  chairman of the U.S. Armed Services Committee of the Senate,  said today at a news conference in Moscow which summed up the  results of the working meeting between the parliamentarians of  the United States and the Russian Federation on questions of  defense and security.    The U.S. delegation was composed of seven senators -- four  Republicans and three Democrats -- highly assessed the results  of the meeting. "We received enthusiastically the idea of  civilian control [kontrol] over nuclear and other types of  weapons of mass destruction," Sam Nunn noted. He stressed that  the United States and Russia should step up their work to reduce  the risk of weapons of mass destruction being used.    The sides agreed that it is necessary to do everything to  prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of  missile technology. "The United States, Russia, and other great  powers have no interest at all in nuclear, chemical, and  bacteriological weapons spreading around the world," Sam Nunn  noted.    Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Committee for Defense of  the State Duma, called the meeting between the parliamentarians  of the two great powers a "significant event". During the  two-day discussion, he noted, problems concerning external  security and defense policy were discussed. The sides stressed  that civilian control over the armed forces has great importance  for strengthening the system of mutual security. "Joint  Russian-American military exercises are the symbol of trust  between the two countries," Sergey Yushenkov said. "In this  respect, the implementation of other programs in the military  sphere, including the Partnership for Peace program, are also of  great importance," he said.    The two parliamentary defense committees agreed to continue  the dialogue which, to all appearances, will take place on the  territory of the United States now.</p>

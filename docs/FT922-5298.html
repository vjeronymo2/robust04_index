			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (5): Further expansion possible for Glaxo - Profile IF YOU are one of the millions of people round the world who suffer from peptic ulcers then there is a good chance that the treatment you take is manufactured in Singapore. Zantac, the ulcer treatment tablet made by the UK pharmaceutical giant Glaxo, has an estimated 40 per cent of the world market for such drugs. Glaxo describes Zantac as the world's best-selling medicine, with sales of Pounds 1.6bn in the year to June 1991. Singapore produces the ingredients for more than 70 per cent of Zantac's worldwide sales. Glaxo has been in Singapore since the late 1940s but has only been manufacturing in the island republic since the early 80s. The specialist ingredients for Zantac arrive in Singapore by ship from Europe and are then manufactured into powder form at Glaxo's plant in the Jurong industrial estate before being air freighted out in drums and made up into tablets, packaged and distributed in the various markets around the world. 'Back in the late 70s, Glaxo decided to go global and Singapore was chosen as the best location for manufacturing,' says Dr Alan Catterall, managing director of Glaxo's Singapore operations. The success of the Singapore plant is due to success of Zantac. Nearly 50 per cent of Glaxo's total sales now come from Zantac. The highly-automated Singapore plant started operations with 120 workers; there are now 300. A new plant is being built on an adjacent site wich will employ an additional 170 workers to manufacture the active ingredients for a new range of drugs. The efficiency of operations at Singapore's docks are essential for the smooth running of the Glaxo plant. The expansion of Singapore's Changhi airport and the good connections available are also key factors determining Glaxo's expansion in the island republic. But like many companies in Singapore, Glaxo now finds it difficult to recruit workers. 'The labour market is very tight,' says Dr Catterall. 'We are now having to look around the region for skilled people, or recruit them from Europe.' Glaxo feels these staff problems will be overcome and does not rule out further expansion plans. 'It's things like the support services that are available here that make the difference,' says Dr Catterall. 'If one of our highly complex machines breaks down someone will be out here to fix it in under half an hour. Elsewhere in the world, it might take 24 hours and valuable production time would be lost.'</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Picking over tasty opportunities - Stakis's plans to exploit weakness in its market Sir Lewis Robertson reflected this week that while illness in a company was undesirable, Stakis had succeeded in timing its period of infirmity rather well. The pruning of the company under his chairmanship since 1991 had 'greatly refreshed' it, he said. It was now unencumbered by problems from the past and confronted a market which offered tasty opportunities for a discriminating purchaser, caused by the difficulties of other companies. Now this medium-sized hotel and casino company is securing sufficient means to exploit these chances. Sir Lewis, a specialist in corporate rescues, became chairman when the company slid into trouble under Mr Andros Stakis, son of its Cypriot-born founder Sir Reo. 'Everyone knew what needed to be done to save the company,' an executive who has worked under both regimes said recently. 'It just needed someone to take the decisions.' The company shed its fringe operations, refining itself to hotels, casinos and its promising but expensive nursing homes operation. Sir Lewis brought in Mr David Michels as chief executive from Hilton International. Stakis emerged from convalescence in January 1993 when it disposed of its nursing homes, writing off Pounds 48m and raising Pounds 28m in a rights issue. Mr Michels tightened the management of what he says was basically a sound business operating a chain of middle ranking hotels and casinos (most of them outside London), which enjoyed strong staff loyalty and well chosen sites. Better control of costs and more skilful pricing were more influential last year in raising room occupancy rates and generating pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m than the slight upturn in the UK economy. Last year the company began to strike out again, buying a hotel in York for Pounds 5m, acquiring three casinos in the Midlands for Pounds 10.5m, and starting building work on airport hotel in Edinburgh. The City has been impressed by Mr Michels' mastery of the business, and has increasingly urged Stakis to take advantage of the opportunities created by the weakness of other groups, hence the rights issue. Stakis has already rejected the hotels being disposed of by Queens Moat Houses, but hopes better properties may become available. It has ended negotiations with Aer Lingus on the possible purchase of its Copthorne chain. But Forte is also expected to make strategic disposals and Hilton International could also put properties on the market. 'The market had been expecting us to make a single purchase of a chain or block of hotels,' says Mr Michels. 'But you can't do that in this market: the seller always parcels up the ones you want to buy with about 30 per cent that you don't want, and in this market you can't get rid of that 30 per cent.' For this reason, Stakis prefers to cherry pick. 'It's more profitable and safer.' However, the company stresses that it will also examine carefully the acquisition of larger portfolios of hotels 'if the profiles of the units suitable and the terms are attractive.' The group expects to buy about six properties this year. 'What we bring to the party is a style of management and local autonomy that has had a positive effect on our returns elsewhere,' says Sir Lewis. 'We also bring a strong marketing input and a strong IT input.' The acquisitions Stakis made last year did not 'add a single body to our head office payroll,' says Mr Michels. The stock market was not taken aback by Stakis's capital raising announcement. The shares fell by 1p to 84p compared with the rights price of 72p. Analysts still expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m for this year, with earnings of 4.2p, which puts Stakis on a prospective p/e of 19.5.</p>

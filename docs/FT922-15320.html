			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Hardline premier losing ground in Beijing power struggle: Li Peng openly criticised in unprecedented battle over economic reform at National People's Congress LI PENG, the Chinese premier and the man most closely associated with the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, is losing ground in an intensifying power struggle between communist party reformers and hardliners. Li's insistence that the country's growth rate be held to 6 per cent this year has been openly criticised in a session of the Chinese parliament, now meeting in Beijing. Such criticism is unprecedented for the National People's Congress, whose 3,000 delegates traditionally rubber-stamp government decisions without question. An NPC deputy, quoted this week by the official Xinhua news agency, compared the proposed growth rate with last year's figure of 7 per cent, and said it was out of tune with the 'spirit of speeding up economic development'. A campaign to accelerate China's economic restructuring with an infusion of capitalism was launched by Deng Xiaoping in booming Shenzhen on the Hong Kong border in January. The 87-year-old patriarch, no stranger to power struggles with Maoist ideologues, criticised by name a number of Li's hardline backers who have dominated the political scene since the military crackdown in Beijing. Deng's message, blocked by opponents of capitalist-style changes, was kept out of the leftist-controlled national media until this week when it was splashed over front pages with full colour pictures of Deng himself. Lengthy extracts were read on national television and the news carried footage of Deng in Shenzhen accompanied by one of his daughters. The media blitz brings Mr Deng's views to the Chinese population for the first time and marks a turning point in his campaign to outwit his conservative opponents and a setback for the increasingly isolated Li and his ageing backers, led by Chen Yun, 86. Sensing a shift in the political wind, Li has tried to present himself to the NPC as a reformer. In his government report to the congress he backed shareholding and reiterated Deng's calls to 'emancipate our minds in reform and opening to the outside world and absorb what has proved effective in capitalist countries'. But he pointedly failed to condemn the leftism which has caused China so much suffering in the past, and to assert, with Deng, that the greatest danger to China came from the conservative Marxists rather than rightists favouring market economics and democracy. The pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported NPC delegates complaining of 'something inadequate' in Li's government work report because of its failure to address the need for vigilance against leftism. Ta Kung Pao and reports in Beijing said yesterday the secretariat of the NPC had added to Li's report a reference to the greater threat being from the left. It said the words 'Eliminate all interference, be vigilant against the right but especially guard against the left' were inserted. Articles are beginning to appear in the Chinese media obliquely aimed at the prime minister. 'Maybe by ousting one person we can set a new course,' said the Economic Daily. Because of his close association with the order to fire on demonstrators in June 1989, Li is extremely unpopular, and said to be seen by Deng as unimaginative and mediocre. His five-year tenure of office ends this year. His future grows more uncertain as the pro-reform forces gather strength in the run-up to the crucial 14th party congress later this year. If Mr Li falls, Zhao Ziyang, the part boss sacked after the Tiananmen crackdown, could be rehabilitated. His economic policies are now moving back into the ascendant.</p>

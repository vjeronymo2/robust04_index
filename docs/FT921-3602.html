			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price under pressure GOLD WAS again under pressure yesterday. The price was 'fixed' in London at its lowest for six months and below the psychologically-important level of Dollars 348 a troy ounce. On the New York Commodity Exchange at one stage the most-active April contract dropped to a new nadir of Dollars 347 an ounce. One dealer suggested: 'Gold's going down to the low 340s and it will be hard work holding it up'. However, Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, stockbroker, said that, although the next few weeks would see gold at its weakest, 'we hold to our expectation that a sustainable bull market will start around the middle of the year, expect a 1992 average price of Dollars 370 to Dollars 375 an ounce and a test of Dollars 400 before year-end.' In a special report on the gold market, Ms O'Connell points out that it was unsettled in February by steady sales from a German bank. The most likely source of the metal was the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Islamic fasting month of Ramadan started on March 6 and runs until April 6 and is contributing to nervousness as Middle Eastern speculative activity is reduced. 'However, in recent weeks the Middle East has been a two-way trader rather than a net buyer so no pillar of support has actually been pulled away,' says Ms O'Connell. She adds that demand from China has re-emerged after its New Year holiday 'and is roaring ahead'. Yesterday's downward pressure was triggered by selling in New York by a computer-managed fund, dealers suggested. In London gold closed last night at Dollars 347.70 an ounce, down Dollars 1.30.</p>

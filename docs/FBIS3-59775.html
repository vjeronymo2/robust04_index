			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] A group led by professor Setsuji Higashinari of the  Basic Engineering Department, Osaka University, has developed a  pH-dependent ultrafiltration membrane that effectively separates  and purifies desired substances such as proteins from mixtures  containing multiple ingredients of various molecular weights.  Moreover, the membrane does not adversely affect biological  activity. This is the first case in which a  separation/purification technique mediated by pH sensitivity has  been realized. The separation and purification of useful  substances produced by microbes and cultured plant and animal  cells (bioproducts) is an essential technology in such major  industries as pharmaceuticals and foods. Because separation  efficiency is greater than with previous methods, and separation  and purification are achieved in a single process, this new  development will lead to greater efficiency in mass production.    Past protein separation and purification processes required  such manufacturing steps as concentrating the protein by  precipitation, fractionating by molecular size using gel  filtration, separating by chromatography or other methods, and  desalting by dialysis. This new membrane is a stimulus-response  polymer membrane whose separation properties change according to  pH. The protein can be concentrated, fractionated, and purified  merely by passing it through the membrane. The pH-dependent  ultrafiltration membrane is formed by dissolving a  radical-polymerized copolymer consisting of 4-vinylpyridine and  acrylonitrile in a 1:4 molar ratio in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in  the presence of lithium nitrate, evaporating the solvent, and  performing gelation to remove additional solvent.    To use the membrane for protein separation, the  sugar-binding  protein lectin is added to a cell lysate and ultrafiltration  performed at high pH. At high pH, the molecular weight of the  fraction passing through the membrane is high, but because the  desired proteins bind to the lectin and essentially form a  polymer, they are retained. This removes impurities that are  lighter than or about the same molecular weight as the desired  protein. Next the pH is lowered, which causes the desired  protein to dissociate from the lectin. At low pH, the membrane  becomes more hydrophilic, and it expands. When this happens, the  pores in the membrane become smaller and the molecular weight of  the fraction passing through the membrane is reduced. This time  only the desired protein passes through the membrane, and it is  separated from impurities of higher molecular weight, which are  retained.    By utilizing the pH-dependent ultrafiltration membrane in  this manner, it is possible to separate a desired substance from  a mixture containing impurities of both higher and lower  molecular weights. The membrane can be used not only to purify  useful enzymes such as peroxidase and superoxidase mutase, but  can also be used for glycoprotein bioproducts such as  oligosaccharides.</p>

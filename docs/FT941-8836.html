			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Andean pipeline will give big boost to Argentine oil earnings The presidents of Argentina and Chile have formally opened a 265-mile oil pipeline crossing the southern Andes. It links the Neuquen basin, Argentina's biggest oilfield, with Chile's Pacific port of Concepcion. The Dollars 215m pipeline built by YPF, Argentina's privatised oil giant, and Chile's state-owned oil company ENAP, will allow Argentina's oil export earnings to be increased by Dollars 500m a year. It has a transport capacity of 107,000 barrels a day and will relieve pressure on Argentina's domestic pipeline system, overloaded by a big increase in production following deregulation of the oil industry in 1991 and YPF's privatisation last year. The presence of Argentina's President Carlos Menem and President Patricio Aylwin of Chile at Tuesday's inauguration ceremony further underlined steadily improving relations between two traditional enemies who almost went to war in the south in 1978. Chilean companies have invested Dollars 2bn in Argentina since 1990, mainly in privatised power stations that include strategically sensitive hydro-electric dams in the southern Andes.</p>

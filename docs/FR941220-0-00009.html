			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third comment also urged EPA to revisit the issue and ``to craft a more stringent regulation regarding the production of methyl bromide for export to Article 5 countries.'' EPA believes that the 10 percent allocation of potential production allowances for the export of methyl bromide to Article 5 countries in today's notice does not preclude future consideration of more stringent regulations for methyl bromide. In fact, EPA is continuing to analyze methyl bromide's role in stratospheric ozone depletion and the potential environmental and health benefits that could potentially be obtained through further regulatory controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Use of Allocation and Conversions During the Control Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposal of October 14, 1994, EPA stated that the allocation of potential production allowances for Article 5 countries may be retroactive to the beginning of the control period starting January 1, 1994. In this final action, EPA allocates potential production allowances for the control period starting January 1, 1994, to those companies with baseline production allowances for methyl bromide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received a comment that further clarification is needed that conversions of potential production allowances into production allowances should also be made retroactive for the 1994 control period. As noted earlier, authorizations to convert potential production allowances to production allowances are valid during the control period in which the controlled substance was exported. Thus, EPA agrees with this comment and will process requests to convert potential production allowances to production allowances for exports that occurred in the 1994 control period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will process authorizations to convert potential production allowances into production allowances for exports that occur within the 1994 control period (before midnight of December 31, 1994) as long as the paperwork is received by EPA before the final day of the first quarter of 1995. The current regulations refer to control periods and do not prohibit companies from seeking authorizations to convert for quantities of methyl bromide exported, as long as the export occurs in the same control period in which the production allowances are used. The export, conversion and use of the production allowances must all occur within the same control period. Therefore, a company that receives production allowances through a conversion during the first quarter of the year following the export will not be able to use these allowances for production, but may use them to ensure compliance for the control period in which the export occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BIG PINE;  </P> <P> CHP SAYS DRIVER TRIED TO CONTROL BUS  </P> <P> The driver of a runaway bus packed with European tourists did his best to avoid  a mountain highway accident in an incident that killed a tourist and injured 46  others, officials said. "He told me he was in third (gear)," said California  Highway Patrol Sgt. Ray Dixon.  </P> <P> "After the brakes were failing and he could smell them burning, he came out of  third to downshift, and he couldn't get into second." The bus continued to pick  up speed while driver Juan Garcia Jr., 30, wrestled to gain control, scraping  the mountainside on its way down steep, winding California 168, the sergeant  said. The bus eventually plunged over a six-foot embankment into a flat area of  rocks and brush. Marguerite Finat, 60, of Marseilles, France was killed.  </P></p>

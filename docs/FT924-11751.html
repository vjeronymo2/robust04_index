			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE STRENGTH of sterling gave an initial boost to stock index futures, sending the contract sharply forward before a strong bout of profit-taking caused a retreat, writes Joel Kibazo. Demand for the December contract on the FTSE, which began trading at 2,691, was seen early in the session sending it gently forward. But continued hopes of a cut in UK base rates, the recovery of sterling and a general lack of sellers led to a squeeze mid-morning when the contract powered ahead reaching the day's high of 2,729 just before lunch. In the afternoon, an initial bout of profit-taking gathered pace after the early lacklustre performance on Wall Street and December hit the day's low point of 2,634 half an hour before the official close. December finished at 2,690, down 6 on Wednesday's close and around 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 23. Turnover was a more modest 8,154 contracts. A premium of between 15 and 30 was seen throughout the session. Volume in traded options was once again healthy, reaching 37,059 contracts. A total of 13,850 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, though a mere 416 lots were traded in the Euro FT-SE option. In stock options, Lasmo was the day's best performer, recording a total of 1,889 trades with the February 260 calls the busiest series.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that  the republic's capital should be transferred from Alma-Ata  [Almaty] to Akmola before the end of the decade. On Thursday he  called on the Kazakh parliament to adopt such a decision. In  Nazarbayev's opinion, the capital should not be situated near  the border but rather in the center of the state. He also  justified his proposal by the fact that Akmola is located at a  point where the major ethnic groups meet (in Kazakhstan Russians  live predominantly in the north and Kazakhs -- in the south).  In addition, Alma-Ata is situated in a seismic zone and is  suffering from severe environmental problems.</p>

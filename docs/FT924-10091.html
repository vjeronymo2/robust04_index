			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / China-Germany ties normalised GERMAN Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel yesterday declared relations with China normalised, ending three years of coolness that followed the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, AP reports from Beijing. Germany, like other western countries, imposed sanctions on China following the army attack on the demonstrators in Beijing in June 1989. Aid and ministerial visits were suspended. The sanctions have largely been dropped, but only last March, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Bonn that a 'visible change in Chinese human rights policies' was necessary for a full return to normal relations. Mr Kinkel, holding a news conference as he neared the end of his three-day visit to Beijing, refused to say why Germany had dropped that condition. However, he emphasised China's economic dynamism and the size of its domestic market, as well as Germany's desire to reverse its trade deficit with China. Since Mr Kohl's meeting with Qian, China has pushed its market reform programme into high gear after a hiatus of four years, and promised to reduce import barriers. 'After this visit has been concluded, we can take it that relations are normal,' Mr Kinkel said. 'Both sides have the intention to look forward.' Mr Kinkel said he discussed human rights with Qian and Prime Minister Li Peng but refused to give any details of what was said. He said quiet diplomacy was more effective than 'making a lot of noise about what one does'. Asked if he discussed political reform in China, he said, 'I don't think I should be the person to interfere in the internal affairs of this country. I am not an adviser to the Chinese government.'</p>

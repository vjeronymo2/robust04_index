			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (6): The strain in Spain - Pressures for greater regional autonomy are growing stronger RUNNING SPAIN must sometimes feel a little like drifting on a liferaft of oil drums tied together with thin string. The longer the craft stays in the water the weaker the binding becomes and the cans begin to move ominously. Although bound by the 1978 Constitution, the 17 autonomous regions that make up modern Spain are beginning to jostle about, rubbing up against each other and pressing the central government for more autonomy. The problem is not that the raft is falling apart but rather that it is costing Madrid a lot more money to keep it together. With Spain's public sector deficit running at 4.4 per cent of GDP (opposition parties claim it is much higher) a recent OECD report on the Spanish economy surprised no-one by insisting that 'one of the main causes for high deficits is expansionary policy by regional governments'. While the central government deficit has been falling since 1985, regional debt has risen from 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1985 to more than 1.5 per cent last year. The OECD accuses the regions of spending money on flashy projects and of paying their civil servants - many of whom duplicate jobs being done in Madrid - more than central government pays its own. Frustrated by Madrid's reluctance to throw more money at them, the regions have begun to tap local and international capital markets for funds. Many are close to breaching their legal debt limits - interest payments may not be more than 25 per cent of revenues - and one, Cantabria, technically bankrupted itself last year. The OECD calls on Madrid (in truth, OECD country reports are usually written with the assistance of the Finance Ministry concerned) to tighten up these limits and to make it clear to lenders that the State is not underwriting regional borrowing. But that misses the crucial political point. The borrowing is just a symptom of the tremendous head of regionalist political steam built up because of the federal vision held out by the 1978 Constitution. Although the complex constitutional system gives some regions - Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia and Andalucia - more autonomy more rapidly than the others, all 17 regions are basically promised the freedom, in time, to run their internal affairs. Madrid's difficulty is that it never really rid itself of the centralist tradition inherited from Franco and is trying to grant autonomy at its pace while many of the regions run by regional parties are trying to grab, in Madrid's view, too much too quickly. It is arguable that devolved power can never create a true federation anyway and that federal states such as Germany and the US function because the devolution went the other way - from the states to the centre. The tension between regions and Madrid stands to reason: the politics of the regions are fundamentally nationalist, or even ethnic. It is essential to the electability of a regional party that Madrid be painted as an inadequate provider, as a distributor of Catalan taxes to Extremadura or of encouraging investment in Andalucia at the Basque Country's expense. Much of this is game playing. But it can sound very threatening. Both Catalonia and the Basque Country are run by conservative nationalist parties whose leaders periodically say almost seditious things. Last year, the Catalan leader observed that Catalonia was in a very similar situation to Lithuania, which was then becoming independent of the former Soviet Union. Did he mean Catalonia should be independent too? He said no, not at all, and then promptly began to press Madrid for more money and, to his horror, had his bluff called. In negotiations last year to redesign the financial arrangements between the regions and Madrid Catalonia began to press loudly for the right to be able to spend the taxes raised in Catalonia. Madrid soon shut this up by suggesting the Catalan government might like to raise these taxes itself too, as the Basques do. This was not what the Catalans had in mind. Raising (in the sense of collecting or increasing) taxes is not a politically attractive thing to do. The Catalan Government simply wanted to spend what Madrid had collected. So the demand was quietly dropped. But the fuss about more autonomy is not just a harmless struggle for money. Slowly but surely it is changing the face of Spanish politics as the large centralist parties weaken and the regionalists grow. It is quite possible, for instance, that the next Spanish general election (to be held between now and October next year) will force Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's socialists into a coalition with either the ruling Catalan CiU or the ruling Basque PNV. Both these parties send MPs to Madrid and the CiU is the third largest party in the House. The large conservative opposition, the Partido Popular (PP), has also been forced to compromise. In Navarra, for instance, it has an agreement under which it supports the ruling UPN in regional elections and in turn expects the UPN vote to come to it in general elections. The PP has also formed alliances with regionalist groups in Aragon and local ones in Valencia and Seville. At another level, regions controlled by socialist party or PP leaders are also being forced to champion regional themes with which their centralist party leaderships are uncomfortable. In socialist Andalucia, for example, the regional government fights constant skirmishes with Madrid over health policy. Andalucia is one of the few regions with its own health service and claims Madrid, in order to save money, constantly delays making budgeted transfers to Seville which, in turn, borrows money in the capital markets to make up shortfalls and thus infuriates Madrid. Meanwhile, Galicia, which the PP controls through its maverick founder, the former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga, is leading a sudden charge to redesign totally the way the historic autonomies - Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia - are run. He has called for the creation of a single administration in each territory, meaning that centrally appointed civil governors and other officials would be withdrawn. Madrid would thus delegate all its powers - including control of the police - to the leader in these regions. It just happens that the socialists control none of the three historic autonomies (though they are the junior coalition partner in the Basque Country) and the idea therefore is unlikely to get very far now. But Catalonia's leadership likes it and single administration may yet make headway if the Catalan CiU is able to force the socialists into a coalition after the next national election. For the CiU and the Basque PNV, the need to be seen to be making progress on questions of autonomy (even if it is sometimes illusory) is critical because they are constantly being chased in their own backyards by smaller parties which genuinely want independence for their regions and not just more national resources. This is even beginning now in Aragon and while Basque separatists regularly take about 16 per cent of the Basque vote there has been a sharp increase in support recently for the separatist Catalan party ERC. That is a direct result of the Catalan leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, exciting nationalist fervour, and backing off. Whenever he does this he leaves a separatist residue for the ERC to pick up.</p>

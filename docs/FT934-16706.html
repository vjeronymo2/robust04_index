			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Stock Exchange to monitor level of flotation demand THE STOCK Exchange is expecting a steady flow of flotations over the next few months, and regards this as a critical time to make sure the mechanism for new issues is working smoothly. That includes ensuring retail investors have access to issues. Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings at the exchange, said that so far issues through financial intermediaries, where investors can apply for shares through brokers for instance, have generally been oversubscribed but not by substantial multiples. 'By and large sponsors have got it about right.' The exchange applied the yardstick of oversubscription to measure whether sponsors had accurately estimated public demand. Mr Atkinson said sponsors who got it wrong would be questioned and the exchange would 'take a more critical view the next time the sponsor comes along with an issue'. There had been no complaints from the public that they had been denied the opportunity to participate in new issues. One broker said the intermediaries offer was seen as a way of accessing the private investor. Another said these offers only worked if commissions were paid. Part of the impetus for the spate of flotations has been that, with the market on a high historic rating, companies have obtained a better price than by accepting a takeover. Institutional appetite for new equity has also been demonstrated by the take-up of rights issues. These have raised nearly Pounds 10bn this year, far outweighing the value of new shares issued in flotations. The rush to market, Page 22</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Justinian: Dear Lord Chancellor . . . Your intention to publish a detailed consultation paper on the question of continued bewigging and begowning of only the judges and advocates of the High Court of Justice seems an unnecessarily elaborate process to determine a straightforward and uncomplicated issue that sharply divides the rationalist from the traditionalist. Cannot that simple issue be left to the Council of Judges to decide, since it is the judges who, apart from any statutory provision, exclusively define their own practice and procedure as part of the inherent jurisdiction of the court? Few, if any, seem to want to be rid of the gown. It is the recognised symbol of authority in all civilised legal systems. And no one suggests that it is anachronistic to require uniform dress in the cause of majestic justice. Even the most plebeian of contemporary legal systems - the US - has discarded most of the accepted habits of decorous forensic behaviour, but not the black gown. Contrariwise, the wig is an anachronism. Apart from some quiddities of the parliamentary scene of which you, Lord Chancellor, are an exemplar - the wig, as opposed to the toupee, is worn only ceremoniously. There is no great harm in that. To sustain the links with our legal ancestors by a visual display at the annual parade of the judiciary is a mark of historical development. We need to be reminded whence we have come. The retentionists argue, rightly, that the legal process is a public service, and if the public want to dress up their judges and legal practitioners in horsehair, so be it. We should bow to the popular voice. This would perhaps carry the day if the public were regular users of the courtroom. Happily they are not. Those who undergo the rigours of the litigious pro-cess are a largely self sel-ective and partially selected number. The overriding impression that any participant in the forensic process gets is the awesomeness of the law in action. Witnesses - those who by definition are largely dragged to court to support one side or another - universally find the experience intimidating. The process should be designed to reduce the element of unfamiliarity commensurate with a decorous procedure that befits a civilised country's means of resolving the citizenry's disputes. Anything that is distinctively out of accord with customary standards of dress should be avoided. Wigs are at best theatrical; at worst they belong to the kindergarten. Then it is said, with appropriate seriousness, that the wig provides an anonymity so necessary to protect the judge - even physically, it seems - from streetwalk or shopfloor recognition by disgruntled litigants motivated to inflict injury. Does Lord Donaldson of Lymington really believe that the wig disguises the judge sufficiently to allow him to pass unnoticed from a civilian shopping in Marks and Spencer? I am afraid experience is to the contrary. The wig - not the full-blown variety used for ceremonies - distorts but does not obliterate the physiognomy. The Master of the Rolls will have to wear a mask if he wants to hide his handsome countenance. My respect for him is not one whit enhanced for the piece of horsehair that sits unevenly on his ample locks. Lord Brightman, apparently a convert to retentionism through a methodologically unsound poll conducted by familial pollsters, says that it is no hardship for us lawyers (and judges) to bow to popular demand. Hardship, no. But the thing I have had to wear for nearly 40 years is a confounded nuisance. I can testify to being the less-than-proud owner of a frowzy wig, much like that described as possessed by Dr Johnson - out-of-court, of course. It is time that the English and the Scots took a leaf out of the book of their kinsfolk in the Channel Islands. The Court of Appeal for Jersey and for Guernsey was formed a quarter of a century ago out of a panel of twelve English and Scottish QCs. We wear a jabot (rather more elegant than the English white bands) and a French style hat. But as soon as the court assembles, the hats are removed and replaced only on the court rising. That combines a due respect for tradition and does not detract from the due process of law. So, Lord Chancellor, to adopt a Chestertonian phrase directed at one of your predecessors on the woolsack, chuck it. You have done much to modernise our profession. You will go down in history as the moulder of a vital public service. Don't tarnish that reputation by condescending to the forces of reactionism. Out with the horsehair. In with the public demonstration that the law is here to serve a public that no longer wants the histrionics of advocates detracting from day-to-day problems that beset the ordinary citizen. The courtroom is not a place for pantomime, but for serious problem-solving. Yours, Louis Blom-Cooper QC</p>

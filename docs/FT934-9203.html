			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Poor sales hurt US retailers TWO LEADING US retailers yesterday said their third-quarter performances had suffered as a result of special charges against earnings. Woolworth and Federated Department Stores revealed disappointing sales figures, in contrast with a batch of retailers reporting a day earlier. Woolworth, which recently announced plans to close or re-position 970 of its general merchandise and specialty stores in North America, said a Dollars 480m provision relating to the restructuring programme contributed to a third-quarter loss of Dollars 452m, or Dollars 3.43 a share. A year earlier, it posted net income of Dollars 65m, or 50 cents. Federated Department Stores posted net income of Dollars 20.3m, or 16 cents, after taking a one-time charge of Dollars 15m for federal tax changes. If the provision were excluded, earnings would have increased 11.7 per cent to Dollars 35.3m, or 28 cents, against Dollars 31.6m, or 25 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992. For Woolworth, sales declined 4.6 per cent to Dollars 2.38bn. However, the decline largely stemmed from the poor performance of its general merchandise stores, which recorded a 10 per cent sales slump. By contrast, specialty shops showed a modest 1.8 per cent improvement. Sales at Federated were virtually flat at Dollars 1.78bn. The company, which operates Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus and other full-line department stories, said the performance was weaker than expected and blamed it on unusually warm weather this autumn, which depressed apparel sales. Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said reductions in operating expenses had enabled it to counter the effect of weak sales and higher price markdowns. On an operating level, earnings were up 3.6 per cent at Dollars 103m, compared with Dollars 99.5m a year earlier. The announcements by Woolworth as well as Federated were in line with Wall Street's expectations and both stocks advanced modestly in morning trade. By mid-day, Woolworth was up Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 21 and Federated added Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/2.</p>

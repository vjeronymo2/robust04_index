			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Wolfgang </F> Kaden, Stefan Simons, and Olaf Ihlau; place and date not given:  "We Are at a Crossroads"]    [Text] [SPIEGEL] Four months after the historic  Washington Declaration of Principles, the Arab-Israeli peace  process has now reached a decisive stage: Will a breakthrough  be achieved now or will there be a setback that will call  everything into question once again?    [Rabin] My goal is to end the 100-year conflict between Jews  and Palestinians. The first great step forward was achieved in  Washington last September...    [SPIEGEL] ...but nothing has happened with respect to the  basic treaty that was to come into force on 13 December. Why  have you allowed yourself to end up in such a tight spot?    [Rabin] The fact that we could not meet that deadline --  three months after the signing -- in no way means that there has  been a setback. Whoever levels accusations at us about that is  not aware of the pitfalls that were hidden in the agreement.  The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that are under way in  Taba, Oslo, Paris, and Cairo are no longer about principles, but  about details.    [SPIEGEL] So, the details are the problem now.    [Rabin] It is particularly awkward to negotiate something  with the Palestinians. We want a new reality, peaceful  coexistence between two peoples between whom -- for goodness'  sake -- there is no love, but profound distrust. On top of  everything, the two peoples are closely intermingled. That is  why it is exceptionally difficult to implement the basic  agreement. There are a great many issues that have to be  clarified: security, infrastructure, jobs, and the supply of  water and electricity.    [SPIEGEL] And how long should the clarification process  last?    [Rabin] In my opinion, we need another two or three months  really to settle all the details. That is the only way in which  we can achieve our goal. However, I am sure that we will  achieve it.    [SPIEGEL] Many Palestinians feel that you are deliberately  playing for time.    [Rabin] Nothing works without patience. Ultimately, we are  trying to end a conflict that has gone on for 100 years.  Germany and France did not become friends overnight.    [SPIEGEL] So why did you promise to start the withdrawal of  Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho on 13 December? By setting  a schedule did you not put yourself under pressure?    [Rabin] That was undoubtedly a mistake, one that we both  made, and I told that to 'Arafat at our third meeting on 12  December. We should have met much earlier and discussed  everything. 'Arafat suddenly chose to interpret the treaty in a  way that was entirely different from that of his team, and he  did so with respect to all the basic points, such as our  responsibility for border security. 'Arafat suddenly changed his  position by 180 degrees. We could have avoided such  misunderstandings.    [SPIEGEL] When you shook hands with the PLO chief at the  White House, your aversion to doing so was clearly visible.    [Rabin] My feelings have got nothing to with it. I had made  the basic decision of holding negotiations with the PLO.    [SPIEGEL] President Clinton had to give you considerable  help when it came to shaking hands.    [Rabin] We were together with the president for one moment  before the ceremony. At first we did not say anything to each  other, then I said to 'Arafat: It will be difficult to  implement this treaty. 'Arafat replied: Yes, it will be very  difficult.    [SPIEGEL] You have met 'Arafat several times since then: Do  you trust him today?    [Rabin] I would be wary of saying anything publicly about  'Arafat's character in the middle of negotiations. As far as I  am concerned the choice was either we speak to the PLO or we  have to tackle the Islamic extremists in the Hamas Movement. If  Israel wants peace with its neighbors, then it has to deal with  enemies, often mortal enemies. 'Arafat and I are aware of the  responsibility that we have assumed. Ultimately, the results  that we achieve will show what the risk that we have taken was  worth.    [SPIEGEL] You have not gotten much to show for it so far.  Every delay weakens 'Arafat's position and his ability to make  concessions. That cannot be very convenient for you?    [Rabin] It is true that we are behind schedule. However, in  the meantime, the Palestinian opponents of the treaty have  intensified their terror campaign against Israel. It comes as  no surprise that our enthusiasm for the treaty has begun to wane.    [SPIEGEL] That is equally true of the Palestinians, who  suspect that Israel is playing some kind of dishonest game.    [Rabin] Excuse me for having to point something out to you:  There is no democracy in the Arab countries, at least not in the  sense in which there is democracy in Israel and the Western  countries. We have to deal with authoritarian or totalitarian  regimes.    [SPIEGEL] That is precisely that accusation that the  opposition is leveling against you, that you want to conclude an  agreement with politicians of that sort.    [Rabin] I do not expect 'Arafat to have his Palestinians  under control before he has set up a strong security apparatus  of his own in the Gaza.    [SPIEGEL] Why do you not want to make a humanitarian gesture  and release the 12,000 Palestinians that are incarcerated in  Israeli prisons?    [Rabin] I do not believe that the release of the  approximately 9,000 prisoners would be a contribution to overall  security. Israeli support for the peace treaty is declining,  because of the rising number of terrorist attacks.    [SPIEGEL] As you have said, there is 100 years of hatred  and confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians. Does the  population of Israel really desire a reconciliation?    [Rabin] Everyone is talking about peace, but everyone  interprets peace differently. One thing is clear: There will  only be peace if all the parties concerned are prepared to make  painful compromises. Whoever believes that conflict with the  Palestinians can be ended without granting them autonomy will  not achieve peace.    [SPIEGEL] Autonomy is not enough for the Palestinians. It  is the first step toward their own state. Can you imagine such  a state existing alongside Israel?    [Rabin] In the longer term, I can imagine a confederation  composed of the sovereign states of Israel and Jordan and within  that, a Palestinian entity with its own administration, but not  an independent Palestinian state.    [SPIEGEL] What status would Jerusalem -- a capital city for  both Israelis and Palestinians -- have then?    [Rabin] Jerusalem is the capital city of the Jewish state.  It cannot be divided.    [SPIEGEL] It must above all be difficult for the 130,000  Israeli settlers in the occupied territories to give up the goal  of a greater Israel, which includes the biblical lands in  western Jordan and the Gaza Strip.    [Rabin] I personally do not believe in a greater Israel that  would include the occupied territories. That would mean that we  would not only annex western Jordan and the Gaza Strip, but by  including those territories, we would also forcibly place 1.8  million Palestinians under our authority, people who are  different from us in terms of politics, religion, and culture.  Israel would thus become a bi-national state and not the  realization of the 2,000-year-old Jewish dream of a return to  Zion.    [SPIEGEL] Does that mean a return to 1967 borders?    [Rabin] I am opposed to that. We have a right to insist on  changes to borders, especially with regard to security. That  would entail a limited inclusion of other territories, but with  as few Palestinians as possible.    [SPIEGEL] What would happen to the 144 settlements in the  occupied territories then?    [Rabin] We have to distinguish between the settlements that  are important for Israel's security and those settlements that  -- contrary to our will -- were created by the Likud Party for  political reasons. I do not believe that the latter are a  contribution to the security of our country.    [SPIEGEL] They could become a danger. Radical settlers have  announced that they will offer militant resistance vis-a-vis the  Palestinians.    [Rabin] I would ask you not to draw conclusions too hastily.  We will deal with the question when it arises. During the  transitional period of the treaty, the settlements will remain  where they are.    [SPIEGEL] You were a professional soldier and a hero of the  1967 Six-Day War. What has actually turned you into a dove?    [Rabin] I did not become a soldier out of a sense of  vocation, but because of circumstance. I went to agricultural  college and actually wanted to become a hydraulic engineer.  Then World War II broke out. I was unable to study and joined  the Israeli underground army, the Palmach. I was a soldier for  27 years....    [SPIEGEL] .... and made it to the post of chief of the  general staff.    [Rabin] Fortunately, I was head of the general staff during  the most successful war that Israel has waged, the Six-Day War.  During my entire time in the military, I was aware that we need  to be militarily strong to safeguard our security. At the same  time, it was also clear to me that our military power must be  translated into political terms. The Arab-Israeli conflict  should no longer be settled on the battlefield. One should not  just leave wars to the generals, but the search for peace should  also not just be left to politicians.    [SPIEGEL] So, do you want to appear in the history books as  the person who achieved peace?    [Rabin] Believe me, I am not concerned about titles, fame,  and office. I have been almost everything that one can be in  our country: head of the general staff, ambassador in  Washington, defense minister, and prime minister -- I am not  concerned about this position that I am occupying now. What I  am concerned about is achieving security and peace for Israel.  The current regional and international layout of forces  provides a unique opportunity.    [SPIEGEL] Being an old military man, your critics accuse you  of being committed to the peace process not with your heart, but  with your head.    [Rabin] For Israel, peace always means that we have to pay,  usually with territorial concessions. What did we receive in  return? Words, treaties. It is worth noting that such  agreements are not with democratic states, but with  authoritarian regimes. That is why I have to constantly ask  myself: What about our security? With the wars that it waged,  Israel took great risks, and now we must also risk a great deal  for peace.    [SPIEGEL] Are you now counting on peace and  reconciliation, because you believe that Israel's strategic  superiority in the Middle East is being gradually reduced?    [Rabin] Not at all. We have time, but that is not the point  at issue. We are living in a new age. The Cold War is over,  and the Soviet Union has disappeared as a source of disruption  in the Middle East. The United States, which acted resolutely  in the Gulf war, has acted resolutely. That has led some Arab  leaders to think things over. Who knows whether Syria's  President Asad would have opted for the path of peace if he had  still had Moscow's military and economic support.    [SPIEGEL] That almost makes it sound as if Israel now lives  in a world without real enemies.    [Rabin] In the longer term, there are, of course, dangers:  the growing strength of Islamic extremists in almost all Arab  countries and the lunatic ambitions of the regime in Iran that  is behind these movements. Apart from that, Iran and Iraq are  seeking to become nuclear powers by the year 2000.    [SPIEGEL] Why do you trust President al-Asad today? The  Syrian leader is an ally of Iran and still fundamentalists and  terrorists.    [Rabin] Previously, al-Asad sought to keep up with Israel  militarily. He can no longer hope to do that today. Of course,  there always is the danger of a return to the past, and there is  speculation that a new Damascus-Tehran-Baghdad axis will be  formed. I do not think that that will happen. Only one thing is  certain: This year we are standing at a crossroads. The year  1994 will tell us whether the Middle East will be move toward  peace or will be stuck in a stalemate situation.    [SPIEGEL] And stalemate would mean war when the next move is  played?    [Rabin] Perhaps not next year, but possibly in five or seven  years' time.    [SPIEGEL] That is why the Americans are trying to draw the  Syrians into the peace process. Do you feel that you have to  some extent been placed under pressure by U.S. President Clinton?    [Rabin] It is clear that the Americans want Israel to be at  peace with all its Arab neighbors. Washington does not have to  tell me that the key partners in that respect are the Syrians  and the Palestinians. The Palestinians do not constitute a  danger to Israel's existence, but the Syrians do. If we manage  to settle matters with them, to achieve a genuine peace -- as we  did with Egypt -- then we will have created a security zone  around us, a buffer against potential enemies in a war such as  Iran or Iraq.    [SPIEGEL] So, are you ready to return the Golan Heights,  which were captured from Syria in 1967, to achieve peace?    [Rabin] It would not be particularly wise to set out the  course of our current negotiations with Syria at this stage. I  will not say in public that I am ready to pay the highest price.  Both sides are trying to achieve as much as possible for  themselves.    [SPIEGEL] Do you really believe that Asad will be satisfied  with less than Egypt's President Sadat was? He got back the  entire Sinai Peninsula from Israel.    [Rabin] That is a nice question, but I cannot answer it.  New circumstances exist, and those justify a different course  of action on the part of Israel.    [SPIEGEL] Even a partial return of the Golan Heights would  mean that Israeli settlements would have been abandoned.    [Rabin] I would like to say once again that in the current  complex situation, you cannot expect me to give a clear-cut  answer. Our talks with the Syrians have just started up once  again. We are seeking to conduct them as discreetly as  possible, in the same way that we pursued talks with the  Egyptians at one time.    [SPIEGEL] The Camp David peace agreements mean that in 1990  Israeli settlers had to leave the Sinai, which was returned to  Egypt.    [Rabin] I know.    [SPIEGEL] Are you afraid that opponents of the treaty --  fanatical Palestinians or Israeli extremists -- will  nevertheless try to torpedo the peace process with terrorist  attacks?    [Rabin] That could already happen today, while we are still  in charge, or it might not happen until tomorrow, once Jericho  and the Gaza Strip are under PLO control. Then it will  transpire whether Arafat's security forces can ensure law and  order and whether they can prevent the Gaza Strip from becoming  a shelter for terrorists. To my mind, that is the decisive test  of whether Palestinians are really willing to accept peaceful  coexistence and whether they are capable of that.    [SPIEGEL] Prime minister, thank you for talking to us.</p>

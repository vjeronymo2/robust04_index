			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE coffee futures rally after early plunge London coffee futures followed New York prices down and then up again yesterday as speculators continued to call the tune in thin markets. Follow-through selling after an overnight plunge at New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange wiped out what remained of this week's rally in early trading at the London Commodity Exchange. The November delivery position, which had fallen Dollars 75 the previous day, opened at Dollars 3,265 a tonne, Dollars 101 below Wednesday's close, and slipped another Dollars 15 before the selling dried up. By the close it was back up to Dollars 3,340 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 26 down on the day. Traders said it was the withdrawal of sellers rather the appearance of buyers that turned the market round. Colombia exported 5.6m bags (60kg each) of coffee in the first six months of 1994, according to figures from Quintero Hermanos, the company used by the National Coffee Growers Federation to collect statistics, reports Reuters from Bogota. The figure was sharply down from the 7.133m bags exported in the corresponding period of 1993.</p>

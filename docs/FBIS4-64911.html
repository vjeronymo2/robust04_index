			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 10 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe ruled out Tuesday [10 May] the use of military force to  free 11 French aid workers held since last month by Bosnian  Serbs for allegedly smuggling arms to the Bosnian Government.    Juppe, speaking on French radio, said such an intervention  would involve too many risks and added that the diplomatic  channel would bear better results.    He warned, however, that the safety of the 11 detainees from  the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) humanitarian organisation  was the responsibility of authorities in the rump-Yugoslavia and  Bosnian Serbs.    "We are not negotiating," he said. "We demand their  unconditional release. The Serbs must realize that if they  persevere with their defiant attitude toward the international  community, they will pay the price."    The French aid workers have been held since April 8 at  Lukavica, a suburb of Sarajevo, on charges that they were  smuggling arms to the mostly Moslem Bosnian Army. The Serbs say  they intend to try the 11, who face up to 15 years in prison.    Premiere Urgence has denied the arms smuggling charges and  says weapons allegedly found at a Serb checkpoint in one of the  organization's trucks had been planted there by the Serbs  themselves.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Test of strength for life offices MANY OF the UK's insurers had reason to be very relieved when base rates began to fall, suggests the latest survey of life office strength by Money Management, an FT magazine for financial advisers. Had 15 per cent interest rates persisted, the magazine believes many offices might have found their liabilities exceeded their assets. That is a terribly insecure position for a life office. Assessing the strength of a life insurance company is as complex an exercise as it sounds. But the exercise is also worthwhile, as it can help to spot future strong performers. The simplest measure is the free asset ratio. This subtracts total liabilities from total assets, and then divides this by total liabilities. This crude measure can then be adjusted to take account of how much offices have reserved for terminal bonuses, or increased mortality because of AIDS, or other factors. Differences in accounting policy make direct comparisons of ratio from one office to another very dangerous. But the trend for an individual office tells an unmistakable story. Of the 41 companies surveyed, 21 saw their ratios drop in 1991 and five stayed the same, but 15 did manage to rise. This was in spite of the extremely poor year, 1990, when equity markets ended lower than they had started. That delivered a substantial blow to life offices' assets, and their free asset ratios. For example, Scottish Amicable saw a drop from 27 per cent to 9 per cent, and Scottish Widows from 49 per cent to 22 per cent. Norwich Union dropped from 34 per cent to 14 per cent, and dropped still further this year to 11 per cent. The office admitted at the end of last year that it was suffering capital strain, as it decided to withdraw its with-profits bond from general circulation, and also made a substantial switch into fixed interest from equities and property. What does this mean for policyholders? The question of strength goes beyond the basic issue of whether your life office is going to go bust. Such things do happen - the fate befell UK Provident Institution in 1986, only a couple of years after it had been topping some performance tables - but they are rare, and the industry is usually able to patch together some form of rescue. In the case of UKPI, Friends Provident took over the funds, and investors received returns which may not have been the industry leaders they once hoped, but were certainly adequate. Strength is more important because it defines an office's freedom for manoeuvre. The more reserves an office holds, the freer its hand to invest in more speculative investments and, potentially, deliver a greater profit. If its free asset ratio is falling, it may need to bolster its strength by switching to fixed interest. Particularly with indications that the government is now 'going for growth', this could be totally against the best long term aims of the fund managers. Less adventurously, a strong office has more scope just to maintain bonuses during years of poor investment returns, even if it is not going in for aggressive countercyclical fund management. One argument against 'strong' offices is that they are in reality 'mean' offices which hold on to reserves rather than paying them to policyholders. But a look at the highest pay-outs achieved this year suggests that this is a fallacy. In lean periods, the strongest offices become the most generous. Offices with high ratios include Pearl (48 per cent), General Accident (39 per cent), Commercial Union (38 per cent), AXA Equity &amp; Law and Royal London (36 per cent). None of these has a traditional reputation for high endowment pay-outs. However, in the latest Money Management survey of 25-year pay-outs, CU are in first place, with GA third, Royal London fourth and AXA Equity &amp; Law ninth. Pearl, which aims to be competitive over shorter periods, is fourth over 10 years. Other offices, feeling the strain, have felt obliged to cut pay-outs, leaving the stronger offices nearer the top of the pile. As life assurance would appear to be for the risk-averse only in any case, then, the latest guide to life office strength arises as an invaluable tool for any would-be investor.</p>

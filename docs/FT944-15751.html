			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: British Steel Recovery in the steel industry is in full swing. One sign of this is British Steel's decision last week to commit nearly Pounds 100m to building a mini-mill in the US, its biggest investment in the past four years. The group has also successfully pushed through six successive price increases since the beginning of last year. Steel prices may still be significantly below the peak they reached in late 1989, but so great is the operational gearing within the trimmed-down industry that British Steel's profits over the next few years are likely to grow rapidly. Analysts calculate that pre-tax profits, which amounted to Pounds 80m in the year to March, may rise to more than Pounds 1bn by 1998. The dividend could quadruple over the same period. In common with other cyclical stocks, the group's share price has risen well in advance of earnings, more than trebling since its low point in 1992. On previous form, it will also turn down again long before earnings reach their next peak. The question for investors is therefore one of timing  -when to sell. At present, the shares trade at about five times expected 1998 earnings. This is more expensive, relative to the market, than their peak rating during the last cycle. Arguably, the higher valuation would be in order if the European steel industry had sorted out its grievous problems. But the capacity cuts pledged by manufacturers may be shelved until the next downturn. This suggests that British Steel's shares are near the limits of their outperformance, even if the group is set to report buoyant profits for years to come.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIDENTIFIED FLYING HYPOTHESIS;  </P> <P> OUT THERE THE GOVERNMENT'S SECRET QUEST FOR EXTRATERRESTRIALS BY HOWARD BLUM  (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 288 PP.)  </P> <P> "This is a true story," former New York Times reporter Howard Blum assures his  readers in the opening page of this book. "I verified every name, every  incident, date and conversation."  </P> <P> The publisher's blurb on the review copy characterizes the book as a "startling  expose that reads with the dramatic narrative drive of a novel but . . . it is  absolutely true!"  </P> <P> The cornerstone of Blum's book is his claim that in early 1987, the Pentagon's  Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) secretly launched a new investigation into  UFOs -- unidentified flying objects. Approximately 18 years earlier, the  Pentagon had announced it was closing down the U.S. Air Force's investigatory  effort after two decades because it had found no evidence that any UFOs were  either extraterrestrial or Soviet craft.  </P> <P> Blum, whose earlier books include one on the Walker spy family, claims that the  Pentagon's new interest in UFOs was triggered by an extraordinary incident that  occurred shortly before Christmas, 1986. It allegedly involved the Navy Space  Surveillance System (NSSS), a key element in the global Space Surveillance  Network operated by the U.S. Space Command.  </P> <P> The NSSS is an "electronic fence" that stretches across our Southern states  from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It was built in the late 1950s,  following the launch of the first Soviet satellites, to enable Washington to  maintain a running inventory of all objects in space -- both satellites and  space debris -- that pass over the United States.  </P> <P> As Blum describes the incident, Navy Cmdr. Sheila Mondran was on duty in Space  Command's underground command center, deep inside Cheyenne Mountain near  Colorado Springs, when a computer display showed a strange, uncatalogued space  object passing through the electronic fence. According to Blum, the object was  performing "crash dives followed by sudden climbs at astonishing speeds."  </P> <P> Had Blum checked, he would have discovered that the Navy's electronic fence  could not possibly have detected such maneuvers -- as I earlier learned when I  wrote a technical article on the system. Furthermore, the system does not  provide a "real-time" display at Space Command's center, which Blum claims  Mondran was viewing.  </P> <P> Blum's dramatic scenario of events alleged to have triggered the Pentagon's  renewed interest in UFOs is riddled with errors. For example, he reports that  Cmdr. Mondran, after parking her car outside Cheyenne Mountain, rode a military  bus inside and "took a polished steel elevator . . . descending almost 2500  ft." There is no such elevator -- as I know from my several visits to the  underground center. The only elevator is a three-story freight elevator.  </P> <P> The military bus would have delivered Cmdr. Mondran to the "ground floor" of  the command center inside Cheyenne Mountain. She would have walked up one  flight of stairs to the Space Defense Center, which is on the second floor, not  the third floor as Blum reports. (Blum claims he called Space Command to ask  which floor it was on, as an example of his meticulous research.)  </P> <P> In response to my request to Space Command's public-affairs office, Maj. Tom  Niemann told me he could find no record that a Cmdr. Sheila Mondran had been  stationed there. When he checked with the Navy, Niemann told me, they could not  find any record of an officer named Sheila Mondran.  </P> <P> Blum describes experiments allegedly conducted by the DIA using "remote  viewers" ("psychics") who, he claims, demonstrated the ability to "see," and  thus pinpoint, the location of submerged Soviet and U.S. submarines. When the  DIA learned of the extraordinary UFO incident, Blum claims, it brought in three  psychics to "see" retroactively what the object looked like when it penetrated  the electronic fence 48 hours earlier.  </P> <P> All three of the psychics drew sketches of "rounded, wingless aircraft," Blum  tells his readers. Armed with these sketches of flying saucers, Army Col.  Harold E. Phillips, a DIA intelligence analyst with a long-time interest in  UFOs, according to Blum, managed to convince his agency that "the time had at  last come to convene a top-secret working group to investigate the possibility  that extraterrestrials were making contact with this planet."  </P> <P> Although Blum claims to have talked briefly with Col. Phillips by telephone,  the only officer with that name who shows up in Army records is a lieutenant  colonel (not a full colonel), and he retired three years before the purported  UFO group was formed. Pentagon telephone directories for 1987-88 show an "H. E.  Phillips," but he is a Navy commander, not an Army colonel. To avoid any  possibility of Pentagon "disinformation," I checked the University of Southern  Illinois, in Carbondale, from which Blum says Phillips graduated with a degree  in engineering. The university could not find any record of a Harold E.  Phillips.  </P> <P> According to Blum, the most vexing problem that confronted Phillips, as chief  of the UFO Working Group, was to find a "highly promising" UFO report for the  panel to investigate. Blum writes: "For a time, the colonel was convinced he  had found his investigative target in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The sightings in  this Southern town were shared by a variety of witnesses, and there was even a  blurred film of what many responsible observers swore was a UFO. It turned out  the Air Force was testing a classified low-flying surveillance plane in the  area."  </P> <P> This explanation is seriously flawed. The object that appeared on the Polaroid  prints of Floridian Ed Walters was saucer-shaped with illuminated portholes --  hardly an appropriate design for a "low-flying surveillance plane." This  explanation also is ruled out if one accepts Walters' claim that he saw  four-foot-high creatures being "beamed-down" from the UFO.  </P> <P> There was slight blurring of the background in a few of Walters' photos, due to  camera motion during the one-second time-exposure used for the night photos,  but the image of the UFO was not blurred. This logically prompted even some  long-time "UFO believers" to conclude that the photos were hoax  double-exposures made with a small model. Recently, a small model flying saucer  similar to the UFO in the Walters photos was discovered hidden in the attic of  the house in which he lived when he took his UFO photos.  </P> <P> Next, according to Blum, Col. Phillips' interest focused on reports of night  sightings of a giant UFO reported by many observers in Hudson Valley  communities north of New York City. "But then, just when Col. Phillips was on  the verge of recommending that the Working Group dispatch a photographic team"  to the area, according to Blum, he received a newspaper report that the giant  UFO was nothing more than a group of small-aircraft pilots engaged in a prank.  More than three years earlier, this hoax had been reported by Discover magazine  in the cover story of its November, 1984, issue.  </P> <P> Phillips finally discovered a "perfect candidate" for the UFO Working Group to  investigate: Elmwood, a small town in central Wisconsin. Elmwood's citizens  often report seeing UFOs, and its mayor had announced plans to build a $50  million UFO landing site. Blum claims Phillips sent two covert agents to  Elmwood, which prompted Blum's own visit. He arrived in time for Elmwood's  annual "UFO Days" festival and devoted about one-sixth of his book to his  interviews with local citizens.  </P> <P> Eventually, writes Blum, Col. Phillips learned of the "Top Secret MJ-12  papers," made public by three UFOlogists in the spring of 1987, which claim  that the U.S. government recovered a crashed saucer and several  extraterrestrial bodies about 40 years earlier. If the MJ-12 claims were true,  clearly somebody forgot to brief the top DIA officials who had approved  creation of the UFO Working Group. Blum provides an even-handed pro/con  treatment, indicating he himself is unsure whether they are authentic.  </P> <P> I appear in Blum's book as the person whose research indicates that the MJ-12  papers are counterfeit. Blum offers a not-unflattering summary of my career as  a technical journalist and skeptical UFO investigator. I was rather surprised  at his reference to my "jaunty, pencil-thin figure," because we never have met  and I have been 10 pounds overweight for 30 years. (We did talk by telephone on  several occasions.) I counted 24 other factual errors in the five pages in  which Blum highlights my career.  </P> <P> During my Jan. 20, 1989, telephone conversation with Blum, he admitted: "All I  have now is a nice weird story and you can poke a thousand holes in it." That  aptly summarizes the tale he tells in "Out There," which could more accurately  be titled "Spaced Out."  </P></p>

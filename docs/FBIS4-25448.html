			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by correspondent Meng Xian (1322 6007 1344): </F> "China's Unmanned Aircraft Research and Development at World  Level"]    [Text] Xian -- China's research and development on small  unmanned aircraft has reached world standards after more than 30  years of effort.    This reporter learned a few days ago from the Xian Unmanned  Aircraft Development Center that the B-7 pilotless plane  researched and developed by the center had passed the  examination of a ministerial-level design and model inspection  authority.    The plane is of an advanced small piston-engine type  weighing  90 kg, with a maximum speed of 100 m a second and an elevation  range of over 5,000 m; the range of remote control exceeds 40 km  and the cruising range is 60 minutes. The plane is equipped  with computerized electronic systems, integrated circuit wiring,  digitized command codes, integrated module-scanning, an  "automated return-flight aviation system," a 360- degree  directional setting capability, and a car-mounted capability  while it is on the ground. The aircraft technology that went in  the making of the unmanned plane has reached the advanced  standard of other similar international plane products.    In 1958, the Xibei University of Industry successfully  test-flew No "04" unmanned plane, opening a new era in our  country's unmanned aircraft development.    The B-1 target drone successfully researched and developed  by  the university on the basis of its experience in  remote-controlled plane models has gone into factory production.  A total of more than 6,000 of the B-2 target drones that came  out in 1971 have been produced, many of them exported to  countries in Southern Asia, Africa, and South America.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NHL;  </P> <P> MAKAROV'S SUCCESS STIRS DEBATE: CAN AN OLD FLAME BE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR?  </P> <P> The dictionary defines rookie as a novice.  </P> <P> In sports, a rookie has always been defined as a first-year player. But not  necessarily this season in the NHL.  </P> <P> There, the term is being redefined in sometimes furious debates that have  spread over two countries.  </P> <P> At the center of the controversy is Sergei Makarov, right wing of the Calgary  Flames.  </P> <P> His numbers -- 22 goals and 58 assists for a total of 80 points in 76 games --  make him the leading candidate for the Calder Trophy, annually awarded to the  league's top rookie. The winner is selected by the Professional Hockey Writers  Assn.  </P> <P> Makarov's closest pursuer is Mike Modano of the Minnesota North Stars with 73  points. Darren Turcotte of the New York Rangers leads all rookies with 31 goals  but has only 63 points. Other contenders are Mark Recchi of the Pittsburgh  Penguins, with 30 goals and 65 points, and Jeremy Roenick of the Chicago  Blackhawks, with 63 points.  </P> <P> But those numbers are not the issue here. The only relevant number seems to be  31.  </P> <P> That's Makarov's age.  </P> <P> He is a veteran of more than a decade with one of the world's top hockey units,  the Soviet Army team.  </P> <P> Makarov is the most successful of the eight Soviet players who have joined the  NHL in the last year.  </P> <P> After playing two seasons with his hometown club, Tracktor Chelyabinsk, Makarov  spent 11 seasons with the Central Red Army team. Each of those years, his club  won the Soviet National League title, and he made the all-star team. He won the  league scoring title nine of the last 10 seasons.  </P> <P> Makarov has also played in three Winter Olympics and nine World Championships.  </P> <P> He appeared in 275 games for the Soviets, scoring 323 points on 173 goals and  150 assists.  </P> <P> Impressive numbers? Too impressive for many reporters and coaches around the  league who insist Makarov shouldn't qualify for consideration as a rookie.  </P> <P> Too old and too experienced, they say. It's not fair to the true rookies.  </P> <P> Since when has age been a criterion for rookies in any league?  </P> <P> There are cases like the Kings' backup goalie, Ron Scott. At 29, he is finally  getting a chance to play after spending six years wasting away in the New York  Rangers' organization. Should someone be penalized because no team recognized  his talent earlier?  </P> <P> The other argument is the experience factor. Because Makarov has competed at  the top level of amateur hockey, that somehow disqualifies him from being  considered a novice pro.  </P> <P> By that reasoning, David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, considered a lock  to be NBA rookie of the year, should be denied that award because he competed  on the U.S. Olympic team, the top level of amateur basketball competition for  this country.  </P> <P> According to league rules, the Calder Trophy is to be awarded "to the player  selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the  National Hockey League."  </P> <P> Clear and simple.  </P> <P> To set up additional restrictions handicaps not only Makarov, but countless  others in the future.  </P> <P> Is there a way to San Jose? The hockey situations in Minnesota and San Jose  seem on a collision course.  </P> <P> In Minnesota, owners George and Gordon Gund have threatened to move their North  Stars to the Bay Area.  </P> <P> In San Jose, former Hartford Whaler owner and WHA President Howard Baldwin is  negotiating to land an expansion franchise for that city.  </P> <P> "We are virtually on the edge," he said in describing his bid to get a lease on  the $100-million arena planned for San Jose.  </P> <P> The next step would be to apply to the league for an expansion franchise. That  would appear to be a formality since most NHL owners consider another West  Coast team a must.  </P> <P> But what about the North Stars? The Bay Area cannot support two hockey clubs.  </P> <P> The most logical thing would be for the Gunds to sell their team to a Minnesota  group and for Baldwin to get his San Jose expansion team.  </P> <P> But here's a new scenario: Baldwin buys the North Stars, keeps them in  Minnesota, and the Gunds get the expansion team.  </P> <P> Crazy? Baldwin, who arrived in Minnesota Tuesday, wouldn't rule it out. "We're  trying to figure out a solution," he said. "But let me say that any solution  that does not include San Jose is unacceptable. I have made a commitment to San  Jose and I intend to keep it."  </P> <P> Baldwin already has stated a willingness to meet the NHL's asking price of $50  million for an expansion team. If the Gunds moved to the Bay Area, would the  league be out that money?  </P> <P> "If they are going to transfer," King owner Bruce McNall said, "in my mind, we  should still get the amount we would have normally got ($50 million). Why would  the league take less?"  </P> <P> The Gunds have no intention of paying the league $50 million to go to the Bay  Area. If they insist on moving rather than selling, the league could fight it  in court.  </P> <P> Or the NHL could award the expansion team to Minnesota, perhaps with Baldwin  heading the group, and get the $50 million that way.  </P> <P> To Baldwin, it's simple.  </P> <P> "I just don't feel you move franchises around like you move pieces of luggage."  </P></p>

The annual meeting reviewed the work of the committee last  year and discussed tasks of this year.    Chairman Jesus Montane Oropesa in his speech said that last  year the U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries  viciously schemed to stifle Korea and Cuba which are defending  socialism, but the two parties, governments and peoples  achieved great victories by firmly uniting to smash the enemy's  moves at every step.    The great leader comrade President Kim Il-song received the  outgoing Cuban Ambassador to the DPRK Juan Jose Leon Vega, and  gave him precious teachings and showed deep solicitude, he said,  and pointed out: This is an expression of deep trust and love  for the party, the government and the people of Cuba.    The friendly and cooperative relations between the two  countries are developing on the basis of the special intimacy  between the great leader comrade President Kim Il-song and  Supreme Commander Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, he noted, and  stressed: The Cuban people would extend invariable support and  solidarity to the Korean people in their efforts for the  reunification of the country.</p>

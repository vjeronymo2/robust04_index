			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ralu Filip report on news conference by Virgil Magureanu, </F> director of the Romanian Intelligence Service; in Bucharest on  29 March: "In the Past, the KGB Coopted Many Romanian  Politicians"]    [Text] In my report on the previous news conference of  Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian Intelligence Service  [SRI], I noted his desire to give a new image to the institution  that he heads, one that should definitely distinguish it from  what the Securitate was and meant for the majority of the  Romanians. One cannot say that Magureanu's efforts in this  respect are groundless, if we think of the immediate past and  the overall context of suspicion in which the SRI was created  and is now carrying out its activity. Therefore, on a scale of  priorities, the problem of its public image is the SRI's number  one problem, as Magureanu confirmed, in a way, at his latest  news conference.    "I can assure you that there has been a positive change in  the image of our institution after the re-election of its  director and the confirmation vote in Parliament. First of all,  the attacks against the SRI, according to the old formula that  it was the successor of the old Securitate, have ceased, if not  totally, at least to a large extent. Moreover, Magureanu  believes that the SRI's image, as reflected in the national mass  media, will further improve in the coming months. "I would like  to assure you that we have done and will continue to do all we  can to make this image more credible and acceptable to the  Romanian public."    Tackling the subject of changes made in the territorial and  central leaderships, Magureanu said that "this is the third  stage of the changes." The first took place at the time of the  SRI's creation, when "we took over only a third of the old  Securitate." The second stage was completed in 1991, when some  25-30 percent of the SRI personnel was laid off, since their  services were no longer needed. The third stage began after the  vote in Parliament, that is after Magureanu's confirmation as  SRI director. "We are not making any purges. It is just that  25 percent of the territorial and central command structures  have been replaced."    Asked why General Gheorghe Diaconescu, the former  counterintelligence chief, was dismissed, Magureanu tersely said  that he was dismissed "mainly for professional reasons," without  giving any concrete details. Similarly, Magureanu denied the  existence of compromising files about himself. "If anyone has  any proof against me, he should not hesitate to bring it up. I  am keenly waiting to see any files put together against me."    Regarding the case of General Cristea [Major General Dumitru  Cristea, the rector of the Higher Institute for Information  Studies and deputy SRI director, accused of having an affair  with a former female student], the SRI director said: "I took  no decision in connection with General Cristea's departure from  our structures." Calling him "a friend and colleague,"  Magureanu said the following in connection with the allegations  of immorality against his deputy: "It may all be nothing but  someone's concoction against someone else."    Asked about the Pancea case [Lieutenant General Marin  Pancea,  former secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, accused of  espionage], the SRI head said that "there is no proof that  General Pancea has worked against Romania during his posting  abroad." Similarly, the SRI has no proof that General Pancea  would have spied for the KGB.    Referring to certain documents and articles in the magazine  ROMANIA MARE, Magureanu said that "someone is fabricating lots  of material in our name. After the situation got out of  control, everybody nonchalantly put the blame on the SRI. This  is not true. We will make public the names of the people who  leaked information and the way that the information reached the  press, since their deeds harmed our institution." However, some  documents are indicative of "yet unidentified leaks," which  require further SRI internal investigations.    Answering the representative of Russian Television,  Magureanu  said that the KGB has pursued intensive activity in Romania by  also coopting several politicians, which was also confirmed  during his visit to Moscow. He said that these people are still  under the scrutiny of the SRI.    In Magureanu's opinion, two of the dangers threatening  Romania are the mafia-type structures operating in Russia and  the states that used to make up the Soviet Union (structures  which are involved in organized crime) and the Italian Mafia,  which is laundering dirty money in Romania.</p>

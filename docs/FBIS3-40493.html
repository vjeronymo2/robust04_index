They plan to make leading-edge companies a core  component of local area businesses. Led by prefectural public  research institutions, a technical study will be conducted by  uniting local manufacturing businesses, national research  organizations, and universities. It was realized that local  public research institutions, which play a key role in the  technical support of local businesses, need to build a network  in order to help effectively at the local level. In 1994,  twenty-three prefectural institutions will participate in this  project. They are requesting an estimated &yen;72.5 million.    The name of the organization is ``Foundation for the  Formation of Local Area Technical Networks.'' At a concrete  level, each prefecture has its own vision for the promotion of  industrial growth. An ``Area Technical Network Committee'' will  be established at each prefectural level. Topics to be studied  will be determined from an educational point of view. The focus  will be on future technical fields important for small  businesses. At the same time the national manufacturing policy  will be adjusted to conform with the study.    Furthermore, led by this committee, about five or so  technical seminars will be held. These seminars will concentrate  on the actual problems faced by local businesses. The technical  power of the national level research institutions and public  universities located in each prefecture will be harnessed.  Exchange of ideas at local public institutions will take place,  and the needs of local area businesses will be grasped. Solving  technical problems and transferring the results to the  businesses is also planned.    Through network exchange, the results of study will be  transferred to businesses, and education of area businesses,  which is the core of local vitalization, will occur, and  stimulate the local economy. Also the activities of the study  group conducted at a prefectural level will be integrated. MITI  plans to support the education of competitive business ventures  as a vital and fundamental activity in 1994, and the formation  of area technical networks this time has the implication of  active support from MITI.</p>

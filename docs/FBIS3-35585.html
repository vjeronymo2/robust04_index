On Tuesday [25 January] he addressed the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence where, among other things, he named  four areas of Russian problems under close surveillance by U.S.  espionage departments.    First of all, intelligence will continue to provide American  politicians with "important, and sometimes unique political and  economic analytical materials warning of the potential dangers  which may lie in store for Russia in future." What is more, the  spy chief even promised to help the legislators get to grips  with all aspects of the Russian economy. Personally, I envy  him: It takes a very lucid mind to trace the logic in our  hopelessly confused system!    Second, American intelligence intends to observe closely  "the  location and condition of Russia's 27,000 nuclear warheads" for  the next 10 years at least. In particular, the CIA is fearful  that these items, which are best "handled with care," may prove  irresistible to the mafia and third countries striving to  acquire nuclear materials, or that they may become dangerous in  the hands of a demoralized, morally depressed Russian military.    It is interesting that the American spies listed among their  priorities activities to monitor the condition of Russia's  "general purpose" Armed Forces. Director Woolsey, it seems, is  dismayed that "the military in Russia are not protected against  the uncertainties and problems connected with the economic,  political, and social transformation of the country." Of  course, it is not a question of oversentimentality on the part  of colleagues from the power structures, although it is very  probable that even American spies find it hard to believe their  eyes when they delve into the problems of our homeless,  vulnerable, morally violated "tough guys" -- from impudently  arrested generals to defenseless border guards.    The fourth aspect is Russia's relations with its neighbors,  the new independent states. According to the intelligence  services, a crisis can be expected in any one of these spots.    ...Indeed, there are very few savings to be made on Russia.</p>

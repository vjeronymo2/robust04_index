			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN REWARDS FRIENDS AND PUNISHES HIS FOES;  </P> <P> NO REPUBLICAN, DISSIDENT DEMOCRAT GETS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, rewarding his friends and punishing his foes,  unveiled his committee assignments for the new legislative session on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> No Republican nor any member of the dissident Democratic "Gang of Five" was  named by the San Francisco liberal to chair any of the 24 committees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOP Leader Not Surprised  </P> <P> Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra said he was neither  surprised nor disappointed by Brown's choices of committee chairmen. Pointing  out that all of the 24 standing committees have solid Democratic majorities, he  said, "I can't imagine why a Republican would want to be chairman."  </P> <P> A GOP source said the Speaker did not automatically accept a list of preferred  committee assignments presented to him by Johnson, as he had previously with  lists submitted by former GOP Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale. Nolan, who had a  comfortable relationship with Brown, resigned his leadership post under fire in  November in response to the continuing FBI investigation of political  corruption that has included him as one of the targets.  </P> <P> Actually, several of the members of the "Gang of Five" -- who last year tried  to topple Brown from the speakership -- did relatively well in their new  committee assignments.  </P> <P> For example, Assemblyman Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) became a member of the Public  Safety Committee. This will give him a visible forum to push for passage of  law-and-order bills, one of his greatest interests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speakership Fight  </P> <P> Another member of the rebel group, Assemblyman Gerald R. Eaves (D-Rialto), got  a seat on the Governmental Organization Committee.  </P> <P> Last year, Brown stripped all five gang members from prestigious committee  slots when the speakership fight was running hot. But he later returned some of  them to less important positions.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) was named as new chairman of the Public  Safety Committee, replacing former Assemblyman Larry Stirling (R-San Diego),  who moved to the Senate.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) was named to head the Health Committee to  replace the late Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood), who died of cancer  last October.  </P> <P> Brown abolished two committees: Veterans Affairs and International Trade and  Intergovernmental Relations. They were downgraded to subcommittees because  neither panel considered many bills, Brown said.  </P> <P> The Speaker earlier had said he would revise the membership of the powerful  Finance and Insurance Committee by removing some members he perceived to be too  responsive to the wishes of the insurance industry.  </P> <P> Removed from the committee were GOP Leader Johnson; Marian W. La Follette  (R-Northridge); Phillip D. Wyman (R-Tehachapi); Steve Clute (D-Riverside) and  Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles). Sen. Stirling also was a member last session.  They were replaced by former GOP Leader Nolan, Charles Bader (R-Pomona); Stan  Statham (R-Oakland); Bob Epple (D-Norwalk); Richard E. Floyd (D-Hawthorne) and  Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- The chairman of the Human Rights  Association (IHD), Akin Birdal, speaking after a visit to the  camps which are home to the Turkish Kurds who have migrated to  Iraq, stated that the wretched war raging in the Southeast was  to blame for the migration which was taking place.    "The Southeast is the region of Turkey where most human  rights violations occur. Hundreds of mystery murders have been  committed in this region and their number is continuing to grow.  We receive reports of incidents of torture every day. IHD  officials who have been conducting activities in the region are  no longer able to do so because of the pressure they face. We  no longer have the opportunity to investigate incidents where  they occur. According to our findings, migration has taken  place because of state oppression and the burning down of  villages have been either burnt down or abandoned. The  inhabitants of these villages have either emigrated to interior  regions or to northern Iraq. Another cause of the migration is  the state's approach to these people. People are given three  choices: to become village guards, to take to the mountains, or  to emigrate. People have chosen the third alternative.  Approximately two million people have emigrated to the interior  regions of Turkey. Sparks of hatred are carried with each wave  of migrants, not the desire for peace.    These sparks might start off a fire. This would be a  disaster for Turkey. I believe the solution lies in democracy  and brotherhood. I observed during my visit that everybody  wished to live as equals in brotherhood and peace," Birdal told  the TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS], commenting on the current violence  in the Southeast.    Birdal later commented on the official claims that PKK  (Workers Party of Kurdistan) oppression had led to migration,  saying: "You cannot base policies on lies. There is a great  discrepancy between official claims and what the hundreds of  people that we have talked to have said. They are the  witnesses. We called on deputies to put together a delegation  to inspect the region. No one answered our call. The state has  to protect its citizens even if the PKK has forced them to  migrate. We will oppose all anti-democratic policies. We do  not want any tears or any blood shed. These incidents have to  end. We have to give our children a democratic world in which  they can live like humans."</p>

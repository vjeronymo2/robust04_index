			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Tobacco boost for PSBR The public sector borrowing requirement in December was Pounds 2.1bn, a much lower figure than the Pounds 5bn that analysts expected. One-off factors seem to have accounted for much of the discrepancy, however, and the Treasury has not reduced its Pounds 49.8bn deficit forecast for the 1993-94 financial year. Excise receipts from tobacco sales were Pounds 1.3bn higher than in December 1992 as wholesalers stocked up on cigarettes before the November 30 Budget, which increased tobacco duties. While the sales were recorded in November, the revenue only flowed through to the government in December. This surge translates into 900m packets of 20 cigarettes, or about 16 packets for every adult and child in the country. The central government deficit was Pounds 3bn in December, up from Pounds 2.6bn in December 1992, but was offset by debt repayments by local authorities and public corporations. Local authorities repaid Pounds 500m of debt, the first time they had made a December debt repayment since 1982. The Treasury and Central Statistical Office indicated the repayment may be related to the temporary change in the rules for capital receipts made by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, in his 1992 autumn statement. The temporary rules allow local authorities to spend the 1993 receipts from the proceeds of the sale of council houses and other items. It appears that many authorities have had higher 1993 receipts as a result of the policy. The local authorities do not have to spend the money immediately, however. Public corporations also repaid Pounds 400m of debt in December, compared with a Pounds 100m increase in debt in the same month in 1992. Total cash outlays were Pounds 22.3bn in December and Pounds 188.8bn for the first nine months of the 1993-94 financial year, compared with Pounds 179.8bn in the same period of 1992-93. The running total for the PSBR in the current financial year is Pounds 32bn, compared with Pounds 25.3bn for the same period in 1992-93.</p>

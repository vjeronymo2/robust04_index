			<p>BFN     [Text] The place in Berlin where North Korean Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam appeared two days ago and held a news  conference is an organization called Office for the Protection  of North Korean Interests. Since North Korea has not  established diplomatic relations with Germany, it has this  mission, instead of an embassy, under the pretext of protecting  its national interests. However, this, in fact, is a base of  secret intelligence operations, according to a report.  Correspondent Yi Myong-ku reports from Berlin.    [Yi Myong-ku] The North Korean Office for the Protection of  National Interests occupies part of the former North Korean  Embassy in the former East Germany. The German intelligence  agency assumes that this is a base of the North Korean secret  intelligence agency, and that North Korean officials are using  this place to procure North Korea's necessities of life and  foreign currency, newspaper DER TAGESSPIEGEL recently reported.    North Korea also obtains military technology through this  interest mission and buys technologically complex machinery and  equipment and sends them to North Korea via diplomatic pouch.  At one time, they also purchased helicopter parts, automatic  firearms, and ammunition, said DER TAGESSPIEGEL.    For the transport of these goods, North Korea uses a Korean  civil airliner which flies to Berlin, the only place the  airliner flies in the West. An official from the German Customs  says he often receives information that the North Korean  airliner, with only 30 passengers occupying its 165 seats, is  loaded with profit-making goods, including narcotics and  hallucinogenic drugs.</p>

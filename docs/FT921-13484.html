			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / GEC-Marconi wins Pounds 1.5bn warplane deal A CONSORTIUM led by GEC-Marconi has clinched a deal to make electronic warfare equipment worth an estimated Pounds 1.5bn for the European Fighter Aircraft if the jet goes into production. The initial contract for a combination of systems to detect, jam and decoy enemy missiles will be worth about Pounds 200m, with GEC-Marconi obtaining about half. The decision about the equipment for the warplane project, in which the UK has a 33 per cent stake, was announced in the Commons yesterday. Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, said the work would lead to creation of 500 UK jobs. GEC-Marconi said only that the contract would lead to some extra employment. The work will be mainly at Stanmore, north London, and Portsmouth. Earlier this month GEC said it would shed 750 jobs, including 150 at its defence communications division at Chelmsford, Essex. Mr Clark reaffirmed the UK's strong commitment to the four-nation fighter project, due this year to complete its Pounds 8bn development phase. A decision about numbers of aircraft and timing is due this year. The electronic warfare system was the last main piece of equipment for the aircraft still awaiting a decision. The UK, Italy and Spain are going ahead with the system, while Germany announced in October it would investigate options for cheaper equipment. GEC-Marconi's partners in the consortium, known as Eurodass, are Elettronica of Italy and Inisel of Spain. The decision on the electronic warfare system has taken about three years, although the GEC-led consortium was the only one to put forward a comprehensive proposal. BAe setback, Page 20</p>

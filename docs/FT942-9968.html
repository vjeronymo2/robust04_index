			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Germans curb foreign workers A crackdown on illegal workers and tax evasion in the German construction industry found that almost 25 per cent of contractors were operating illegally. Raids by almost 3,000 police and customs officers in late April found that foreign workers were paid a fraction of German wages. In all, 20,000 employers and workers - including some in catering and transport - were questioned in the biggest action of its kind so far, according to the German finance ministry. The raids were launched after complaints from trade unions and employers' organisations about low-paid foreign workers. Employers can be fined up to DM100,000 (Pounds 40,140) for using illegal workers and over 120 have been taken to court, the ministry said. An Irish construction worker in Bonn said foreign workers were badly treated by middlemen who often disappear with their earnings. The middlemen receive about DM55 an hour for each worker they supply but the workers see only DM30 in the best cases.</p>

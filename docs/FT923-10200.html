			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Yorkshire deal YORKSHIRE Building Society, the 12th largest in the UK with assets of Pounds 4.18bn, is to take over Haywards Heath Building Society. Haywards Heath, which has five branches and assets of Pounds 125m, is expected to incur a loss this year after provisions against loan losses on self-build housing schemes. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 104,000. Yorkshire outbid Skipton Building Society to secure the takeover.</p>

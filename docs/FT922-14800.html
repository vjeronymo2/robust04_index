			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Reshuffle as Tapie turns to politics MR Bernard Tapie, France's new minister for cities, yesterday put his two closest business associates in charge of his two main companies, to free himself to concentrate on his political duties. Mr Tapie, who was nominated to the French government on Thursday night, said he would continue to control Adidas, the German sports shoe maker he bought two years ago. However, he said he would hand over his functions there to Mrs Gilberte Beaux, the former banker who joined the French group during the acquisition. At the same time, he promoted Mr Elie Fellous, finance director of the Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF) holding group since 1998, to become BTF's president. Mrs Beaux, a former business associate of James Goldsmith, has handled Mr Tapie's relations with French banks and represented him on the Adidas board. The move comes a day after Mr Rene Jaggi, Adidas's chief executive, said he would leave at the end of this year, possibly for the top job at Hugo Boss, the men's fashion group. Mr Fellous' first task will be to handle the asset disposals to fund the final FFr726m (Dollars 129.6m) debt repayment which BTF must make by next August, on the borrowings it incurred for the FFr1.6bn Adidas acquisition. BTF sold La Vie Claire, the health foods group for an undisclosed sum in February and is understood to want to sell Teston and Terraillon, the separately-quoted makers of weighing machines. Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, yesterday reported a successful public issue of 20.8 per cent of its shares, writes Philip Rawstorne.</p>

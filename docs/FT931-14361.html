			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Water companies The water companies' response to Ofwat on how the 1994 regulatory review should be conducted unsettled the market. Recent performance of the sector suggests investors are looking for reasons to switch into more cyclical stocks. But the document is little more than a gentle reminder that the industry's price limits in the second half of the decade are still undecided. Like other recent public exchanges with Ian Byatt, the tone is gentlemanly compared with the bluster between other utilities and regulators. It is hardly surprising the industry would prefer its capital base measured on the complex basis set by government at privatisation. If Mr Byatt opts to take market capitalisation instead, as he is minded to do, the companies' current rate of return on capital would look embarrassingly high - perhaps 11 per cent. Under the original government formula the rate of return would look more modest. The industry is right to point out the flaw in valuing on the basis of market capitalisation. That figure itself would adjust quickly to changes in expectation of what the regulator would allow. The industry is equally right that huge capital investment has to be financed. Mr Byatt may be tempted, for example, to reduce the companies' rate of return by restricting profits growth while they press ahead with capital investment. That would mean sharply higher gearing. Mr Byatt would doubtless argue that his presence would reassure potential lenders. Given the short track record of the privatised utilities, banks and bond market investors may be less certain.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar moves deeper into red CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, suffered a second-quarter loss of Dollars 53m, or 52 cents per share. The group was hit by a drop in sales and the effects of a prolonged strike. The poor results for the period ending June 30 were the company's sixth consecutive quarterly loss. In the same period last year, it lost Dollars 17m, or 16 cents per share. Total sales fell to Dollars 2.6bn, a drop of Dollars 91m, or 3 per cent, from last year. Slightly higher prices were only able to partly offset a 9 per cent decline in sales volume. Non-US sales plummeted 13 per cent and the bulk of the fall was in recession-hit Europe. The company said that the five-month strike by 12,600 members of the United Auto Workers Union had resulted in many sales being delayed beyond the second quarter. In addition, when workers returned in April after their strike was broken, there were 'some inefficiencies' as production restarted, according to Mr Len Kuchan, company treasurer. The UAW, which is still negotiating a contract agreement with the company, is waging its battle with management by encouraging members to do no more than required on their jobs. Before the strike, Caterpillar workers had frequently participated in co-operation schemes to improve production and cut costs. For the first six months, losses were Dollars 185m, or Dollars 1.83 per share, compared with losses of Dollars 49m, or 48 cents per share, last year. Sales and revenues were Dollars 4.61bn, Dollars 582m lower than the same period last year. But the company believes it can return to profitability during the second half. While markets in Europe and Japan are very weak, it said that mild economic growth in North America will help sales and that sales delayed by the strike will be completed. In addition, the company said it expected to raise prices 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent on parts and machinery, respectively. Price rises, however, had to be implemented 'very gingerly, very cautiously,' said Mr Kuchan, because 'markets are still weak'. Europe is the company's main concern regarding its foreign sales, which represented just 54 per cent of total sales during the second quarter, compared with 59 per cent a year ago. 'We don't know when (European) markets will come back,' Mr Kuchan said. Brazilian operations also continue to be unprofitable because of economic conditions in that country. Redundancy programmes to reduce its European workforce were being implemented and the company said that it still intended to proceed with an overall reduction in US jobs by some 1,300. That was the number it discovered that could be pared from its US workforce during the strike. It said that it is making the cuts through attrition. Caterpillar's new joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to design, produce and distribute lift trucks is also absorbing some excess management employees. The joint venture, known as Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift, began operations July 1. It is 80 per cent held by MHI and 20 per cent by Caterpillar.</p>

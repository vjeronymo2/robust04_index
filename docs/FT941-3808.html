			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / N Korean nuclear inspection completed Experts from the United Nations nuclear safeguards agency have completed their inspection of North Korea's declared nuclear sites and will leave Pyongyang today, the agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Vienna. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokesman Mr David Kyd refused to say whether the inspections had been a success. 'Certain restrictions were placed on what they could do at one or two locations and it's a question of how seriously these will be viewed,' he said. The US has made unimpeded IAEA inspection of the seven declared sites a condition for holding high-level talks with the North Koreans in Geneva at the end of next week. The talks were part of a package negotiated by the US, North Korea and South Korea to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula and stop North Korea from proceeding with a nuclear arms programme. If the IAEA's six-man inspection team reports it was prevented from carrying out a meaningful examination of the nuclear facilities, the deal could be in danger.</p>

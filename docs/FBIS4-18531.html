			<p>BFN     [Text] The downward trend in the Central Bank's foreign  currency reserves is gradually gaining momentum. The repayment  of foreign debts and the interventions aimed at placing the  parity of foreign currencies under control have reduced the  foreign currency reserves to $3.285 billion. The level of  reserves decreased by $788 million from 11 to 18 March. A  record fall took place from 18 to 25 March. Foreign currency  reserves decreased by $803 million that week. This indicates  that the foreign currency reserves decreased by 33 percent  during the past two weeks. Consequently, the Central Bank's  overall foreign currency reserves fell to $3.285 billion.    The Central Bank's foreign currency reserves totaled $7.193  billion at the end of November 1993. The figures indicate that  it lost 54 percent of its reserves during the past four months.  The Central Bank's foreign currency reserves totaled $6.277  billion on 1 January 1994. The bank lost 48 percent of that  amount since the beginning of the year. The record drops in the  Central Bank's foreign currency reserves have caused the amount  of foreign currency held by that bank to be at an all-time low  during the past two years.    Meanwhile, the Central Bank's foreign currency deficit has  increased to $5.815 billion. The bank's debts in foreign  currency total $10.588 billion. Its assets total $1.488 billion  in gold and the equivalent of $3.285 billion in foreign currency.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JPH: "Netherlands and Germany To Submit </F> CSCE Proposal"]    [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- Wim Kooijmans and Klaus  Kinkel, the Netherlands and German foreign ministers,  respectively, want the CSCE to bear greater responsibilities.  Among other things, the CSCE should be prepared to undertake  more peacekeeping operations, but in close cooperation with the  United Nations.    That is the essence of the proposal Kooijmans and Kinkel  will  be making to next week's special CSCE meeting in Vienna. The  ministers will personally present the proposal at a joint  meeting of the CSCE Permanent Committee and the security forum.  Ambassadors from the 52 member states (Serbia/Montenegro have  been suspended) sit on these committees, which respectively  discuss the political and military aspects of cooperation. It  is quite exceptional for ministers to present their plans in  person.    The Netherlands and Germany feel that the CSCE makes too  little use of the opportunities available to it. At the 1992  Helsinki summit, the member states decided that in the event of  future conflicts the CSCE should be able to undertake missions  to investigate the situation on the spot. Subject to strict  conditions, the organization may also undertake peacekeeping  operations, for which it can request the military resources of  NATO and the Western European Union.    This makes the CSCE a "regional organization" according to  the UN Charter. This means that it bears, in principle, initial  responsibility for settling any conflict in the area covered by  its treaty (Europe). The Hague and Bonn believe that it does  not yet make enough use of this authority. Peacekeeping  missions are now being planned for Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh.    The CSCE may not, however, undertake any peacemaking  activities. If a conflict gets out of hand to the extent that  such a mission is required, the United Nations must then take  over. The proposal by Kooijmans and Kinkel states that, in such  cases, the CSCE must hand over the mission as fully as possible  "so that it contributes to subsequent UN action and that the  United Nations does not have to start again from zero,"  according to a Netherlands Foreign Ministry spokesman.    The CSCE regularly brings together all the countries of  Europe, including most of the former Soviet republics and the  former Yugoslavia, plus Canada and the United States, to discuss  such matters as political and military security, human rights,  and the prevention of conflicts.    The proposal by Kooijmans and Kinkel is to be discussed at a  subsequent CSCE conference to be held in Budapest in October and  November at which developments in the organization will be on  the agenda.</p>

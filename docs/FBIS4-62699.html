			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by MOLOD UKRAYINY special correspondent Vitaliy </F> Portnykov: "Meshkov Holds Negotiations With Luzhkov"]    [Text] During his recent visit to the Russian capital,  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed an agreement on economic  cooperation with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. Of course, the  press was not so much interested in the list of goods that the  Crimea is going to trade with Moscow, as in the very fact of  Meshkov's meeting with one of the most prominent Russian  politicians who was recently named among plausible successors to  either Boris Yeltsin or Viktor Chernomyrdin.    The content of the negotiations between Meshkov and Luzhkov  has remained a secret for journalists as also the content of the  huge bag that Meshkov presented to the Moscow mayor (Luzhkov  presented the Crimean president with a vase decorated with the  Russian coat of arms). At the news conference given after the  signing of the agreement on economic cooperation, the Moscow  mayor recalled that Moscow already has similar agreements with  both former Soviet republics and subjects of the Russian state.  However, the agreement with the Crimea is, after all, special:  The mayor considers the political processes on the peninsula to  be incomplete and calls upon Russians to assist the Crimea.  Luzhkov characterized going to the Crimea on vacations as a  patriotic duty of every Russian citizen.    The head of the autonomy was less fastidious in his  statements. He expressed confidence that the fact of both sides'  being apart was temporary, as "the economy will unite all of  us," proposed that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet be  resolved in the course of bilateral negotiations between  Russia... and the Crimea (!), and bitterly complained at the  conduct of [Ukraine's defense minister] General Radetskyy, who  had imprudently reminded Meshkov of the actual meaning of his  "autonomous post." While characterizing "Ukraine's economic  collapse," Meshkov reminded the audience that every nationalism  has two paths: One toward economic dislocation and the second  -- toward a civil war. "For the time being, Ukraine has opted  for the former, but it is at a dangerous brink," stressed  Meshkov, who tried, in all of his other statements, to adhere to  the role of a well-wishing director of a holiday home and  guaranteed the Russians every security, if they finally  succumbed to the joint persuasions by the mayor and president  and go to the Crimea. In Yuriy Meshkov's opinion, it is only  now that the holiday-making in the Crimea is so cheap, since the  Crimean leader sees his peninsula precisely in the ruble zone,  perhaps, next to Tajikistan involved in conflicts....    Therefore, everybody must be in a hurry.</p>

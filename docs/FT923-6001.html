			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Management: Russia embraces the tyranny of fashion - Impoverished Russians are having a first taste of promotional gimmicks, and are being invited to buy designer clothes Not many people in the West spend 20 times the average monthly wage on one jacket - no matter how fashionable it may be. But many shoppers in Russia are mysteriously doing exactly that, splashing out on clothes in the newly-opened Escada fashion store in St Petersburg. Escada's prices are considered high even in the company's home market of Germany, but when translated into roubles at the open market rate they verge on the stratospheric. A stylish pink jacket is on sale for more than Rbs100,000 (Pounds 325). It would take a comparatively well-paid Russian engineer 20 months to earn such a sum. Nevertheless, Escada has been 'very encouraged' by its first Russian store, which opened in the Passazh shopping centre on the Nevskii Prospekt earlier this month. It says sales are running at comparable levels to those of a new store in Germany. Such a performance shows the strength of Russia's unofficial economy, the latent spending power of a new generation of entrepreneurs (and crooks), and the craving for high-status consumer goods in a land which has been deprived of them for decades. Irina Nylander, Escada's area manager, says the brand is a status symbol for the emerging business classes who believe in flaunting their wealth. 'If you have a diamond ring in Russia you wear it,' she says, strolling round the store in striking red hot pants. Many of the customers are young independent entrepreneurs who walk into the store with plastic bags containing 'bricks' of roubles. Nylander estimates that foreigners account for less than 5 per cent of sales. Escada, Germany's second biggest clothing manufacturer, conducted little formal market research before opening in St Petersburg; its initiative owed more to a chance encounter between a company director and a Russian trade minister. The company now plans to expand in Russia, in contrast with its retrenchment in western Europe. Its principle designer and co-founder, Margaratha Ley, died in June at the age of 59. Her husband and business manager, Wolfgang Ley, admits the company was left to drift during her extended illness. A dozen years of near 30 per cent annual growth ended, an extensive new distribution centre hit teething troubles and the company fell into loss this year. Russia may contribute to a turnaround in Escada's fortunes, although it is a difficult place to do business, with unpredictable investment and customs laws and an uncertain economic climate, says Nylander. She also argues that Russians are impatient capitalists. 'People want to make a million in a month. They want a big profit margin on every deal. But we emphasise that to be successful you have to build a trading relationship over a long time,' she says. But in spite of such concerns, she claims Escada has been able to establish a mutually beneficial trading arrangement with Passazh, the retailing concern which owns the centre where its shop is found. She claims it is important to have an effective local partner, who can deal with many of the bureaucratic worries. Escada pays no fixed rent to Passazh but effectively leases its store by giving it a percentage of its takings. It has also agreed to take on all the staff from the previous shop on the premises - it now employs 50 people in total - and to maintain the fabric of its section of the centre. The overhead costs are lower than in Germany but they are offset by higher distribution expenses, a customs charge of 6 per cent on imported goods, and a further 2.5 per cent charge for converting rouble sales into Deutschmarks. The net result is that margins between Russia and Germany are similar. The company has spent much time and effort promoting the Escada brand name and its store-opening programme in Russia by means of press, radio and television advertising. It believes it can quickly - and cheaply - make the Escada brand synonymous with high fashion in the minds of millions of Russians, stealing a march on its competitors. Whether it can sustain its early advantage in such a fast-changing economy remains a moot point, however. A glamorous TV advertising campaign is currently running ahead of the Moscow store openings. In St Petersburg, local government officials and the press were invited to a lavish party on the eve of the opening which generated a great deal of media coverage. 'When Passazh opened its doors at 10 am people were running down the arcade towards our shop. There were so many people I did not know what to do,' Nylander says. Ironically, although the media's headlines focused on the high prices - 'Shop and Shock' ran one - Escada's first customer was a Russian journalist who spent Rbs289,000. But not all are so impressed by what Escada has to offer. 'Only a valyutnaya can afford to buy here,' said one shopper, bitterly referring to Russia's high-earning hard currency prostitutes. Such private resentments could easily spill over into public hostility towards the more high-profile expressions of the vast inequalities of wealth that are rapidly developing in Russia. Escada will have to tread a narrow path to ensure it becomes a victor, not a victim, in the volatile world of Russian fashion.</p>

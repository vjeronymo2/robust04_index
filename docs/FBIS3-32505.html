Lage  arrived in Venezuela from Brazil, where he met with President  Itamar Franco and other government officials, political leaders,  and local businessmen.    Venezuelan media have reported that Caldera has the  intention  of maintaining good relations with Cuba. In Caracas, Lage will  also meet with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli,  who aspires to become secretary general of the Organization of  American States and who has recently declared that he favors the  reintegration of Cuba into that Panamerican association.    Another important meeting that Lage will hold during his  brief stay in Venezuela will be with the directorate of the  Petroleos enterprise to examine the possibilities of resuming  the triangular oil trade that existed between Caracas, Moscow,  and Havana. In statements to the press in Rio de Janeiro, prior  to his departure for Caracas, Lage pointed out that every day  the United States is more isolated in its policy of blockade  against Cuba. He added that an example of this is the passage of  resolutions against Washington's economic retaliations against  Havana by the UN General Assembly for two consecutive years.    Today, Lage will travel to Colombia on an official visit.</p>

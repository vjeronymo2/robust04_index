			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Brussels steps up action on cartels THE European Commission warned yesterday of a crackdown on cartels following this week's raids on the offices of 15 carton-board-making companies. 'We're getting tougher all the time,' said a senior EC official, adding that it was a priority of Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner that 'we should be on the lookout for cartel activities'. Officials from the Brussels competition directorate, accompanied by national officials, made unannounced visits on Tuesday and Wednesday to 15 companies, several of them subsidiaries of non-EC companies like Stora of Sweden, Cascade of Canada and Mayr-Melnhof of Austria, and took away documents. The investigation follows an allegation by the British Printing Industries Federation that producers of carton-board were concerting price rises, contrary to the Treaty of Rome. 'We are sifting through the evidence, but there's nothing at the moment that would lead us to widen our investigation beyond carton-board,' said the EC official. The BPIF wrote to the Commission on November 22 listing 23 occasions on which it said its members had been faced with seemingly concerted price rises of around Pounds 40 per tonne. The supplying companies were in the UK, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The similar dates of the notification of the price rises - from mid-September to mid-October - and the similar dates of the implementation of those rises - in the first week of January  - raised the federation's suspicions. 'Although we must accept that that certain factors relevant to board producers are common .. we do not believe that the overall impact of all the various factors is so uniform that the prices should rise by virtually identical amounts at virtually the same time,' it said. Backing for the UK complaint came from the Federation Francaise de Cartonnage, which said yesterday it had received inquiries from the Commission officials last December. 'We told them that for the past two and a half years, producers have been announcing identical price rises at the same time.' By contrast, Mr Volkmar Wulf, director of the Frankfurt-based international paper and carton association, CITPA, said he was 'astonished' by the Commission's action 'because I thought the market was OK'. In January the Commission raided several EC steel companies suspected of market fixing practices, and last year ICI of the UK and Belgium were fined a record Ecu47m (Pounds 32m) for carving up the soda ash market. Other recent cartel investigations include petrochemicals, plastics, plasterboard and pulp. David Goodhart adds from Bonn: The European Court of Justice has ruled that the German Federal Labour Office's state monopoly in the job placement market is invalid in the senior management sector. The case was brought by a Munich headhunting agency, Hofner and Elser, who were not paid by a customer on the grounds that their work was against German law.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Caution still needed  -Property yields remain high 'IN THIS business you have to take the rough with the smooth. And last year was rough, believe me.' Thus Tom Heyes, head of ICI's pension funds, commenting on the market for investment property. He does not exaggerate. In mid-1989, average property yields took off vertically and did not stop rising until the last quarter of 1991, by when they were 30 per cent higher. Since then the decline from this all-time historic peak of 10.2 per cent has been barely measurable. Statistics from the Richard Ellis Monthly Index suggest that yields may have dipped to 9.9 per cent by the year end. No lower. Little wonder, therefore, that fund managers with the decades of experience of Mr Heyes are still advocating 'a great deal of caution', and categorise some sectors (notably offices) and regions (particularly the City of London) as disaster zones. New funds, which may have bought within the past five years at yields above 7 per cent, would have taken a bad enough hit if forced to sell properties last year. But pity those whose holdings go back a decade or more to the days when yields were under 5 per cent. Yet Mr Heyes and his counterparts at the other gigantic pension funds remain philosophical, and continue to believe that large funds should maintain an exposure to property, if only as a diversification from the dominance of equities in their portfolios. Outsiders will note that the large funds have little choice but to hold on. When times are hard, the property market dries up, its illiquidity making sales extremely difficult. That illiquidity, coupled with the fact that properties come in expensive lumps and require skilled and continuous management, is also the reason why significant property holdings are not really suitable for smaller funds (Jones Lang Wootton estimates that a fund needs a minimum of Pounds 15-20m in a property portfolio to give it reasonable diversity). With such different factors operating at either end of the scale, the statistics for pension fund property exposure need careful interpretation. Overall, they show a very significant run down in exposure. From a high of 19 per cent in 1974, average pension fund property holdings were only 7 per cent of total assets last year, according to the Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management annual figures. Many funds had no exposure at all. But that probably disguises the tendency for smaller funds to avoid going into the sector and/or to sell those smallish holdings which they had already bought. Independent figures reinforce the experience of JLW's in-house fund managers (whose clients are almost exclusively in the middle to large bracket) that large funds entered 1992 with property holdings amounting to between 8 and 12 per cent of their total assets. It is more difficult to draw a line through the different claims about current strategies. Malcolm Naish, a partner of JLW's fund management arm, says that more of his clients are today increasing their holdings if they have fallen below 10 per cent, than allowing them to continue to shrink. But other fund managers are adamant that they have no new money going into property at the present time. There may be a number of reasons for this: some have little or no new money arriving for any form of investment, as redundancy programmes continue to erode the number of contributors and cash-strapped companies gratefully take contribution holidays on the back of the outperformance of the late 1980s. Others are robbing Peter to pay Paul: that is, selling one form of investment (or property sector) to buy another. According to the latest in PDFM's Pension Fund Indicators series (whose publication should coincide with the National Association of Pension Funds conference) the tentative conclusion is that some net new money - about 4 per cent - was allocated to property last year, compared with the net 2 per cent disinvestment in 1990. The trend remains to be confirmed later this year and will bear close examination. For anecdotal evidence suggests fund managers have become highly selective in the forays into the property market. Although many, like the Prudential's pension fund management arm, now believe that the drop in property values has now been sufficient to compensate for the poor outlook for rental growth, they are still wary of the office market overall, and of the City's prospects in particular. Tom Heyes reserves real enthusiasm only for smallish retail units where demand has already begun to pick up. 'In the cathedral towns, there are five buyers for every Pounds 2m shopping centre investment,' he observes. In previous downturns in the UK cycle, British fund managers have been able to turn their sights abroad. This time the range of sparkling opportunities is small. The US is in a worse state than the UK, and may take more than five years to find its feet again. Forget Japan. Too many investors are trampling over one another in Berlin, though that is taking some of the pressure off Frankfurt. France is at best flat. Some are beginning to look again at Spain. As for east Europe, it's a case of: 'After you. . . No, after you, sir.' Jones Lang Wootton may accurately have pinpointed the turning point when British fund managers regained their appetite for property in the home market, but they are scarcely ravenous. When a pensions manager on the scale of the Prudential - which dramatically reduced the numbers in its property department in 1990 - now talks of a mixed programme of sales and purchases but makes no moves to increase staff numbers, it speaks volumes for the expected future exposure to property. Property unit trusts, the once-popular vehicle for funds too small to consider direct property holdings, have also fallen from favour as a result of a decade of under-performance. However, Medidian Funds Management, the global investment arm of NML, the Australian insurance group noted for its consciously counter-cyclical approach, will begin marketing this month a planned DM1bn closed-end European Property Fund, to be launched in September. The success of that launch may offer a pointer to whether mutual funds can be revived.</p>

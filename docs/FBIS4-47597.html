			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from speech by Chief Scientific Secretary of the </F> Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Makarov at the March 1994  General Meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under the  rubric ``Science: The Hour of Choice. Guided by a Wise Budget'':  ``Both To Abound and To Suffer Need'']    [Text] After describing the overall situation of the state  of affairs at the Russian Academy of Sciences and making a brief  survey of the scientific results of the year, I. Makarov dwelt  on the work of the presidium of the RAS.    During the year under review the presidium heard 16  departments. In the end many positive results were obtained.  First of all the departments made an analysis and outlined means  of improving their activity. Priority directions of scientific  research were formed, redundant or obsolete subdivisions of  scientific institutions were eliminated, and the subdivisions,  which conduct mainly applied research, were converted to cost  accounting. The process of getting rid of unnecessary personnel  and themes, which is natural under these conditions, is taking  place. The institutions, which have been linked into the  ``technological chain,'' are seeking new forms of organizational  interaction, for example, in the form of joint institutes, as  the Institute of High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of  Sciences and the Institute of Earth Physics, the Institute of  Chemical Physics and others have done.    And nevertheless the problem of structural changes at the  academy is still far from its solution.    In examining the discussions of the work of the departments  in aggregate, it is also possible to note several oversights. In  my opinion, financial and economic analysis did not take its  proper place in their work. The questions of the specification  of the content of the academy charter from the standpoint of the  interests of the departments and of its coincidence with the new  conditions and the problems of social relations in scientific  collectives were practically not touched upon.    In accordance with the instructions of the general meeting  the presidium of the RAS devoted daily attention to the search  for additional sources of financing. During the year under  review they invested many billions of rubles in scientific  research of the RAS.    In connection with the development of the independence of  the  regions it seems to me that the expansion of research in their  interests has considerable prospects. Practical confirmation of  this is the ``Science for Moscow'' and ``Moscow for Science''  programs. They made it possible to obtain additionally from the  city budget approximately R1.5 billion. Moreover, Moscow granted  the institutes breaks on the fees for electric power, heat,  water, and sewer service and on the rent for premises. The city  obtained from the academy the science-intensive technologies it  needed.    Of course, by earning additional assets, we, on the one  hand,  are contributing to the preservation of the creative potential  of the academy. However, this process is distorting the  structure of our potential. A larger and larger portion of it is  switching to exclusively applied spheres or to enterprise. A  question arises: What factors are now decisive in determining  the real priorities in the basic directions of research at the  RAS: The notions of the scientific community about priorities or  the financial receipts from extrabudgetary sources? And there is  more. Should the system of priorities in effect in our country  of the distribution of state budgetary assets by directions of  research take into account the receipts from extrabudgetary  sources?    It seems to me that we should find the answers to these and  similar questions in the process of joint discussions before we  are faced with the fact of the disappearance of basic research  at the academy.    The patent law protection of our scientific product is  playing an important role. Owing to patent protection (and until  1990 the academy maintained abroad from 800 to 1,000 patents) we  obtained every year appreciable amounts of hard currency. For  example, $130,000 were spent on the patenting of three  inventions relating to fianites (a development of the Physics  Institute imeni Lebedev), while the payments from foreign firms  under agreements came to $12 million.    The change starting in 1991 of the procedure of paying  expenses, which are connected with the patenting of inventions,  and the lack of a centralized monetary fund of the academy led  to the significant decrease of the amounts of foreign patenting  at the RAS.    During the year under review the institutions of the RAS  received just 26 foreign patents, while the revenue from the  sale of licenses came to only U.S. $36,000.    Fundamental changes in the patent and licensing policy of  scientific institutions and the RAS as a whole are necessary for  the conversion of scientific and technical achievements into a  commodity, including an export commodity, and the formation of a  stable source of currency receipts, and we are working on this.    In spite of the difficulties with financing, such a form of  the obtaining of knowledge and the exchange of experience as  scientific conferences, meetings, symposiums and schools is  being restored in the life of our scientists. During the year  under review more than 100 such measures were implemented. This  year the institutes and scientific councils have planned to  implement 200 measures. I will recall that until the sharp  decrease of their number in 1992 more than 400 meetings,  conferences and schools were held annually.    I cannot but speak about the RAS-UNESCO contract ``The Basic  Sciences in Russia,'' the implementation of which was rated  highly by the leadership of UNESCO. During its fulfillment the  conducting of scientific research of an international scale, the  giving of assistance in the establishment of the Scientific  Center of Computer-Integrated Systems of the RAS, the practical  study of talented young scientists at leading world centers, and  much else became possible.    In concluding the discussion of the results of the work in  1993 and stating the fulfillment of many items of the decrees of  the general meeting, it is impossible not to note that a number  of important decisions remain unfulfilled.    It has not been possible to complete the formulation of the  concept of the activity of the academy under the new conditions.  Thus far a system of the examination of the activity of academic  scientific institutions has not been established. A fund for the  support of young scientists has not been formed at the RAS.    I would not want to exaggerate the importance of the concept  of the RAS under the new conditions, but it would be unjust to  understate it. The existence of a concept always testifies to an  intelligent approach to one's own activity, which, as you know,  never hurts.    We have the charter of the RAS. But let us see whether it is  that form of representation or not. Does our charter give, even  if at the fundamental level, answers to questions that arise in  life: What forms of work with the property of the RAS are  permissible for us, and what ones are not; what objects of this  property can be privatized and how in the process of  privatization should the interests of the academy be reflected;  what forms of entrepreneurial activity are permissible in our  community; under what conditions can a person hold an  administrative position at the academy and be an associate of  it, and under what ones can he not; should the assets that are  earned by institutions, which receive state budget financing and  use the fixed capital and creative potential of the academy, be  redistributed in the academy and thus support priority  directions of scientific research; finally, one should also  think about the moral and ethical principles in the life of our  community.    In the charter there are neither answers to nor principles  of  answering such questions. They are also not present in other  standard documents.    About the fund of young scientists. It seems to me that such  a fund is more than necessary. If our talented young people  instead of thoughts about basic problems rush about in search of  means of survival, they will find means in the end, but what a  price for science!    Given the decrease of the amounts of state budget financing  of the RAS I think that now a single solution is possible--to  establish the fund of young scientists by means of deductions of  the institutes and commercial structures attached to the  academy. I ask you to express your opinion on the listed sources  of financing of the fund. The position of the directors of our  institutes is especially important here.    Winding up, I will dwell briefly on questions of the  interaction of the academy with the leadership of the state. Our  scientists took a direct part in the work of many governmental  commissions and committees of the former Supreme Soviet, now the  State Duma, and made a substantial contribution to the solution  of domestic and international problems.    Examining from an unbiased standpoint the life of the  academic community, it is impossible not to note that this life  was painted with the entire rainbow of colors. And the people,  who are trying to depict it only in black or only in rose color,  are hardly correct.    It appears that the ancient biblical wisdom, which was  formulated in the epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the  Philippians, is becoming a guiding one for us: ``I know both how  to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all  things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to  abound and to suffer need.''    The main thing was done. Given the support of the RAS on the  part of the leadership of the state, the government of Moscow  and the international scientific community we were able during  the year under review to preserve the creative potential of the  academy and to achieve good scientific results.</p>

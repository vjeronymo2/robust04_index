			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT GETS THE MESSAGE  </P> <P> The majority of the people in United States who believe that the decision to  have an abortion is a serious choice but still a deeply personal one should  take comfort from two key legislative decisions this week. In both Florida and  in Washington, legislators were willing to stand up and be counted against  further restrictions on legal abortions.  </P> <P> Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who called a special session of the Legislature in  an effort to place limits on abortion, found himself in the embarrassing  position of a drum major without a band. The one measure that received fairly  broad support, a proposal that would have called for stronger state regulation  of abortion clinics, will likely be reconsidered during the regular session.  </P> <P> But the Legislature decisively spurned Martinez's attempts to impose several  restrictions, including prohibiting public hospitals from performing abortions.  The Legislature's action was particularly noteworthy because this is the same  Legislature that just last year passed a law to require a minor to get the  permission of a parent or a judge in order to obtain an abortion. But last week  the Florida Supreme Court struck that down, based on the state's privacy law.  </P> <P> In a hard-fought vote in Congress, the House narrowly approved a provision that  extended government-funded abortions to poor women who have been the victims of  rape or incest. The vote is an about-face from the policy that prevailed  throughout the Reagan Administration. While there have been repeated attempts  to restore federal funding for cases of rape and incest, a timid House has  failed to do so until now.  </P> <P> Some abortion-rights advocates say that the votes signal a major tide change.  But President Bush has threatened to veto the House measure, which has been  endorsed once by the Senate and is expected to be routinely approved again.  Even if Congress can manage the difficult task of overriding a presidential  veto, pro-choice advocates still face bruising battles this year in  legislatures in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Texas, where anti-abortion  supporters are expected to push a cluster of bills that will attempt to impose  parental, spousal or partner consent and waiting periods on abortions.  Certainly it is too early for pro-choice advocates to declare victory over an  intractable controversy likely to continue for some time.  </P> <P> But the votes in the House and in Florida do indicate that many Americans  remain convinced that the right to an abortion is best left standing. The  rejection of further limits is an acknowledgement that many voters have made it  known to their legislators that they prefer to keep abortion legal and safely  available to those who seek it.  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (4): French way of doing things - The economics minister explains his government's distinctive approach towards economic management / Profile of Edmond Alphandery Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, is no stranger to foreign lands - but he remains convinced that his country's way of doing things has much to commend it. Formerly a professor of economics and a graduate of the Institute for Political Studies in Paris, he also attended both the universities of Chicago and Berkeley. At a breakfast meeting last week at Bercy, the modernistic headquarters of the ministry of finance and economic affairs, he was in a reflective mood about the distinctive French approach after a busy travel schedule to other countries. 'There is a difference in perception between the strength of French economy and how it is perceived overseas,' he says. He points to sustained growth in the last few months. 'I'm very confident of the prospects for the economy.' He adds: 'The momentum has been maintained in the second half of the year. People thought it might slow down but it hasn't. Consumption has taken up the baton, particularly in consumer durables, and the last motor of the economy - investment - is now firing. Even small and medium-sized companies are more optimistic.' One of the distinctive elements of the French approach to economic management is the way it has tackled privatisation. He says the experience has been favourable compared to other countries, 'many of which have been a failure'. Most recently, he points to the partial privatisation of Renault, which was more than 15 times over-subscribed by institutions and has also received a high level of demand from private investors. He points out that the state has so far raised a total of FFr103bn from sales. But he stresses that 'you don't judge the success of a privatisation simply by the number of subscribers.' He says the objective has instead been primarily to disengage the state from business activities. 'The public sector is too big.' He calls the 1982 nationalisation law in France 'archaic and astonishing for an industrial modern economy at that time.' Mr Alphandery defends what he calls the noyaux stable or the idea of a core group of long-term shareholders as part of the success of French privatisation. 'It is sometimes criticised by other countries, but it has proved flexible and supple - an effective way to let companies pass smoothly into the private sector.' He also highlights other distinctive French approaches to the process: the idea of an independent privatisation commission to select advisers and make decisions about the sale of state assets, transparency and the scope for employees to become shareholders. 'Privatisation is an art and very complicated,' he says. 'We have the savoir-faire.' Looking forward, he says that no decision has yet been taken on whether to proceed with the sale of Seita, the state- controlled tobacco monopoly which sells Gitanes and Gauloises, and for which the search has now begun for an adviser to consider the possibility of a sale. He says that Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group, will be next in line to offer shares to the public. 'It will be sold as soon as possible depending on market conditions,' he says. 'There are no particular obstacles.' Mr Alphandery argues that there are four principal challenges for the French economy. The first is the amelioration of unemployment. 'There is insufficient flexibility in the labour market,' he says. 'Many measures need to be taken.' He highlights the role of professional training, particularly within companies, and argues that there is 'a lot of room for manoeuvre' in reducing the social security taxes paid by companies. He is less convinced that the minimum wage is a real problem. His second challenge is the social security system. He says France must do more to modify the existing retirement system schemes, reform pensions and cut health care expenditure. He stresses 'an important first step' through the tax reforms over the summer which encourage private pension schemes for artisans and independent workers. 'The big problem is to develop a pension scheme for workers,' he says. 'It's a big problem for French society. I am confident in the months to come that there will be legislation but it would be a bit hurried before the presidential election.' His third challenge - which he stresses is far from unique to France - is to tackle national training and the education system, which he says are still too centralised. 'There is a lot to do.' That leaves an important fourth challenge: to continue efforts to reduce the budget deficit, which has a current target of FFr301bn for the end of this year and FFr275bn for next year. In the run-up to next May's presidential elections, he is also keen to reassure the financial markets. He does not believe there is any significant difference between the principal candidates on economic matters. Any divergence from the current approach would, he argues, 'be absolutely irresponsible and damage their credibility'.</p>

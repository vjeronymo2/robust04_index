Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, located in Darlington County, South Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would have revised Section 6 of the Technical Specifications to implement the functional role and responsibilities of the Nuclear Assessment Department (NAD). The proposed change would have modified the facility Technical Specifications pertaining to the Nuclear Assessment Department. The fundamental role of the NAD is to assist in the early identification of deficiencies that may prevent the Company's nuclear projects from achieving the desired level of performance on a sustained basis and to ensure effective correction of deficiencies. Because of major changes in the original submittal, the licensee has chosen to withdraw the previous amendment application and provide a new amendment request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 16, 1992, (57 FR 42769). However, by letter dated July 22, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated August 10, 1992, as supplemented September 15, 1993, and the licensee's letter dated July 22, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Hartsville Memorial Library, 147 West College, Hartsville, South Carolina 29550. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 5th day of August 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Brenda L.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (AFP) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  urged the IAEA Monday to provide Beijing with more details on  North Korea's nuclear programme to enable it to make a firm  decision on the best course of action in the crisis.    Australian Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe said Li had made  clear to him that Beijing's "knowledge was incomplete,"  emphasising the point that "the IAEA might assist by providing  China with more information that it could use to make a firmer  judgement."    China, which has consistently opposed imposing sanctions on  North Korea, has also expressed its willingness to play a  "constructive" role to resolve the crisis, sparked by North  Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) access to its nuclear facilities. However, Beijing also  emphasised that its influence over its neighbour and its  knowledge of North Korea's nuclear programme -- suspected by the  United States to be developing a nuclear bomb -- is limited.    "Certainly I didn't get much hint of support for sanctions,  but I did get a sense that China was prepared to play a role  that was constructive," said Howe, in China on an eight-day  visit. "There was implied there recognition that China needed  to be brought into the game more and trusted to play that role  ... that China needed to be trusted with a bit more confidence  to use that influence" that it is assumed to have over North  Korea, Howe told journalists.    As support grows for U.S. calls for sanctions against North  Korea, the stance of China -- which has a veto as a permanent  member of the United Nations Security Council -- is critical.  China abstained Friday in an IAEA vote to suspend technical  assistance to North Korea.</p>

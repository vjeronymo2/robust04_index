			<p>BFN     [Text] The complicated social and economic situation in  Primorskiy Territory [Maritime Kray] and huge, mainly  demographic pressure by next door China can pose the threat of  the region's gradual economic breakaway from Russia, the  government Economic Management Commission in Moscow said on  Wednesday.    Head of the industrial policy committee Igor Shurchkov said  that such secession could lead to greater disintegration and a  sharp deterioration in the country's defence capability. He  also said that the region's economic hardships, its remoteness  and Russia's transport troubles were posing a real threat of the  region being used by Asian-Pacific countries simply as a net  exporter of mining products and importer of "average quality  products at best".    A resolution was adopted to form a commission of heads of  regional departments and regional administration representatives  to work out a package of proposals for economic recovery and on  the prospects of regional development "in the context of  Russia's geo-strategic and economic interests in the  Asian-Pacific region." It was also indicated that the federal  government and regional administration must meet to discuss the  question of power sharing with each other.</p>

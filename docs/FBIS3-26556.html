			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [China Daily Commentaries: "New Nuclear Plant"] </F>   [Text] The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has started  commercial operation. This event marks another step forward in  the development of China's nuclear power industry. It will send  electricity to Hong Kong in addition to greatly easing power  shortages in Guangdong Province.    The Daya Bay plant is China's second nuclear power station.  The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in East China's Zhejiang  Province began operation in 1991.    Daya Bay is China's first large-scale nuclear power station  that makes use of foreign investment, sophisticated foreign  equipment and advanced technology. This would have been  impossible without the reform and opening policy.    The question of safety is the people's primary concern. From  its design through construction, trial and commercial operation,  the Daya Bay plant has observed all requirements of the  International Atomic Energy Agency and has passed several of its  examinations. Residents in nearby regions can trust the safety  reassurances made by experts, both Chinese and foreign, who work  at the Daya Bay plant and whose families live nearby.    Though China is rich in energy resources, the distribution  is  poorly balanced. Shortages of energy are becoming a bottleneck  to economic development, especially in coastal southeast China.    So far, nuclear energy, the cleanest, safest and most  economical source, constitutes only 1 per cent of China's energy  production. This means that there is vast potential as well as  urgent need for future development.    The Daya Bay project has, among other achievements, provided  experience and trained personnel for nuclear power production.  It has also set an example of successful international  co-operation.    All this surely will have very favourable effects on the  further expansion of China's nuclear industry.</p>

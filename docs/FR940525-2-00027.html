North Dakota's PWSS program, administered by the North Dakota Division of Municipal Facilities, has adopted regulations for lead and copper that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) in 40 CFR part 141 for lead and copper promulgated by EPA on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460&hyph;26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review of North Dakota's primacy revision and has determined that it is no less stringent than the NPDWR for lead and copper. EPA therefore approves North Dakota's primacy revision for the Lead and Copper Rule. This determination shall become effective June 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any interested parties are invited to submit written comments on this determination, and may request a public hearing on or before June 24, 1994.

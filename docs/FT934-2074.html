			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Russian events and weak bonds hit Dow Wall Street US stocks retreated yesterday as a weak bond market and political developments in Russia encouraged a round of profit-taking in cyclical issues, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 21.80 down at 3,742.63, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.64 to 463.06. The American SE composite was off 2.94 at 461.83 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.25 to 751.47. New York SE volume was 275m shares and declines led rises by 1,376 to 700. Investors were largely indifferent to the day's economic news. As forecast, the Commerce Department reported retail sales in November had risen 0.4 per cent, following an upward revised 1.8 per cent increase in October. If some investors were reassured by the steady growth in the sale of durable goods, others saw grounds for pessimism in the moderating month-to-month trend, even though it had been widely expected. For the most part, however, the data were neutral. By contrast, political developments in Russia, which appeared to threaten the reform process, were clearly unsettling. A mid-morning downturn in the US Treasury market further rattled Wall Street, even though bond act-ivity was driven by technical factors. As a result, stocks most likely to benefit from a buoyant economy gave back some of their gains from the previous, record-breaking session. Alcoa slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 3/8 , 3M Dollars  1/2 to 110 3/8 , Cummins Engine Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 and International Paper Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 . IBM was Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 56 1/8 , but General Electric gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 102 3/8 . The Big Three car makers were weaker, led by Chrysler, down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 55 1/8 . Ford relinquished Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 1/2 and GM Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55. Brown-Forman surged ahead after offering to buy up to 4.2m of its shares in a Dutch auction at Dollars 83 to Dollars 90 each. The distiller's 'A' stock shot up Dollars 15 1/8 to Dollars 86 and the 'B' Dollars 11 7/8 to Dollars 85 3/4 . Among other beverage stocks, Anheuser-Busch shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 49 3/8 on news of its plans to cut beer prices in a move to stem declining sales of its premium brands. Philip Morris, which owns Miller Brewing, dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 . Federal Express climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 71 1/2 after analysts raised their ratings on the stock. On the Amex, Medco Research jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 15 3/4 after its Adensoscan heart disease detection drug moved a step closer to FDA approval. Canada Toronto moved sharply lower in busy trading amid further profit-taking after reaching an all-time high last week. The TSE 300 index ended 48.9 off at 4,244.4, the third decline in the past four sessions. Falls outnumbered advances by 543 to 285. Volume was 75.5m shares valued at CDollars 928m. The transportation group retreated 3.1 per cent and the gold shares index shed 1.4 per cent. Metals and minerals lost 2.2 per cent as metal prices fell back sharply.</p>

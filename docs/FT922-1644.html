			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capital gains and indexation THIS TABLE allows you to work out your capital gains tax liability after indexation for assets sold in May. Multiply the amount of money you paid for the asset by the figure shown for the month in which you bought it. If you then subtract this figure from the amount you received for it on the sale, this will give you your taxable gain or loss. Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in February 1985 and sold them in April 1992 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the February 1985 figure of 1.515 gives a total of Pounds 9,090. Subtracting that from Pounds 14,000 gives a gain for tax purposes of Pounds 4,910 - which is below the 1992-93 Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance. If you are selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The value of the retail prices index, used to calculate many index-linked pension schemes was 139.3 for May (where the index at January 1987 is 100).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CGT INDEXATION ALLOWANCES: MAY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Month           1982       1983       1984       1985       1986  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January            -      1.686      1.604      1.527      1.447 February           -      1.679      1.597      1.515      1.442 March          1.753      1.676      1.592      1.501      1.440 April          1.719      1.653      1.571      1.470      1.426 May            1.707      1.646      1.566      1.463      1.424 June           1.702      1.642      1.562      1.460      1.424 July           1.701      1.633      1.563      1.463      1.428 August         1.701      1.626      1.549      1.459      1.424 September      1.702      1.619      1.546      1.460      1.417 October        1.693      1.613      1.536      1.457      1.415 November       1.685      1.607      1.532      1.452      1.403 December       1.688      1.603      1.533      1.450      1.398  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1987       1988       1989       1990       1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January        1.393      1.348      1.255      1.166      1.070 February       1.387      1.343      1.246      1.159      1.064 March          1.385      1.338      1.240      1.147      1.060 April          1.368      1.317      1.219      1.114      1.047 May            1.367      1.312      1.211      1.104      1.043 June           1.367      1.307      1.207      1.099      1.039 July           1.368      1.306      1.206      1.099      1.041 August         1.364      1.291      1.203      1.087      1.039 September      1.360      1.285      1.195      1.077      1.035 October        1.354      1.272      1.186      1.069      1.031 November       1.347      1.266      1.176      1.072      1.027 December       1.348      1.263      1.173      1.072      1.027  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

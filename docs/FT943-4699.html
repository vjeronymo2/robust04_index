			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Pearson taps the eurosterling sector for Pounds 125m over 10 years Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times, launched a Pounds 125m 10-year eurosterling offering in an active day of issuance in spite of the fall in European government bond markets. Demand for the bonds, which were priced to yield 75 basis points above the 6 3/4 per cent UK government bond due 2004, came almost exclusively from UK-based institutional investors, lead manager NatWest Capital Markets said. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate dollars. The Republic of Argentina launched a CDollars 100m three-year bond priced to yield 229 basis points over the interpolated yield on two and five-year Canadian government bonds. Lead manager Paribas said the bonds attracted retail and institutional investors in Canada and continental Europe. Despite the weakness of the currency on the foreign exchanges, several eurodollar offerings were launched. The City of Yokohama issued its much-anticipated deal, raising Dollars 250m through an offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 35 basis points over 10-year US Treasuries. Lead manager Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets said the launch was successful, with strong interest from European retail and institutional investors as well as from some Asian investors. However, syndicate managers had some doubts whether the bonds would remain in Europe. 'Most will be snapped up by Japanese investors,' said one syndicate manager. 'European investors do not trust the liquidity of the issue.' Credit Local de France tapped the shorter end of the curve with a Dollars 200m offering of four-year bonds targeted at retail investors in Europe and Hong Kong. The bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points above the interpolated yield on three and five-year US Treasuries. 'This offers a wider spread than previous four-year dollar issues, which have been trading through Treasuries,' said lead manager IBJ International. Baden-Wurttemberg L-Finance launched a DM500m issue of four-year D-Mark eurobonds priced to yield 5 basis points over the BOBL 108. In a similar deal, SudwestLB Capital Markets also tapped the D-Mark sector with a DM300m offering of four-year bonds priced to yield 15 basis points above the 5 3/4 per cent German government bond due 1998.</p>

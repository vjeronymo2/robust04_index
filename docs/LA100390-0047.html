			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GANG ACTIVITY SUSPECTED IN SLAYING OF GIRL  </P> <P> A popular 14-year-old high school girl was fatally shot and a pregnant friend  was wounded in what Oceanside police said Tuesday might be the city's first  gang-related killing.  </P> <P> Officer E.J. Luarca said the victims were black and the suspects are believed  to be Samoan, raising suspicion that the violence might have been sparked by  gang rivalry between the two ethnic groups.  </P> <P> Michele Tate defied her mother's pleas and went to Alberto's Mexican Food in  eastern Oceanside on Monday night, leaving the restaurant with several friends  shortly after 9 p.m. when a car drove up and an occupant opened fire.  </P> <P> A bullet passed through Tate, who was pronounced dead at Tri-City Medical  Center, and struck Stacey Prince, 17, who was flown by helicopter to Palomar  Hospital, where she was treated and released.  </P> <P> Shortly before noon Tuesday, Oceanside police had arrested Talofa Finouga Jr.,  19, and were searching for a second suspect, Akeli S. Kelly, 21, both of  Oceanside.  </P> <P> "We don't know if the shooting is gang-related or ethnically motivated," Luarca  said. If the former, "it's the first gang-related shooting that has resulted in  the death of a person" in Oceanside, he said.  </P> <P> Oceanside has had gangs for generations but police warned last year that gang  activity had escalated with several non-fatal drive-by shootings between the  Samoan Bloods and the Deep Valley Posse, which is a black gang.  </P> <P> Although police were guarded in their statements, the neighborhood where  Michele lived in a tract of older, modest stucco homes near Camp Pendleton's  back gate has been buzzing for days about gang activity.  </P> <P> Michele's mother, Mecaela Tate, comforted by friends and family, said Tuesday  she had warned her friendly, outgoing daughter to stay away from Redondo Drive  and North River Road, the commercial and residential area where the shooting  occurred and which police say is commonly used as a gang hangout.  </P> <P> "I told her time and time again to stay away from there," said Tate, who said  her daughter didn't belong to a gang but that some of her friends did.  </P> <P> On the day Michele died, she had telephoned her mother at work to say she was  home sick from school. But while her mother, who is divorced and works two  jobs, was still at work that evening, the girl left the family's home and ended  up with her friends at Alberto's.  </P> <P> Tate believes that her daughter, a freshman at El Camino High School, was shot  by mistake and the assailants meant to kill one of her companions.  </P> <P> "She was at the wrong place at the wrong time. She took the bullet," Tate said.  </P> <P> "She doesn't do anything wrong, she's innocent," sobbed the mother, adding that  her daughter "wanted to be a lawyer. How's she going to be a lawyer if she's  dead?"  </P> <P> Tate said Michele was friendly to a fault, often inviting homeless children to  spend the night in their home. She was loyal to friends, some of them gang  members, and seemed unaware that her association could bring her harm, said her  mother.  </P> <P> Sources believe the bullet could have been meant for one of Michele's  companions, which included two males whom police have not identified.  </P> <P> Residents of Tate's neighborhood have worried for days about increasing gang  activity.  </P> <P> One area resident, who asked not to be identified, said there has been some  gang activity in the past, but that random shots were heard last Friday and  Saturday nights.  </P> <P> Although nobody was injured, "this was new for this end of the valley," said  the woman. "Everybody knows it's gangs. Everybody was told by gang members and  the cops to stay in at night."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Oceanside Unified School District administrators ordered extra  security at El Camino High, which Michele had attended for only a month, and  provided psychologists who help students having emotional problems.  </P> <P> "We don't know whether it (the shooting) was random or not, but we're treating  it with a great deal of caution," said district spokesman Dan Armstrong. "If  there's a neighborhood in turmoil, we don't want it to spill into El Camino."  </P> <P> The district placed unarmed guards at the school's entrances to check everybody  coming and leaving, prohibiting strangers and "making sure they have legitimate  business on campus," Armstrong said.  </P> <P> He said the mood on campus was "tense and somber," with some students  "wondering if it's an isolated thing or a precursor to other incidents."  </P> <P> Although Tate hadn't attended the high school for long, she had already made an  impression. One of her teachers, Sherilyn Gazso, said, "Michele was very sweet  and extremely friendly."  </P> <P> Last year, before she left Lincoln Junior High School, a yearbook indicated  that Tate had been voted "most humorous" by her classmates.  </P> <P> Oceanside police said Tuesday that many pieces are missing in the case.  </P> <P> Department spokesman Luarca said authorities are not sure what kind of weapon  was used, how many rounds were fired or what all the injuries were. Police  suspect a handgun was used, but there were unsubstantiated reports a shotgun  was the weapon. Police believe the suspects were driving a 1984 blue and white  Oldsmobile Cutlass.  </P> <P> Police didn't say why Finouga and Kelly are suspects or what the motive may  have been in the shooting.  </P></p>

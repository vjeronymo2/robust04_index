			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / BNF raises Thorp charges by 3% British Nuclear Fuels has warned foreign customers of its Thorp reprocessing plant that they will face a 3 per cent price increase because of the government's delay in deciding whether to give the plant permission to operate. The final cost of commissioning the plant has risen by Pounds 130m to Pounds 359m because of the delay, according to BNF's October business plan, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times. BNF has sent the business plan to Thorp's overseas customers with 'cost-pass-through' contracts which specify that customers will pay if costs rise above the level budgeted. BNF said yesterday that its customers were anxious for the plant to start soon and that none had challenged the increase in charges. A government announcement that the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which will reprocess used or 'spent' nuclear fuel, will get a licence to start operating is expected before parliament rises at the end of next week. An announcement was planned this week, but the government has been concerned to minimise the chances of environmental pressure groups overturning the decision in the courts. BNF originally expected to press the start button a year ago. Its claims about the delay costs have been contested by environmental groups. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has been most prominent in campaigning against the plant, said yesterday that the business plan raised questions about BNF's claims that the delay was costing money as it showed that much of the costs were passed on to customers. But BNF says that it can reclaim only a third of the total delay costs, which it estimates at more than Pounds 150m. BNF added that because it had cut its workforce while waiting for a licence, the costs of delay - after passing on as much as possible to customers - had fallen to some Pounds 1.5m a week. In June, BNF said that each week of delay cost it Pounds 2.4m. The business plan also shows that even where the cost-pass-through contracts apply, BNF can pass on only some 93 per cent of cost increases. The delay has pushed the cost of reprocessing a kilogramme of uranium fuel from Pounds 721 to Pounds 746 in current money values, a rise of 3.5 per cent. However, unit prices charged to customers have risen from Pounds 852 to Pounds 876, a rise of 2.8 per cent. Greenpeace said: 'There are so many contradictory figures about Thorp's economics. That shows that the only reasonable course of action is a full public inquiry.'</p>

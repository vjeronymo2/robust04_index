			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> END OF A LONG ROAD;  </P> <P> FAMILY'S STRUGGLE TO BE REUNITED WITH ROMANIAN GRANDMOTHER PAYS OFF  </P> <P> It had taken a days-long hunger strike by her family, some unusual bureaucratic  maneuvering, a grueling 10-hour train ride though Romania and a 20-hour  overseas flight to get Livia Groza to the United States. And when the journey  finally ended Tuesday, she headed straight for the kitchen.  </P> <P> Not to eat, but to work. It was her party, but Groza couldn't resist helping  out with a tremendous array of Romanian delicacies that her family had prepared  at their Westminster home to celebrate her long-sought immigration.  </P> <P> Finally, after everyone else had been served, the guest of honor agreed to sit  down. Sampling a piece of soft bread with an amazed look on her face, Groza  whispered to her 9-year-old granddaughter in her native tongue: "In Romania,  the bread is as hard as the table."  </P> <P> It had been a long road to the table.  </P> <P> In late 1984, her son-in-law, 31-year-old Vasile Sofroni, had eluded armed  Romanian border patrol guards and sneaked through trenches to escape what he  calls the oppressive life style of the East Bloc regime. A maintenance worker,  he eventually settled in Westminster and was able to bring his wife, Lia, and  two young children to the United States to be with him.  </P> <P> But Groza was left behind.  </P> <P> For three years, her family in the United States desperately implored U.S.  officials to allow her to immigrate, citing her failing health and inability to  work. Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) offered assistance. But the  Immigration and Naturalization Service rejected her visa application last May,  saying that Groza, now 55, was still young enough to support herself and thus  did not have to be with her family.  </P> <P> So, with traditional immigration routes exhausted, Lia and Vasile Sofroni  camped outside the federal immigration office in Westminster in July and went  on what ended up being an 80-hour hunger strike.  </P> <P> News media publicized their story throughout the Southland. Dornan renewed his  calls for assistance. And outgoing INS Western Regional Commissioner Harold  Ezell appealed directly to higher federal officials for help in the case.  </P> <P> The INS reversed itself. On their second review, federal officials decided that  Groza's poor health and the Romanian government's refusal to let her work after  she had applied for a visa warranted a rarely used humanitarian visa.  </P> <P> "We had all the right ingredients (for a humanitarian) visa," said Dornan aide  Patricia Fanelli, who worked on the Groza immigration for a year and helped  welcome her Tuesday. "It was a very compelling case -- a woman under an  extremely suppressive government, with her family gone, and she's sick and  unable to work."  </P> <P> With her visa finally approved, Groza said a tearful goodby to friends in  Romania, took a 10-hour train ride from her village of Giulvaz to the Romanian  capital of Bucharest, and flew to New York City, where she was met by Vasile  Sofroni. They flew together to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> After withstanding a media onslaught upon arrival at Los Angeles International  Airport, Groza met her daughter and two grandchildren, who arrived late at the  airport and made their way through the crowd to embrace Groza tearfully. "I  feel very, very happy, very lucky," Lia Sofroni said.  </P> <P> The Sofronis are taking a two-week vacation with plans to go to Disneyland, Las  Vegas and San Diego.  </P> <P> But Groza said she doesn't particularly care what they do. "I don't want to go  anywhere. I just want to stay here with my family and be happy," she said in  Romanian.  </P> <P> And she said she has no desire to return to her homeland, wanting instead to  leave the memories behind.  </P> <P> Explained her son-in-law, Vasile Sofroni: "Here, we got everything. There they  stand in line three, four hours for piece of bread. There, if you want to go  from the village to the city, they ask you why you want to go. . . . Here, we  have freedom? Why go back?"  </P></p>

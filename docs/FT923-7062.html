			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Firms take a bullish view of the future  -Andrew Jack considers a survey that shows the profession is still optimistic about its prospects AN INTRIGUING survey doing the rounds of the firms at the moment brings bad news for those who believe there are too many accountants in the world, but mixed blessings for those involved in professional practices. A survey by Lafferty Business Research of the opinions of 66 senior partners in 39 countries and regions is inevitably subjective, but it does provide some useful insights into the machinations of those at the helm of some leading firms. The main impression (as the chart shows) is one of optimism for the future. Asked to project growth over the next five years, most of the partners expected their firms to grow well above the increase in gross domestic product. Mr Jim Butler, senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK and chairman of its worldwide network, said he expected double-digit growth in each year over the decade. Mr Brandon Gough, his opposite number at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, was more circumspect. 'The 1980s saw a particular, perhaps even unique, configuration of events which created rapid growth. We may not see its like again.' Overseas, there is a clear transatlantic division. Partners in North America have been humbled by the severity of the recession. Mr Robert Nason, head of Grant Thornton in the US, says growth will parallel the economic recovery, the degree of which is still unknown. But the worst position appears to be in Scandinavia. The Norwegians in particular are gloomy. Mr Paul Bellamy, head of Grant Thornton in that country, highlights the financial difficulties for firms as a result of the economic crisis in the country, with rising bankruptcies and the dire position of the banking industry. He also stresses the competitive fee pressures from clients, combined with a relaxation in accountants' ethical rules on tendering for contracts. Elsewhere in Europe, partners are more optimistic. Mr Hans-Heinrich Otte, senior partner at BDO Deutsche Warenstreuhand Aktiengesellschaft, says there has been a boom in fee volumes in Germany, driven by the opening up of the former eastern Germany. Requirements for auditing from the end of last year in the new Lander is generating substantial new income. Growth in Eastern Europe is equally strong, although several partners suggest that future expansion may be held in check by the lack of local professionals. There is similar optimism in Portugal. Mr David Sargison, the partner in charge of Arthur Andersen, which dominates the country, stresses it remains a small, underdeveloped market. More companies are coming under the requirement for a legal audit each year, while he believes that other business for the firms will be driven by issues including privatisations, regulation, the adoption of new EC laws, foreign investment, the internationalisation of existing companies, the growth in complexity of the tax system, and expanding demands for information. In general, growth will not be uniform between different parts of the accountancy firms' practices, however. As competition intensifies and demand for new services stabilises, the importance of audit is on the wane almost everywhere. Arthur Andersen even believes it is declining in less mature markets such as Spain, although in Brazil, Mr Ernesto Rubens Gelbcko of Directa BDO sees expansion driven by that country's economic growth, new requirements for auditing, and privatisation work. On the other hand, tax and consulting advice are projected to grow. In the US, partners highlighted demand for additional tax advice in response to fiscal measures taken by the federal government, as well as the financial crises in state and local government. But consulting is widely seen as having the strongest potential for future growth. Partners stress areas such as information technology, electronic data processing, productivity enhancement and environmental services. If there is one concern which dominates partners' minds more than any other, it is litigation. Legal actions and awards continue to rise, according to the survey, driven by both the theory that accountancy firms have 'deep pockets', and by the apparent belief in the role of auditors to detect fraud. Several partners voiced concern about the combination of corporate collapses triggered by the recession, combined with fee competition which might risk compromise on quality of service. Concerns are particularly high in the US and other parts of the developed Anglo-Saxon world. Even in Korea, Mr David Telepak of Young Wha Accounting Corporation worries about the risks. He points out that the country has no indemnity insurance cover available to professional service firms. Yet he expects potential lawsuits to rise in tandem with the number of bankruptcies, the growing sophistication of shareholders and the liberalisation of the financial markets. Litigation is one factor which is likely to drive incorporation. Mr Anthuan Xavier of Simpson Xavier Horwath International in Ireland says he will not be surprised if there are at least two accountancy firms on the Dublin stock exchange by the end of the decade. But KPMG's Mr Jim Butler in London insists by contrast that partnership is right at least for his firm and that it acts in the best interests of the public. Several partners still believe there is scope for a mega-merger between two of the 'big six' firms, notably Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse. A larger number believes some middle-tier firms will unite among themselves, but that smaller firms which are not affiliated to international networks will disappear over the next few years. 'Times are going to be much tougher than the firms realise,' says Mr Michael Lafferty, who co-ordinated the analysis. World Accounting Forecast - 1992. Lafferty Business Research.

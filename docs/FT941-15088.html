			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt As Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer said on Friday last week, German interest rates will not stay at current levels 'for longer than necessary'. How long that will be remains open, but the remarks rekindled speculation that the German central bank will deliver its long-awaited rate cut on Thursday, when the policy-making council holds its second meeting of the year. Ahead of the meeting, investors' attention will be focused on currency developments. The D-Mark's weakness against the US dollar helped drive bund prices down sharply on Friday and investors will treat any signs of a strengthening US economy - implying the need for higher rates in the US - as bad news for bunds. It may be that currency considerations will restrict Mr Tietmeyer's freedom to ease the Lombard and discount rates from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent respectively, even if preliminary January inflation data (due towards the end of week) suggest a cut is justified on domestic grounds. Even if the D-Mark remains stable against the US dollar, economists said the Bundesbank would be unlikely to deliver more than a 0.25 per cent cut in the discount rate. There was scope for bund yields to drop from current levels in the first half of the year but the fall was not likely to be dramatic, they said.</p>

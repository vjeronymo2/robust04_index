At the talks, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov and  Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Fukuda exchanged wide-ranging  views on international issues and the situation in the  Asia-Pacific region, and discussed bilateral issues. At the  talks they also discussed future steps the two countries should  take to conclude a peace treaty, and ways to resolve bilateral  issues. Moscow Radio commentator Yuriy Afonin comments on the  outcome of the talks:    [Begin recording] The talks drew a great deal of attention  in both Russia and Japan because they were held to exchange  views between the two countries for the first time since  President Yeltsin visited Japan. The world is now faced with  many important issues. One of the issues is the Russian  parliamentary elections that resulted in concerns over Russia's  future foreign policy. At the talks, both sides affirmed the  validity of an agreement that was signed by the leaders of  Russia and Japan when President Yeltsin visited Japan last  October. In other words, both sides affirmed a genuine  partnership between the two countries. With the Moscow talks,  Russia-Japan political dialogue has now entered a new stage and  set the future direction of Russia-Japan relations. At the  talks both sides agreed in principle that Foreign Minister Hata  will visit Russia in March this year to hold talks with his  Russian counterpart in accordance with a Tokyo Declaration  provision on the revitalization of political dialogue between  the two countries. The schedule for Foreign Minister Hata's  visit to Russia is to be decided through diplomatic channels.    It can be said that preparations have now begun for  improving  Russia-Japan relations. At the talks, both sides agreed to hold  a meeting of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee on  Economy, Science and Technology in April, at the earliest. The  talks focused on discussion of ways to conclude a peace treaty.  The two countries should consistently take steps toward  resolving bilateral issues in order to normalize their  relations. The two countries also should cooperate closely in  deepening mutual understanding between their people, and in  creating a good environment in the two countries. The two  countries will prepare proposals aimed at reaching agreement on  certain issues when Foreign Minister Hata visits Russia. The  closeness and similarity of the two countries' positions on  international matters and issues in the Asia-Pacific region are  of great significance to the future of relations between Russia  and Japan. This will serve to expand their cooperation in the  United Nations and the international community, just as they  cooperated in Cambodia.    There are many common positions between Russia and Japan on  the issue of the Korean peninsula. The two countries will also  attend a conference on ASEAN security in Bangkok in July this  year. At the Moscow talks, both sides agreed on a common  approach to the issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region.  It can be said that the Russia-Japan vice foreign ministerial  talks took a concrete step toward strengthening the relations of  trust between the two countries.    These are my comments on the on-going Russia-Japan dialogue.  [end recording]</p>

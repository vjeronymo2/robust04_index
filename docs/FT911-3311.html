			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: ACIL sells 6.6% stake in Nine Network AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), formerly Bell Resources, yesterday sold a 6.6 per cent stake in Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network for ADollars 55m (USDollars 42.3m), cutting its holding to around 15 per cent. The sale conflicted with an undertaking given to the Australian Stock Exchange in February that ACIL had no plans to reduce its shareholding in Nine Network, formerly part of Mr Alan Bond's Bond Media. However, ACIL is understood to have decided to reduce its stake to help fund its acquisition of 50 per cent of National Brewing Holdings, formerly Bond Brewing. Bond Brewing was sold to a joint venture between ACIL and Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer, as part of a sale of the assets of Bond Corporation, Mr Bond's flagship company, which is being restructured. ACIL had hoped to finance payments due to Lion Nathan as part of the deal without reducing its holding in Nine, but recently reported an interim loss of ADollars 90m. Mr Colin Henson, an ACIL director, said the proceeds of the sale of Nine Network shares would be used for 'internal funding requirements,' but declined to give details. He said there were no plans to dispose of the rest of ACIL's holding in the Nine Network, which was regarded as 'a long-term investment'. Shares in the Nine Network have doubled in value since the company was acquired eight months ago by Consolidated Press Holdings (Conspress), Mr Packer's privately-owned master company. The shares closed 2 cents higher on the day at 58 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday. ACIL shares closed 1 cent higher at 22 cents. Conspress, which has a controlling 38.8 per cent stake in Nine Network, has also given an undertaking to the stock exchange that it has no plans to reduce its holding.</p>

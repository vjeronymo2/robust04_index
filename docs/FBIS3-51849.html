			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Trench" newscast] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] Secretary General Daniel Ortega Saavedra met with  Sandinist members in Leon and Chinandega, where they discussed  the preparations for their convention in May.    Ortega told the rank-and-file it is necessary to restructure  from committees within departmental municipalities all the way  up to the National Assembly. He said if it is necessary to make  changes in the National Directorate to recover the trust of  members, it should be done. Ortega added that from now on, the  FSLN's work must focus on paving the way to returning to power  in the 1996 elections. He said Sandinists cannot allow  outsiders who want to take advantage by pretending to be  possible candidates because it is very dangerous and the  rank-and-file must remain vigilant.    Ortega told Sandinists gathered in the [words indistinct]  the  National Autonomous University of Nicaragua that they should  support the transportation strike because the government's  economic measures are affecting the cost of living. He said  violence should be avoided. He mentioned a communique, which  has been attributed to an organization of rearmed individuals  who call themselves the armed division of the drivers, and he  said that this can be viewed as a provocation.    Daniel Ortega categorically rejected the presence of the  U.S.  DEA in Nicaragua. He said the DEA's actions of interdiction  operations against cocaine traffickers violated Nicaragua's  sovereignty. In addition, Ortega noted that the DEA's actions  are very dangerous because at any moment, there might be up to  20,000 armed men in Nicaragua under the pretext of pursuing drug  traffickers.    In the case of Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna, Ortega accused the  government of Honduran President Rafael Callejas of lying and  being an accomplice. Ortega said that when Callejas came to  Nicaragua, he already knew who had murdered Cruz Laguna, and  Ortega criticized President Chamorro's government for decorating  Callejas.</p>

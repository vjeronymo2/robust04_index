			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Taxmen clamp down on holiday lettings TAX inspectors are clamping down on the generous tax breaks for letting holiday homes. No cases have yet reached court but the scale of the battle is clear. Several breaks were allowed in an attempt to boost tourism in the 1980s. One allows losses on holiday lets to be offset against the owner's income. But there are a number of strict conditions; for example, the property must be available for commercial letting to the public as holiday accommodation for at least 140 days in a 12-month period, and the letting period must be for at least 70 days. Losses are incurred easily in a time of high interest rates and recession, but the Inland Revenue does not seem to take this into account when deciding if the letting is 'commercial.' Definitions of this term have sometimes been narrowed to the point where some taxpayers were told they were not trading commercially since they did not show a profit in their first year. This meant being stripped of all the benefits of special treatment, including unlimited mortgage interest relief on the property. Accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn has had a lot of trouble with loss-making holiday lettings, according to personal tax partner Andrew Tappin. He detects a hardening Revenue attitude. 'They are saying that if a profit is not made within a couple of years, then, by definition, the business cannot be operating on a commercial basis and, therefore, the special reliefs and rules do not apply. It's against the spirit of the rules.' Tappin has had to argue very strongly with inspectors in several disputes. And he warns: 'It is important to show you have thought about making a go of letting before you started. Lay the groundwork. Have some figures ready showing what rents you think you can get and how many weeks you can let for.' He believes the Revenue's real aim in tightening up is to stop people abusing the rules by borrowing up to the hilt to buy a retirement or second home and taking what lettings they can get with no prospect of getting into profit for five or 10 years. 'The trouble is, it is time-consuming to argue and expensive if you have professional advisers,' Tappin says. 'The Revenue not infrequently wins the day because the taxpayer just gives up.' At another accountant, Glazers, partner Russell Black said one inspector had defined 'commercial' explicitly as 'profitable.' Black added: 'He was really saying you that can't have relief for a loss because you haven't made a profit. If there is a provision for relief of losses, it must be possible for a commercial operation to make a loss.' Black suggested that in the absence of any case law on the subject, much could depend on individual inspectors, although profitability by the second or third year seemed to be considered acceptable. Accountant Robson Rhodes is arguing with an inspector who has questioned the status of a Suffolk country cottage which has shown losses on holiday letting for the past three years. 'The client has tried to carry on the business with a view to commerciality,' said the firm's tax manager, Martin Sands. 'The Revenue stance is that the income that could be obtained must have been known at the outset and, because expenditure has exceeded income by a substantial amount, the place could never have been let on a commercial basis.' Sands noted that while the Revenue had been happy to accept the first three years' losses - which it was not seeking to alter - it now was taking a much tougher line. In reply, the firm was putting forward proof that the client was doing his best to trade commercially by cutting back spending on improvements or replacement furniture. A Revenue spokesman denied there was any special drive against holiday home-owners. He referred to tax law specifying that loss relief in the first four years 'shall not be given unless the trade (letting) is carried on a commercial basis and in such a way that the profits . . . can reasonably be expected to be realised in the period (of assessment) or within a reasonable time thereafter.' No definition of 'reasonable' is supplied. In later years, he said, relief would not be allowed unless the letting was 'on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits in the trade.' He added: 'Inspectors would look for a person running a letting as a business to produce commercial projections of the sort they would need if getting a loan to set up a business.' Otherwise, he suggested, owners might well be trying to subsidise their own holiday home or use the tax privileges to finance property bought for investment. As for the recession, he noted: 'Inspectors will be aware of the general economic conditions. The law is there, it has not changed, and inspectors need to apply the law as it stands.'</p>

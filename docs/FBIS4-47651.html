			<p>BFN     [Text] The disarmament of the civilian population in  Burundi is creating some tension. Disarmament was agreed on 22  April by the political and military authorities. Its  enforcement was supposed to start on 24 April at 1800. Because  of some objections, however, the disarmament operation had to be  postponed, especially in the area of Kamenge, north of  Bujumbura, where there are apparently some problems. However,  yesterday the security forces were given an order to carry out  the disarmament operation. Here is Burundi Foreign Minister  Jean-Marie Ngendahayo:    [Begin Ngendahayo recording] Last night the army and the  people of Kamenge exchanged fire. Only this morning the people  living in Kamenge started to be evacuated. Thousands of people  are today leaving Kamenge. As you know they are being gathered  at a stadium in Bujumbura. We are trying -- with the help of  ministers, of the army's high-ranking officials, the  International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR, and other  partners of Burundi -- to place them under the responsibility of  well-known leaders so that once the search in Kamenge is over  these people, these very same people, can immediately return to  Kamenge. There will be people responsible for each and every  street so that order will be kept by the very people living  there. [end recording]</p>

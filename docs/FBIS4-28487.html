			<p>BFN     [Text] A draft plan for the revision of business merger  guidelines compiled by the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is  advantageous to companies in that it makes it easier for them to  formulate business strategies for the promotion of restructuring  (business reconstruction) through a merger. The current  guidelines are under criticism because "they are so abstract  that it is difficult to understand in what cases firms will be  allowed to enter a merger." Responding to this criticism, the  FTC has decided to review the guidelines. However, because the  revision is not aimed at easing standards for authorizing  mergers, the industries will likely air their dissatisfaction.    The draft plan has clarified that "a 25-percent market  share"  is a standard for classifying mergers subject to FTC  examination. Although the clarification is to remove the  misunderstanding that "a 25-percent market share is a criterion  for approving of mergers," this will also help allay the anxiety  of companies planning mergers.    The draft plan has also mentioned that import volume will be  taken into consideration in deciding whether or not a merger  violates the Antimonopoly Law. This will enable firms to tell  the FTC that "although our market shares are high at present,  competition will not be restricted as a result of our merger  because we plan to increase imports from now on."    Meanwhile, some industries are calling for clarifying the  guidelines and easing classification standards to improve  circumstances for restructuring.    However, the FTC is negative about complying with this call,  saying: "If we relax standards, competition will be restricted  in many cases as a result of mergers."</p>

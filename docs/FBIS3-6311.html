			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 16 (KCNA) -- The seventh  working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys  between the North and the South was held behind closed doors at  the Tongil House in the northern portion of Panmunjom today.    At the end of the contact the head of the North side's  delegation briefed home and foreign reporters on the contact  here.    According to him, the North side at the contact urged the  South side to accept the reasonable proposal it had made at the  sixth contact, a proposal to announce in a joint communique that  the sides confirmed again each other's will for the exchange of  special envoys and agreed on their early exchange. At today's  contact it also proposed to the South side to clinch the  discussion of working procedures on the basis of the  North-tabled "Agreement on the Exchange of Presidential Envoys  Between the North and the South" and sign the agreement.    The South side, however, repeated trite words this time,  too.  It categorically objected to the North side's proposal of  publishing a joint communique and to its suggestion that the  questions of observing the principle of national independence,  deciding on the way of national reunification and of promoting  the great unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the draft  agreement with regard to the mission of special envoys.    Drawing attention to the fact that the South side's  "minister  of the unification board" yesterday officially predicted that  Wednesday's working-level contact would end in failure, the  North side said this remark itself showed a very dangerous  position.    Much upset, the South side tried to parry it with the  subterfuge that reporters gave a wrong account of what the  "minister of the unification board" said.    The process of the contact today clearly showed that the  South side was taking a stand to put the brakes on the third  round of DPRK-USA talks by deliberately creating difficulties in  the way of discussion of working matters for the exchange of  special envoys.    It was agreed to have the next, 8th working contact in the  Southern portion of Panmunjom on March 19.</p>

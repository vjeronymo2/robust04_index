			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Japan's Aggressive Design" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Foolish is the design of  the Japanese authorities to dominate Korea and the rest of Asia  again, declares NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article Sunday.    Noting that the Japanese ruling circles are now making haste  with the preparations for "security emergency legislation  arrangements," the article says:    "The security emergency legislation arrangements" mean the  enactment of a wartime law which would allow Japan to take part  in the war immediately after the United States started it in  Korea.    This is a dangerous move to lay a legal foundation for  overseas aggression and, on this basis, stage a military  comeback to Korea.    The Japanese reactionaries are scheming reinvasion of Korea,  availing themselves of the tension mounting on the Korean  peninsula due to the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK. They are  now crying for "the security of Japan," while spreading the  rumor that a war will be started by the North in Korea in no  time. This is aimed at drumming up support from the Japanese  people for the enactment of the wartime law.    Their intention to enact the wartime law is related to their  dominationist, aggressive design not only on Korea but also on  the rest of Asia.    They seek to dispatch their aggression forces to Korea and  any other regions of Asia under the pretext of "emergency" by  formulating the law.    Though dozens of years have passed since the end of World  War  II, the Japanese reactionaries have not yet honestly reflected  on their past crimes and apologized for them, because they  remain captive to the ambition to dominate Korea and other Asian  nations again.    If Japan choose aggression and war again, failing to draw a  lesson from their defeat in the past, it would suffer a more  miserable defeat.</p>

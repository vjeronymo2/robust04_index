			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS ASSISTANCE  </P> <P> As you noted in your editorial ("Do's and Don'ts of Budgeting," Sept. 15),  Congress has overwhelmingly authorized disaster relief for those cities hardest  hit by the AIDS epidemic and assistance to all 50 states to develop more  cost-efficient programs of AIDS care. However, in the continuing budget  standoff, the actual appropriation of the funds needed to enact these critical  programs is in jeopardy.  </P> <P> While the federal government has made a substantial investment in HIV research  and prevention, spending for AIDS care and treatment remains utterly  inadequate. Congress and the President should carefully assess the much higher  costs of allowing urban health care systems to collapse.  </P> <P> It has been clearly demonstrated that AIDS care can be delivered at  substantially lower cost -- through early treatment, ambulatory medical  services and home care. These are the programs that the Ryan White AIDS Care  Act will make possible. The most costly mistake of all is continued inaction.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH TAYLOR  </P> <P> Founding National Chairman  </P> <P> American Foundation for AIDS Research  </P> <P> New York  </P></p>

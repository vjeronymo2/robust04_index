			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Forex losses hit Novo Nordisk results FOREIGN exchange losses marred the first-half performance of Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceuticals and enzymes manufacturer. Pre-tax profits fell by 16 per cent to DKr788m (Dollars 113.34m) from DKr941m in the same period last year. Sales advanced 6 per cent to DKr5.73bn from DKr5.38bn, while profits before financial items were down by 3 per cent to DKr864m from DKr887m, according to the group's first-half interim statement. But DKr160m in foreign exchange losses contributed to converting net financial income of DKr54m last year to a net loss this year of DKr74m. With estimated corporate income tax down by 34 per cent, however, net profits fell by 8 per cent to DKr595m from DKr649m. Earnings per share were down to DKr15.87 from DKr17.42. The pre-tax profit figure was in line with expectations by Copenhagen brokers.</p>

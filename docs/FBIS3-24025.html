			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head of </F> Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of  Geological Sciences: "Consultation With Geologists Needed To  Avoid Mistakes"; place and date not given]    [Text] We received a letter from Poltava's Zelenyy  Svit [Green World] Association expressing alarm over  uncontrolled development of nuclear energy in Ukraine.  "Ukraine's citizens want answers: Where are they going to store  highly radioactive wastes adding up to 30-40 kilograms per tonne  of spent fuel? Will they be safe during transport? Have the  scientific problems of storing the wastes in Ukraine been worked  out?" Ways to safeguard the wastes are the subject of our  correspondent's interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head  of the Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences  Institute of Geological Sciences.    [Correspondent] Dmytro Pavlovych, how urgent is the problem  of storing radioactive wastes in Ukraine?    [Khrushchov] The basic source of such wastes here is the  operation of AESes [nuclear power plants], also the fallout from  the Chernobyl AES disaster. According to experts of DKBYaE  [State Committee on the Use of Nuclear Energy], the amount of  radioactive wastes subject to burial in deep geologic formations  by the year 2010 will be about 60,000 cubic meters. Plans used  to call for sending the wastes to Russia for processing, but now  Russia has a law banning the burial of wastes from other  countries, so now we even have to take back the wastes we sent  there earlier. There's really only one way to solve the problem:  bury the hazardous material in our territory in suitable  geologic formations capable of keeping it safely isolated from  the biosphere.    [Correspondent] How are other countries handling the  problem?    [Khrushchov] Many countries have been researching and  experimenting with the problem for 20 to 30 years; the work is  laborious and takes considerable capital investment. Active work  is going on in France, England, and Spain, and Canada and  Belgium have underground laboratories. Meanwhile, the practice  is to place the wastes in special mine shafts for long-term  storage. Germany has an experimental program of burying  medium-radioactive wastes in salt strata. Other countries are  looking into similar possibilities available to them: the Finns  are studying granite strata in the Baltic Shield, the Dutch are  looking into salt. The U.S. has excellent prospects in that  regard in Nevada's Yucca Mountains, where the rocks and climate  are right (very dry) and there are no local population problems,  as they were moved out long ago because of nuclear weapons  testing.    [Correspondent] What are Ukraine's prospects?    [Khrushchov] Ukraine has several options. A large part of  its  territory is on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, and the  Dnieper-Donets Depression has clay strata and salt. But it's  hard to make the final choice. Problems of isolating and burying  radioactive wastes in Ukraine's geologic formations have been  discussed many times in recent years at inter-departmental  meetings of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, the State  Committee on Geology, the Education Ministry, and also  specialists from the DKVYaE, the Nuclear Energy Inspectorate,  and the Enerhoproekt [Energy Planning and Designing] Institute.  In March 1993 the problem was discussed at a conference of the  Ukraine Supreme Council Commissionon on Higher Education and  Science, which confirmed the need for integrated research and  the formulation of an appropriate state program.    Now that program has been formulated, and these are its  stages:    I (1993-1995). Formulation of the conceptual  principles and allocation of promising areas for reconnaisance  work and selection of test sites.    II (1996-2004). Study of regional, zonal, and  local conditions; forecasting of the consequences of the  construction and operation of underground radioactive waste  isolation facilities.    III (2005-2010). Preparation of the construction  and experimental operation of facilities.    [Correspondent] What do you think of the possibility of  using  nuclear blasts to make such storage places?    [Khrushchov] At first I was tempted to try it. It would be  so  convenient--bang, and there's your facility. After detailed  study, however, we decided the explosions would cause fissures,  so we had to look for other ways. And we found them.    [Correspondent] We've been talking about AES wastes. How  about other kinds, for example military wastes?    [Khrushchov] I don't actually know how things stand. I do  know about the burial of military wastes in salt mines in the  U.S., but I haven't had contacts with our own military.    [Correspondent] Can the same methods be used in burying  toxic  wastes?    [Khrushchov] The situation is more complex. Radioactive  wastes do eventually cease being radioactive, but toxic wastes  never do. I'm worried by the way some nonprofessionals try to  solve these problems at one stroke. We need to make a sound  choice between two approaches--processing and storage. Recently  I was visited by colleagues from Russia who are developing a  variant of toxic waste burial in the potassium mines of the  Pre-Urals. Their concept is not bad, but I did criticize some  approaches.    [Correspondent] A final question. What do you think of the  idea of burial sites where the area is already contaminated--the  30-kilometer zone?    [Khrushchov] No way! It's foolhardy. Ideas like that stem  from ignorance of geological conditions. We can only talk of  burying low- and medium-radioactive wastes. We need to consult  with scientists in order to avoid mistakes!</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (14): Rapidly expanding group - Profile of FLS FLS, Denmark's largest industrial conglomerate, is something of a mystery. With more than 20,000 employees and an annual turnover of DKr12.6bn, the group is market leader in some of its sectors, yet remains largely unknown in the wider world. Part of the reason for its obscurity is the unusual range of industrial areas in which FLS operates. For example, the group's largest activity is cement manufacturing equipment, a sector in which it is world leader, enjoying between 50 to 60 per cent of the market. Most of its remaining operations emanate from this core business. Environmental services, building materials, packaging, and services such as freight forwarding and finance all derive from the cement equipment business. The group has been expanding rapidly. Since 1987, FLS sales have more than doubled, assisted by a massive annual investment programme of DKr1.4bn spent on capital projects and acquisitions. Recently, however, FLS has made a strategic move away from its core area, diversifying into the aerospace sector and raising the profile of the company. The diversification follows a restructuring of the group, boosting efficiency and generating the necessary cash-flow to move into the new area. Mr Birger Riisager, president and chief executive, explains: 'FLS in the early 1980s was a large group with a parent company that just wasn't on its toes. It was incapable of working out where it was making and losing money.' In 1987 headquarters staff was cut to only 40 people. Top management was overhauled and reduced from 25 to only 10. Many of these were new appointees from outside the company or further down the organisation. Operating companies were given far greater freedom to make their own decisions. At the same time, the cement equipment business was reorganised into seven divisions, moving responsibility down the organisation, says Mr Riisager. This freedom helped the group internationalise, particularly into south-east Asia, which is now one of the few markets still growing. The cement equipment operations were given a further boost in 1990 when it acquired Fuller, one of its main competitors in the US. The cement equipment business is the most important and now most profitable part of the group, claims Mr Riisager, making about 45 per cent of group profits. The business has survived the recession in Europe and the US well, by concentrating on south-east Asia and south and central America. Meanwhile, some of the operations emanating from cement continue to perform well. Miljo, for example, the environmental protection business, is enjoying exceptional growth, says Mr Riisager. The company develops, designs and markets complete flue gas cleaning systems for the power, incineration, cement and paper and pulp industries. Mr Riisager says Miljo's sales were only about DKr200m in 1989 and he expects them to reach DKr1bn this year. FLS's freight forwarding business, Dan Transport, is also doing well, although Mr Riisager admits its success is strange given the bad state of the freight market. Sales increased from DKr1.2bn in 1990 to DKr1.6bn last year. Mr Riisager says the subsidiary is highly profitable. Some FLS businesses are suffering from the recession, however. The depressed state of the building market in Denmark has hit its building materials business. Similarly, the demand for FLS polyethylene packaging has been hit. The company is the fourth-largest European manufacturer of polyethylene sacks. Demand has collapsed in Europe by as much as 40 per cent. Mr Riisager admits that many of the group's businesses are mature, with little prospect of big growth. This was recognised in 1987, when the FLS had recovered from a loss of DKr200m four years earlier, but was still only generating profits of DKr73m. This lack of growth explains why FLS decided to move into the aerospace sector. From virtually nothing in 1988, the company has become the largest independent third-party aircraft maintenance contractor. 'We had a small ground support equipment company in the UK, and Lovaux, a British group, approached us to buy the business. 'We decided to buy Lovaux for DKr150m instead.' says Mr Riisager. He says the industry was growing extremely rapidly, but was not structured at all, consisting mainly of small and medium-sized businesses. Large airlines needed to go to lots of different companies for their maintenance needs. In January 1991, the group acquired the engineering division of Dan Air, the troubled UK airline, for Pounds 27.5m. Dan Air's business only had one wide-body hanger, so FLS started planning a new one, says Mr Riisager. However, FFV, another aircraft maintenance business, Swedish-owned but mainly operating in the UK, also became available during the autumn of 1991. FFV had hangers at Stansted and Manchester, each capable of handling two Boeing 747s. FLS's spending spree was launched just as the aviation industry was entering its worst down-turn since the Second World War. Mr Riisager admits the market remains difficult, with about 10 per cent of the world's aircraft fleet parked in the Californian desert. However, he reckons the market will move back to normal next year, although six months ago he thought it would be this year. The businesses have been reorganised into an engineering outfit based in Stansted, an aerospace support operation at Gatwick supplying components to airlines and FLS Aerospace Lovaux whose activities range from design and production of light aircraft, to manufacture of ground support equipment and military aircraft maintenance. United Airlines and Continental of the US have both recently signed contracts with the division. Dan Air has also extended its three-year contract for a total of six years.</p>

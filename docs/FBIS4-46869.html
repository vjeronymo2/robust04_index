			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Doctor of Economic Sciences </F> Volodymyr Chernyak by S. Slyusarevska: "How to `Cure'  Inflation"; place and date not given]    [Text] Professor Doctor of Economic Sciences  Volodymyr Chernyak, the outstanding scientist and politician,  talks with journalist S. Slyusarevska about his conception of  anti-inflation policy.    [Slyusarevska] Our economy is badly ailing. One of its  ailments is inflation. Various ways to "cure it" have been  proposed. In your opinion, Volodymyr Kyrylovych, what is the  distinguishing feature of a method of "curing" inflation?    [Chernyak] The nature of the inflation. A particular set of  "cures" should be used depending on the nature of the inflation.  Spending inflation requires one kind, demand inflation requires  another. In our case, spending inflation has combined with  demand inflation, although spending inflation predominates. In  Ukraine, inflation is of a monetary, structural, and  institutional character. Hence, the Ukrainian version of  inflation has a very complex nature. Hence, the "cure" for  inflation has to be integrated, consistent, and specific. The  situation requires a combination of "cures." Ukraine's  anti-inflation policy has to combine monetary and nonmonetary  methods (with emphasis on the latter, I believe). There has been  too little effort to limit the amount of money in circulation  (to restrain monetary and credit emissions and uncontrolled  wages), and in any case that is not the decisive condition for  curbing inflation. It would be sufficient if inflation was  merely a monetary process. Hence, the ineffectiveness of purely  monetary methods of curbing inflation in Ukraine is an objective  fact.    [Slyusarevska] By the way, what is the level of inflation in  Ukraine right now, and what tendencies are apparent?    [Chernyak] Inflation in 1993 added up to 4619 percent. In  that regard, Ukraine ranked second in the world after  Yugoslavia. Toward the end of last year, inflation ran as high  as 80 to 100 percent per month. Starting early this year,  however, the rate dropped substantially: retail prices rose by  19.2 percent in January, 12.6 percent in February, and 5.7  percent in March. That effect was gained through purely monetary  methods--stopping the issuance of bank notes (as a result of  which wages were not paid regularly) and implementing a tough  credit policy (as a result of which mutual settlements between  enterprises practically halted). Naturally, it is impossible to  go on for long not paying wages and not extending credit, and as  soon as the taboo is lifted the inflation spiral begins anew.  Monetary measures produce an effect swiftly, but it vanishes  just as quickly.    We need nonstandard, nontraditional solutions. In  particular,  nonmonetary methods of curbing inflation--more specifically, a  combination of monetary and nonmonetary methods. Monetary  methods alone tend to suppress demand and paralyze the incentive  to work and invest.    [Slyusarevska] Now let's find out what the causes of  inflation in Ukraine are.    [Chernyak] Indeed, in order to cure an illness you have to  treat its causes, not its symptoms. The basic culprits of  inflation in our country are not rising wages or even monetary  and credit emissions but rather the shortage of goods, declining  productivity, the lack of effective incentives to work,  structural distortions of the economy, monopolism and  corruption. Although, to be sure, we cannot discount monetary  and credit emissions, subsidies and indexation of earnings.    [Slyusarevska] In your view, what has been our government's  biggest mistake in anti-inflation policy in the past few years?    [Chernyak] If we can talk about any anti-inflation policy of  our government at all, we must point out that over the past two  years it has been oriented toward freezing wages and controlling  enterprise consumption funds--hence, restraining effective  demand. This is definitely in conflict with our realities.    [Slyusarevska] What would the right thing be?    [Chernyak] As I have said, spending inflation predominates  here. Yet the policy which the government and the National Bank  have been conducting is more suitable to demand inflation. An  element of anti-inflation policy such as suppressing effective  demand works effectively only where there is a market, and not  just a market but a buyer's rather than a producer's market. But  conditions here are quite otherwise today. Therefore,  suppressing demand as an element of anti-inflation policy must  be relegated to the background. Let me emphasize that while I do  not deny its importance overall, I am merely pointing out that  the emphasis has to be placed correctly. In our situation,  prices on goods are not going down despite weak demand.  Depressed demand is one of the causes of declining production.  All countries having a developed market economy try to stimulate  rather than suppress demand. So we will have to apply different  tools of anti-inflation policy.    [Slyusarevska] Which, specifically?    [Chernyak] The development of the production of goods and  services must serve as the foundation of anti-inflation policy.  We face the necessity of simultaneously stopping the decline in  production and rising prices. As a rule, just one thing happens  in the world--either prices go up, or production volumes go  down. In our case, however, there is an ominous combination of  processes which economic scientists call "stagflation" (that is,  a combination of stagnation and inflation). Therefore, the most  effective anti-inflation measure today would be to boost the  production of consumer goods. The main thing is to saturate the  market with goods, and everything else will follow.    [Slyusarevska] But how is that to be done? As they say, the  spirit is willing but the flesh is weak....    [Chernyak] By designing effective incentives to work and  invest. This is possible on the basis of privatization in  various forms, the creation of an environment fostering the  development of entrepreneurship, liberalization of foreign  economic activities, as well as promoting stabilization--that  is, establishing a finance system--all of which requires changes  in monetary, budget, tax, and credit policies. Primarily,  anti-inflation measures are those which foster the development  of the production of goods, making it more effective and  competitive.    [Slyusarevska] This question would seem to merit more  elaboration.    [Chernyak] Our main problem is production (to which, owing  to  disastrous anti-inflation policies, we must also add the problem  of sales) rather than inflation. The development of production  is closely linked to transformations in ownership relations,  including ownership of the means of production, land, and  property, the formation of market mechanisms and the development  of entrepreneurship, and restructuring of the economy  (eliminating structural disproportions on the macro-level and  streamlining [sanatsiya] enterprises on the micro-level). Any  anti-inflation policy can be successful only on the basis of  privatization. Privatization is an anti-inflation measure  because, first of all, it fosters the designing of effective  incentives to work and invest, and, second, it serves as a  source of revenue for local and state budgets. It is possible to  balance money and goods only on the basis of structural shifts  in favor of the production of consumer goods rather than by  raising prices and freezing wages. Incidentally, the only  inflation that is dangerous is the kind that doesn't work to  effect restructuring of the economy.    [Slyusarevska] Hence, structural policy also requires the  rethinking of certain changes. What ones, specifically?    [Chernyak] We're talking about changes in structural policy  which must include these basic directions: the releasing of  energy, raw materials, financial, and labor resources from the  extractive sectors and the military-industrial complex and  channeling them into the production of food and other consumer  goods in order to bring the economy's consumption sector out of  its crisis; instituting of a complex of measures to supply the  economy with fuel and energy resources (expanding exploration  work, creating joint stock companies to boost the output of  petroleum on our own territory and in the oil and gas regions of  other countries, the construction of a tanker fleet and oil  terminals, rebuilding of oil refineries, making use of  alternative energy sources, and implementing an active energy  and resource conservation policy).    I would also include these things among necessary changes in  structural policy: the development of science-intensive and  ecologically clean industries and the enhancement of our export  potential and production of goods to trade for imports. Any  structural policy can be effective only on the basis of  activating innovation and investment activity, the material  basis of which is the development of investment  machine-building, which has been badly neglected. Imported  equipment can improve the technological structure of capital  investments. To the foregoing we must add the following:  measures that are anti-inflationary are those linked to the  creation of a competitive environment. Hence, anti-monopoly  policies are anti-inflationary at the same time.    [Slyusarevska] Among measures of anti-inflation policy, what  importance do you assign to the streamlining of production?    [Chernyak] High priority. What is needed is a scalpel in a  firm hand, and let's not forget that there must be trust in that  hand. And let's not forget the anesthesia. It is obvious that we  have to give up on supporting inefficient enterprises and design  a mechanism for financial bankruptcy. The longer we avoid  dealing with this problem the worse things get. Applying the  financial and credit system to the process of supporting  enterprises' artificial solvency only serves to foster inflation  swings. Let me emphasize that bankruptcy may constitute  retribution, but under our conditions enterprises frequently go  bankrupt as a result of depreciation of their own reserves, a  shortage of circulating capital, excessive interest on their  loans, and nonpayments (a nonpayment crisis provokes inflation).  When instituting streamlining, of course, we need to see to it  that its negative social consequences are neutralized as far as  possible (in particular, unemployment).    One essential condition for enterprise streamlining is the  abolition of state orders as interpreted by the Cabinet of  Ministers. The only thing that should be preserved is the state  contract between enterprises and state clients which pay for  orders from state resources (or credits). We need to allow banks  to accept state property as collateral, so that if the  enterprise is unable to pay, the banks can sell the property for  the market price. The problem of streamlining is closely linked  to privatization (bankruptcy is a form of privatization). To  overcome inflation we need to bring the main elements of the  national wealth into commodity circulation--the means of  production, state property, and land.    [Slyusarevska] What role is assigned to reducing the state  budget deficit in implementing anti-inflation policy?    [Chernyak] In 1993, the budget deficit stood at 25 percent  of  the gross domestic product, which is higher than in any of the  neighboring post-socialist countries. Ukraine has a chance to  wind up in the "Guinness Book of World Records." And because the  budget deficit is a cause of inflation, reducing it and  balancing revenues and expenditures constitute a vital direction  in anti-inflation policy. State budget revenues can be increased  by formulating and implementing an effective new taxation  system, liquidating unjustified tax breaks and changing tax  rates in order to stimulate business, also improving the work of  the tax inspectorate; introducing land taxes and fees for  natural resources; revising taxes on citizens' property and  individual income which are not invested in production;  converting to settlements for exported goods in world market  prices; introducing economically justified tariffs on foreign  goods transported over Ukrainian territory; and introducing  state securities to make up for the budget deficit. In order to  reduce the expenditure portion of the budget it is necessary to  liquidate budget loans and subsidies to losing enterprises,  reduce the number and size of sectorial ministries and their  departments and local agencies, abolish budget loans and  financing of capital investments of enterprises, revise certain  social programs, restrict migration into Ukraine by pensioners  from other countries, and include the pension fund and social  insurance fund in the budget. Under present conditions, it is  useful to draw up the budget quarterly, because the financial  system is virtually destroyed.    [Slyusarevska] What about wages? Rising wages are also a  cause of inflation.    [Chernyak] Yes, but not the main one. Rising wages are a  cause of inflation when they are paid for by means of monetary  emissions--that is, when the wage dynamic is divorced from the  production dynamic. Hence, we need a correlation between the  size of wages and the dynamic of production as well as the  dynamic of prices. One mechanism for slowing wages can be  taxation. Therefore, wages need to be indexed, and control over  enterprises' consumption funds must be abolished.    [Slyusarevska] Let's discuss the controversial question of  credit. Should credit be cheap or costly?    [Chernyak] It is hard to give an unequivocal answer. In  order  to provide sufficient credit to the economy, of course, we need  to increase rather than reduce credit resources. What I have in  mind is mobilizing real credit resources. Credit should be  granted primarily on the basis of collateral, which will require  the institution of a lien law. The national economy can be  restructured only on the basis of credit and tax breaks. Hence,  we need to combine a tough financial policy with respect to  existing production facilities, on the one hand, and a policy of  cheap credit for the restructuring of the economy, on the other.  Generally, demand inflation is generally "treated" with costly  credit, but what we have, keep in mind, is spending inflation. I  would say that the essence of the problem is not excessive  credit emissions but rather the ineffective application of the  credit mechanism. Credit can be both inflationary and  deflationary (if it fosters restructuring, renovation of the  production apparatus, acceleration of capital circulation, and  plentiful goods in the market). It is obvious that credit should  not be extended fanwise but along the chain of producers. It is  urgently necessary to change the system of refinancing, having  created a market of credit resources so that each bank can buy  them and invest them in profitable projects.    [Slyusarevska] A final question: What should we do with  traditional--monetary--"cures?"    [Chernyak] Apply them in definite doses and certain  combinations with other "cures." Any effort to curb inflation  requires substantially limiting amounts of money in circulation.  The general rule is this: the amount of money in circulation  must not increase faster than production. Excess money in  circulation leads to increased prices. The essence of the  question is what means to use to limit the amount of money in  circulation. We need to replace direct monetary emission by  National Bank credits. It is possible to limit money in  circulation by issuing securities (stocks, bonds, and so on),  and also through the circulation of notes as a form of mutual  settlements. The most reliable form of securities is the  issuance of earmarked loans for projects which can be put into  operation swiftly (for example, the production of food products,  medical equipment, education, and so forth), also the issuance  of municipal loans for specific programs.</p>

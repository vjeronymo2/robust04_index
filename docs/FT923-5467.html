			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Economic roots of French 'non' psychology EXTRAPOLATING historical trends into the future is a risky business, as many economic forecasters have discovered over the past year. But if the past fortnight's shift in French opinion polls continues up to the referendum, then most European interest rates will rise in less than three weeks. Europe will wave goodbye to the Maastricht treaty, and quite possibly the exchange rate mechanism too. Why have the French apparently become so disenchanted with the Maastricht treaty? Certainly, the French have a habit of inflicting embarrassing surprises on their leaders from time to time. German unification, and the subsequent crop of racial attacks in the eastern Lander, may have revived painful memories in French minds. But there is also an economic cause. France remains gripped by a sense of economic malaise, provoked by years of high interest rates, slow growth and high unemployment, of which this summer's strikes and riots are symptoms. Last week's economic data provided more unwelcome news for the pro-Maastricht lobbyists. Seasonally adjusted unemployment remained unchanged at 10.3 per cent in July, while gross domestic product grew by a mere 0.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year. Economists at Insee, the French national statistics office have revised down their GDP growth forecast from 2.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent in 1992. But hold on. Output in the UK economy is still falling after two years of recession, the US is struggling to manage anything more than a meagre recovery and Japan is also slowing fast. French growth of 2.2 per cent this year does not look too bad in comparison. The French economy has, in fact, done a surprisingly good job of shrugging off the recessionary forces of the past year. The OECD's leading indicator index, an amalgam of interest rates, share prices, business surveys and other forward-looking statistics, is designed to predict movements in industrial output by about six months. But French output has stubbornly refused to follow the indicators' pessimistic forecast, as the chart shows. Output has fallen in the last two months, but has performed better than in the other main industrialised countries since last year. France's problem is not no growth this year but slow growth over the past half-decade. The government's policy of competitive disinflation within the ERM has reduced French inflation to the lowest European levels but at a high price in terms of persistent unemployment and lost output. French output rose by 13 per cent between 1985 and 1990, compared to 17 per cent in Germany, 18 per cent in Italy and 28 per cent in Japan. The OECD calculates that the trend rate of growth of French industrial output was a modest 1 per cent a year in the 1980s, the slowest of the six largest industrialised countries. The pain may soon be over. The main obstacle to French growth remains high German interest rates. But Germany's leading indicators suggest a sharp fall in output is in the pipeline. With German inflation also falling, the threat of recession will eventually force the Bundesbank to cut its rates. And after the pain, the gain: French hands may also be on Europe's monetary tiller before long if the move to monetary union continues as planned. Unless, that is, the French vote no and the prospect of Emu fades. All the sacrifices of the last few years will then have been in vain.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED STATES

seasonally adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

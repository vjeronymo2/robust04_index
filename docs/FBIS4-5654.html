			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  decided Friday [8 April] to send 15 election observers to El  Salvador again as part of a UN peacekeeping mission, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said.    The decision came after no candidate was able to win the  necessary majority of votes to fill the offices of president and  vice president in the March 20 elections, resulting in another  election set for April 24 to pick the nation's two top leaders,  the chief government spokesman told reporters.    Japan sent a 15-member team to monitor the last polls in the  central American country. The Japanese observers returned home  on March 25.    Tokyo will again dispatch 15 election monitors to El  Salvador  for about a 10-day stay, a government official said.    Most of the participants will be picked from those taking  part in the last mission, the official said.    El Salvador is the third country to which Japan has sent  election observers in accordance with the UN Peacekeeping  Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Cessna Model 750 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Novel or Unusual Design Features <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Model 750 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including a digital Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), Air Data System, Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), Navigation and Communication System, Autopilot System, and a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system that controls critical engine parameters. These systems may be vulnerable to lightning and high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general (&sect;25.581), and the other for fuel system protection (&sect;25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protection of electrical and electronic systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference, special conditions are proposed for the Cessna Model 750, which would require that new technology electrical and electronic systems, such as the EFIS, FADEC, AHRS, etc., be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to both the direct and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lightning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To provide a means of compliance with these proposed special conditions, clarification of the threat definition of lightning is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, Protection of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed as a basis to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception of the multiple burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20&hyph;53A, will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding, airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, tests (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation) and/or verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems. The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility to upset and/or malfunction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First Return Stroke: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment ``hardness'' level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Multiple Stroke Flash: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of 50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms. An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system under evaluation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

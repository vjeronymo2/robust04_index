During  the event, Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan  praised the soldiers deployed in Chiapas State for their  dedication and spirit. Gen. Riviello Bazan said the Army's  intervention in the Chiapas conflict is strictly in accordance  with the law and ethics of the Armed Forces.    [Riviello Bazan] "We did not act on our own, rather, in  accordance to the law. We are in Chiapas to protect  constitutional order, which is demanded of us by the country and  the people of Mexico."    Gen. Riviello Bazan said the Armed Forces have acted with  prudence and firmness, without abuses.    [Riviello Bazan] "President Salinas de Gortari is a good  commander and great social leader. From far and near the hands  of provocation moved. They found their response in dialogue,  concord, and national agreement."    Gen. Riviello Bazan said values like loyalty are not nor can  be changeable.    [Riviello Bazan] "No one can justify violence and the taking  up of weapons to demand solutions. We must not attempt to  glorify those who resorted to violence. If those who encourage  confrontation were faced with it, the first thing they would do  is ask the authorities for their protection."    The defense secretary said the Armed Forces are reliable,  and  this is why the Mexican people support and respect them.    [Riviello Bazan] "There are some who would like to separate  us from the people; that is impossible. We are one and the  same. Just look at our faces, skin, thoughts, and heart of each  and every soldier. You will see we are the people; we are  Mexico just like the rest of the country."    The defense secretary added:    [Riviello Bazan] "We are no more and no less than any other  Mexican who works hard for his country. We are an Army for  peace. We are an Army to have peace. We believe in the law; we  obey the law; we follow orders. Discipline is our motto."    During the event, Gen. Luis Angel Fuentes Alvarez, director  of the Heroic Military School, read the honor list of the Child  Heroes of Chapultepec and the Heroic Navy School. Also present  at the event were representatives of the Legislative and  Judicial Branches, cabinet members, and the Navy secretary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks on the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] continue in Vienna. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's alternate special representative, continued the talks  with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' envoys in the presence  of Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on  the Cyprus issue, and Tugay Ulucevik, the Turkish deputy foreign  minister.    Lamb told the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation that he and  Ulucevik were just observers in the talks. He added that  today's talks focused on a detailed analysis of the 21 March UN  document. He avoided evaluating the talks' results.    The talks began at 1030 today, stopped at 1500 and resumed  at  1600.    Acting government spokesman Spiros Arotis said nothing  happened in yesterday's seven-hour talks. He added that the  government is being kept informed.</p>

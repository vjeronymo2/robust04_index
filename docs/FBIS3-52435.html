			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The FLN [National Liberation Front] political bureau  has announced that its proposals on the draft platform [for  dialogue] suggested by the National Dialogue Commission [NDC]  were not taken into consideration. The FLN submitted a  clarification of its proposals and the aspects of its  disagreement with the proposals.    In a letter addressed yesterday to the NDC chairman, a copy  of which the radio received, the FLN pointed out that it  disagreed with the NDC over three essential issues. The first  is the major amendment of the constitution. The FLN opposed  amending the constitution and considered it a basic reference  point which should be applied during the transitional period.  The second issue is the alternative bodies. The FLN announced  that it was not interested in the bodies which would succeed the  Higher State Council [HSC] and the management of the  transitional period. The FLN expressed its readiness to  contribute to solving the problems when a real authority is  established, at the end of the HSC's term of office, which would  actually be committed to solving the problems. The third issue  is the transitional period. The FLN opposed extending the  transitional period in accordance with the proposed basis [by  the NDC].    The FLN reiterated its stance that the comprehensive and  deep  national dialogue would remain the only way to get the country  out of the crisis.</p>

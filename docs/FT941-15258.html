			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: Sampras serves notice - The Australian open starts on Monday. John Barrett sees the men's world No 1 full of confidence on and off the court / Tennis The world number one was unusually outspoken. 'I have come here to win the Australian Open. I will be satisfied with nothing less,' said Pete Sampras at Peters New South Wales Championships in Sydney, where he powered his way through to today's final. His opponent in that final, Ivan Lendl was less forthcoming. Refusing to be drawn into making a forecast about the likely winner of the ADollars 8m (Pounds 3.6m) championship, the first grand slam event of the year which begins at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne on Monday, the former world champion grew tired of parrying the questions and said mischievously: 'OK - I'll go out on a limb . . . Steffi Graf]' Sampras and Graf will rightly be strong favourites to win the main titles at Flinders Park. Yesterday's draw has thrown Sampras and Lendl together again. If they both survive as they should (and only Lendl's stamina over five sets at the age of 33 in the intense heat makes that uncertain), then we could enjoy another minor classic. Lendl seems to have regained his zest for the game. He is moving more quickly, serving magnificently (a record 28 aces against the unfortunate Richey Reneberg who is likely to be his second round opponent in Melbourne) and making fewer unforced errors than last year. Sampras, too, has found his form. There was a scare on day three when, after leading 6-1 4-0 against Jason Stoltenberg he found himself a service break down in the final set. Against Aaron Krickstein on Thursday and Petr Korda yesterday, Sampras looked every inch the world's best. He was keen to beat Korda to gain revenge for a particularly painful loss to the left-handed Czech in the last tournament of 1993, the Compaq Grand Slam Cup. In that gruelling 4 1/2 -hour semi-final, one of the most dramatic matches I have seen, Sampras was tottering about like a punch drunk boxer and Korda writhing on the court with cramp. Sampras failed to convert any of the five match points he held and eventually surrendered 13-11 in the final set, totally spent and physically sick. That defeat came at the end of a wonderful year in which the American won eight tournaments, including a first title at Wimbledon and a second at the US Open. Sampras was already sure of his No 1 ranking when he suffered his only loss in a final - to the new German hero, Michael Stich at the IBM / ATP Tour Championship. Sampras had not intended to defend his title in Sydney because he felt last year that he had played too many matches by the time he lost to Stefan Edberg in the semi-final of the Australian Open. But a first round loss last week in Doha to the little known Moroccan, Karim Alami, a player ranked below 200, caused him to change his mind. The manner of that loss was worrying. Sampras led by a service break in the final set before 'choking on his lead', according to a reliable eye witness. This rude shock prompted Sampras to ask for a wild card into the Sydney draw. Even the best laid plans of mice and millionaires must sometimes be modified. Jim Courier, who has won the Australian Open for the last two years, has dropped to No 3 in the rankings and has been drawn in the same half as Sampras. If these two do meet in the semi-finals expect a battle royal. Courier is convinced that he would have won their Wimbledon final against a fading Sampras if only he had captured the fourth set. The new No 2, Stich, has first Korda and then Edberg in his path. Edberg comes fresh from success in Doha and seems to have found his service rhythm at last. If he has, then he may be the man Stich has to watch. In their Grand Slam Cup semi-final Edberg recaptured his 1988 form. Can he still stretch that form over five sets, that is the question? The women's title seems wide open for Graf. The stabbing of Monica Seles last April removed the only player capable of beating Graf regularly. In her absence Graf duly annexed the last three grand slam titles of 1993 to bring her total to 14. The game has been robbed of a rivalry that promised to equal those other historic rivalries - Wills v Jacobs, Brough v Connolly, Court v King, Evert v Navratilova - that have been central to the game's evolution. Their final here last year, won by Seles 4-6 6-3 6-2, was one of the great contests of 1993. When these two will next meet is a matter of conjecture. Seles, ever the perfectionist, has been training and practising hard but will pick her moment so that she can be certain of returning with a win. The latest communique suggests that she might decide to emerge next month, probably in the US. Although 27 of the top 30 women are here, with Seles, Martina Navratilova and Jennifer Capriati all absent the draw does look thin. It is worrying that there are so few young players capable of challenging the leaders. With Graf in the top half is fellow German, Anke Huber, who gave Seles a hard match here two years ago. Her coach Boris Breskvar (he was Boris Becker's original coach) told me that she is now capable of beating Steffi. Whether or not that is wishful thinking we may soon discover. In the lower half the effervescent Spaniard, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario is seeded No 2 for the first time. She may have a tough quarter-final against Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere who retires from the circuit after this championship and wants to go out with a bang. If Sanchez survives she may face Gabriela Sabatini in the semi-finals. The Argentinian has reappointed her original coach, Carlos Kirmayr of Brazil. I do not envy him the task of revitalising a player who has not won a tournament since the 1992 Italian Open and whose serve seems to be getting worse rather than better. Elsewhere the talent cupboard seems to be bare. No, if Graf is not to win it then I cannot suggest who might. Please hurry back Monica, please.</p>

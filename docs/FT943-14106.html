			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Honda to halve US exports Honda Motor of Japan will halve its annual exports to the US to 150,000 vehicles by 1999 in an attempt to reduce risks from exchange rate fluctuations, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper reported that under a long-term business plan, Honda also planned to boost exports from its US plants to Japan and other countries nearly four-fold to 150,000 vehicles a year. Honda hopes the moves will help ease Japan-US trade friction over vehicles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Vaskovic from the Serbian Assembly] </F>   [Text] After a three months break, the deputies have again  convened in the hall of the Serbian Assembly. This time the  newly appointed deputies are sitting on the benches. The  session should start any minute. Dr. Vojislav Dimitrijevic, the  oldest deputy, has still not taken the seat of the chairman.  Let me remind you that Dr. Dimitrijevic chaired the previous  assembly last year. He will be assisted in chairing the session  by the two youngest deputies, Aleksandar Vucic and Milan  Dragisic. These deputies from the Serbian Radical Party have  already taken their seats at the chairing table.    The first part of the session should be taken up by the  verification of the deputies' mandates. One of the 250 deputies  will be elected chairman of the Assembly. The four deputy  chairmen are also to be elected today. At least 30 deputies are  needed to put forward a candidate for chairman. We have found  out unofficially that the Socialist Party of Serbia will put  forward Dr. Zoran Arandjelovic, the previous chairman, as  candidate. We have also found out unofficially that the  Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] will put forward as  candidate for chairman one of the following deputies: Vuk  Draskovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, Milan Nikovic, or Borivoje Borovic.  So one of them will be the Depos candidate for chairman of the  Assembly. The voting will be as the deputies decide, public or  secret. The candidate who gets the majority vote will be  elected chairman.    When the Assembly is constituted the procedure will commence  for the formation of the government. The president of Serbia  will put forward the candidate for the new prime minister. At  least 126 votes are needed for his election. The deadline for  the formation of the government has not been given.    Esteemed listeners, I am saying all this in the expectation  that the Serbian Assembly session will begin. It is about to  start. We will let you know more in our next newscast.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Nagging headaches smite financial giant: US's Prudential seeks change of fortune with appointment from outside Prudential Insurance Co of America has been going through a decidedly rocky patch of late. It is the US's biggest life insurance company, the second largest mortgage lender and one of the leading managed healthcare groups. It owns a stockbroking firm (Prudential Securities), a reinsurance company (Prudential Re), and a growing credit card and lending business. With assets of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32bn), it is also probably the leading insurance group in the mutual fund industry (though it is still only a quarter the size of Fidelity Investments). In all, the Prudential, which is unrelated to the UK insurance group of the same name, has Dollars 218bn of assets on its balance sheet and manages another Dollars 155bn for pension funds, mutual fund investors and others. Yet this market clout and a powerful capital base (Dollars 10.7bn at the end of last year) has generated erratic and disappointing earnings. Post-tax return on capital was only around 5 per cent in each of the past two years. This year, the Prudential may end up with a loss. Also, the company's credit standing has been slipping. At the beginning of 1992, it had a top AAA-rating: now, after two downgrades, it lost some of its gold-plated shine. Had it been a public company, shareholders would have had something to say about this. As it is, the company is a mutual, owned by its policyholders. Now though, the company's own board of directors has decided it is time for a change. Mr Robert Winters, the actuary who has been the group's chairman and chief executive since 1988, will retire on December 1. Into his place will step Mr Arthur Ryan, president of New York banking group Chase Manhattan - the first person from outside the company (let alone the insurance industry) to get the top job. Although Mr Winters said as long ago as 1988 that he planned to retire early, Prudential's recent traumas appear to have precipitated his departure. 'It wasn't a surprise that he was going. What is more of a surprise is the timing and the short transition,' said Mr Michael Albanese, an analyst at AM Best, the US insurance rating agency. Mr Ryan himself will only say: 'I think the board knew he wanted to retire and decided it was a good opportunity to look around' for a replacement. The choice of a banker in part reflects the Prudential's push into a broader range of financial services during the 1980s. But this diversification is also at the root of its problems. 'The complexity of the company has outrun the ability of management to run it. They haven't grown with the business,' says one person close to the company. Three issues have cast a cloud. Foremost has been the investment scandal at Prudential Securities, the stockbroker bought in 1981. During the 1980s, the company's brokers promoted Dollars 8bn of risky property and energy investments as though they were safe, and the parent company's impregnable image helped sell the investments. The total cost of settling claims may top Dollars 1bn (roughly the amount the group has set aside in provisions). Long-term, the episode could impair Prudential's image, which has taken 119 years to build. Second on Prudential's list of headaches have been the US property/casualty and reinsurance businesses. Hurricane Andrew, which devastated the Florida coastline in 1991, cost Prudential Dollars 1bn and its AAA rating. Like other US insurers, the Prudential has set a high priority on limiting its exposure to such catastrophe losses: it is now pulling back from the property/casualty business, and plans to float its reinsurance arm. Third, the group continues to struggle with a balance sheet weighed down with underperforming property investments. Its Dollars 27.5bn of commercial property and mortgages at the end of 1992 made it one of the biggest private property owners in the world. In September 1993, underperforming property assets amounted to 30 per cent of its huge capital base. There is a belief in the investment community that not all potential losses in Prudential's property portfolio have been provided for. 'If they had to mark the portfolio to market, there would be some big hits there,' says one person with knowledge of the assets. As an insurer, with liabilities stretching years into the future, the Prudential is not obliged to recognise losses that a company with a shorter-term liability structure - a bank, for instance - would have to report. 'Unless there's a permanent impairment (to the value of a property), a life insurer really doesn't have to provide,' says Mr Chester Murray, director of life insurance ratings at Moody's. On top of all this, the Prudential is looking at a cyclical downturn in some of the biggest parts of its business. Mortgage lending has tailed off this year as US interest rates have risen. Stockbrokers are feeling the pain that comes with the end of a bull run in securities markets. Although the company publishes only a brief annual summary of its financial condition, rating agencies, big creditors and others receive a more detailed quarterly report. 'This year, results have been very disappointing,' says Mr Albanese. Mr Ryan's first actions are expected to be the appointment of a strong chief financial officer (a job which has lain vacant) and the imposition of greater operational and cost control on Prudential's disparate businesses. 'They'll have to compete more and more on costs,' says Mr Murray, pointing out that life insurers now have to fight for investment business with banks, mutual fund groups and others. Mr Ryan's longer-term challenge, though, will be to decide just how many businesses Prudential can manage successfully.</p>

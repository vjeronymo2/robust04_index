Stoma, Biochemistry and Pharmacology Departments of the  Minsk Medical Institute, Belarussian Scientific Research  Institute of Cancer and Medical Radiology, and Radiobiology  Institute at the Belarussian Academy of Sciences; UDC  577.391:621.386.86]    [Abstract] The decisive role played by carotenes and  vitamins E, C, and A in enabling the tissues to resist the  development of radiation-induced free radical damage prompted a  study of the concentration of vitamins E and A and ubiquinone,  ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and diketogulonic acids,  _b_-carotenes, lipid peroxidation products, dien conjugates,  and  malonic dialdehyde in blood and plasma and liver mitochondria of  28 rats kept for five months at permanent monitoring stations  (reference points) in Rechitsy rayon of Gomel oblast. The  radioactive cesium concentration at these points was  1.041+/-0.043 kBq/kg, and the animal nutrition ration consisted  mostly of cereals (oats) with a specific radioactivity of 0.28  kBq/kg for cesium. The ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and  diketogulonic acid concentration in the blood plasma and liver  of rats kept in the radioactive contamination zone (group 1),  the _b_-carotene and antioxidant vitamin concentration  (ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and diketogulonic acid and vitamins  E and A) in the rat liver (groups 2 and 3), and the  concentration of the lipid peroxidation products in the blood  plasma and liver mitochondria of the test animals are  summarized. All indicators were measured in group 1 (seven rats)  immediately after the rats returned from the exposure zone; the  remaining two groups were switched to the vivarium ration; one  half (group 2) was injected with the antioxidant vitamin complex  ten times on alternating days; the remaining 10 rats (group 3)  received no treatment. The findings show that the ascorbic acid  concentration in the blood plasma and especially liver in group  1 is depressed while vitamin E concentration in group one was  lower than that of the control group by more than twofold. The  hypovitaminosis state was corrected by the AK preparation--an  antioxidant complex of vitamins E, A, and C. This corrective  action not only normalizes the _b_-carotene, tocopherol,  ascorbate, and retinol levels in the blood and liver of test  animals but also lowers the rate of the free radical oxidation  processes by decreasing the peroxidation product concentration,  thus helping to increase the animals' radiological resistance.

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STYLE IS DEMAGOGUE, BUT LACKING SERIOUSNESS  </P> <P> The day after his election as president of the Russian Republic, Boris Yeltsin  promised:  </P> <P> "If we last 100 days Russia will be independent . . . Russia's laws will take  precedence over national laws. We should have our own interpretation of the  laws on Russia's lands, on property, on the autonomy of enterprises. Treaties  will be concluded with foreign states bypassing the center."  </P> <P> The center that Yeltsin was proposing to set aside is the state apparatus that  Mikhail Gorbachev struggles to administer. To read such stuff is scarcely to  accord its author any place of special portent among the specters now haunting  Gorbachev.  </P> <P> For here is the style of the demagogue. The practice of demagoguery cannot be  dismissed out of hand, since it is an elemental component of the democratic  process. But, if he is to be taken seriously, the demagogue must not just  befuddle the public but make some degree of sense to the managers of society.  Yeltsin seems incapable of taking that necessity into account. His future is  unpromising until he does.  </P> <P> Yeltsin has made himself the voice of the Great Russian chauvinism that most  galls the Russian Federation's sister republics. The last census identified 800  different nationalities in the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's own Russia is a  federation of restless nationalities that might be as inclined to declare  independence from him soon after he achieved the independence he affects to  declare from the central government.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has never yet failed to mount an overwhelming majority whenever he  has put an issue to a parliamentary vote. Given that record, it's hard to  understand why he failed to stop Yeltsin's ascension by applying his inarguably  formidable party machine to the job.  </P> <P> The assumption that statesmen know what they are doing is one of the more  common errors in analysis of their policies. But if we grant that Gorbachev  knew the consequences of inaction, there is no plausible way to explain this  instance of it except as a calculated decision to let Yeltsin have center stage  and trust him for a series of pratfalls. That could turn out to be a shrewd  stroke, because Yeltsin appears to have started without much plan of his own  and at once betrayed signs of proceeding according to what may have been  Gorbachev's.  </P></p>

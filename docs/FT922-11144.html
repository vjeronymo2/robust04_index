			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Trade News: France pays less over export losses THE French government paid FFr9.05bn (Pounds 910m) net to exporters last year to cover losses on state-guaranteed contracts to foreign clients unable to pay. This was down from FFr11.5bn in 1990, William Dawkins reports from Paris. This also reflects a decline in exporters' claims for unpaid bills in global trouble spots, plus a rise in the cash recovered from clients in default, said Compagnie Francaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (Coface), the French state-controlled export credit agency. Coface, which handles payments on medium-term and some political risks on the state's behalf, said net claims on government-guaranteed contracts were running at about the same rate as last year. They could reach anything between FFr6bn and FFr12bn, depending on the outcome of a few large contracts in Latin America and the Maghreb, Mr Philippe Remond, agency director-general, said. Coface yesterday showed stagnant net profits of FFr142m on its own operations, mainly insurance of short-term credits and political risks in stable industrial countries, which it insures on its own account, with no state guarantee. Mr Pierre-Yves Cosse, a former executive of Banque Nationale de Paris who became Coface chairman last October, said the results compared well with competitors in a tough trade year. The group was capable of taking on more business now covered by the state on the grounds that it was thought too risky for commercial insurers. Coface started taking on political risks, such as nationalisation, in the EC (previously state-guaranteed) last year. It went further this year, to insure against political risks in all members of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) except Turkey, and to guarantee exchange rate losses on foreign trade flows. Coface has surprised competitors with its recent aggressive expansion, with its purchases over the past year of 3 per cent in Trade Indemnity, the UK insurer, 25 per cent in La Viscontea, the Italian credit insurance group, 16.5 per cent in Unistrat, a political risks insurer, and 45 per cent in Forex Finance, a French adviser in treasury management. It has made joint ventures in commercial information with Austrian and German partners, to boost its east European debt recovery. The strategy was to turn Coface into a diversified export finance group, with a full range of services, Mr Cosse said. He warned of a 'question mark' over Coface's ability to reinsure risks in years to come because of the turmoil at Lloyd's of London, the main European centre for trade credit reinsurance.</p>

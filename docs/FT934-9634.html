			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Yeltsin outlines a new order for his country 'RUSSIA needs order', President Boris Yeltsin told the Russian people in a television broadcast last night. But he continued: 'Not the terrible, repressive order of Stalinist camps: Russia urgently needs firm,legal order.' The draft constitution, published today, is his attempt to give it that basis. It is certainly not a Stalinist order (though the Stalinist constitution on paper was a model of democratic practice), for it is careful in defining the rights and duties of the levels of government which exist now or should be elected. But it is certainly firm. It has been plain for some weeks that this was to be a constitution for a strong presidential state, with much of the US and French systems about it. As it turns out, it is stronger than either, largely because the figure of the president is unambiguously the source of the country's central powers. The two houses of the federal assembly, or parliament, are limited in crucial areas by the overriding powers of the president. These allow him: to be head of state and of the armed forces; to set the general direction of internal and foreign policy, announced yearly in a state of the nation address; to name the prime minister and insist on keeping him even if parliament objects; to name the senior military commanders without parliamentary approval, and name and head the security council, which has a wider range of powers than purely security. If his government is challenged by a vote of no confidence against it in parliament, he can keep it in office for three months and then sack the parliament rather than the government, if the vote is repeated. He can veto any law passed by a simple majority in the lower house, and then require a two-thirds majority for it to be passed. And though he himself can be impeached for treachery or very serious crimes, these do not include breaching the constitution - and need, again, a two-thirds vote. He needs the lower house's approval for appointment of the chairman of the central bank and the upper house's approval to appoint the chairmen of the main law courts. But all of these chairmen are then guaranteed independence. Finally, in a last section dealing with the 'transitional situation', he absolves himself of his pledge to run for re-election next June by laying down that he must serve out his term till June 1996. He also limits the length of the parliament to two years. forcing it to be re-elected in 1995, and gives ministers the right to be deputies, thus increasing his government's power in the legislature. Deputies have the right to initiate and to pass legislation - which can be vetoed by the president. But they do not, apparently, have the right to consider, much less block, presidential decrees, which can be issued by the president and must only conform to the constitution. Presidential decrees have been the backbone of the new legislation passed since the abolition of the old parlaiment in September: it seems likely that the tradition will continue. Nevertheless, in an evident effort to mark a complete break with the Soviet past, the constitution is replete with rights, There is no state ideology or religion; no primacy given to any organisation; and there is a provision for an ombudsman for human rights, to be elected by the state duma - albeit with undefined powers. It is the charter for a strong president - but it is assumed he will also be a liberal one.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Changes by Isosceles chief lead to departures MR DAVID Simons, the new chief executive at Isosceles, yesterday moved to simplify the management structure of the Gateway food retail business and put the development of new retail formats 'on pause'. He said a review of head office costs had started this week which would take between 10 and 12 weeks to complete. As part of the changes, two directors are leaving the company. They are Mr Paul Highett-Smith, the buying director, and Mr Jim Grant, managing director of the Somerfield chain. Mr Simons said that terms of their departure were still being negotiated. Earlier this week Isosceles, the vehicle for the Pounds 2.1bn 1989 leveraged buy-out of Gateway, agreed the sale of Herman's Sporting Goods, the US chain, leaving Gateway as the only operating business. Isosceles is currently working on a business plan to put to its lenders and shareholders as the basis of a refinancing of the group's Pounds 1.4bn of loans. Gateway includes a number of different fascias, some of which the previous management had been rolling out to replace the Gateway name. Mr Simons, who joined the group on January 4, has decided to put the development of the Somerfield format on pause. He said 'the fascia debate is a non-debate. We must upgrade the quality of what we do inside the store before the outside of the store'. He plans to merge most of the different business units within Gateway's head office in Bristol. Mr Simons said this would avoid duplication, improve accountability and make for a more efficient organisation. However, the Food Giant discount store business will remain separate, he said, because 'the mindset of a discount operation is so different we could destroy the concept if it was mixed in'. Mr David Jury, from the Gateway chain, is to become store operations director. The London head office of Isosceles will close at the end of April, and the boards of the two companies are being merged. Isosceles held its board meeting in Bristol for the first time on Thursday. Mr Simons denied suggestions that structural changes were being made because the group's lenders had demanded cost cuts. He said 'this is not about money, it is about a simpler organisation'. He said that the business plan now being finalised aimed to address Gateway's problems. These included systems which were 3 to 5 years behind its main competitors, the fact that 'we have allowed ourselves to get into a position of price uncompetitiveness', and Gateway had been 'lousy at executing things we had said we would do'. Priorities would be 'making sure the shelves were full and tidy, the chiller cabinets are working and the staff are interested'. Poor availability of stock in the stores had meant pre-Christmas sales had been weak. Gateway had been going through a period of 'sharp decline in sales' but in recent days that decline was slowing, he said. He said that the group's lenders and shareholders were being supportive. Rumours that Wasserstein Perella, the US investment house which has a veto through its holding of half the A shares, had refused to support the refinancing were 'absolute bunkum'. Discussions on the refinancing would not start until there was a business plan on the table, he said.</p>

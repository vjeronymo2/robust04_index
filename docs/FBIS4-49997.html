			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By J.S. Chang and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Pretoria, May 9 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC]  President Li Teng-hui met briefly with Yasir 'Arafat, leader of  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Monday [9 May]  during a dinner given by Pretoria Mayor Nico Stofberg in honor  of the foreign delegates here to attend the inauguration of  South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela.    This was the first encounter between the ROC head of state  and the PLO leader.    Li and 'Arafat shook hands and embraced each other before  beginning their conversation.    Li also greeted many other foreign dignitaries present at  the  banquet, including the Spanish and Belgian crown princes and  Tunisian Foreign Minister Beji Essegsi [name as received].    Li and his entourage arrived in South Africa Monday evening  following a [words indistinct] visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica  in Central America.    South Africa is the third leg of Li's current global tour.  His participation in Mandela's inaugural ceremony highlights  the ROC Government's efforts to increase its presence in the  world arena.    Official delegations from more than 100 countries will  attend  the historic presidential inauguration in Pretoria Tuesday.  Scores of world leaders, including Cuban President Fidel  Castro, Israeli President Ezer Weizman and US Vice President Al  Gore, have already arrived here for the ceremony.    The ROC Embassy in South Africa has arranged for President  Li  to meet with Mandela and his predecessor F.W. de Klerk as well  as with new governors of the country's nine provinces during his  three-day stay here.    Li will also visit Swaziland before he returns to Taipei May  16.</p>

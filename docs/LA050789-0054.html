			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL YOUNGSTERS SHARE JOY, BEAT OBSTACLES AT TRACK MEET  </P> <P> The emphasis was on overcoming obstacles, not winning ribbons. Just being  there, running and jumping with abandon on that pylon-littered grass field in  Lakewood, seemed enough for the 400 retarded youngsters.  </P> <P> Their joy, from the time they warmed up with wild arm-flailing versions of  jumping jacks, was uncontainable.  </P> <P> The team from Mayfair High, one of 19 schools represented at the Melbourne  School for the Trainable Mentally Retarded's 16th annual track meet Thursday,  looked sharp in blue T-shirts. It was ready. Victor Guitierrez and Ramon  Fernandez, both 15, engaged in a flurry of high-fives and patted each other's  cheeks.  </P> <P> One of the Mayfair members loosening up had the look of an athlete and the  admiration of his teammates.  </P> <P> "I'm doin' good, how you doin'?" said Jess Porter, 19, tall, lean and autistic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm Ready to Run'  </P> <P> "Jess is the best runner," said Tim Kennedy, 18.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to run," said Porter, "if I have the time."  </P> <P> A band played the Flintstones theme and the "Hokey Pokey." Guitierrez ate a  rapidly melting chocolate bar, despite warnings from his teachers that his  waistline would be further expanded.  </P> <P> Then he went right out and shined in the sun: He jumped 4 feet 8 inches.  </P> <P> Some of the participants, who ranged in age from 3 to 21, are also physically  impaired. But all were required to compete in each of the events -- shuttle  run, long jump, soccer dribble, batting, obstacle course, Frisbee throw, basket  toss and marathon.  </P> <P> Youngsters aimed a Frisbee at Hula Hoops affixed to a chain-link fence. Landing  the disc inside a hoop was worth one, three or five points. Some sailed high  over the fence, landing on a blacktop playground. But Mayfair's Juan Varela,  18, nailed the five ring with consistency. "Good job, Juan," praised the  volunteer officials, and Varela's day was made.  </P> <P> The reward for Mary Crowley, an adapted physical education specialist and meet  coordinator, will hopefully come, she said, this summer when Varela, using this  skill he has learned, plays with a Frisbee at home.  </P> <P> The soccer dribble presented a problem for those in wheelchairs. So while being  pushed by a volunteer, they used a hockey stick instead of their feet to nudge  a ball around three pylons on a 25-foot-long course.  </P> <P> With a well-muscled left arm, Greg Morton, 19, a deaf student at Pace School in  Bellflower, worked his stick. Smiling all the way, he gave the ball a last  solid tap and was applauding by the time he reached the finish line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Students Spurred On  </P> <P> At the shuttle run, the students, spurred on by Wendy Purvine, the event's  volunteer chairwoman, ran without regard to their lack of coordination.  </P> <P> "Run, run, run, run, run!" urged Purvine, and Marlena Ruffin, 10, of the  Mendenhall School in Garden Grove, took off toward a pylon 30 yards away.  Surprisingly, she stopped when she reached the pylon, returning only when she  heard cries of "Come back, come back."  </P> <P> "They look like they don't understand anything," Purvine said. "But they know .  . . and they love every minute of it. This is their chance."  </P> <P> Joe Hill, 16, of Pace School, despite unfluid legs, threatened to run out from  under the helmet he has to wear because he sometimes has seizures.  </P> <P> "Faster, faster, faster, faster!" Purvine shouted as Joe touched the pylon and  started back. He pounded over the grass, kicking up the sand beneath it, and  crossed the finish line with a happiness that was almost unbearable -- to him  and those who watched him.  </P> <P> He sat down and was given a drink of water by his proud sister, Tina Albritton,  who said, "He's been excited about this since 6 this morning."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nine Shots in a Row  </P> <P> Over at the basket toss, Wendy Wheeler, 17, of the Columbus School in Downey,  stood a few feet from a can and with an underhand delivery made nine shots in a  row.  </P> <P> As the youngsters waited to be escorted to their next event, they would talk  excitedly: "I beat you. . . . " "Did you see me?" "What are we going to do  next?"  </P> <P> Jess Porter was doing very well. He jumped 7 feet 6 inches. And he ran like a  gazelle, easily outdistancing his competitors.  </P> <P> At the batting station, a whiffle ball was set atop a tee and the batters aimed  at a fence that had numbers attached. Porter swung hard on his first attempt  but sent the tee, not the ball, against the fence. He settled down and ripped  several line drives.  </P> <P> "I got 14 points," he said. "I tried but couldn't hit one over the fence."  </P> <P> A volunteer asked him, "How's high school going? Any cute girls?"  </P> <P> "Well, some of them," Porter said.  </P> <P> As someone told him how handsome he looked with his new teeth braces, he waited  with hands on hips for the basket toss. He tossed ball after ball into a can.  </P> <P> "Jess Abdul-Jabbar," a teacher said.  </P> <P> No praise could have been greater.  </P> <P> Porter turned to leave, not smiling but with his head held high. Softly, he  repeated those magic words, "Jess Abdul-Jabbar."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> BOARD UNDECIDED ON SCHOOL BOND SURVEY  </P> <P> The Pleasant Valley School District in Camarillo has delayed a decision on  whether to spend $15,500 for an opinion poll to gauge support for a $6-million  school bond issue.  </P> <P> The district is debating whether to place the bond issue on the November  ballot.  </P> <P> If voters approved the measure, the money would be used to build a new school  to ease overcrowding in the district.  </P> <P> If the bond passed, property taxes would increase a maximum of $50 per year,  said Assistant Supt. Howard Hamilton.  </P> <P> The district has until July to put the measure on the November ballot but could  decide to hold a special election instead, either in March or June of 1991,  Hamilton said.  </P> <P> Some school board members said Thursday that the opinion poll is an unnecessary  expense, while others withheld their opinions until after a presentation May 3  by a political consultant on how to run a bond issue campaign.  </P> <P> Overcrowding is so severe in the district that at Las Colinas Elementary  School, 221 of the 1,025 students will be sent to Monte Vista Intermediate  School in September.  </P> <P> The last two schools the district built -- Las Colinas and Santa Rosa -- were  funded by developer fees. But officials said they only have enough of those  funds left to pay for one-third of the cost of a new school. JEFF SCHNAUFER  </P></p>

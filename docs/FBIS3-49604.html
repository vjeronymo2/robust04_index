			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Out of some 2,000 Bohemian  and Moravian castles and mansions, 514 were confiscated by the  end of 1947 under the Benes Decree No. 12 dealing with "landed  property confiscated from Germans, Hungarians, and traitors and  enemies of the Czech and Slovak nations."    The decree sought to punish those who filed for German or  Hungarian nationality in 1939 and 1940, served in the German  Army under the Nazis, or otherwise collaborated with the Germans.    In today's article entitled "Czech Seats Claimed Even by  Descendants of Wehrmacht or SS Servicemen," the left-leaning  RUDE PRAVO writes that it was under this decree that many of the  130 castles which have been opened to the public in the  following two years were acquired by the state. Since November  1989, over 40 of them have been restituted to the original  owners' families, and restitution claims have been made for the  whole or parts of the remaining ones.    However, twenty-four claimants, or almost a third, fall into  the category specified by the Benes Decree. Moreover, the  property concerned, the paper writes, is of the highest cultural  value -- such as Rozmberk, Hruby Rohozec, Blatna, Kozel, Opocno,  Ratiborice, Zleby, and Bouzov Castles -- and there are another  40 claims to less valuable properties acquired by the state  under the decree. The most significant claims have been filed  by the Waldstein, Collorado, Blucher, and Buquoy families as  well as by the Order of the German Knights. It seems that the  claimants have agreed on a unified approach, consisting in first  filing a claim with the regional land registry for both land and  buildings, and then demanding restitution of land only, under  the 1993 Land Law, the paper says.    Three documents are required by the land registry: A proof  of  original ownership, the claimants' Czech nationality, and their  permanent residence in this country. However, the Interior  Ministry has been handing out Czech nationality certificates to  persons of "special importance" irrespective of the laws, and as  for a permanent residence stamp, it has been shown that this can  often be obtained without difficulty. The land registry, then,  is unconcerned whether or not the claimed property was  confiscated under the Benes Decree -- and a precedent was set  when the land registry in Semily, east Bohemia, gave 90 hectares  of land to Karl Walderode, who beyond doubt opted for German  nationality in 1939 and served in the Wehrmacht. The land  registry in Ceske Budejovice, south Bohemia, has started  inquiries into the current state of property a claim to which  had been filed by Karl Buquoy, the last owner of Rozmberk -- and  it has done so irrespective of the fact that he is a former SS  and SA member and that after the war he served a jail term for  spreading Nazi propaganda.    It is clear that the future course of events will be as  follows: As soon as the Benes Decree-covered claimants receive  the land, they will file for farm buildings and eventually for  castles. Under the 1993 Land Law, castles can be considered --  strange as it may seem -- as "dwellings forming part of the  original farming property" and, as such, to be restituted.    Judging by the silence of Justice and Interior Ministry  officials who are aware of all these facts, and by the land  registries' approach, it appears that the restitution deadline  of February might be broken and the Benes Decrees rendered  ineffective. It even seems that by the attitude they have  taken, government institutions are giving this development free  rein, RUDE PRAVO writes.</p>

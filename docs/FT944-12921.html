			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Motoring: Please go easy on diesel, Mr Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, warned a year ago that excise duty on motor fuel would go up by at least 5 per cent in his next Budget - due at the end of November, writes Stuart Marshall. In plain English, that could means up to 18 pence a gallon - or 4p a litre. That figure could, however, be a great deal higher - perhaps almost double. It depends how strongly the government is convinced that the best way to curb atmospheric pollution is to reduce vehicle mileages, and that the best way to achieve this is to put up fuel prices. But would it work? Italy has some of the most expensive petrol in Europe; but if high pump prices have persuaded Italian motorists to leave their cars at home, or moderate their driving habits, it hardly shows. The most obvious causes of exhaust pollution in big towns are lorries, buses and taxis powered by old - and often ill-maintained - diesel engines. Because most diesel cars in use are fairly new, their individual contribution to the pollution total is minute. This is acknowledged widely by industry experts. But modern diesel cars get tarred with the same brush as the stinking old smokers. In general, politicians seem remarkably ignorant about diesel cars. ('I know taxis have diesel engines but are there really diesel cars?' one junior minister said to me, straight-faced and quite serious, only a few years ago). Will the diesel car get a square deal this time? I doubt it. In the past year, there has been too much ill-informed comment on diesel vehicle emissions. All one can really hope is that things stay as they are and that the chancellor does not take fiscal steps to slow down the growth in diesel car sales. But even with the fuel taxed at the same level as unleaded petrol, we diesel car-users know we can drive at least 20 per cent further on every litre.</p>

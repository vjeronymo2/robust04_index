The driver, Hafiz 'Abd-al-Sattar Muhammad, said he is  employed by Ayman Khidr, the proprietor of an import-export firm  in Alexandria. He added that he took delivery of the vehicle  from its owner in the Libyan town of Darnah. The owner told him  he would follow him in three days.    Sa'd Mutawalli, chief prosecutor in Marsa Matruh  Governorate,  remanded the driver for four days pending investigation and sent  a specimen of the seized merchandise to the forensic laboratory  for examination. He also issued instructions to arraign the  export firm proprietor.</p>

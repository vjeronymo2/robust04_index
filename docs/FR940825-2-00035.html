The Board is an independent Federal advisory committee. Its eleven members are appointed by the Secretary of the Army.

That notice solicited nominations for five appointments or reappointments to two year terms that will begin January 1, 1995. Subsequent to the submission of the August 4, 1994 notice, a member of the Inland Waterways Users Board eligible for reappointment indicated he will decline reappointment.

The substance of these provisions is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Selection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Members are to be selected from the spectrum of commercial carriers and shippers using the inland and intracoastal waterways, to represent geographical regions and to be representative of waterway commerce as determined by commodity ton-mile statistics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Service <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board is required to meet at least semi-annually to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army on waterways construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for commercial navigation improvements, and report its recommendations annually to the Secretary and the Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appointment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The operation of the Board and the appointment of its members are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463 as amended) and Departmental implementing regulations. Members serve without compensation but their expenses due to board activities are reimbursable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The considerations specified in Section 302 for the selection of the Board members, and certain terms used therein, have been interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise clarified as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Carriers and Shippers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The law uses the terms ``primary users and shippers.'' Primary users has been interpreted to mean the providers of transportation services on inland waterways such as barge or towboat operators. Shippers has been interpreted to mean the purchasers of such services for the movement of commodities they own or control. Individuals are appointed to the Board, but they must be either a carrier or a shipper, or represent a firm that is a carrier or shipper. For that purpose a trade or regional association is neither a shipper or primary user. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Geographical Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The law specifies ``various'' regions. For the purpose of selecting Board members, the waterways subjected to fuel taxes and described in Public Law 94&hyph;502, as amended, have been aggregated into six regions. These are: (1) The Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries above the mouth of the Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River and its tributaries below the mouth of the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways including Tennessee-Tombigbee, plus the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette. The intent is that each region shall be represented by at least one Board member, with that representation determined by the regional concentration of the individual's traffic on the waterways. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commodity Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Waterway commerce has been aggregated into six commodity categories based on ``inland'' ton-miles shown in Waterborne Commerce of the United States. In rank order they are: (1) Farm and Food Products; (2) Coal and Coke; (3) Petroleum, Crude and Products; (4) Minerals, Ores, and Products; (5) Chemicals and Allied Products; and (6) All other. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A consideration in the selection of Board members will be, that the commodities carried or shipped by those individuals or their firms will be reasonably representative of the above commodity categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reflecting preceding selection criteria, the present representation by Board members is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, include one shipper representative representing the Upper Mississippi River Region (Region 1) and farm and food products, ethanol and coal; one shipper representative representing the Lower Mississippi River Region (Region 2), and farm and food products; one carrier representative representing the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas (Region 4), and petroleum and petroleum products; one carrier representative representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and coal and coke, minerals, and metals, petroleum and petroleum products, farm and food products and chemicals; and one carrier representative representing the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette (Region 6), and farm and food products, petroleum products, chemicals, containers, and forest products. The members representing Regions 2, 3 and 6 area eligible for reappointment. However, the member representing Region 6 has indicated that he will decline reappointment to the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The six members whose terms expire December 31, 1995, include three shipper representatives representing (1) the Lower Mississippi River (Region 2), and farm and food products, (2) the Ohio River (Region 3), and coal, and (3) the East Gulf region (Region 5), and coal; two carrier representatives representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and farm and food products, coal, petroleum, chemicals, minerals and metals; and one shipper/carrier representative representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and coal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nominations to replace members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, may be made by individuals, firms, or associations.

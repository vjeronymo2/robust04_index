			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Mobile satellites A game of chicken is being played out in the so far non-existent market for pocket satellite phones. Inmarsat's decision to raise Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in equity for its mobile satellite affiliate has sharply increased the game's stakes. The industrial might now converging on the market is formidable. Inmarsat itself is owned by 75 telecom operators. Three rival consortia include corporate giants such as Motorola, Lockheed, Sony, Loral, Alcatel-Alsthom, Vodafone and France Telecom as well as Mr Bill Gates and Mr Craig McCaw, America's best-known high-technology entrepreneurs. Pocket satellite phones will be a niche market, providing services for globe-trotting business people and those parts of the world without ordinary cellular networks. That could still be a lucrative market. But it is doubtful that four groups investing Dollars 10bn-20bn in total can all be profitable. Some will back down or merge. The first test will be whether they are prepared to put in hard cash. Motorola's Iridium has already raised Dollars 800m, though some of this involves commitments to provide services rather than cash. Loral's Globalstar has pulled in a more modest Dollars 275m. Inmarsat's Dollars 1bn financing is the most ambitious. But perhaps it has the easiest task, in that it is raising the money from a closed group of mainly state-owned monopolies. Inmarsat's plans will only look commercial to outsiders if its few private-sector investors such as BT think the project worth bankrolling.</p>

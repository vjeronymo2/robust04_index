			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> SATELLITE MIRRORS PLAGUED BY WARPING  </P> <P> Mirrors being built for a $747-million series of weather satellites have been  found to warp and become useless in the temperature extremes of space, a NASA  official said. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman said  that the flaw was discovered by ITT Aerospace, a subcontractor for the project,  and that the planned weather satellites cannot be completed and launched until  a solution is found. In another NASA project, a mirror aboard the Hubble Space  Telescope is producing a blurred image.  </P></p>

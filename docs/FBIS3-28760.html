Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today  denounces this as an undisguised move to become a nuclear power  any moment.    The analyst points out:    Japan has already developed not only devices and  technologies  for the manufacture of nuclear bombs but also long-distance  nuclear delivery means. The danger of Japan's nuclear armament  presents itself as a thing of the present-day reality, not of a  distant future. Japan's nuclear armament poses a grave threat  to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast  Asia and, further, in the rest of the world. We cannot but  counter with vigilance the grave situation in which Japan's  nuclear armament is being promoted in the full-scale stage  around the Korean peninsula. As we have declared more than  once, our people who value the dignity and independence of the  nation as their own life are fully prepared to retaliate on any  manoeuvrings of the aggressors.    If nuclear-free peace and security is to be actually  guaranteed in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, the  overall denuclearization of this region must be achieved. For  this purpose, the people of Asia and the rest of the world  should pay due attention to Japan's hastened nuclear armament.    The denuclearisation of Northeast Asia must be realised  without fail and it should lead to the total abolition of  nuclear weapons worldwide.</p>

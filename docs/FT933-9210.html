			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Thames Water taps into BOT - A Dollars 700m infrastructure project in Turkey THE champagne was on ice. UK Trade Minister Richard Needham had a plane to catch. And everyone was waiting for the acting head of the Turkish Treasury. It was a nervous few moments before Mr Osman Unsal scaled the steps of the British embassy and Thames Water, the privatised UK regional utility, was able to sign an implementation agreement on a Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) water project with the Izmit municipality. Much has been made of the BOT model of project financing to fund large public infrastructure but, as Thames Water's experience last month illustrates, no bank, let alone export credit agency, is likely to support the scheme without the Treasury's blessing. The late President Turgut Ozal of Turkey pioneered the concept of BOT, in which a private developer builds and operates a plant, recovering costs before handing it over to the public utility. Today, the method is embraced by Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister, as Turkey searches for ways to meet its infrastructure needs during rising budget strain. The key attraction is that BOT falls under the private sector and so does not bite into the government's balance sheet - important for indebted countries with limited access to medium- and long-term commercial borrowing. However, bankers stress that if Turkey finances numerous projects by this method, the market will reconsider the country's risk profile. Bankers also point out it would be cheaper if the projects were financed by conventional turnkey arrangements, where the Treasury offers bank lenders full sovereign guarantees. The projects also involve long gestation periods, partly because of their inherent complexity. Thames Water, with its local partners, Gama and Guris, has been working on the Izmit water scheme for three years. Chase Manhattan, the US bank, has been preparing a power plant project at Birecik on the Euphrates for the best part of six years. Not one BOT has been successfully concluded. Many contractors have walked away from earlier attempts at BOT, and even Thames Water is far from safe. The only beneficiaries so far, perhaps, are the lawyers - legal fees alone are about 0.5 per cent, according to one estimate. But, while Turkey's economy is so troubled, bankers see few alternatives. Investment in the electricity sector, for example, has come to a virtual standstill, with the World Bank insisting on reform at TEK, the public utility, before new funds are available. For foreign contractors, BOT is probably the only way they can win business on large capital equipment supplies. Bankers also point out that BOT typically will incorporate an equity element  -a form of direct capital investment by the consortium which would not be available on conventional turnkey projects. Banks like to lend hard currency to projects that earn hard currency. The BOT is a way around this for projects which depend on local revenue receipts. There are assumed to be greater efficiencies in using a private developer rather than the government agent or utility, as the operational risks of project over-run are carried by the private sector. The issue of who takes the financial risk is central to the concept of BOT. Under the scheme the banks lend to a private sector developer and theoretically the banks' only recourse to the government occurs when the project goes wrong. Some bankers argue, though, that on such large infrastructure, government is always involved indirectly. In the implementation agreement signed last month, Thames Water and the Izmit water authority agreed terms of the water sale, the volumes, price and form of payment, which bankers say will be denominated in the underlying currency of the lending. Chase Manhattan, financial adviser to the project, is looking for a mix of Japanese government aid, European export credits and UK and Japanese commercial bank funding. Thames Water is also seeking the Treasury's guarantee of the Izmit water authority's payment obligations. In turn the Treasury must provide some mechanism to ensure lenders are repaid if the project is abandoned and the revenue flows interrupted as a result of force majeure. Thames Water is arranging a subordinated loan mechanism: a standby facility of which the project company can make use in the case of force majeure. But ultimately Thames Water's ability to raise finance will be affected by the Treasury's own appetite for funds.</p>

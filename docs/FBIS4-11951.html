			<p>BFN     [Text] Several settlement leaders in the territories said  that in their meeting this morning, Prime Minister Rabin  promised them not to evacuate Jews from Hebron, not to change  the location of the Jewish neighborhoods in the town, and that  all the settlements in the Gaza Strip, including Dugit,  Netzarim, and Kfar Darom will remain where they are at least  until the final settlement is implemented.    The settlement leaders also told our correspondent Gil  Litman  that the prime minister confirmed in the meeting that there has  been a significant rise in the number of stone-throwing and  firebomb incidents in Judaea and Samaria in recent weeks. Rabin  told them he believes there are now five times more incidents  than there were in the past. Mr. Rabin promised the settlement  leaders that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] would step up its  activities against those who disturb the peace in the  territories. Those attending the meeting were Uri Ari'el,  secretary of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip; Rabbi Yo'el Bin-Nun of 'Ofra, and  Tzvi Hendel, head of the Hof 'Aza Regional Council.</p>

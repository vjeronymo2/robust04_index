			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Risks of Mercosur deal slight Sir, The flaws you point to in the recent Mercosur agreement (Editorial: 'Freeing Latin American trade', August 9) may not be as obvious as you make out. While Argentina has agreed to raise tariffs on capital goods to 14 per cent as a concession to Brazilian demands, in exchange Brazil has agreed to lower tariffs from 20 to 14 per cent. Since Brazil's economy is roughly twice that of Argentina's and its ability to absorb imports proportionately higher, one may take the view that the effect of the agreement on access to the joint market will not have changed very much. Moreover, Brazil's own economic policies have led it to reduce its tariffs and open up its market to imports over the past four years. One may expect it to abide by the recent agreement and continue the trend with its Mercosur partners not only as an extension of the existing policy, but also as a result of pressure from Argentina, which will not want to see back-peddling on the deal. The pressures on Brazil will become even greater if the most committed of the free marketeers in the area, Chile, joins the group. Bilateral trade between Brazil and Argentina has increased more than fourfold since 1990. Over the same period Brazil's trade with the rest of the world has also been rising, and its trade surplus of more than USDollars 1bn a month maintained. Surely this is the best evidence that Mercosur will not lead to inwardness. The risks that the members may be led to believe they have an alternative to global competitiveness and that the agreement may make regional integration more difficult is, I would have thought, slight.

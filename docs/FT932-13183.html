			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: Riveting insights into life in the country Sir, I have been studying, with awe, Brenda Polan's article, 'Never wear you Barbour to shop at Peter Jones' (April 17). It was not until I was on the third reading that it occurred to me - for I am, you will understand, only a slow-witted countryman - that the fascinating people that Brenda Polan describes for us could well be related to Robin Lane Fox's celebrated friends, the Sloane-Wallys. I do hope that this is so and that we are to be regaled with more riveting insights into country life in Hertfordshire, that most rural of counties.

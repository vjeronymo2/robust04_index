			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Martin Marietta sales boosted by acquisition Martin Marietta, the US aerospace group, yesterday posted a surge in revenues and earnings for the first quarter, highlighting the success of its strategy during the industry's post-cold war consolidation, writes Frank McGurty. Mr Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive, attributed the strong results to the 'synergistic benefits' realised through the group's acquisition of General Electric's aerospace division last year. The deal made Martin Marietta the largest supplier of aerospace electronics in the world. Overall, sales jumped 74 per cent to Dollars 2.03bn. The biggest contribution was the electronics arm, which reported revenues of Dollars 850m, more than double the year-earlier level. The space division's sales, at Dollars 650m, also showed improvement, as the group awaited final approval of its purchase of General Dynamics' space systems business, expected later this week. Excluding a special item, earnings were 50 per cent better at Dollars 114.4m, against Dollars 76.4m. Net income of Dollars 184.6m, or Dollars 1.47 a share fully diluted, included a one-time, after-tax gain of Dollars 70.2m, or 56 cents. Earlier this month, the group decided to drop its friendly offer to buy Grumman, a New York-based aircraft maker, and avoid a costly bidding war with Northrop.</p>

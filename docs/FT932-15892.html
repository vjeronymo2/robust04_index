			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys downturn WARDLE Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment concern, yesterday reported a fall in interim profits mainly because of lower interest earnings and an accounting change. Pre-tax profits fell from a restated Pounds 4.92m to Pounds 4.04m in the six months to February 28. The restatement, prompted by adopting FRS 3 led to the reclassification of a Pounds 563,000 gain as exceptional rather than extraordinary, thereby lifting the prior year figure. Operating profits increased 3 per cent to Pounds 2.74m on unchanged turnover of Pounds 38.2m. Net cash fell slightly from Pounds 34m to Pounds 31.3m. Lower interest rates meant net interest received fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.31m. Earnings fell from an adjusted 14p to 10.9p. The company said it planned to increase this year's dividend to compensate shareholders who would otherwise lose out because of changes to the rates of ACT introduced following the budget. The interim dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 5p.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pioneer International up 9% to record level PIONEER International, the Australian building materials and petroleum group, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in net profits to a record ADollars 179m (USDollars 127m) for the year to the end of June. Turnover was down 6 per cent to ADollars 5.1bn. The group said the result was in spite of difficult trading caused by recession in its main markets in Australia, the UK and the US. The result was struck after including a net abnormal profit of ADollars 5.7m. This was created by a ADollars 63.7m profit on the sale of the group's shareholdings in the Ampolex and Oil Search exploration companies, offset by a ADollars 58m write-down of non-current assets. Pioneer said this year was likely to be 'one of the most challenging we will experience'. It added there was evidence of an end to the recession, but tangible signs of recovery were elusive. However, the group said it expected to benefit from the federal government's budget announcement that its programme of public works would be expanded by ADollars 1.2bn to ADollars 4.5bn over the next two years. At the operating level, profits from petroleum activities were flat at ADollars 187.7m because of a fall in demand and a reduction in refinery margins, exacerbated by a change in the pricing formula applied by the Australian regulatory authorities.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,300 touched before profit-takers arrive - Market Report The brakes were slammed on hard when the UK stock market burst briefly through the Footsie 3,300 mark yesterday morning, and the session ended on the downside in moderate selling pressure. With both gilt-edged and sterling quieter at first, equity investors decided to take profits ahead of the closure tonight of an extremely successful two-week trading account. However, government bonds moved up at the close when there were buyers as well as sellers for equities. The final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index, down 5.8 at 3,271.6, compared with a day's low of 3,263.6. The new equity trading account is extended for three weeks to cover the Christmas holiday. Dealers expect plenty of action as brokerage houses and the investment press disclose their share recommendations for the new year, and were unwilling to be short of stock yesterday. Early dealings saw completion of the last of the buying orders put in by the big institutions on Wednesday. Backed up by initial strength in the December futures contract, the Footsie gained nearly 23 points to register a new intraday peak of 3,300.1, showing a rise of 100 points since the Budget speech. Buying has been led by the overseas institutions, with US investment funds making the running. But stock index futures, continuing to exercise a powerful influence, turned sharply downwards and share prices quickly followed. Bank shares, which have been a prime driving force behind the latest upswing in the Footsie, dipped sharply, with marketmakers only too happy to mark prices down in order to attract stock to refill their depleted trading books. Marketmakers have taken heavy punishment this week as prices have raced ahead. Oil shares also took punishment, extending their losses in the late afternoon when US sellers made an appearance. Weak oil prices continued to take their toll of the exploration issues, with Lasmo hit by the departure of the chairman. But across the broader range of equities, activity was more 'stock specific' and investors sought out shares thought to have been overlooked. Stores shares gave back only a few pence. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, extending the range of the Footsie down into second line issues, continued to make headway, rising 6.3 to a new peak of 3,596.2. The Footsie Mid 250 is the area which attracts private investor interest. After falling sharply during the pre-Budget sell-off, the Mid 250 has recovered ground rapidly and once again remained positive in spite of profit-taking in the blue chip stocks. Seaq volume, measured in numbers of shares traded, was high at 884.3m shares, against 821.4m on Wednesday, when retail business worth of Pounds 1.72bn was at the higher end of this year's daily figures. Company statements, while spurring interest in the stocks themselves, did little to change perceptions across the market. Traders stressed the volatility of the equity sector, which was seen as indicating that profit-taking was absorbed easily and quickly, with investors showing no serious signs of doubt regarding the market's gain over the past two weeks. The slower trend of the other leading European bourses did nothing to dim London's conviction that interest rates are on the way down, and that this will confirm predictions that UK base rates will be cut again early in the new year.</p>

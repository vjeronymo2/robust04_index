			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GETS A TASTE OF ARCTIC WEATHER FROM CHILLY RAIN  </P> <P> Southern Californians scurried for umbrellas and sweaters Friday as Arctic  winds dropped temperatures into the 40s and low 50s along the coast and brought  light snow to mountain resorts and passes.  </P> <P> "We dress a little warmer, with the thermals of course," said Officer Mark Ehly  of the California Highway Patrol's Ft. Tejon station, located along Interstate  5 in the Tehachapi Mountains.  </P> <P> It was warmer, but still cloudy and wet at Long Beach Harbor, where a few  intrepid sailors braved the choppy seas to get in a little boating.  </P> <P> "Not a bad day to sail, if you don't mind getting wet," remarked Tony Burt of  the Pacific Sailing Club as he looked out from his office toward the Queen Mary  and the Pacific Ocean. "But personally, I think it's a day to stay inside by  the fire."  </P> <P> About 0.32 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center by 7  p.m. Friday, and a forecast of a low of 47 degrees for Friday night prompted  city officials to announce that they would open armories and recreation centers  near downtown Los Angeles to shelter the homeless.  </P> <P> More than 700 cots will be available through the weekend at four downtown  recreation centers, said George Pallas, of the city homeless coordination unit.  Armories in Van Nuys and West Los Angeles will also be open.  </P> <P> Three homeless men and a woman returned Friday to an abandoned Westlake home  where the night before they had built a campfire in the living room to keep  warm. The fire got out of hand, blackening much of the house.  </P> <P> "We're going to stay in the garage now," a homeless man said as he surveyed the  damage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Rain Coming  </P> <P> The forecast for the Los Angeles Basin for today calls for periods of rain and  maximum temperatures in the low to mid-50s, with rain tapering to showers  tonight, said Dave Beusterien of Weather Data Inc., which provides forecasts to  The Times. Variable clouds with a chance of showers were forecast for Sunday.  </P> <P> More and heavier snow was predicted for today in Southern California mountain  areas, with snow levels dropping to 5,000 feet today and 3,000 feet Sunday,  Beusterien said.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, stores selling warm clothes and ski equipment were doing a  brisk trade Friday.  </P> <P> "We're completely sold out for rentals," said Matt Byran, a salesman at Craig's  Snow Job in West Los Angeles. "Hard goods like skis go around Christmas. The  clothing goes right now."  </P> <P> A light snow had already begun to fall at Lake Arrowhead at about 2 p.m.  Friday, and residents said they were going to leave water faucets dripping to  keep pipes from freezing.  </P> <P> Closer to sea level, light rains caused serious problems for freeway commuters.  </P> <P> Four crashes involving 24 vehicles, including a tanker truck, closed all four  lanes on the westbound Ventura Freeway in Calabasas and backed up cars for  miles at the height of the rush-hour commute.  </P> <P> The crash occurred about 2:15 p.m. near Las Virgenes Road. At one point,  traffic completely stopped for almost five miles.  </P> <P> Scores of drivers poured on to surface streets in search of alternate routes,  many of them driving north to the Simi Valley Freeway to find a way into  Ventura County.  </P> <P> "It's a mess," said Officer Bob Weaver of the California Highway Patrol.  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Observer: In at the Finnish Finland's imminent entry into the European Union has got off to a flying start with the choice of Erkki Liikanen as the country's first European commissioner. Not only is he one of the most assiduous party-throwers in Brussels, where he currently serves as EU ambassador, but he knows his way around the organisation - which is more than can be said for many new commissioners. However, it was touch and go whether Liikanen, 44, would get the job. Early yesterday morning, Prime Minister Esko Aho was still balking at sending Liikanen, a member of the opposition Social Democrats. Aho, who leads the agrarian-based centre party, wanted Ekso Ollila, a Bank of Finland director; others favoured Pertti Salolainen, the foreign trade minister who led Finland's negotiations to enter the Union. Failure to agree allowed President Martti Ahtisaari to push the job Liikanen's way. Liikanen's reputation is certainly higher in Brussels than in Finland where voters still remember him quitting as finance minister in the previous government just before the economy crashed. Will he be as lucky when Jacques Santer hands out the portfolios? Insiders tip the Flying Finn for the personnel portfolio - not particularly exciting but one which will leave other commissioners looking for favours. But why not the more high-powered internal market portfolio, which remains in search of a political heavyweight?</p>

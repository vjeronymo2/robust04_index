			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sinister Intention To Suppress Chongnyon"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Minister  of Justice, Hiroshi Nakai, at a meeting on June 21 issued "an  order" to keep a closer watch on the movements of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), saying  "this is demanded by the situation" surrounding the "nuclear  issue" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according  to a media report from Tokyo.    Shigetaki Ogata, general director of the public security  investigation agency, told the meeting "it is necessary to take  more perfect measures for the investigation into the movements  of Chongnyon than ever before."    Their remarks fully revealed the criminal intention of the  Japanese reactionaries to intensify the on-going suppression of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan on a wholesale scale under the  command of the authorities.    The Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon, an  authoritative organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and  Japan-resident Koreans is the worst violation of human rights,  an illegal political crackdown and a typical model of the  national chauvinist crimes.    The Korean people can hardly repress bitter national  resentment at Japan, which occupied Korea for nearly half a  century and imposed immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings on  the Korean people and is now continuing to persecute those taken  to Japan forcibly from Korea and their descendants, instead of  repenting of its past crimes through generations.    It is only too clear that the suppression of Chongnyon and  Koreans in Japan is part of the premeditated and deliberate  anti- DPRK moves launched by the Japanese authorities, availing  themselves of the U.S. scheme to isolate and stifle the DPRK  under the pretext of its "nuclear issue."    Such a wholesale suppression and the preparation of  legislative arrangements for the establishment of a wartime  system such as the "emergency security law" in Japan, which is  designed to stage a comeback to Korea, indicate that "sanctions"  against the DPRK by the Japanese reactionaries have reached a  practical stage.    If they dare take "sanctions" against the DPRK, ignoring our  repeated warnings, they will meet a severe punishment.    They must clearly see our determination and promptly stop  the  suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.</p>

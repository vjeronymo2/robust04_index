			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Brooke to warn on arts spending MR Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, will tell the Arts Council this week it should be more accountable for the millions of pounds it spends. He will make a Commons statement following last month's report from Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, which showed that the council spends 10p on administration out of every Pounds 1 it receives for the arts. Mr Brooke is unlikely to recommend any of the radical options proposed by Price Waterhouse. These include streamlining the council's structure by cutting the number of posts by 100 to about 50, saving Pounds 2.2m a year. Price Waterhouse also suggested that disposing of the council's present premises would save at least Pounds 1.3m. Last year the Arts Council distributed Pounds 225m for arts projects.</p>

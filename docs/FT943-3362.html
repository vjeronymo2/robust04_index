			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher offshoots turn in mixed performance The increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 82m to Pounds 88.1m at Kingfisher masked a mixed performance from the retailing group's chains. The biggest surprise was Woolworths' fall from a Pounds 2.1m profit to a Pounds 6.9m loss, after suffering from the downturn in computer games sales, which left it with excess stock which had to be heavily marked down to clear. There was also a new Pounds 3.5m depreciation charge on checkout scanning equipment, and Pounds 1.7m redundancy costs following restructuring. Comet also fell from a Pounds 0.7m profit into a Pounds 1.7m loss, hit by higher expansion costs, and increased rents on out-of-town sites. New opening costs in Kingfisher's smaller chains, including Music and Video Club, and the office superstore chain Staples, resulted in a Pounds 2.2m loss (Pounds 0.3m profit). Other chains performed better. Darty, the French electrical retailer which made a full first-half contribution for the first time, made operating profits of Pounds 35.7m, and held margins and increased sales in a shrinking French market. The B&amp;Q DIY chain lifted operating profits to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 41.6m), although sales growth was slower than last year. Superdrug, the chemists chain, also lifted operating profits from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 14m. Chartwell Land, the property division, increased investment income from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 23.1m.</p>

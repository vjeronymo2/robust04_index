			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Fishermen win Dollars 30m aid The Clinton Administration is rushing Dollars 30m of emergency assistance to fishing communities in the north-east suffering from a collapse in fish stocks. The US Commerce Department said this was the first crisis in the fishing industry which warranted extensive federal assistance. Some 20,000 jobs are in jeopardy from the fall-off in stocks and new federal rules designed to rebuild them. Washington is still worried about jobs, which are being created at a slower rate than in past economic recoveries. Such funding as is available in these days of stringent budgetary restraint is given high profile treatment. The Commerce Department credited the assistance to President Clinton's trip to Boston last week when he directed Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary and Mr Leon Panetta, office of management and budget director, to develop an aid package for New England. The department had been working on the package for several weeks. Mr Brown was in Boston yesterday with members of New England's congressional delegation, Massachusetts governor Mr William Weld, a Republican, and members of fishing communities to make the announcement.</p>

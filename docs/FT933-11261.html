			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / The Property Market: A move to the country - Lloyd's Register's controversial plans Lloyd's Register, the ship classification society, shares little more than its name with Lloyd's of London, the insurance market. But it plans to follow the example of its namesake by constructing a new office building designed by the architect Richard Rogers. The plans are once again controversial. This time, however, the controversy is not about the design of the building, but rather about the company's decision to move from London to Liphook in Hampshire. Assuming the building wins planning permission, it expects to move by 1996. There is little doubt that the society needs to leave its existing offices, which are over-crowded, dilapidated and expensive to maintain. 'We have slum-like conditions,' says Mr Patrick O'Ferrall, the society's chairman. But critics are not convinced that the move out of London is justified. It will uproot 60-80 per cent of Lloyd's 1,350 staff and will loosen the society's 233-year-old ties with one of the world's leading centres of maritime business in favour of one with no shipping tradition. 'The move is sad for Lloyd's Register, sad for the City of London and sad for shipping,' lamented a recent editorial in Lloyd's List, the newspaper. '. . . It cannot be good for London's future as a world shipping centre that the leading classification society is set to add to the diaspora.' But Mr O'Ferrall defends the plans for the move, which he set in motion when he joined the society as deputy chairman in early 1991. The relocation is 'good for our customers, good for our staff and thus good for Lloyd's Register and the wider community', he says. Certainly the reason cannot be financial. The collapse of rental values in the City and the expected cut in London rate bills after 1995 have made the capital less expensive. The 376,000 sq ft building is budgeted to cost about Pounds 34m, but the cost of relocating the staff will be far greater. The society may have difficulties in assigning the lease on its Croydon office building, which is currently occupied by its industrial and engineering services division. It has planning permission for a 275,000 sq ft office building on its Fenchurch Street site. But what its value will be by 1996 is highly uncertain. Although there is no clear financial case for the move, Lloyd's believes it is justified by the need to improve its staff's 'quality of life'. 'Getting in and out of London is a painful experience,' says the chairman, who commutes in from Godalming, Surrey, himself. He thinks that productivity will improve if staff have an easier journey and more pleasant surroundings. They are also more likely to stay late if they have an easy journey home, he believes. 'If people's journeys (are) easy you don't get a stampede at 5.30. It will be an added benefit,' he says. He hopes the society will also benefit from bringing its workforce together under one roof. The site in Hampshire was chosen after an exhaustive search of the south-west for places with easy access to London and airports. Lloyd's feels confident that its workforce supports the idea because of the findings of a questionnaire it commissioned in the early stages of its plans. However, companies that move to the country often find their employees miss the bustle of towns. Debenham Tewson Research, a property adviser, published research showing that many tenants that moved out of town missed the shopping, leisure facilities and access to public transport to be found in cities. Lloyd's is considering installing shopping facilities and a bus service to and from the nearest station. An extra problem for its employees may be the disruption suffered by their spouses, two-thirds of whom are in employment. That said, those who work in London will find that Liphook is within commuting distance. Lloyd's is not severing its link with the City entirely. It is keeping one of its City buildings, the listed Fenchurch Street headquarters by Thomas Collcutt - one of the finest turn-of-the-century buildings in the City - for the use of senior staff, particularly those involved in marketing. It intends to use videoconferencing facilities to communicate between London and Liphook. Nonetheless, it is hard to dispute the conclusion that Lloyd's decision to move is a blow for London. Central London has lost about 60,000 jobs over the past seven years through relocations. The flight of companies, which reached record levels in 1991, has slowed down as a result of the recession. But as Lloyd's decision shows, the City cannot take the continued presence of even its oldest companies for granted.</p>

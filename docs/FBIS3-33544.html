The program includes the elimination of  investments in new projects and programs, except for those  projects considered to be of utmost importance.    According to the decree issued by the government of  conservative President Sixto Duran-Ballen, the procurement of  new domestic and foreign loans now depends on the existence of  specific financing. The government will not agree to any  international commitments, agreements, or contracts without  first ensuring the existence of funds, and commercial contracts  will only be signed once it has been verified that dependable  domestic or foreign financing exists to support them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhou Guangting (0719 1639 1656), Li Xunzhou (2621 6064 </F> 5297), and special reporter Wang Guocai (3769 0948 2088):  "Temper an Army of Steel--Chronicle of General Secretary Jiang  Zemin's Concern for Building Armed Police Force Units"]    [Text] The Chinese People's Armed Police Force [PAPF] was  reestablished in 1983 under the ideological guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of reform and opening up, through  the necessity to provide a stable social environment for reform  and construction. Over the past decade, under the leadership of  the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the CPC  Central Military Commission and with the concern and support of  local party committees, governments, and the masses at all  levels, this unit has matured into an important armed force  defending the socialist system and maintaining social stability.    Comrade Jiang Zemin, as Party general secretary, State  president, and chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission,  is a very busy man and occupied with a myriad of state affairs  but he is very much concerned about the building of the PAPF.  Over the past few years, his footprints have extended across  PAPF battalions in 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities throughout the country. He has encouraged vast  numbers of PAPF officers and men to accomplish their mission and  constantly make contributions to the motherland and the people.  <H3>  A Good Social Environment Is Essential for Economic  Construction. General Secretary Jiang Urged: "The PAPF Should  Stand in the Forefront of Maintaining Public Order and Social  Stability." </H3>   Whenever people step into the PAPF headquarters, the  Triangle  Building, the first things that come into view are the 16  glittering characters of: "Strengthening the Building of the  PAPF, Defending the Socialist System" erected in the hall. This  was the inscription made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin when  he inspected the PAPF headquarters on 19 December 1990. Up to  now, cadres of the PAPF Headquarters retain fresh in their  memory the scenes of General Secretary Jiang's inspection. At  1515 on that day, General Secretary Jiang, accompanied by Qiao  Shi, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee  member and secretary of the CPC Central Commission of Political  Science and Law, went to the PAPF headquarters. He met  cordially with cadres at and above the department level,  conscientiously listened to work reports presented by leaders of  the PAPF, and often chipped in with cheerful and humorous  remarks.    General Secretary Jiang analyzed the domestic and  international situation and expounded on the nature, position,  and role of the PAPF from the high plane of consolidating the  socialist system. He said: "Our present socialist system has  been built at the expense of the bloody sacrifices of tens of  millions of revolutionary martyrs and we must definitely defend  it. The PAPF is a component of the armed forces of our Party  and our country. Its tasks are different from that of the  People's Liberation Army [PLA], but both the PAPF and the PLA  serve the people. The PAPF undertakes important tasks in  defending the socialist system and maintaining social stability  and we must definitely build it up well."    Our hearts were filled with deep feelings and we have to  shoulder heavy burdens. General Secretary Jiang placed high  hopes on the PAPF in safeguarding socialist modernization.    On the eve of the 1991 Spring Festival, General Secretary  Jiang went to the headquarters of the Henan PAPF, cordially paid  homage to officers and men, and said: "The Spring Festival is  approaching. I am paying an early New Year call on all of you!"  Then, he pointed out: "Our Party set out the proposal on the  `Eighth Five-Year Plan' and the `10-Year Program' at the Seventh  Plenary Session of the 13th Central Party Committee, which was  recently held. Now, the whole country is studying and  implementing it. However, there is a very important problem  which is directly related to your tasks. It is impossible to  accomplish our economic construction without a stable situation.  Only under a stable political situation can we really devote  our energies to promoting our economy. Viewed from the present  international situation it is, by and large, favorable to us.  Peace and development are still the two themes of the world but  we should also watch out for the volatile international  situation. We must always heighten our vigilance against some  foreign forces which infiltrate our country and carry out  subversive activities. We must resolutely nip in the bud every  symptom which endangers social stability once we discover it.  This is, in the first place, the duty of the PAPF. I hope that  all of you always have high morale and exert yourselves in the  struggle to create and maintain a good social environment for  our country's economic construction."    On 12 October 1992, General Secretary Jiang was delivering  his report to the 14th CPC National Congress in the Great Hall  of the People. "The PAPF is an important power in safeguarding  our socialist modernization." The hearts of all armed police  delegates to the 14th CPC National Congress were overflowing  hearing this sonorous voice. Delegates said excitedly in the  discussions: It is the first time that the PAPF has been  mentioned in the report to the party congress. General  Secretary Jiang has further defined the glorious mission of the  PAPF during the new era of development of the socialist  undertaking.    General Secretary Jiang set forth the ideology of allowing  the PAPF to stand in the forefront and fight in the van when  dealing with emergencies and maintaining social stability in  accordance with the peculiarities of the PAPF in performing its  missions.    On the night of 19 April 1991, General Secretary Jiang went  to inspect Sichuan Province. After a discussion with the  Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government,  disregarding his tiredness after a day's work, he asked Lin  Xianze and Li Kaiyuan, commander and deputy commander of the  Sichuan Armed Police Corps, about the detailed public security  situation in Sichuan. On the following morning, in drizzling  rain, General Secretary Jiang went to the Sichuan Armed Police  Corps Headquarters for an inspection. On the parade ground,  while braving the rain, he met cadres from the headquarters and  earnestly told everybody: "We must implement the basic party  line unswervingly and devote our energies to accomplishing  economic construction. However, it is impossible to accomplish  economic construction without a stable and united social  environment and there is no exception to this, in modern or  ancient times in China or elsewhere. No country has ever  accomplished economic construction under constantly chaotic  circumstances. Only with social stability and unity can we have  the preconditions to develop our economy. On what does  stability and unity rely? It relies on correct policies, strong  ideological and political work, skillful handling of the two  different kinds of conflicts and, in the final analysis, it  relies on economic development. The PAPF must stand in the  frontline and fight in the van in safeguarding public security.  Our PAPF must always be prepared for any destabilizing event  and decisively nip it in the bud, thus ensuring a stable and  unified situation.    Comrade Jiang Zemin has expounded on many occasions since  becoming general secretary, the ideology of allowing the PAPF to  stand in the front line to maintain social stability.    --On 3 July 1989, he talked about the task of further  safeguarding social stability when meeting all the comrades who  attended the National Public Security Department (Bureau) Heads  Conference. He said: "I think under normal circumstances, we  mainly rely on our public security personnel and our armed  police."    --On 28 September 1990, he emphatically pointed out when  inspecting the Inner Mongolian Armed Police Corps: "As far as  the task of maintaining social stability is concerned, those who  stand in the forefront are the Armed Police."    --On 19 September 1993, he further stressed when reviewing  the PAPF's achievements in military training: "As far as the  defense of state security and social stability is concerned, the  ideology of marching to the forefront and fighting in the van  must be firmly established in the PAPF."    The ideology of "standing in the forefront" and "fighting in  the van" has been kept firmly in the minds of armed police  officers and men and has become their strong impetus in  defending modernization.  <H3>  The PAPF Spreads All Over the Country and Is In Direct  Contact With Society. General Secretary Jiang Stressed: "It Is  Very Important To Vigorously Advocate and Carry Forward Our  Army's Glorious Tradition." </H3>   The PAPF has to undertake many tasks covering an extensive  areas. Due to special tasks and the macroscopic social  environment of reform and opening up, special requirements have  been set on building the ideology and style in this force. An  important matter which General Secretary Jiang often pays  attention to is how to preserve the purity of the PAPF.    In the small hours of a certain day in March 1991, General  Secretary Jiang, who was inspecting Hunan, could not calm  himself for a long time after reading a letter addressed from  Mao Anying to his relative in October 1949.    The following day, General Secretary Jiang addressed a  meeting attended by PLA and PAPF cadres, at and above the  division level, stationed in Changsha City. He said with deep  feelings: "A relative of Mao Anying wrote him a letter hoping  that Chairman Mao could assign a government post to another  relative of Mao Anying. In his letter of reply Mao Anying stated  his views. The main points were that the fundamental difference  distinguishing the New China from the old, the Communist Party  from the Kuomintang, and Mao Zedong from Chiang Kai-shek, lay in  the virtue of not seeking personal gain. Today, this letter is  still worthy of our study. If vast numbers of our Party members  and cadres can serve the interests of the majority and refrain  from seeking personal gain, just as the revolutionary martyrs  did, our party style will be improved and our Party will become  stronger. We must frequently teach vast numbers of cadres and  soldiers to carry forward the fine tradition, cultivate  patriotic thinking and communist values and outlook on life, and  serve the people wholeheartedly."    In the autumn of 1991, General Secretary Jiang went to  Xibaipo to "reflect on the past in light of the present" and all  sorts of feelings welled up his mind. When addressing the  police from Hebei Provincial Public Security Department and  cadres from Hebei Provincial Armed Police Corps, he said: "A  visit to Xibaipo is a very good education for all of us.  Xibaipo was once the seat of the Central Party Committee and  the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee  was held there. At the party plenary session, Chairman Mao  urged that we must be modest and prudent and guard against  arrogance and rashness and that we must keep to the style of  hard struggle and plain living. In this respect, how well are  we now? This is the question which all of us should ponder."    In January 1992, as No.10 Detachment of the Shanghai Armed  Police Corps launched activities to mark the 10th anniversary of  "emulating the Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road," General  Secretary Jiang went there on an inspection. While attentively  viewing silk banners and certificates of merit in the  detachment's honorary room he could not help saying: "We must  be willing to act as orderlies who are untainted with unhealthy  practices and this is a tradition which we must carry forward!"  General Secretary Jiang also wrote an inscription for the No.  10 Detachment: "The new generation under neon lights must  emulate the Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road, to encourage  officers and men to learn from the `Good No. 8 Company,' to  carry forward the glorious tradition of never being tainted with  corrupt practices and constantly make new contributions to  safeguarding Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization.    One morning in the early summer of 1993, the West Room in  the Great Hall of the People was ablaze with lights. General  Secretary Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen,  Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, and other cadres, listened to reports on  the PAPF work situation by Commander Ba Zhongtan and Political  Commissar Zhang Shutian. Afterwards, he emphatically told  members of the PAPF party committee: "Our PAPF is spread all  over the country, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other more  prosperous localities. In strengthening the building of the  force, particularly in the work of building our ideology and  style, we are faced with an environment of constantly deepening  reform and wider opening up. It is very important to take the  new reality and new tasks into consideration and vigorously  advocate and carry forward our Army's glorious tradition. The  PLA's Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road always maintained its  distinctive revolutionary character amidst an atmosphere of  debauchery, which was very remarkable. There is always the  question of guarding against degeneration in army building in  times of peace, and we must never be tainted with corrupt  practices. The PAPF is the same in this respect. The PAPF is in  direct contact with society, in particular, some of the units  live in some prosperous and open cities and are faced with  scenes of debauchery. Therefore, it is necessary to teach and  encourage officers and men to stand the test and maintain a high  morale."    These remarks, which were full of deep feelings, inspired  vast numbers of armed police officers and men to inherit the  glorious tradition of our Party and Army, carry forward the  "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping,  maintain the true qualities of the people's army, and portray a  good image of people's guards.  <H3>  The Sacred Mission of Maintaining Social Stability Sets a  Very High Demand on the PAPF's Building. General Secretary  Jiang Pointed Out: "The PAPF Must Pay Attention to Its Software  and Hardware and Constantly Improve the Capability To Perform  Its Duties and To Handle Emergencies." </H3>   On 19 September 1993, during the autumn harvest, General  Secretary Jiang went to the PAPF Special Police Academy in the  suburbs of Beijing to review PAPF achievements in military  training. Following a number of brilliant performances and  bursts of warm applause, he cheerfully stood up to wave  greetings to officers and men and commended them: "Your reports  gave expression to your superb and competent military technique,  your valiant and tenacious fighting style, and the mental  attitude of staunch guards. The comprehensive building of the  PAPF is being constantly strengthened and new progress in all  kinds of work is being constantly achieved, the Central Party  Committee is satisfied." After fully affirming the building and  work of the PAPF, General Secretary Jiang set overall demands on  how to further strengthen the PAPF's building. He made a call to  armed police officers and men: It is necessary to uphold  steadfastly our Party's absolute leadership of the Army;  resolutely comply with the command of the Central Party  Committee and the Central Military Commission; firmly implement  instructions issued by the Central Party Committee the State  Council, and the Central Military Commission; and steadfastly  implement the basic party line. It is necessary to  conscientiously study Mao Zedong's military thought and Deng  Xiaoping's thinking on military building during the new period;  resolutely implement PLA regulations; and uphold the principle  of improving the quality of army building. It is necessary to  place education in a strategic position and integrate it with  the reality of the PAPF to go in for rigorous training, set  stricter demands, and enforce stricter controls. It is  necessary to improve weaponry; enhance military and political  quality; and improve the capability to perform our duties and  handle emergencies under modern conditions. It is necessary to  inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of our Party  and Army; strive to develop the PAPF into a dauntless unit which  is "qualified politically and competent militarily" and which  "has a fine style of work, adheres to strict discipline, and is  ensured of adequate maintenance and supplies"; and  conscientiously perform the sacred mission of maintaining state  security and social stability!    General Secretary Jiang not only portrayed the magnificent  blueprint of the PAPF's building but also set concrete demands  on it. He used engineering terminology, in light of the new  domestic and international situation and the PAPF's  characteristics, to liken the PAPF's equipment to "hardware" and  to equate the military and political quality of officers and men  to "software." He stated unequivocally: "The PAPF must pay  attention to both the software and hardware and constantly  improve the capability to perform your duties and to handle  emergencies."    On the afternoon of 2 August 1989, a meeting was called  commending public security personnel and the Shanghai PAPF.  General Secretary Jiang specially canceled his schedule and  cheerfully attended the meeting to extend his greetings. He  also gave important instructions on the building of public  security and the PAPF. He pointed out: "As an instrument of  the people's democratic dictatorship, public security and the  PAPF must be armed with goods and materials as well as vigor.  The latter means that we must be armed with  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, always maintain political  alertness, and have a high degree of consciousness."    In the early summer of 1993, the new situation in the  development of the socialist market economy brought new vitality  to the PAPF and also posed new problems, one after another, to  the building of the force. In order to enable officers and men  to adapt to the new situation, General Secretary Jiang promptly  issued a call to the force to study more. He stressed when  meeting members of the PAPF party committee at the Great Hall of  the People that, in the process of developing a socialist market  economy, we must constantly learn new knowledge and that his was  also very important to strengthening the building of the force.  He said: "Under the new situation, our leaders at all levels  must strive to learn new knowledge and new things. We are now  engaging in a socialist market economy but what exactly is the  market, the market mechanism, and the socialist market economy?  Many comrades do not have, or are short of, basic knowledge in  this field. Hence, we must study it well and should study it  repeatedly. We must study scientific and technological  knowledge through various channels to advance our cultural  quality to a new stage. Our cultural quality covers every  aspect, including the quality of economic knowledge, of  scientific and technological knowledge, and of military  knowledge. The PAPF must attach importance to improving its  military, scientific, and technological quality. In the first  place, it must improve the military and scientific and  technological quality of leading armed police cadres at all  levels, particularly that of senior cadres. Only when this has  been done can the force become really combat- ready."    In order to help fully improve the PAPF military and  political quality and make its "software" and "hardware"  competent, General Secretary Jiang personally inspected the PAPF  Training Ground despite many claims on his time.    On the morning of 30 July 1991, it was scorching hot in  Tianjin Municipality. General Secretary Jiang, who was there on  an inspection, went to the Tianjin Armed Police Corps No. 6  Detachment Training Ground and braved the intense heat of summer  to watch in the open the report-back performance of military  training. After watching such brilliant performances as  emergency dispatch, tactics of using batons and shields, and the  formation of anti-riot squads, he said cheerfully: "This kind  of competency is what we should have, especially in large  cities. In case emergencies arise, we can immediately dispatch  the armed police to nip them in the bud."    On 4 May 1992, a get-together was held at the Great Hall of  the People to mark the 70th anniversary of the Communist Youth  League's founding and General Secretary Jiang, who attended, was  impressed by the unique skills demonstrateded by the armed  policemen. Full of zest, he talked to the performers from the  Special Police Academy and repeatedly praised them on their  extraordinary skills.    It has never been easy to strengthen the building of PAPF  "hardware" and party and government leaders and the departments  of politics and law at all levels must support and attach  importance to it. Hence, on many occasions, General Secretary  Jiang has told leading comrades in provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities that we must attach importance to  building the PAPF "hardware." We should spare no expense in  properly arming the armed police. In compliance with General  Secretary Jiang's instructions, party committees and governments  in various localities have: Paid great attention to building  the PAPF; given strong support to them in terms of finance and  goods and materials; set up a number of regular barracks; and  have installed groups of excellent cavalry.    Living up to our Party's and the people's concern and  expectations, the PAPF have made arduous efforts to strengthen  the building of "software" and "hardware" and constantly improve  its combat strength. As a result, a number of heroic  collectives which are ready to assemble at the first call and  capable of fighting and winning, such as the "special police of  Lingnan," the "iron fist of Nankai," and the "keen sword of  Cangshan," have emerged.  <H3>  Soldiers Are the Basis of the Force. General Secretary  Jiang Hoped That the "Relationship Between Officers and Men and  Between Comrades Should be Even Closer Than the Relationship  Between Family Members." </H3>   The Shanghai Armed Police Corps No. 10 Detachment will never  forget 18 January 1992. On that day, General Secretary Jiang  visited them and went straight to the dormitory of the Class No.  2. He touched the soldiers' quilts and asked: "Are you feeling  cold?"    On learning that every soldier was given a quilt, a woolen  blanket, and an overcoat, he smiled and said to the soldiers:  "You have three layers of warmth." Everybody present laughed.    General Secretary Jiang asked about soldiers' cultural and  recreational activities. He told leaders of the corps by his  side: "Soldiers' cultural and recreational activities must be  organized well."    General Secretary Jiang also inspected the kitchen and asked  in detail about the varieties and nutritious value of the meals.    General Secretary Jiang urged leaders of the PAPF at all  levels to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition initiated  by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and revolutionaries of the older  generation and pay great attention to the building of the force  by maintaining close ties between officers and men.    On 17 May 1990, General Secretary Jiang met cadres from the  Hainan Armed Police Corps and PLA stationed in Hainan at and  above the division level. He urged all of them to fully  understand the importance of unity between officers and men from  the high plane of the nature of the People's Army. He said  sincerely: "Our Army is a proletarian force and the people's  own army. Unity between officers and men and support given to  soldiers has always been the fine tradition of our Army. Why do  the broad masses support the revolution and the Army and send  their children to the Army? It is precisely because our Army  fights and works for the people's interests and, for this same  reason, the relationship between officers and men and between  comrades is even closer than the relationship between family  members."    To counter some of the relationship problems between  officers and men in a small number of units, General Secretary  Jiang twice urged party committees and leaders at all levels to  pay attention to solving these problems in grass-roots units.  He said: "The fact that some problems have arisen in the  relationship between officers and men shows that we have not  been painstaking enough in doing our ideological work and we do  not have adequate understanding of soldiers' ideological trends.  Something happens but we often do not know the reason why and  muddle through. How can we act like this? In the past, company  commanders and political instructors would watch every night  which soldiers tossed about in bed or which soldiers suddenly  ate less than they normally did. In these cases, company  commanders and political instructors would try to understand  whether or not the soldiers had ideological problems or whether  or not their families had any problems. Such a fine tradition  of doing painstaking ideological work can never be cast away!  It is very important to be solicitous about soldiers' health,  understand their mental state, be concerned about their weal and  woe, and solve their problems."    As general secretary of our Party, state president, and  chairman of the Central Military Commission, Comrade Jiang Zemin  is extremely busy but he is always concerned about the PAPF  building and spares time to visit armed police officers and men  to talk to them meticulously. His conduct sets an example to  leaders at all levels.    On 13 October 1989, General Secretary Jiang inspected work  in  Jiangxi. Around noon on that day, after finishing his work, he  had photos taken with leading comrades of the provincial party  committee and working personnel. At 0900 the following day,  after learning that six soldier guards who had been on duty and  had not had their photos taken with him, General Secretary Jiang  Zemin joyfully agreed to have one more photo taken. When he saw  that the six soldier guards stood behind him in a reserved  manner, he moved a step backward and cordially said: "It is  better to stand alongside to take a photo." Then, the general  secretary stood in the midst of the soldiers and the photo was  taken.    On the morning of 13 November 1991, in the cold wind of the  early winter, General Secretary Jiang and other leading comrades  from the Central Party Committee went to a construction site at  Liangshuihe, Beijing, to participate in the work. Red flags  fluttered over the construction site, which was seething with  excitement. At 0955, General Secretary Jiang went to an armed  police construction site and extended cordial greetings to the  officers and men. After learning from leaders of Beijing  Municipality that due to inadequate machinery, the officers and  men had borne many hardships and made great contributions to  flood control projects, he repeatedly praised them saying:  "Great, great!" The general secretary's commendation was like  a warm current which boosted the strength of thousands of armed  police officers and men to surmount difficulties and which  inspired everybody to fulfill his task while ensuring quality.    Cordial care is a tremendous driving force. Living up to the  expectations of General Secretary Jiang and the Central Party  Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission, armed police officers and men have: Satisfactorily  completed the task of guarding against and dealing with  emergencies; guaranteed the safety of fixed targets and targets  of temporary service; achieved remarkable results in rushing to  deal with emergencies and in providing disaster relief; and the  have played an important role in the comprehensive management of  public security, thus making contributions to safeguarding  socialist modernization.</p>

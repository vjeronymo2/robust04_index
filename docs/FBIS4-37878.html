			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 25 Jun (MENA)--The Sudanese opposition  al-Ummah Party has accused the Sudanese security authorities of  harassing party leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi who was arrested last  Monday. A statement by the party said al-Mahdi and two of his  aides, who are detained in a Khartoum prison, have suffered  various harassment acts. Their families are not allowed to  visit them and they have been denied clean clothes and food from  outside the prison.    The statement added that the Sudanese security authorities  have barred the lawyers who offered to defend al-Mahdi from  contacting him and obtaining an indictment against al-Mahdi and  his colleagues.    The statement appealed to human rights organizations and  fraternal and friendly forces to continue pressuring the  Sudanese Government to guarantee the safety of and release  al-Mahdi and his aides immediately.</p>

It said no senior ministry officials who have retired  since January went to any of the 59 major construction companies  affiliated with the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors  or smaller companies outside the federation.    Figures released by Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi  after  a cabinet meeting showed that the 20 retired lower-ranking who  did find jobs in the industry went to smaller firms. The figure  compared with the 163 former ministry employees who found  employment in the construction industry after retirement in the  whole of 1992.    None of the 20 had seniority higher than section chief,  compared with four above that rank for the same period in 1993.    Since most staff retire from the ministry in April, ministry  sources say the number of staff announcing their intended  retirement by then differs little from the total for the year.    In August 1993, the then Construction Minister, Kishiro  Nakamura, officially discouraged the practice whereby its  employees found postretirement positions in companies with which  they had had close dealings while serving in the bureaucracy.  The practice was criticized as a cause of corruption.    Nakamura was arrested March 11 in a bribery case. Meanwhile,  the Tokyo district court extended for 10 days the period of  detention of former Construction Minister Nakamura, who was  arrested on suspicion of bribe taking.    The court approved the prosecutors' request for Nakamura's  detention for an additional period from Wednesday to April 1,  court officials said.    Nakamura, 44, is suspected of receiving a 10 million yen  bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. as a reward for  helping quash the filing of a criminal charge by the Fair Trade  Commission in connection with a bid-rigging affair in Saitama  Prefecture in 1992. Since his arrest on March 11, Nakamura has  refused to answer questions from prosecutors, investigative  sources said.</p>

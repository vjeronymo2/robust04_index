			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 7 Jan (EFE) -- The  Mexican Government has undertaken an operation to help the  civilian population in Chiapas State, victims of the armed  conflict between the Army and rebel groups since 1 January.    With the intensification of clashes between the Mexican  Armed  Forces and the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN)  near dozens of civilian towns, thousands of residents are  without basic services and have fled their homes to save their  lives. Almost 1,000 peasants and Indians have been caught in  the middle of the Air Force bombardment of the mountainous San  Cristobal de las Casas area and in the midst of crossfires that  have destroyed homes and crops.    In response to complaints by civilians, the Mexican Army has  reiterated that its forces have not attacked civilian towns and  pledged not to do so.    The government, church, and civilian organizations are  setting up shelters for the Indians and peasants who have fled  their homes because of the bombings. Thus far two shelters have  been established in towns far from San Cristobal de las Casas  and near neighboring Tabasco State, where civilians seeking help  will be temporarily housed and their safety against rebel  attacks guaranteed. It is expected that between today and  tomorrow another two shelters will be opened. Additionally,  corn, beans, rice, sugar, oil, powdered milk, and soup  concentrate are being distributed among the most severely  affected civilians. State-owned Mexican Petroleum expects to  send approximately 20 tons of supplies to the area between today  and tomorrow.    Hundreds of EZLN members have focused on occupying small  towns in southern Chiapas to threaten the authorities and  proclaim fragile victories over the soldiers; in the process,  they have cut off sewage services and the supply of gas, power,  and potable water. Dozens of tanker trucks have been sent from  Mexico City with 50,000 liters of potable water to prevent the  spread of gastrointestinal diseases among the civilian  population. As a result of the shortage of domestic gas, the  operation of a mobile plant has been authorized in the war zone  to normalize the supply of fuel and to avoid further problems  for the civilian population.    Meanwhile, the Institute of Social Security and Services for  Government Workers (ISSSTE) has sent ambulances, several tons of  surgical equipment, analgesics, antidiarrhetics, plasma  expanders, and first aid material. It is expected that the  ISSSTE and other medical institutions will continue to send  medicine, vaccines against typhoid fever and tetanus, oral  serum, antibiotics, and other first aid material.    Meanwhile, the National Defense Secretariat (SDN) reiterated  today in a press communique that the Armed Forces have not  staged any attacks whatsoever on civilian targets. "The SDN has  paid special attention to the protection of the civilian  population and respect for human rights during the course of the  operations under way in the area," the communique asserts. The  communique also states that during combat on Thursday one  soldier was killed and eight were seriously wounded. The SDN  has officially announced that almost 100 people have been killed  in the clashes, including soldiers, rebels and civilians, but  Red Cross reports indicate that the bodies of at least 190  rebels have been picked up from the streets.</p>

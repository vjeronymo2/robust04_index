Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    Sakuma, a professional SDF officer, let out the bellicose  blast as soon as he took office as an advisor to the SDF. This  is a very ill-boding act. This indicates that the Japanese  military quarters, having built up strength for turning Japan  into a military power, are now going to embark upon the road of  reinvasion, exerting a direct influence even on the state power.    His utterances show how frenziedly the war-thirsty military  quarters are trying to proceed overseas by destroying the  domestic device of legal control.    Sakuma disclosed the scheme to create a legal condition for  a  war of aggression when he rattled on "revision of the SDF law"  and "study and enactment of a law on the case of emergency."  Should the arbitrariness of the military be allowed and given  greater scope in Japan with a record of aggression behind her,  it will, no doubt, follow in the footsteps of the Japanese  imperialists.    Korea is the first target of reinvasion of the Japanese  reactionaries. Sakuma's claim that Japan, together with South  Korea, "is a party concerned in a possible Korean war" cannot be  construed otherwise than an outcry of Japan threatening a war in  Korea.    The war-hungry military quarters of Japan should ponder over  the matter, not making a mistake as regards the DPRK.</p>

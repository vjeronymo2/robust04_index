			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Howard seeks better EC-wide job notification THE GOVERNMENT will seek to improve the system for notifying job vacancies on an EC-wide basis during the UK's presidency of the Community in the second half of this year. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, will also use the UK's six-month presidency to review services offered by public employment agencies throughout the EC. Progress on health and safety and the free movement of workers are are also likely to be among the priorities for the government during the UK's presidency. The government hopes to use the presidency to persuade ministers from other EC governments of the validity of its employment policies.

An international conference on risk assessment is planned, and that would tie in with the European year of health and safety beginning in March. Work to resolve social security issues relating to the movement of workers, such as portable pensions, will also be high on the agenda. Much of what has been proposed for the UK presidency would continue if Labour won the coming general election. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday that a Labour government would create a better climate for the discussions with an early commitment that the UK would accept the social chapter. UK employers will not be able to opt out of the social chapter because union negotiators will incorporate its precepts into their bargaining, according to Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union. Mr Edmonds said at a weekend conference in Oxford: 'British employees will not put up with second-class status, and they are looking to their trade unions to negotiate equal conditions with Europeans.'</p>

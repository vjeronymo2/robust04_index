			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter: Index will further the cause of derivatives Sir, It is with dismay that I note your imminent introduction of a medium capitalisation index to be followed by a family of real-time market sector indices ('New UK share indices to join existing benchmarks', September 2). These new members will further the cause of derivatives which are already threatening to undermine the functioning of the underlying market. At the same time institutional managers will be further opting out of their responsibilities by increasing the scope for index-tracking. By definition these funds can only react to previous price movements, thereby exaggerating trends and increasing volatility undesirably. Performance management will become more detailed but the additional statistics may only serve to confuse. In my years as a fund manager, we were paid to attempt to outperform the future rather than to concentrate on jobbing backwards. Emphasis on historic mathematics must also be very discouraging to the management of quoted companies and, I suggest, provide a classic case of the tail wagging the dog] Roger Parsons, 9 Holly Lodge, 41 Lindsay Road, Poole, Dorset BH13 6BQ</p>

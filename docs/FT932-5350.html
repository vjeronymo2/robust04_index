			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Leasing scheme for rail stock THE government yesterday announced plans to create three new companies to lease passenger rolling stock to rail operators which win franchises to run trains after the British Rail privatisation begins next April, John Willman writes. The companies will initially be established as BR subsidiaries, with access to the National Loans Fund for state-owned organisations. However, they will be expected to seek private-sector capital to finance new investment and will eventually be privatised. Advisers are to be sought from the private sector to structure the three companies and provide the commercial and financial skills needed to set them up. BR will seek tenders next week. The companies will take over the existing BR fleet of 11,000 vehicles, worth about Pounds 2bn at written-down historic cost value, on April 1 next year. The fleet will be divided between the companies so that there is more than one lessor for most types of rolling stock. The lease companies will offer operating leases, bearing the residual value risk. They will not have in-house maintenance capabilities, and will contract with engineering companies for whatever maintenance the lessees are not required to do.</p>

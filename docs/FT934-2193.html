			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Arts: Joan Cross - Obituary The soprano Joan Cross, one of the most distinguished singers since the first world war, has died at the age of 93 in London. Born in 1900, she studied under the composer Holst. She then graduated from the Old Vic chorus to small solo parts before becoming leading soprano at the sister-theatre, Sadler's Wells. This phase of her career culminated in 1945, when she sang Ellen Orford in the first production of Britten's Peter Grimes. Joan Cross remained closely associated with Britten, as a founder member of the English Opera Group formed in 1946 and as the creator of a succession of leading roles in his operas - the Female Chorus in The Rape of Lucretia, Lady Billows in Albert Herring, Queen Elizabeth in Gloriana (at Covent Garden), Mrs Grose in The Turn of the Screw. She worked as opera producer in London, Holland and Norway and, with Anne Wood, founded the Opera School (later National School of Opera) in 1948. In praising all she did at a time of operatic consolidation in Britain there is a danger of overlooking Cross's excellence as a singer of the standard repertory. In Mozart her Fiordiligi and in Verdi her Desdemona must serve as just two admirable examples of her use of an English-type soprano voice under masterly control with quiet but unmistakable authority. She was not a glamorous performer, but her sense of style, respect for words and music and sharp intelligence were ample compensation. In a wartime Beggar's Opera her gin-soaked, tatterdemalion Mrs Peachum revealed a gift for character acting not fully exploited. She was awarded a CBE in 1951.</p>

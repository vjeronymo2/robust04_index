			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG BURNING  </P> <P> I've read the articles and letters to the editor regarding the Supreme Court's  flag-burning decision and the hoopla about a possible constitutional amendment.  Give us all a break! There's a very easy way to stop all this nonsense and  satisfy the pro- and anti-burners using laws that probably already are on the  books.  </P> <P> If someone burns a flag he's arrested for either burning without a permit or  polluting the air. In this way you can burn all the flags you want but you have  to do it where there are no anti-open fire ordinances or no clean air  regulations. Simple, everybody's satisfied.  </P> <P> MICHAEL STRATTON  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

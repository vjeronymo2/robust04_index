			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES;  </P> <P> REBEL BAND KILLS AMERICAN RANCHER  </P> <P> Communist rebels killed an elderly American rancher on the central Philippine  island of Masbate after he refused to pay "revolutionary taxes," officials  said.  </P> <P> The victim, Stewart Frank Raab, was the second American killed by Filipino  rebels in a month and the fifth in the past year. Raab, 76, was seized Tuesday  by about 30 New People's Army guerrillas at his ranch near Milagros, 240 miles  southeast of Manila, a military spokesman said by telephone from Masbate. Raab,  who was born in the Philippines when it was still an American colony, had been  paying "revolutionary taxes" -- or protection money -- until the rebels  increased the fee to $34,000 a year.  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Dole seeks review of WTO's decisions Senator Robert Dole, the likely majority leader of the US Senate, is requesting establishment of an eminent person's group to review decisions to be taken by the new World Trade Organisation and report on them to Congress. He is also seeking assurances that the US could pull out of the WTO at any time after it succeeds the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade next year. Mr Dole, who represents the grain-growing state of Kansas, said he was looking for a way to 'extricate us from the World Trade Organisation, if we are getting adverse decisions. That's the big sticking point, at least in my part of the country.' Mr Dole's suggestions coincided with requests from Republican leaders to delay a vote on a the Uruguay Round world trade treaty due at the end of the month. Mr Jesse Helms, of North Carolina and incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to US president Bill Clinton requesting the vote on liberalising world trade be postponed until early in 1995 because more hearings were needed. Republicans will take control of both the House and Senate next year and some Republican lawmakers believe the change in power gives them an chance to recast the Gatt legislation. Under congressional 'fast track' rules, the implementing legislation now moving through both Houses cannot be amended. Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, has called for bipartisan co-operation on the Gatt treaty. 'I think all of us recognise the importance of getting that kind of major trade agreement enacted,' Mr Panetta said. 'It will be a test of our ability to work together to ensure that we are trying to protect this country's interest,' he said this week. The new provisions, as proposed by Senator Dole, could be attached to a trade bill which would also grant the Administration renewed fast track authority to negotiate new free trade agreements in Latin America. Senator Dole, widely expected to run for his party's presidential nomination in 1996, is seeking to placate the many conservative Republicans who oppose the WTO on the grounds that it will require the ceding of US sovereignty to an international organisation. The Gatt treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, would cut trade barriers and cut tariffs worldwide.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names close to clear victory on Outhwaite A GROUP of Lloyd's Names are close to winning a clear victory in the out-of-court settlement being negotiated in the Outhwaite case. Details of the settlement between 987 Names, who were members of Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in 1982, and 81 Lloyd's agents, including RHM Outhwaite Underwriting, will be announced this morning. The Names - the individuals whose capital supports underwriting at the insurance market - are expected to win more than Pounds 100m from the settlement which will be financed by errors and omissions insurers, who cover agents against legal awards for negligence. Errors and omissions policies, which are underwritten by Lloyd's syndicates, also usually cover legal costs. Syndicate 317/661's losses in the 1982 underwriting year amounted to more than Pounds 200m and are expected to carry on rising. Reports that a final settlement had been reached on Sunday night were dismissed as 'premature' by sources close to the Names, who said negotiations continued yesterday. Only those Names backing the legal action will benefit, which will exclude the rest of the 1,614 Names on the syndicate. High Court hearings in the action, which began in October, have heard how Mr Richard Outhwaite, the underwriter of syndicate 317/661, underwrote 32 loss-making reinsurance contracts, assuming the US liability exposures of other insurers. When claims from awards to asbestosis victims mounted in the mid-1980s, the syndicates produced disastrous results for Names. Discussions about a possible out-of-court settlement are understood to have begun about two weeks ago after an expert witness, Mr Richard Hazell, finished giving his evidence on behalf of Mr Outhwaite. Mr Justice Saville adjourned the hearings for a week on Monday last week. Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, is said to have been involved in the initial talks between the 1982 Outhwaite Names Association and the agents' errors and omissions insurers. A settlement in the case is likely to encourage other Names also involved in legal action against their agents. Four legal cases - involving Names on syndicates managed by Pulbrook, Poland and Oakeley Vaughan - are outstanding. A High Court judge yesterday issued disqualification orders against two former Lloyd's underwriters. Mr Peter Cameron-Webb and Mr Peter Dixon, formerly of the PCW Agencies, were disqualified from being involved in the management of companies for 10 years. The two were accused of 'dishonest and cynical plunder' in a DTI report published 18 months ago.</p>

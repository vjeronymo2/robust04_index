			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: UBS purchases London office UNION BANK of Switzerland has bought its London office building from Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the company jointly owned by Stanhope Properties and Rosehaugh, which recently went into receivership. In effect, the deal pays off the Pounds 200m loan made by UBS on the building. UBS will also benefit from tax losses worth tens of millions of pounds. UBS and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, its stockbroking subsidiary, occupy the 390,000 sq ft building in the Broadgate development. UBS pays an annual rent of Pounds 13m. BP3, the RSD subsidiary that owned the building, incurred a net loss of Pounds 17.8m in the year to June 30 and had net assets of Pounds 15.1m. However, the value of City office buildings has since fallen sharply; according to Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors, they have dropped 20 per cent over the past year. UBS described the deal as further evidence of its firm commitment to its operations in London. Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, said that following RSD's recent signing of a five year extension to its banking arrangements, the sale was further evidence of the stability of the group and the quality of its assets. RSD is also in talks with Credit Lyonnais about the acquisition of the building it occupies.</p>

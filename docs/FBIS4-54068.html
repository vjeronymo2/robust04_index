			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Criminal Declares Joint Declaration on </F> Denuclearisation Invalid" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- South Korean puppet  Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku, taking issue with the  North over its "nuclear issue", reportedly told the "Foreign  Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly" on  May 23 that the "North-South joint declaration on  denuclearisation has virtually become invalid".    Announcing the joint declaration on denuclearisation null  and  void, he ascribed this to the North's "nuclear issue". This is  the height of folly.    The South Korean puppet clique which has stockpiled spent  nuclear fuel containing more than 10 tons of plutonium now is  hell bent on the development of nuclear weapons, developing a  fast breeder reactor to abstract a larger amount of plutonium.  This tells that the South Korean puppet clique is entirely to  blame for reducing the joint declaration on denuclearisation to  a mere empty sheet of paper and for rendering the  denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula impossible.    The South Korean puppet clique's acceleration of the  development of its own nuclear weapons is an intolerable  anti-national, anti- peace criminal act of increasing the danger  of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.    Facts eloquently tell that the South Korean puppet clique is  a clique of nuclear fanatics who are not interested at all in  the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but desperately  stepping up their own nuclear armament under the nuclear  umbrella of the United States in a bid to ignite a nuclear war  and plunge the nation into a holocaust of nuclear war.</p>

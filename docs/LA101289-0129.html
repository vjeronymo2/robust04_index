As the  first day of a four-day session of the 242-seat House of Elders opened,  opposition leaders demanded that Gandhi respond to a Hindu newspaper report  raising questions of wrongdoing in the 1986 artillery deal with A.B. Bofors,  the Swedish arms giant. But the catcalls began as Gandhi rose to respond to the  accusations.  </P></p>

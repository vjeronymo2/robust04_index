According to the survey, a decline  in import prices was observed in 18 out of 20 surveyed items,  and 14 items were cheaper even in the consumer market. The EPA  commented: "The market trend is beginning to show the effects  of the yen rate appreciation."    The survey was conducted to compare the import and retail  prices of 20 items -- foodstuff, clothes, and durable consumer  goods -- imported in December 1993 with prices in the previous  year. The import prices were calculated from the average on  customs entry in December, and retail prices from statistics on  price trends in Tokyo in mid-January.    As a result, a decline in import prices was observed on  beef,  chocolate, and golf clubs. Although the import prices of  oranges and lemons increased due to brisk demand and cool  weather in producing nations, their retail prices in Japan  actually dropped in line with the price decline of  Japanese-grown citrus. On the other hand, automobile prices  dropped on the customs clearance basis, but became more  expensive in the consumer market. This was mainly because of  price hikes after model changes.    The average foreign exchange rate in December was 108.35 yen  to the dollar, up 12.7 percent from the previous year.</p>

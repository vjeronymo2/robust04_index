			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Pound gives chancellor new year cheer: The reasons for sterling's recent rise THE POUND'S rise this week has given Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, an unexpected new year present. It provides a more favourable background for further interest rate cuts, which may be needed to generate UK growth, and helps in the Treasury's battle against inflation. Sterling's strength may also help Mr Lamont to claim that the currency is regaining some of the confidence of international investors that was lost last September as a result of Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound closed in London last night at DM2.52 against the D-Mark, up 1 pfennig, and little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.542 after a sharp rise on Tuesday. It was also much stronger on its trade-weighted index, which measures it against a basket of currencies, and which rose from 81.2 to 81.7. The longer-term outlook for the pound is still uncertain in spite of the strong performance of recent days. It is still too early to talk about the pound shrugging off the tribulations of the past six months. Sterling enjoyed a similar rally against the D-Mark in mid December, only to fall back a few days later. The outlook for sterling's exchange rate against the dollar also looks much less favourable than its prospects against the D-Mark. Against the German currency there are predictions that sterling may rise as high as DM2.70 later this year if the Bundesbank cuts German interest rates to halt the country's slide into recess-ion. But the dollar appears well set for a strong rally against European currencies in 1993. Given the large fiscal deficit in the US, economic activity will probably be funded by large inflows into the US currency. Against that background, Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, believes the sterling/dollar rate might soon be back at Dollars 1.40. Nevertheless, the main factors behind the pound's rise in recent days look reasonably solid. Investors have bought sterling partly because of the increasing turbulence inside the European exchange rate mechanism, and the possibility that the French franc may have to be devalued. The pound's weakness since Black Wednesday was caused partly by the UK government's cuts in interest rates, which give investors a smaller return for holding the UK currency. But the prospect of a devaluation of the franc or a cut in German interest rates now makes sterling look like a temporary safe haven in Europe. 'There is a small risk of a 5 or 6 per cent devaluation of the French currency later this year,' says Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'That devaluation would undermine the higher return that investors now get for holding francs instead of pounds.' Investors have also bought sterling for other currencies because of increasing evidence that the UK economy may be recovering after its long-est recession since the 1930s. Indications of a significant rise in shop sales last month, together with a large 3 per cent year-on-year rise in the M0 money supply in December, have provided some support for theories about a modest rise in consumer spending. In industry, concrete signs of any recovery are harder to spot. Order books have remained thin in spite of the confidence-boosting measures announced by Mr Lamont in the Autumn Statement. However, many companies can reasonably expect to step up UK sales this year as the economy benefits from the 3-percentage-point cut in base rates, bringing them to 7 per cent since the pound's ERM exit. Another factor attracting investors is that Britain's economy is starting to look more robust than elsewhere in Europe, even though UK growth this year is likely to be modest. With German growth in 1993 expected to be no more than 0.5 per cent - and with Italy and France also expect to see only a weak economic expansion over the next 12 months - the increase in UK output of 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent that many economists predict for this year looks reasonably healthy.</p>

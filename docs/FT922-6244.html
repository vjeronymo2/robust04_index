			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Northern city of steel shows signs of rust: Sheffield's financial difficulties mean the council must make hefty budget savings, axe jobs and cut services Sir Robert Scholey hails from Sheffield, along with the steel industry to which he has dedicated his working life. He recently returned to the city of his birth and was saddened by what he saw. Outside the Victorian gothic town hall in Pinstone Street, the chairman of British Steel frowned at the neglected flower beds and the dribbling, dilapidated fountain. Sir Robert returned to London and wrote a letter to the Sheffield Star, reprimanding the city fathers for an evident loss of civic pride. The front page of the edition in which it appeared carried a banner headline demanding that the city's ruling Labour group 'come clean' about the financial crisis which it said the council had created. 'Empty flower beds are a tiny hint of what is to come. For years, we've accused the council of hiding from reality and now they've come horribly unstuck,' according to Mr David Heslop, leader of the council's Tory group. Outnumbered six-to-one on the Labour benches, Mr Heslop's team may have all the impact of a gnat's bite on an elephant's backside. But it is no longer alone. The city treasurer, Mr Malcolm Newman, has warned the council about living beyond its means. Councillors have also received a letter from Mr Gordon Sutton, the district auditor, referring to the threat of serious fiscal problems ahead. Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of Sheffield's chamber of commerce, says the council has chosen to ignore the warning signs for years but that the 'day of reckoning has arrived'. Mr Irvine Patnick, the only Conservative MP in Sheffield, says the authority 'is on the edge of a precipice, hanging on by one finger'. Despite an increase in the poll tax from Pounds 217 last year to Pounds 281 in 1992-93, the people of Sheffield now face a summer and autumn of announcements which will gradually expose the extent of the city's difficulties. In the short-term, the council has to find savings of about Pounds 10m in the current year's Pounds 400m budget. The city treasurer has talked of cuts reaching Pounds 50m next year. There are rumours of possible large-scale redundancies from the workforce - numbering 26,000 - of the council which is the largest local employer. The city has in the past put job protection on an equal footing with the provision of services but now Mr Mike Bower, the newly elected Labour leader, acknowledges: 'Perhaps the balance was wrong. We can no longer afford to employ people in all the jobs we need them to do.' Other possible action includes rises in council rents, cuts in education budgets and closure of old peoples' homes. The city was once the proud model of Labour local government when Mr David Blunkett, now the party's local government spokesman, was its leader. Now it stands accused of indulging in a costly binge, running down reserves and of turning creative accounting into an art form while wilfully defying the constraining influence of central government. Most recently, it was charged with gambling on a Labour central government riding to its rescue after the general election with desperately needed extra cash. Ironically, the city played host to Labour's now notorious election campaign rally which is said to have sown the seeds of Labour's defeat. Despite warnings from the party's national leadership that the city could not expect a blank cheque, the council counted on better times under a more generous regime. There were high hopes of an immediate release for use of Pounds 23m of capital receipts from council house sales and an end to any threat of capped budgets. The council's elected leaders vehemently deny the allegations against it, although they accept they face a series of painful decisions in the short-term as well as a fundamental rethink about the future. One likely result is a redefining of the council's role and a shrinkage of its traditional civic responsibilities. The significance of Sheffield's dilemma, beyond the immediate impact on its own state of health, is that many other authorities may be forced to follow as the Conservatives continue to erode local government powers. The city's problems go back at least to 1985, when the council was rate-capped and it sought to sustain its spending programmes by turning to Banque Paribas to syndicate a Pounds 90m loan that will have to be repaid into the next century. Its difficulties were compounded by the decision to seek to boost its international status by staging last summer's world student games - an event no city outside the UK wanted. The games entailed capital expenditure of nearly Pounds 150m and left in their wake, alongside some spectacular sporting facilities, an operating loss of Pounds 10.5m. The city now faces an inquiry into the losses by the district auditor. Mr Bower denies the city is on its knees but accepts that morale is low after Labour's national defeat: 'The perception is that we are barmy and waste money. The truth is that we have been fighting against unfair treatment by central government for years to provide badly needed services.' 'We cannot see any prospect of outside help and we will have to take apart, penny by penny, Pounds 700m of gross expenditure and start again.' He argues a case repeatedly made by aggrieved councils: that Sheffield's problems stem primarily from years of underfunding by a hostile Whitehall. In the past four years, he says, reductions in government grant to the city have cost it more than Pounds 120m, while comparable cities facing similar problems have done better. Mr Bower wins support for his accusation of underfunding from Mrs Pamela Gordon, the city's chief executive. She says big budget cuts look inevitable and points out that government grant per adult is 11 per cent below the national average for metropolitan districts. Sheffield, she adds, is 28th in the league of 36 districts when it comes to the allocation of government funds. The council, meanwhile, has to get on with the cost-savings. Mr Bower says he expects a significant part of council services to be maintained, while some will be scaled down and others abandoned completely. He hopes compulsory redundancies can be avoided. In spelling out possible solutions, he cites an Italian council which contracts out social services to local co-operatives and German authorities which hand over day care for children to the churches. Mr Bower says he has a stand-by plan in his back-pocket: 'If we cut the working week from 37 hours to 35, but pay people for working 36, the workforce gets two more leisure hours but only loses one hour's pay. We save Pounds 10.5m and although everyone suffers a little, nobody suffers a lot.' The idea of paying people for one hour's work which they are not expected to do does not give the Tory group many grounds for believing that Labour in Sheffield is about to change. According to Mr Heslop: 'It's typical of the crisis management in which this council has excelled. If Councillor Bower has any sense, he will keep the silly idea deep in his back pocket.'</p>

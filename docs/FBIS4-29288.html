			<p>BFN     [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 17 KYODO -- Myanmar's  [Burma] military junta is preparing "democratic foundations" for  a civilian government, sources close to a Japanese business  delegation quoted the chairman of the junta as saying Friday [17  June].    The sources said senior Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the  ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), told a  delegation from the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren) on Friday that, "though the military had to step in  for a national emergency, the military should not stay in power  for a long time."    "It is only natural that power be transferred to the  civilian  government. The SLORC is preparing democratic foundations  before power transfer so that no more military intervention  would be necessary in the future," Than Shwe was quoted by the  sources as saying.    The 46-member delegation led by Kazuo Haruna, chairman of  Marubeni Corp., arrived in Yangon on Wednesday for a four-day  mission to explore investment possibilities in Myanmar.    SLORC Secretary Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, National Planning and  Economic Development Minister Brig. Gen. David Abel and Foreign  Minister Ohn Gyaw separately briefed the delegation Thursday on  Myanmar's political, economic and foreign relations situations.    The delegation will be briefed by other ministers on various  sectors of economy in the country later in the day, and it will  visit industrial sites and a new port site near Yangon on  Saturday before returning to Tokyo the same evening.    Myanmar's military seized power in a coup in September 1988  and established the SLORC.    In May 1990 national elections the National League for  Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide  victory, but the military junta has refused to hand over power.    Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been under house  arrest in Yangon since July 1989.</p>

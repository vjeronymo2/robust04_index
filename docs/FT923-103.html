			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US courts approve GWR reorganisation GREAT Western Resources, the US-based natural resources company, appears to have won its 18-month struggle for survival with the approval by US bankruptcy courts of a reorganisation plan for the company's coal subsidiaries. GWR, which is quoted on the USM in London, put its coal subsidiaries into Chapter 11 - the US bankruptcy proceeding which protects a company from creditors - last April. The move followed a prolonged dispute over pricing and contracts with the company's largest coal customer, the South Carolina Public Services Authority (Santee Cooper). The decision to accept the reorganisation plan, which included a new coal contract with Santee Cooper and a restructuring of the company's Dollars 82m debt, will become official on October 11 if there are no appeals. Mr William Phillips, vice president and chief financial officer, said the decision was 'very good news . . . It sets the stage for getting business back to normal.' However, any benefits would not materialise in the year which ends today. The company is likely to report a substantial loss when the results are published in December. Mr Phillips said Great Western expected to deliver some 3.5m tonnes of coal over the next 12 months, compared with the 3m delivered in 1990. However, the new contract with Santee Cooper sets a coal price of about Dollars 30 a tonne, against Dollars 36 previously. The difference in price would be narrowed through production efficiencies, said Mr Phillips. The decision also frees Dollars 31m in coal payments withheld by Santee Cooper. GWR plans to pay Citibank, its main creditor, some Dollars 15m. The balance would be used for capital expenditure, and the development of oil and gas assets.</p>

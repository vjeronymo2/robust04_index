			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Threatened councils face publicity probe The Audit Commission, the local government spending watchdog, said yesterday that it was investigating complaints that county and district councils were wasting public funds on publicity campaigns for the English local government review. The cross-party Association of District Councils has said that some county councils were 'getting away with scaremongering, twisting the truth and breaking a strict code of conduct' in an attempt to enlist 'public support for self-preservation'. With the Local Government Commission's public consultation into future council structures due to end by the end of the month, divisions between councils have deepened. Legal guidelines established by the government in 1988 say that councils 'should not use public funds to mount publicity campaigns whose primary purpose is to persuade the public to hold a particular view'. Complaints to district auditors suggest, however, that the guidelines are being flouted by district councils as well. Most counties favour leaving the local government system as it is, while a majority of districts favour abolishing county councils and replacing them with new single-tier unitary authorities. Exeter city council was reported to the auditor after banners with the slogan 'Home Rule for Exeter' were placed in the city's main streets, and on an electronic notice-board. The council said that it had spent Pounds 500 on publicity - less than the county's budget - and that it was for others to decide whether the slogan was meant to persuade. Districts have objected to county information leaflets which ended with specific advice on how to reply to the commission, such as 'Vote Option Three for the Red Rose County of Lancashire'. The association made charges of excessive expenditure against several county councils: Essex county councillors earmarked Pounds 135,000 from emergency funds for public relations; Nottinghamshire county councillors were asked to add Pounds 150,000 to the existing public relations budget; West Sussex county council is paying 'more than Pounds 44,000' to commission a special edition of a local newspaper; Leicestershire spent Pounds 70,000 on printing and distributing booklets. The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils dismissed the districts' claims of 'dirty propaganda'. The commission estimates total expenditure on campaigning by councils exceeded its own publicity costs of about Pounds 2m for the year to cover 32 counties.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Italian austerity budget to overhaul pensions THE NEW Italian cabinet last night announced an emergency austerity budget, which included a long-awaited shake-up of the country's generous pensions system, increases in wealth and property taxes, cuts in public spending and a freeze on public sector employment. Mr Giuliano Amato's government, which obtained a vote of confidence from parliament a week ago and is backed by the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, has been forced into the move because of an overshoot in spending. The original 1992 budget envisaged a public sector deficit of L128,000bn (Pounds 82.62bn), but this was expected to reach L175,000bn, equivalent to almost 11 per cent of GDP. The latest measures seek to produce an extra L15,000bn in cuts and L15,000bn in revenues. The main revenues will come from special taxes on property, bank deposits and deposits in postal savings. Overall, these new wealth taxes are expected to raise L11,200bn. Further revenue will come from increases in stamp duty, the cost of passports and some licences. Property taxes will also be raised, and monitored more closely. The government stepped back from its earlier intentions of increasing income tax after strong union objections. But it increased social security contributions by 1 percentage point for the self-employed and 0.8 per cent for salaried workers. More significant was the decision to reform the pensions system. The pensionable age will be raised gradually to 65, from the current 55 years for women and 60 for men, while the minimum contributions period to qualify for pensions was raised from 15 to 20 years. Private pension funds are also to be encouraged. The cuts in spending centred on a freeze on new employment in public administration and state companies. The need for urgent action was underlined yesterday as the lira came under renewed pressure on the foreign exchange markets and the Bank of Italy was obliged to raise its short-term interest rates to more than 15 per cent.

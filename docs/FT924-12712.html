			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: One fifth of EC fishing fleet hangs in balance MORE than one fifth of the EC fishing fleet appears poised to be scrapped in order to conserve sufficient fisheries stock to sustain the industry. Community fisheries ministers yesterday decided to press for an evenly distributed reduction of the EC fleet next month, or at the latest in December. Mr David Curry, the UK fisheries minister, who was chairing the meeting, said afterwards that the 12 were broadly agreed that the fishing industry across the EC knew that measures had to be taken. 'All the illustrative figures were over 20 per cent,' he said. He pointed out that neither the extent nor the final distribution of the cuts had been agreed. Senior officials of the member states start work on the reductions today. Mr Curry said that other measures to conserve fishing stocks would also be examined. Nevertheless, the level of vessel scrapping under discussion is less than the original proposal of 40 per cent put forward in December 1990 by Mr Manuel Marin, EC fisheries commissioner.</p>

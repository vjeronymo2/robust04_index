			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Preacher Pat hopes to work a miracle at UPI JOURNALISTS did not know whether to laugh, cry, or welcome the apparent rescue of a venerable institution. 'It's unfair, he'll get his scoops from God,' they said; or: 'We can't compete with a hotline to Heaven.' The news, from a bankruptcy auction in Rutland, Vermont, late on Tuesday, was that a television evangelist had made a cash bid for United Press International. The Rev Marion G. Robertson is universally known on earth - and perhaps upstairs - as Pat. He put in the only complete bid for UPI, the 85-year-old news agency that has been on its last legs for more than a decade. UPI prided itself on being first with the news of President Kennedy's assassination and won nine hallowed Pulitzer prizes for its news coverage. Pat Robertson is undoubtedly the best known televangelist not now in jail for fraud or otherwise under a cloud for sexual misdemeanours. More than that, he ran for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago on an extremely conservative platform and spent more than Dollars 20m to carry five states in the primaries. Yesterday, he first said he had no intention of turning UPI into a religious wire service or otherwise to change its traditional editorial content. Then he appeared on his 700 Club flagship programme and pronounced that buying UPI might be 'a little opportunity' for God to touch the media 'with his truth and love'. Mr Robertson used to claim he communicated directly with the Almighty fairly frequently. This assertion may disturb UPI's biggest remaining client, the definitely non-Christian Kyodo news agency of Japan. It has said it would tear up its annually renewable contract if what it got took on a proselytising tone. Until Tuesday night, Mr Robertson had not entered the public's political consciousness much since 1988. But he has not exactly been idle in the past four years, as his contingent all-cash Dollars 6m bid for UPI demonstrates. The condition is that he has 30 days to look at UPI's books, after which he may lower or withdraw his offer. Mr Robertson's vehicle for the offer is US Media, formed a year ago as the for-profit offshoot of his tax-exempt Christian Broadcasting Network. He runs a sophisticated corporate network. Another arm is International Family Entertainments, which runs the cable Family Channel and went public last month. The offering valued the stock held by Mr Robertson and his son at dollars 90m, constituting a positively unholy return on an initial investment of dollars 183,000. UPI has gone in the other direction and is a shadow of its former self. In the 1980s, it went through several hands and twice filed for bankruptcy. Even divine intervention, however, may not be enough to keep UPI afloat for much longer.</p>

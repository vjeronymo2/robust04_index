			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Feng Lanrui (7458 5695 3843) of the Marxism-Leninism </F> Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences:  "The Market Economy Needs a Labor Market"]    [Text] The goal of the current reform is to build the  socialist market economic structure. To build a market economic  structure, a labor market is indispensable. It is a great  breakthrough that the decision of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th Central Committee set out the issue of a labor market.  However, it does not mean that all issues concerning the labor  market are solved. I should like to air my views on several  issues that I have come across.  <H3>  A Complete, Perfect Market Structure Is the Condition for  the Building and Normal Operation of the Market Economy </H3>   It has been 15 years since we conducted reform in the  economic structure. In 1984 we set out the need to develop the  commodity economy on the basis of public ownership. In 1992 we  set out the building of the socialist market economy as the goal  of China's reform of the economic structure. Both the planned  commodity economy and the socialist market economy calls for a  complete and perfect market system. Without a complete, perfect  market structure, the development of the commodity economy or  the market economy would be out of the question.    Today, China's market system remains incomplete and  imperfect. The product market is comparatively mature, and the  goods and equipment market is gradually opening up. However,  the money and labor market have not yet taken shape. Over the  past two years or so the money market has begun to bud, with  exchange and securities companies founded. However, because of  the lack of legislation and macroeconomic regulation and  control, confusion surfaced in banking. The grave stagnation of  the labor market has already become a bottleneck and a hurdle to  completing and perfecting the market system and promoting the  building of the socialist market economic structure.  <H5>  Deepening Reform Calls For a Labor Market </H5>   Presently, the hot spot in deepening reform is to implement  the modern enterprise system, convert the operational mechanism  of state-owned enterprises, streamline government organizations,  and to readjust the industrial setup. All these are directly  related to the labor market.    1. The modern enterprise system is the direction of reform  of state-owned enterprises. Under the modern enterprise system,  the enterprise property right relations are transparent, and  with all its properties as a legal person, the enterprise  operates on its own, and assumes sole responsibility for its  profits and losses. This precisely calls for enterprises to  organize production and operation based on market demand, and  improve labor productivity and economic returns. That being the  case, the enterprise must use personnel according to the needs  of its own production and operation, and surplus personnel must  be dispensed with. Enterprises suffering deficits over a long  period must go bankrupt according to the law, and employment  arrangements must be made for the workers of bankrupt  enterprises. Under such circumstances, the labor market will  play the role of a "reservoir," which will supply manpower  resources when enterprises have such a demand, and when there  are surplus hands in the enterprise, they can be put on the  labor market to seek new jobs.    When an enterprise converts its operational mechanism, it  will experience autonomy in 14 aspects, of which autonomy in  personnel and labor employment are closely connected with the  labor market. When an enterprise has autonomy in matters  concerning labor and personnel, it will hire help and employ  cadres on its own, and dismiss workers or cadres when it is  overstaffed. Without a labor market, where would the enterprise  hire the help it needs? If it continues to ask labor  departments for workers, would it not be returning to the way of  administrative allocation? Without a labor market, where would  the enterprise's surplus workers go when they are let go?  Should overstaffed personnel stay on at their posts, when the  enterprise should continue to carry the burden of some 20-30  percent of overstaffed personnel, how could it improve its labor  productivity and economic returns?    2. Streamlining government organizations is an important  step in the reform of the political structure. The NPC  [National People's Congress] has already made a decision that  personnel should be reduced in implementing the civil service  system, whereas institutions must also reduce their personnel  while improving efficiency. It will be impossible to rely on  internal absorption of all workers thus let go, so it is  imperative to reorganize employment through the labor market.  Without a labor market, the government reform in streamlining  organizations would also be difficult.    3. The adjustment of industrial setup is closely connected  with the labor market. Some state-owned enterprises continue  their production even when their products are unmarketable and  overstocked. Whereas some products the market demands are in  short supply; for example, the raw materials industry. To  readjust this irrational arrangement, the greatest difficulty  lies in the arrangements for workers. The approach is to allow  the flow of workers from production departments that need be  readjusted to those departments that need to be developed  through the labor market. Without a labor market, the flow of  labor force and readjustment in the employment structure would  be out of the question, and it would be impossible to reallocate  the fixed assets and circulation funds employed for this segment  of workers. To readjust the employment structure and promote  readjustment of the industrial setup, it is necessary to develop  a unified national labor market with control.    The aforesaid shows that the labor market is the need of  socialist economic development as well as in-depth reform, and  is independent of people's subjective will.  <H3>  The Inevitability of Labor Turning Into a Commodity Under  the Socialist Condition </H3>   The theory of labor being commodity is a prerequisite set  out  by the labor market. The labor market is the sum of the trading  relations of labor. If labor is not commodity, where does the  labor market come in? This truth is very simple and clear.    However, some of our comrades do not think so. They are  afraid that, should they acknowledge that labor is commodity,  they would negate workers' status as masters under socialist  conditions, thus obliterating the difference between capitalism  and socialism. Those comrades fail to see that there is  objective inevitability for labor to become commodity under the  socialist condition.    One of the characteristics of the socialist market economy  is  that all essentials must be allocated by the market, and will  enter the production process only through market exchange.  There is no exception to labor; otherwise, the normal operation  of the socialist market economy would be out of the question.  That is one side of the issue. From the worker's angle,  proceeding from the individual's interest to obtain greater  income, he would sell his labor on the market, thus labor is  converted into a commodity.    Then, would it be as traditional theory put it that the  worker had to sell his labor because he was divorced from  production materials, and "had absolutely nothing to his name"?  But historical facts are nothing like that. It was not because  the worker had lost his production materials that determined the  sale of his labor. In a slave society, the laborer and  production materials were separated; nevertheless, the slave did  not enjoy personal freedom, and independence in personality.  His very body and labor belonged to the slave owner, and it was  entirely impossible for him to sell his labor as a commodity,  but he could be sold along with his labor by his owner. Under  the feudal system, the laborer (serf or peasant) might own a  small plot of land, but he could not get rid of his personal  attachment to the feudal landlord, nor could they enjoy complete  personal freedom, and independence in personality. It was also  impossible for the worker to sell his own labor as a commodity.  That being the case, in feudal society the inevitability of the  conversion of labor to commodity did not exist.    The capitalist system is a developed market economy, and its  operation is possible only when there is a complete and perfect  market system, and calls for a mature labor market, with labor  being a commodity. That is on the one hand. On the other hand,  the reason the worker is now able to sell his own labor, and  labor can be turned into a commodity, is that the worker has now  gotten rid of the relationship of personal attachment, and  enjoys his personal freedom and independence in personality.  The worker is now the owner of his own labor, and is able to  freely dispose of his own labor.    Facts have shown that if the worker does not enjoy personal  freedom and independence in personality, even if he and  production materials are separated, and "has absolutely nothing  to his name," it is impossible for him to sell his own labor as  a commodity. Under different conditions, the laborer is not in  the category of "having absolutely nothing to his name," but  possesses some land and production tools; to pursue greater  income, he will go out to sell his labor. In developed Western  countries, many peasants farm on their land, while serving as  workers at the same time. Quite a few of them are employed in  industrial and commercial enterprises in cities and towns,  making use of their leisure (weekends and after work) or with  their dependents pursuing agricultural production at home, thus  becoming the so-called people holding concurrent posts. There is  a world of difference between such condition and that of the  early stage of the capitalist society when the peasants and  craftsmen were forced to enter factories to work after they had  gone bankrupt.    Labor turning into commodity in contemporary China is the  objective demand of socialist market economic development.  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee  toward the end of 1978, earth-shaking changes have taken place  in China's economic life. In a nutshell, China's economy has  changed from the former basically unitary socialist public  ownership to a socialist economy characterized by the dominant  public ownership with the coexistence of multiple economic  factors, and from the past noncommodity economy to the socialist  commodity economy. Like all developed commodity economies, in  the course of transiting toward the market economy, the pressing  demand for turning labor into a commodity has already been set  out objectively in present-day China.    If we put it that private ownership of labor by the worker  creates a realistic possibility for labor to turn into a  commodity, then it follows that the development of China's  commodity economy or the market economy possesses the realistic  possibility for labor to change into a commodity. We might as  well conclude that this is the inevitable trend of socialist  market economic development.    China's practice has evidenced the fact that the conversion  of labor to a commodity is determined by the demand of the  social productive forces in China. Labor is the most active and  dynamic factor in productive forces, which will become very  active as soon as they get rid of all sorts of personal bondage.  When the development of the market economy increases demand for  labor and raises the prices for labor, workers who pursues  maximum individual income will increasingly enter the labor  market from the relatively backward areas, countryside, and  small towns to developed regions to work or do business. There,  their income is higher than those who are engaged in farming  exclusively, and they have learned production skills and  accumulated production and operational experiences as well as  information and means in becoming rich. At the same time, they  have accumulated funds and would return to their home village to  develop production. They would become rich themselves, and  bring along the whole village to become well-to-do, thus  promoting relatively backward areas to develop the productive  force. Such a condition has often taken place in China in  recent years.  <H3>  Labor Tuning Into a Commodity Does No Harm to Workers'  Status as Masters </H3>   As mentioned above, the conversion of labor to a commodity  is  not determined by the separation of the worker and production  materials, but the need of the socialist economic development as  well as the worker's comparative interest. Under the condition  of the worker possessing production materials, labor can be  converted to a commodity, too. Under socialist conditions, the  worker is the master of production materials of public ownership  on the one hand; on the other, he is the one who sells his  labor. Such double status is acceptable.    Under socialist condition, production materials are owned by  the workers in entirety, but not by any individual worker, who  as an individual is just one of the owners production materials  of public ownership, and does not equate the entirety of  workers, the union of all workers. That being the case, when  every single worker sells his labor as a commodity to the state  or enterprise that represents the entirety of workers, it does  not mean that he is selling his labor to himself. If we put it  that they have become employees on the grounds that they have  sold their labor, it does not mean that they have become  employees to their selves, but that they have become the  employees of the state or enterprise that represents the  entirety of workers. This being the case, the worker is one who  shares production materials in their ownership, hence his status  as one of the masters of the state or enterprise or one of the  owners. At the same time, the employees are the ones who sell  their labor to his own enterprise and state. That is not  contradictory.    One idea believes that "reform the labor system, while  gradually shaping a labor market" aims only at nonstate-owned  enterprises. As to state-owned enterprises, its workers are the  masters, and the issue of a labor market does not exist. This  is a great misunderstanding. The labor market referred to in  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee decision  is a unified labor market that includes economic factors of all  sorts and categories across China. Especially in the  state-owned economy, it is imperative for them to allocate  manpower rationally from now on, genuinely implement  two-direction selection, encourage the rational flow of  personnel, and implement the best combination of labor and  production materials. As to the nonstate-owned economy  developed in recent decades, they have been the main body in the  labor market from the very start, and have hired their employees  through the market. The commodity quality of labor in the  nonstate-owned economy is beyond doubt. Now it is time to  change concept, have a clear picture that labor is commodity,  and that it is state-owned enterprises that must change  administrative to market allocation.    Another concept is that, should labor be a commodity, would  it not be regarding workers themselves as commodities? We  should know that the worker and labor are two different but  interrelated concepts. The worker may sell his labor as a  commodity, or may consume it himself, or let it lay idle. When  a worker sells his labor, his labor becomes commodity. What the  worker sells is his labor, not himself. This being the case, it  is clear that workers will not become commodities.</p>

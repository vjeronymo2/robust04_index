			<p>BFN     [Text] Today at Cotroceni Palace, Romanian President Ion  Iliescu received the representatives of the parliamentary  delegation of the Republic of Moldova currently in Bucharest to  attend the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black  Sea Economic Cooperation Zone countries.    The delegation is headed by Mr. Petru Lucinschi, the speaker  of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, who, following the  meeting with President Iliescu, made the following exclusive  statement to our reporters:    [Begin Lucinschi recording] First I would like to say that  in my assessment we both confirmed that the relations between  our countries are quite intense [relatii destul de intense], and  they are developing in every way, although we cannot say that we  are satisfied, we wish for more, we think that the efficiency of  our relations could be even higher and better. But, currently,  both our countries are in transition, in a crisis situation.    Our talks concentrated on the concrete aspects of the  relations between our countries. Thus, we discussed economic  issues. For instance, the fact that the current emotional state  and the spiritual problems -- the consequences of which may be  seen in the spiritual life -- also appear in the press and in  public opinion. However, little is being done to support the  furthering of relations among persons, localities, and  industrial or economic enterprises, by which one could solve the  majority of the problems currently facing our peoples.    Today we have to be realistic -- and this term was recurrent  during our talks -- because if we disregard the real situation  we will again end up beating the air, causing either confusion  or revolt among the people. Thus, the current real situation  makes it necessary for us to back all those who wish to  undertake concrete things to better our relations at all levels.    This was, in my opinion, the leitmotif of our talks today,  and we agreed to accomplish some of the things we had previously  convened.    As far as state relations are concerned, indeed, sometimes  we  have neglected them, we had an electoral campaign, and you may  have also been busy with other things, so there are such  intervals that are not very intense, which is normal. However,  as far as relations among persons are concerned, they are  relations as among relatives, which is also normal. Besides all  this, we have the relations between the businessmen, and here we  have to establish a better social-economic framework for our  future cooperation. [end recording]</p>

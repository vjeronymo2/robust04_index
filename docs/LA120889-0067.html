			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NO. 3 HOYAS OVERPOWER NO. 17 TAR HEELS  </P> <P> Does this sound like a coach's dream?  </P> <P> Dean Smith: "It's a big joke . . . our schedule already was too tough."  </P> <P> John Thompson: "I'm not for it and I've said it all along."  </P> <P> What North Carolina Coach Smith and Georgetown Coach Thompson were talking  about was their matchup Thursday night in the inaugural ACC-Big East Challenge,  an eight-game matchup of two of the toughest conferences in the country, which  wound up at four victories apiece.  </P> <P> Mark Tillmon scored 27 points to lead the No. 3 to victory over the No. 17 Tar  Heels, 93-81, in the final game of the tournament at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> It was the first meeting between the team's since the Tar Heels beat  Georgetown, 63-62, on Michael Jordan's jumper in the 1982 NCAA championship  game at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Georgetown (4-0) held a comfortable lead throughout the second half, and North  Carolina (4-3) never got closer than five points in the final five minutes.  Alonzo Mourning scored 18 points for Georgetown. Scott Williams had 19 for  North Carolina.  </P> <P> Virginia 73, Villanova 65 -- John Crotty scored 25 points and Virginia (5-1)  beat Villanova at East Rutherford.  </P> <P> Virginia grabbed the lead for good at 62-60 with 5:45 to play on a three-point  shot by Crotty.  </P> <P> Virginia's last field goal, a rebound follow by Bryant Stith, gave the  Cavaliers a 64-60 lead with 4:34 left. Greg Woodard hit a long jump shot for  Villanova (4-3) 22 seconds later, but Cavaliers made nine of 12 free throws to  preserve the victory.  </P> <P> No. 19 North Carolina St. 126, Duquesne 77 -- Chris Corchiani and Brian Howard  scored six points each in a 22-0 first-half run that powered North Carolina  State to victory at Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> Rodney Monroe scored 22 points as North Carolina State placed six players in  double figures.  </P> <P> Iowa 89, Iowa State 87 -- Ray Thompson, who lost his starting job after being  arrested last week, scored 20 of his 32 points in the second half to rally  unbeaten Iowa at Ames.  </P> <P> Thompson, arrested last Friday for public intoxication and two other charges,  was suspended for one game and has been been a reserve since. He played 29  minutes against Iowa State and hit 14 of 21 shots.  </P> <P> Iowa, which trailed by 17 points early in the second half, withstood a 36-point  effort by Iowa State's Terry Woods.  </P> <P> Arizona State 70, USF 67 Matt Anderson's fast-break layup with six seconds left  in the second overtime lifted the Sun Devils (1-3) to victory at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Anderson's layup followed a steal by Emilio Kovacic, a Yugoslav newcomer who  had shot an air ball on a free throw attempt with 32 seconds left.  </P></p>

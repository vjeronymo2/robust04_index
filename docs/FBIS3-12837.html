			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian  delegation to the peace talks, has stressed the need for the  issue of settlements to top the agenda of any  Palestinian-Israeli talks in the future. In a statement to our  radio, he pointed out that failing to include the question of  settlements in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks will make  these talks pointless. He noted that the Palestinian side had  called for the need to discuss the question of settlements  before the Oslo agreement was signed to ensure protection for  the Palestinians.    Dr. 'Urayqat added that the Palestinian people want peace  more than any other party. He expressed fears for the possible  recurrence of the Israeli massacres against citizens in the  occupied Arab territories. He emphasized the need for  international protection to ensure that such incidents may not  recur in the future.</p>

The billing says these programmes 'bring together disputing parties, whether individuals or groups', but in the first two episodes, at any rate, race is a factor. Today a Muslim resident of Leicester confronts a prostitute who works on the street outside his house (8.00pm). BBC2's series on technology, White Heat, which began well last week, moves on to the question of technological change: does it occur to supply a need, or do innovations create their own demand? Until somebody created a disposable nappy, nobody needed one. Fiction writers 'invented' death rays, and then along came the laser which can shoot down aircraft, restore sight and read bar codes - yet it was not invented to do any of those (8.00pm). BBC2 considers OJ Mania: The Media Trial Of OJ Simpson (11.15pm). Millions of Americans watched the scenes live on television when Simpson set off up the highway and was pursued by a phalanx of police cars. Some now doubt whether Simpson can ever get a fair trial.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Danish stimulus THE violence in Copenhagen perpetrated by a minority of demonstrators has sounded a discordant note amid the general relief prompted by Tuesday's Maastricht referendum result. However, the Yes vote has given the Social Democrat-led coalition an opportunity to bring in a modest stimulus programme for the hard-pressed Danish economy. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister since January, is the current president of the EC council. His personal success in securing a Yes, though based on treaty opt-outs negotiated by the previous government, makes Mr Rasmussen one of the few EC leaders entitled to walk with a spring in his step. He intends to capitalise on this victory by using next month's EC's summit in Copenhagen as a platform to launch Community-wide measures to combat the European recession. Accounting for just 2 per cent of EC GDP, Denmark has limited room to act alone. Furthermore, the tax cuts and accelerated public sector investment announced on Wednesday may not be large enough to boost GDP expansion from 1 per cent this year to 3 per cent in 1994, as the government hopes. But by seizing the opportunity to push for non-inflationary growth, Mr Rasmussen is setting a good example. With unemployment now 12 per cent after six years in the doldrums, there is no doubt that Denmark needs higher growth. There is also no doubt that the economy is capable of delivering it. Denmark has curbed its spending habits of the early 1980s. It boasts an inflation rate of 1 per cent and a current account surplus. Ironically for a country which wants to steer clear of the plan for a single currency, Denmark is one of the few EC states close to fulfilling the Maastricht targets set down to guide the path to economic and monetary union. Foreign exchange market doubts about Denmark's ability to stay in the ERM 'hard core' have forced the Danish National Bank to maintain high interest rates during the past 12 months. Uncertainties will remain unless Denmark provides evidence it can shake off the damage to competitiveness caused by the European devaluations since last autumn. In view of its Emu opt-out, Denmark has to work doubly hard to convince the markets that it is serious about monetary stability. However, the gap between short-term German and Danish interest rates, in April as much as 5 percentage points, has now fallen to less than 1 point. Following this week's 1 point cut in the discount rate, there is now room for the National Bank to reduce rates further. By holding down wage rises and putting up with high unemployment, the Danes have made big sacrifices. Assuming the recession in the larger EC economies  -above all Germany - does not worsen, Mr Rasmussen now has a chance to show that rigorous economic management can bring its own reward.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 3 (AFP) -- Three out of 11 French aid  workers held by the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo risk the death  penalty or jail terms of up to 20 years, a spokesman for the  relief agency Premiere Urgence (First Aid) said on Tuesday. The  11 members of Premiere Urgence were imprisoned in a Serb  barracks at Lukavica, a suburb of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo,  on April 8 after their aid convoy was intercepted and on Monday,  three of them were indicted for transporting arms to the Bosnian  Moslems.    Spokesman Pascale de Lomas said judicial investigation of  the  case against the three would likely end on May 8 and their trial  would follow immediately. The eight others would be freed. The  parents of the only woman in the group, Patricia Ettouati, said  the 11 were being held in the same room and were in good health,  but had lost weight because of "foul food".    The Bosnian Serbs first proposed swapping the aid workers  for  11 Serb doctors and nurses held in Sarajevo by the Moslems.    Premiere Urgence, which has been active in Bosnia  transporting food parcels to Sarajevo with the agreement of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will send lawyers  and observers from Amnesty International and the International  Federation of Human Rights to the trial, to be staged in the  Bosnian Serb capital of Pale.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has called the arrest of  the 11 "hostage-taking" and demanded their "immediate and  unconditional" release.</p>

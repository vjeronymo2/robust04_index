			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bridgestone tumbles 21.4% at midway BRIDGESTONE, Japan's leading tyre maker, blamed a 21.4 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits to Y28.9bn (Dollars 231.2m) on weak demand from the domestic car and construction indus-tries. Sales for the six months to the end of June fell 2 per cent to Y342.9bn, while sales within Japan slipped 1 per cent to Y252.3bn, with demand for passenger car tyres steady but that for trucks and buses declining. The company is confident of an upturn in the Japanese economy in the second half, and sales for the year are expected to be Y740bn, up from Y736.5bn, and pre-tax profits are forecast at Y70bn, down 8.7 per cent. Bridgestone said improvement in the fortunes of Firestone, the US tyre maker acquired four years ago, and an expected recovery in the international economy would lead to net consolidated profits of Y25bn, compared with Y7.4bn in 1991. However, consolidated sales are forecast to rise only slightly to Y1,770bn, from Y1,763bn, and the improvement will come from the reconstruction of Firestone, which has been a considerable burden for the Japanese company.</p>

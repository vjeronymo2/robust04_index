			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The government's Tax  Commission stressed again Wednesday [2 February] that an income  tax cut to stimulate the economy must be linked by law to a  consumption tax hike.    Commission chief Kan Kato told reporters that "almost 90  percent" of the advisory tax panel members reaffirmed at an  afternoon meeting that the timing and rate of a consumption tax  increase must be spelled out in the same tax reform law that  cuts income tax. Kato also rejected proposals to decouple the  two measures but issue a government statement that the  consumption tax would be raised later to pay for the tax cut.    Asked about the reported plan, Kato said, "I think we would  not be able to accept it."    He repeatedly stressed that the two issues must be dealt  with  explicitly to elicit the support of the people and said a vague  handling of the matter would be "hiding" something from the  people. The result would be "uncertainty and unease" among the  public, which could damage the economy, Kato said.    The issue of linking the income tax cut and an increase in  the consumption tax rate has torn at the governing coalition,  which must settle the matter to fashion the economic stimulus  package that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has promised to  announce Thursday. The largest coalition member, the Social  Democratic Party, opposes raising the 3 percent consumption tax,  while the Finance Ministry insists that the two must be linked  by law.    Kato, a Keio University professor, noted that Hosokawa has  vowed to respect the commission's recommendations on the tax  issue and said he trusts the prime minister will do so. He said  it is mistaken to think that raising the consumption tax would  hurt the economy.    Simulations show that consumption picks up on "last-minute  demand" as implementation of the tax hike approaches and that  even if it declines temporarily after the hike, consumption  recovers within a half year, he said. Public support for the  consumption tax has increased since it was introduced five years  ago and the need for structural reform must be explained clearly  to the public, Kato said.    The current prolonged recession is structural, not cyclical,  and this would be a good time for structural reform, including  revamping the tax system, he said.    Kato said the panel would probably meet again Friday and  Monday but that it has largely determined the "direction" of its  final fiscal 1994 tax reform report, which is to be issued  Tuesday.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Stock prospectors wary of oil - Bottom Line Stock market investors keen to have a flutter on the oil price usually look beyond the big, integrated oil majors such as British Petroleum and Shell to smaller exploration and production stocks. This week one of the largest companies in the sector, Lasmo, announced a deeply discounted Pounds 219m rights issue to shore up a balance sheet ravaged by a Pounds 794m debt. Management said strong operating cash flows have been undermined by the steep fall in oil prices over the past year, to current average levels Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. Price weakness called into question the company's ability to carry out its ambitious plans to cut its high-cost production base by developing low-cost oil and gas reserves. Analysts have long considered Lasmo the company in the exploration / production sector most vulnerable to weak oil prices. Its agony as oil prices plumeted over the past year has been marked by a trail of casualties: in early 1993 it dropped Chris Greentree as chief executive in favour of Joe Darby. Changes have also been made to its finance director and non-executive chairman. In addition its shares were among the worst performers in 1993 and it passed its final dividend last month. Investors may therefore be wondering whether Lasmo's plight is unique, or a sign that similar troubles might spread to other companies in the sector. After all, as the chart shows, the performance of the exploration and production sector has been relatively resilient in recent months in spite of oil prices falling to five-year lows. Furthermore, asset values in the sector do not fully reflect oil prices at recent lows. Analysts have mixed views on the sector, but most agree that Lasmo's case is unique in at least one crucial sense; its investment cycle and therefore its debt load is seriously out of synch with the oil price. The company is entering a two-year period of large-scale development commitments for schemes such as Liverpool Bay, a big natural gas project which will generate significant cash after 1996. It already had financing for Liverpool Bay and other projects, but at current prices Lasmo's high-cost production profile makes the company unprofitable. Analysts say a successful rights issue will give Lasmo the breathing space it needs over the next two years. Other exploration companies have also seen their cash flow suffer because of weak oil prices. But most, including Enterprise, the biggest independent explorer, find themselves at more comfortable points in the capital investment cycle. Does the sector deserve its relatively high valuation given the continuing uncertainty over oil price? Brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull think not. In a recount report they argue that investors are perpetually over-optimistic about oil price trends: 'Equity investors . . . have been only too keen to pay over the odds in order to acquire oil and gas reserves via the stock market at prices which the oil and gas industry itself has not been prepared to pay.' The brokers add that the 'anomaly between stockmarket versus industry reserve valuation obviously creates good opportunities for energy companies to raise finance in the equity markets.' Other analysts disagree. They point to recent asset sales in the North Sea which valued reserves at Dollars 15-Dollars 17 a barrel, proof they say, that the industry believes current prices are not a realistic long-term prospect. But for private investors the attractiveness of a flutter on the sector still rests on whether they think the oil price will increase, and whether they feel lucky.</p>

Over 60 people were killed in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the  horrible massacre that was carried out by settlers and covered  by the Israeli Army. Hundreds were left wounded. In the  occupied territories, 19 people were killed as of yesterday at  the hands of the Israeli Army. Many were also wounded.    As for the Juniyah church massacre, Israel deliberately  carried out this attack to distract attention away from the  horrible Friday massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque.    In the face of the world's strong condemnation and rising  calls for the protection of the Arab citizens in the occupied  territories, Israel, as usual, has created a fog of falsehood.  Its officials expressed regret and some of them alleged  sorrow. Shim'on Peres went as far as saying that the settlers  are a catastrophe for Israel, knowing that Shamir's former  government and Rabin's current government gave priority to  settlement activities.    Rabin himself saw to it that the settlers were armed and  given all means of support and, only recently, his agriculture  minister expanded a settlement in the Golan Heights. Both  Shamir and Rabin blocked the peace talks in Washington and two  years later, Israel has not yet pledged to withdraw from the  occupied territories.    Rabin's main objective in singing the Oslo Agreement, and  then holding negotiations to interpret it, was to maintain the  settlements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as arsenals, a sword  hanging over the heads of the Palestinians.    Consequently, the alleged sorrow expressed by Israeli  officials is a cheap attempt at deception. The return of  stability, calm, and tranquility to the Middle East hinges on  Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the  dismantling all forms of occupation, the end of all settlement  activities, and the building of a just and comprehensive peace  that protects everyone's rights. Israel has, thus far, rejected  withdrawal, refused to halt settlement activities, and rejected  just and comprehensive peace.    Even after the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which shocked  and disgusted the world, Israeli terrorism continued to claim  more innocent lives. The Palestinian people were punished and  subjected to military siege and curfews, and the Lebanese  people, who denounced the massacre, were punished by an Israeli  bomb in Juniyah church. Meanwhile, the Zionist settlers, who  committed the slaughter in cold blood, are moving around freely  and celebrating the crime. The measures, which Rabin claims to  have taken against the fanatical settlers, are aimed at throwing  dust in the eyes of the world.    For over 40 years, Israel has been uprooting the Palestinian  people from their land and property through force, terrorism,  and massacres. The Friday massacre is not unusual in this  Israeli trend. It is a continuation of the series of crimes,  such as those in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, and al-Samu',  and is aimed at terrorizing the Palestinian and forcing them to  leave their land.    Thus, talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist  escalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the  occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of  time. It is, indeed, absurd. For over two years, the Arab  delegations have failed to prompt Israel to even pledge to  withdraw from the occupied territories.    Friday's massacre and the ensuing events threaten that the  situation in the region will deteriorate unless the world  community takes resolute and effective moves to protect the  Palestinian people, first and foremost. They must also stress  that the Middle East peace hinges on Israel's full withdrawal  from the occupied territories and its removal of the settlers,  and that these issues cannot be delayed or postponed. The  Western powers, who have provided all kinds of military and  economic aid to Israel, are responsible for checking the rampage  of the Israeli beast. There is no purpose or meaning in holding  any peace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment  to implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw  from the occupied Arab territories.</p>

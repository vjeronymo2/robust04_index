			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME INC. STRIKES BACK;  </P> <P> TIME'S STRATEGY SHOWCASES WASSERSTEIN PERELLA &amp; CO. AS SUPERSTAR IN MERGER  BATTLES  </P> <P> Time Inc.'s decision to merge with Warner Communications, while rejecting a  hostile offer from Paramount Communications, is bound to irk Time shareholders  who wanted to accept Paramount's lucrative stock offer.  </P> <P> But to Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., one of two investment banking firms that  helped devise Time's complex takeover and defense strategy, such controversy  has become part of the territory.  </P> <P> In just the year and a half since it was formed, the small New York-based firm  has become a mergers and acquisitions powerhouse, having a hand in many of the  biggest and most controversial takeovers of the day.  </P> <P> All told, its $36 billion in deals completed last year propelled it virtually  overnight into the sixth-largest mergers and acquisition adviser, ahead of such  giants as Salomon Bros. and Merrill Lynch. If some of its pending deals, such  as Time-Warner, are completed this year, the firm could challenge Morgan  Stanley for the top spot later this year, according to IDD Information  Services, which ranks investment houses.  </P> <P> In the process, Wasserstein Perella has come to wield tremendous influence in  the executive suites and board rooms of America's corporate elite, boasting 20%  of the nation's 300 largest corporations as ongoing clients. It's amassed a  $1-billion war chest that can be used to finance leveraged buyouts or buy  equity positions in firms involved in deals.  </P> <P> And its partnership with giant Nomura Securities of Japan, which owns 20% of  Wasserstein Perella, gives it an entree into the fast-growing investment  banking business in Asia, part of its goal to be a worldwide force in mergers  and acquisitions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm Has Its Critics  </P> <P> "They've done a damn good job and have carved out a good niche," says Perrin  Long, industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services.  </P> <P> But the firm's rise has not come without its criticisms. As in the case of  Time, some critics say Wasserstein Perella's staunch loyalty to defend its  management clients against hostile takeovers has come at the expense of those  firms' shareholders.  </P> <P> Critics also have questioned the firm's judgment. A Delaware judge criticized  the firm last November for a "conflict of interest" in backing a financial  restructuring of Interco, a large furniture and shoe manufacturer, over a  hostile takeover bid by the Rales brothers of Washington. Wasserstein Perella  stood to receive higher fees if the restructuring succeeded, the judge argued.  </P> <P> And although the firm professes to be as busy as ever, some Wall Street experts  say it has grown too fast, increasing its vulnerability to layoffs or other  troubles when merger activity subsides and the economy falls into recession.  </P> <P> Such criticisms are not surprising, given the wide reach and high profile of  the firm and its co-founders, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella. The two  arguably were Wall Street's most respected merger and acquisitions advisers  when they left the investment banking house of First Boston in February, 1988,  after a disagreement with management over the firm's direction.  </P> <P> Wasserstein in particular was regarded as a creative genius, having devised  many innovative takeover strategies while co-head of mergers and acquisitions  at First Boston along with Perella. Their work was credited with propelling  First Boston into the elite among investment bankers, and their departure to  form a "boutique" investment house was seen as part of a new era where  high-paid superstars no longer wanted to be constricted by the large  bureaucracies and demands of full-service firms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Major Deals  </P> <P> Since leaving to form Wasserstein Perella, the duo have amassed an impressive  list of deals. The firm advised Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in its record  $25-billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, and Philip Morris in its  $12-billion takeover of Kraft.  </P> <P> Pending deals, besides Time-Warner, include advising LIN Broadcasting in its  $6.5-billion acquisition by McCaw Cellular, and advising Beecham Group in its  $7.8-billion bid for SmithKline Beckman.  </P> <P> "At the moment, we're stretched as thin as can be," said Mack Rossoff, a  Wasserstein Perella managing director.  </P> <P> To augment its deals, the firm also takes ownership positions in clients. For  example, it owns 50% of Santa Monica-based Wickes Cos.  </P> <P> The firm also performs ongoing advisory work for dozens of clients not involved  in pending deals, helping them devise growth strategies or making them more  resistant to possible hostile takeovers. Such clients include Alaska Airlines,  Walt Disney Co. and Henley Group.  </P> <P> Many of these clients, including Time, followed Wasserstein and Perella from  First Boston. But the firm attracts and keeps them by hiring superstars.  </P> <P> "We've tried to create an M&amp;A all-star team at the senior level and build  around it," says Jon D. Kutler, head of Wasserstein Perella's Los Angeles  office, one of six worldwide.  </P> <P> The firm's now employs about 100 professionals, close in size to the mergers  and acquisitions departments of major full-service firms, Kutler says.  </P> <P> The firm also keeps clients by focusing on advisory work, avoiding  underwriting, trading and other activities, he says. The firm also keeps  clients by stressing takeover-defense work, generally avoiding working for  corporate raiders.  </P> <P> This defense orientation is key in the case of Time, which is also using  Shearson Lehman Hutton as a co-adviser.  </P></p>

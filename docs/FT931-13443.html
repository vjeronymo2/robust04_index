			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GPA restructure sees debt halving in 3 years GPA's debt restructuring proposals, which were sent to its 130 banks yesterday, envisage that its Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn) debt will be cut by half over the next three years. The ambitious target is dependent on the Irish aircraft leasing company regaining access to capital markets, so that it can raise off-balance sheet finance to replace bank debt and unsecured traded debt. It has already instructed Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, to lead manage an issue of securitised aircraft leases, called Alps. Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's deputy chairman, said he hoped the Alps issue would take place 'well before end of the year'. However, bankers believe the Alps issue will be impossible until investors are confident that GPA can overcome its financial difficulties and that will take many months. In addition, GPA is planning to raise about Dollars 200m of equity through a rights issue of convertible securities. The rights document will be sent to shareholders when banks agree to the proposed debt rescheduling. The detailed documents sent to banks yesterday, which are an inch thick in total, also said that GPA's commitments to buy aircraft from manufacturers has been reduced from Dollars 12bn at the beginning of last year to less than Dollars 4bn. More importantly, the group believes that it has cut orders for airplanes in 1993 and 1994 from Dollars 5bn to about Dollars 2.5bn. However, a banker stressed that the group had only reached agreement in principle with manufacturers to cancel or change the contracts. They were not legally binding. The banker added that the group had yet to reach any sort of agreement with one manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, though agreements have been reached with Boeing, Fokker and Airbus Industrie. Mr Foley said the failure to reach agreement with McDonnell was not serious. The deadline for reaching agreement with banks has now slipped from mid-January to the end of February or early March. One banker said the restructuring process was among the most complicated in which he had ever been involved. The banks are being asked to defer to late 1996 approximately Dollars 1bn of debt repayments due between the end of last year and September 30. GPA has Dollars 3.5bn of bank debt on its balance sheet plus another Dollars 500m off, some of it in joint ventures which have to be unscrambled. This debt is divided into more than 20 different facilities, provided by 130 banks. A group of regional Japanese banks, which are said to shocked by GPA's difficulties, provided a 'club loan' of Dollars 150m, all of which was due for repayment in a year. In addition about Dollars 2bn has been borrowed in the form of unsecured traded debt, of which Dollars 500m is in the form of publicly traded, fully registered bonds. In the next three years Dollars 1.25bn of this falls due for repayment.</p>

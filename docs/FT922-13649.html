			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: BFCE revamp pays off BANQUE Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the commercial banking group owned by some of France's biggest banks, recovered last year by boosting net profits from FFr8m (Dollars 1.42m) in 1990 to FFr115m in 1991, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The bank said it had benefited from a radical restructuring which included heavy investment in technology. BFCE's net banking income rose from FFr1.84bn in 1990 to FFr2.04bn in 1991, while gross operating profits were up from FFr401m to FFr671m. The group's total balance sheet was reduced from FFr239.4bn to FFr218.2bn. The cover rate on its sovereign risks was raised from 51 per cent to 60 per cent. Broken down, it was 60 per cent cover for most debtor countries and 35 per cent for the states within the former Soviet Union. BFCE's Cooke ratio increased from 7.3 per cent to 8.1 per cent. Assurance Generales de France, a large insurance group, is the biggest shareholder in BFCE, with a 43 per cent stake.</p>

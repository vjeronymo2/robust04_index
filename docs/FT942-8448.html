			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Goode opposition short-sighted The suggestion that larger companies are pressing the government to abandon the Goode recommendation on having at least one-third of pension scheme trustees drawn from the workforce is alarming ('Employers oppose rule change for pensions', May 17). The stalking horse for this view is that it is said to involve 'over-regulation'. There are a number of very respectable reasons why member participation in pension scheme trusteeship is highly desirable. One point though needs to be made loud and clear in this particular context. The 'nasties' identified over the last few years would never have occurred if the trustees had been robust, experienced, well-informed and uninvolved in management's financial ploys. You can achieve similar protection from external independent trustees or a really tough pensions regulator. However, there is no doubt that good member trustees play an excellent role as quick, sensitive and extremely cheap 'watchdogs' and regulators of pension schemes. It is very short-sighted of these larger companies to oppose this thoroughly sensible recommendation. They are likely to find that the regulatory regime may be much tougher and more expensive in consequence. Their beneficiaries may find it, I fear, less effective.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An uninspected vessel and vessel assistance towing vessel would be exempt from the rule between one hour before sunrise and one hour before sunset if the vessel: (1) Operates between 3 and 20 miles from shore and is equipped with an operable VHF radio capable of transmitting and receiving on channels 6, 13, 16, and 22A and operates within the VHF radio range of at least 1 VHF coast station (same as sea area A1 as defined in 47 CFR 80.1069) or (2) When operating more than 20 miles from shore the vessel must be ``in company'' with at least one other vessel at all times and the vessels are equipped with an operable VHF radio capable of transmitting and receiving on channels 6, 13, 16, and 22A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard's proposal for a one hour before sunrise to one hour before sunset exemption criterion is intended to incorporate, in principle, the recommendation from the charterboat operators to exempt vessels on voyages of less than 12 hours duration. The proposed rule would allow day trips to get underway before sunrise. If trouble developed early in a trip, search and rescue operations would still be able to take place in daylight. The proposed rule would also require boats without EPIRBs to be within 3 nautical miles of shore (4.8 Km/3 statute miles on the Great Lakes) at least one hour before sunset. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard is proposing to define the term ``in company'' to mean 2 or more vessels operating together in the same area, remaining within visual and VHF radio contact, by predetermined agreement prior to getting underway, for the purpose of ensuring mutual safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The condition to have a VHF radio and operate within range of a coast station recognizes the importance radio plays in summoning assistance from the Coast Guard or other vessels. The specified channels are those most likely to be needed in a search and rescue operation. However, in an accident involving a sudden capsizing or sinking, or one that quickly results in a loss of power, an operator who chooses to comply with the regulation by carrying a VHF radio may still be unable to summon help if out of sight of other vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One way of dealing with a possible rapid loss of a vessel's power is to require an emergency battery that is not part of the vessel's main power system. The Coast Guard is specifically interested in receiving comments addressing a requirement that to be eligible for the EPIRB exemption, uninspected passenger vessels be required to have a VHF radio that can be operated using an emergency battery that is not part of the vessel's main power system. Comments are invited on the practicality of such an arrangement and whether this should be an additional condition of the final rule. If the battery-powered operation is considered feasible, should a minimum operating period be specified? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Coast Guard is considering requiring uninspected vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels that operate beyond 20 nautical miles from shore to have a 406 MHz satellite EPIRB. The Coast Guard specifically requests comments on the practicality of such an arrangement and whether this should be an additional condition of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also proposes requiring all uninspected commercial vessels to carry the same visual distress signals now required to be carried on commercial fishing vessels in 46 CFR 28.145. For vessels operating in coastal waters within 3 miles of the coastline, the requirements would be the same as the visual distress signals now required on recreational boats in 33 CFR part 175 subchapter C. Vessels operating beyond 3 miles from the coastline would be required to have brighter and longer-burning flares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The casualty study shows that being seen by another vessel is a primary way in which assistance is obtained. Flares and other visual distress signals are recognized by mariners as signals indicating that assistance is required, so they play an important role where rescue depends on visual detection. The Coast Guard believes that most uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels already carry visual distress signals since those signals are now required whenever such a vessel is operated as a recreational boat in coastal waters. These flares can be bought for about $20. Therefore, the cost of this requirement would be minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed in this SNPRM, all vessels less than 11 meters (36 feet) in length and vessels of any length with positive flotation could meet the EPIRB requirement by carrying either an installed Category 1 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB or a readily accessible Category 2 (manual) 406 Satellite EPIRB mounted at or near the principal steering station of the vessel. For purposes of this regulation, length is defined as the length listed on a vessel's Certificate of Documentation or Certificate of Number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific number of vessels that would be affected by a regulation requiring EPIRBs on uninspected passenger vessels and assistance towing vessels is difficult to determine. The largest group of these vessels are charterboats, most of which make day fishing trips, but some are involved in overnight trips. Others operate as dive boats, excursion boats, parasail boats, vessel towing assistance vessels, water taxis, and other services. Those over five net tons are documented by the Coast Guard, and major accidents involving these vessels are required to be reported to the Coast Guard. Smaller boats are state numbered, are difficult to distinguish from recreational boats, and are often not captured in the Coast Guard's data on commercial vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data, EPA tentatively concluded that the data indicated that driving cycle did not contribute significantly to MMT-induced increases in HC emissions. (EPA's preliminary analysis was placed in docket A&hyph;92&hyph;41.) However, in addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl data appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than that observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's new program or in the original Ethyl test program). The Agency remained concerned that these data might indicate that certain engine and emissions control system configurations are more vulnerable to a MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate further settlement discussions with Ethyl, EPA decided to attempt to formulate an emission testing program intended to address in a timely manner specific unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions: (1) whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions similar to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels containing MMT have significant adverse effects on emissions from vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to meet future standards. On October 28, 1992, EPA held a public workshop to assist the Agency in its attempt to formulate such an emission testing program (57 FR 44740, September 29, 1992). In particular, EPA hoped to obtain information and assistance from technical experts outside of the Agency concerning the test program and, in view of the significance of any future waiver decision concerning MMT for the auto industry and the general public, EPA was interested in obtaining comments concerning a decisional framework designed to address and resolve these issues. A proposed emission test program developed by the Agency and presented at the public workshop, was effectively adopted by Ethyl as its most recent vehicle emissions test program involving the 1993 model fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although further settlement discussions between Ethyl and EPA were held subsequent to the public workshop, the parties were not successful in reaching a settlement. However, despite the failure of the parties to reach agreement, EPA concluded that the Administrator's denial decision should be reconsidered in light of the new emissions data generated by Ethyl subsequent to the decision. Accordingly, EPA requested that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia remand the denial decision to EPA for reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeals issued a decision granting the Agency's motion and remanding the case to the Agency to redetermine within 180 days whether to grant or deny Ethyl's application. The mandate implementing this judgement was transmitted to the Agency on June 3, 1993. Pursuant to the court's remand decision, the Agency published a notice indicating the commencement of a comment period (58 FR 35950, July 2, 1993). The Administrator's final decision on remand was due within 180 days after the transmittal of the court's mandate, or by November 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the Court of Appeals granted the Agency's motion to remand the denial decision concerning Ethyl's July 12, 1991 application, Ethyl submitted to EPA a substantial amount of additional data on emission testing with fuels containing MMT. (Specific aspects of these data are discussed below in Section IV of this document).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the course of the remand of Ethyl's waiver application, the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviewed the available data concerning the health effects associated with inhalation of manganese as part of a process to revise the reference concentration (RfC) for inhaled manganese. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  An inhalation reference concentration is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious non-cancer health effects during a lifetime. The methodology for establishing an RfC accounts for uncertainties and gaps in the health data base through the assignment of uncertainty factors. In November, 1993, ORD completed preparation and review of, and EPA released to Ethyl, a document identifying and describing the rationale for a new inhalation RfC of 0.05 ug/m3 for manganese and manganese compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1990, an inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for manganese of 0.4 ug/m3 was verified and placed on IRIS. The original RfC for manganese figured into a 1990 risk assessment of MMT prepared by the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD). Subsequently, in light of new information submitted by Ethyl and new results from more recently published studies concerning manganese inhalation health effects in workers, EPA reexamined the RfC for manganese and revised it to a value of 0.05 ug/m3 in 1993. This revised RfC for manganese was made available to Ethyl and placed on IRIS in November 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl subsequently provided to EPA a detailed critique of the approach utilized to derive the revised manganese RfC. Among other things, Ethyl argued that EPA used an inappropriate procedure to derive the RfC from a study of occupational manganese exposures by Roels, et al. (1992). Ethyl also argued that use of MMT would not result in significant changes in background manganese exposures, and that the favorable effects on public health resulting from changes in the composition of gasoline when MMT is utilized would outweigh any potential for adverse health effects. (Copies of documents describing the revised RfC and of the Ethyl comments are available in the public docket.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the deadline of November 30, 1993, for final action by EPA on Ethyl's waiver application approached, EPA concluded that the extensive data base on the emission effects of MMT assembled by Ethyl and others during the consideration of the application was sufficient to permit a decision concerning whether Ethyl had satisfied the statutory requirement to show that use of MMT will not cause or contribute to exceedence of emission standards. However, there had been insufficient opportunity for public comment concerning the use of a revised manganese inhalation RfC in assessing any risks that might be posed by granting Ethyl's application. Ethyl argued that it had not been afforded an adequate opportunity to study the derivation of the RfC and to comment on its implications for Ethyl's application. While EPA scientists did not necessarily agree with the specific technical arguments concerning the revised RfC and other issues pertaining to health effects made by Ethyl, EPA concluded that it might be useful to review the revised RfC in light of further analyses of the available data as well as the underlying data from occupational studies of inhaled manganese if such data could be readily obtained. EPA also concluded that it would be desirable in any case to have further dialogue with Ethyl and other interested parties on issues related to the health effects of manganese before EPA was to make a final decision concerning Ethyl's waiver application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

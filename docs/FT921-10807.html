			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Newton's poor law The poor are off the poli-tical agenda. In pre-That-cher elections at least a few people argued about the homeless, elderly widows in freezing flats, or families whose bread-winner was unemployed. Now Labour regards itself as too respectable to allude to such inconveniences, while the Conservatives are reluctant to acknowledge the problem. Neither should get away with it. The other day Mr Frank Field, a Labour MP who ploughs his own furrow, roughed up Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, in an illuminating exchange. It went unreported. This is partly the fault of Labour's social security spokesman, Mr Michael Meacher. Mr Meacher, whose ineptitude is one of the crosses Labour perversely chooses to bear, attracted the headlines with some careless remarks about his party's plans to lift the ceiling on national insurance contributions. Mr Field's grilling of Mr Newton was lost. It is time to retrieve it. Mr Field, who is chairman of the social security committee, asked a devilish question. Did the right honourable gentleman endorse the finding that those who had gained the smallest increase in incomes since Mrs Margaret Thatcher first took office were the poorest? 'What I shall certainly endorse,' said Mr Newton, 'is that . . . we have steadily - uprating by uprating - steered additional resources to poorer pensioners and to others whom we had identified, as a result of our research, as among those who were not doing as well as we should have wished.' Mr Field: 'I am grateful to the right honourable gentleman . . . but may I ask him that question again . . . Does he endorse the whole of that report, which shows that the very poorest have gained the smallest increase under this government?' Mr Newton: 'I accept that there are variations in the way in which incomes have grown . . .' And he wriggled on, about whether the same people were in the lowest decile throughout the 1980s. Some were, said Mr Field. Mr Newton, an honest and capable minister, sought refuge in 'a whole range of extremely complicated factors'. Mr Field asked, a third time, whether the minister would acknowledge that 'under the stewardship of this government, the poorest people in this country have had the smallest increase?' His victim came out fighting. 'At all levels of the income distribution,' insisted Mr Newton, 'people have been getting better off during the lifetime of this government.' Not quite. The numbers of long-term unemployed are rising again. The dole has not kept pace with earnings. State benefits have, with important exceptions such as payments to the disabled, risen by little more than the retail price index. General incomes have risen much faster. The very poor have hardly benefited from the growth of the 1980s So the lower deciles have moved ahead slowly, if at all. For example, poorer pensioners are about where they were in 1979; well-off pensioners are some 35 per cent better off, in real terms. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) tells us that poverty persists. The CPAG has been rebutted by the government on the ground that if you define poverty according to the numbers receiving income support then every time the trigger point for payments is increased the number 'in poverty' rises. True, but the CPAG also refers to two other definitions. One is the number on below half average incomes after housing costs. The other is 'breadline Britain', a survey of who can afford what are generally regarded as basic necessities. This was used by London Weekend TV in 1983 and 1990. Each definition has defects. Yet all three tell the same story. We also have our own eyes and ears. Even if the CPAG is only half-right there is no way out. The very poor have hardly benefited, if at all, from the growth that has made so many of us so comfortable. The tragedy is that in political terms it hardly matters. Many of the worst off are probably poll-tax dodgers who will not be on the electoral register. This election campaign is governed by the rich and powerful, the affluent, the moderately affluent, and aspirants to affluence. The other end is an embarrassing nuisance. That is why the Conservatives are hardly bothering to argue that only a wealthy society can help its poor. It is a sound argument, and in good years the Tories may prove its worth by a generous uprating of social security benefits. Fear of the affluent also explains Labour's pusillanimity: the extent of its redistributive urge is limited by a plan to put taxation back to where the Conservatives had it in 1988, the money thus raised to go to pensioners and higher child benefit. What we really need is a proper analysis of the poor. Take pensioners. There are two possibilities. Labour would rely on state pensions, with an immediate uprating of the basic pension and subsequent increases in line with earnings. It is still in a tangle about the relationship between its proposals for national insurance payments and its promises to the retired. The ultimate flaw in Labour's line is that future taxpayers may rebel against paying decent pensions. The Conservatives intend to press ahead with the privatisation of individual pensions. Good. Occupational pensions promise better rewards. Social security support should be concentrated on the rapidly-ageing pensioners who are solely dependent on the state. But the Tories are wary of such talk. When Mr Nigel Lawson was chancellor he was alleged to have floated the idea of a narrowly-focused state pension. The ensuing row was about whether a tape-recorder had been working when he said whatever he said. We need that tape now. If the voters will not hear of redistributive policies, politicians must start devising private insurance instruments to minimise the damage to the potential poor of the future. Just be careful not to become one of the left-overs.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: WEST COAST DEALER SERVICES ACQUIRED BY INCOMNET  </P> <P> Incomnet, a Westlake Village operator of a computerized auto-parts network,  said it completed the acquisition of West Coast Dealer Services, also of  Westlake Village, for an undisclosed amount of cash, debt and equity.  </P> <P> Sam D. Schwartz, Incomnet's president, said the acquisition doubles the size of  Incomnet and links the company with another network that trades more than $100  million worth of auto parts a year.  </P> <P> The acquisition will add about $2 million a year in revenue to Incomnet, and  will lead to combined 1990 revenues of about $7 million and income of $2  million, Schwartz said. He also said the purchase would allow Incomnet to  expand its services to car dealers and auto service contract companies.  </P></p>

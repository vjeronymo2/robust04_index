			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom sector active HINTS that the appointment of a new head of Oftel, the government's regulatory body, was imminent sparked fears of a tougher pricing regime and depressed telecoms stocks. BT fully-paid fell 5 to 398p, while the partly-paid retreated 4 1/2 to 293p. Vodafone fell, but rallied ahead of a big institutional meeting today and closed a penny ahead at 385p. The effects of currency movements continued to be felt in the market as Cable and Wireless was the latest stock to be seen as a major beneficiary of last week's dollar strength. Broker Hoare Govett lifted its current-year forecast by Pounds 125m to Pounds 1.05bn. Analyst Mr Jim Ross said: 'With the US economy picking up ahead of Europe, further dollar strengthening over the medium term is likely.' Hoare also increased its new customer connection rate estimates for Mercury, the C and W subsidiary, from 22,000 a month to 29,000. The shares rose 10 to 740p. Utilities bought The water and electricity sectors performed strongly as investors sought out defensive stocks in the wake of the US economic worries. Among waters, Anglian put on 6 at 509p, so did Thames, at 510p, and Southern added 4 at 498p. Ms Angela Whelan at BZW said: 'The sector is attractive for short-term dividend growth together with the growing realisation that the regulatory environment is increasingly stable.' Ms Whelan believes the sector's defensive qualities will override the attractions of the recovery plays, mainly because any economic revival will be slow. She added that selected stocks, such as Severn Trent, 3 ahead at 490p, also had recovery potential. Among electricity issues, London rose 7 to 451p, National Power 9 1/2 to 312p, PowerGen 10 1/2 to 314 1/2 p and Yorkshire 8 to 497p. SmithKline weak Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham suffered a sharp fall in an already depressed sector. General pressure was exacerbated by worries that tax benefits for companies who manufacture in Puerto Rico will be removed as part of US financial reforms. Puerto Rico is a significant production centre for the company's US operations. In addition, the possibility that President Clinton might crack down on the health sector in his State of the Union address late last night added to the worries. SmithKline shed 10 to 439p in the 'A's and 9 to 382p in the Units. Meanwhile, Fisons lost 5 to 238p, Glaxo 5 to 662p ahead of figures today, and Wellcome 2 to 898p. Tobacco stocks BAT Industries and Rothmans International declined on fears of a possible rise in US taxes on overseas companies. BAT fell 11 to 958p, and Rothmans 6 1/2 to 611p. Conglomerate Hanson slipped 5 1/2 to 244 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 10m shares for the same reason. Lasmo favoured Oil group Lasmo rose 6 to 172p after securities house Smith New Court published a buy recommendation. The house said it expected Lasmo to maintain its dividend, based on the current level of sterling oil prices. However, other oil shares were unmoved by the announcement of Opec production cuts, with many in the market sceptical that they would be adhered to. Opec set an output ceiling of 23.582m barrels per day (bpd) from March 1, against January output of around 25m bpd. BP lost a penny to 261p and Shell Transport gained 1 1/2 at 577 1/2 . RTZ down The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, saw its shares fall sharply in early dealings after the group announced provisions for cutbacks within a US subsidiary. The registered shares were down 20p just before the official start of trading on the surprise news that RTZ's Kennecott subsidiary was stopping operations at its 54 per cent owned Creek mine in Alaska. The move will entail provisions of Dollars 48m (Pounds 33.8m). Although the news was unexpected, one analyst summed up the general view when he said: 'It is a one-off provision and does not affect the underlying trading position.' The market is looking for profits of around Pounds 300m, against Pounds 308m last year, when RTZ reveals figures on March 11. The share price recovered throughout the day, partly helped by a buy note from US house Lehman Brothers, to end a net 5 off at 651p. Abbey National up High street bank Abbey National climbed 14 to 365p with the help of an improved recommendation from UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson. House analyst Mr Peter Dutton moved to a buy from a hold. He said the shares had underperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index by 6 per cent over the past month and 'the yield has got to a level where we are happy to be buying again'. There was also talk of a badly handled buy order by one house. Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays mopvked down 4 to 431p and National Westminster receded 5 to 435p. Pittencrieff jumped a further 27 to 378p on consideration of the company's plan to split its telecommunications division from its oil and gas activities. A squeeze in P &amp; O saw the shares improve 11 to 557p. UK airports operator BAA firmed 3 to 770p after announcing that it had applied for planning permission to build a fifth terminal at Heathrow airport. British Airways recovered 3 to 278p after Tuesday's fall that followed the release of third-quarter results. Publisher Emap moved forward 4 to 434p following a Pounds 20.65m acquisition of business magazines, directories and related exhibition interests from Thomson Information Services. Analysts said the market liked the fit and the fact that the money came from Emap's existing cash pile. Carlton Communications recovered 13 to 768p from its oversold position as concern about rival products, particularly pay-for-view, proved hard to pin down. Worries that a large customer may cancel or defer aircraft orders depressed defence and aerospace components group Smiths Industries. The shares gave up 15 to 349p, with funding worries at the European Fighter Aircraft, to which Smiths is also a supplier, also dampening enthusiasm for the stock. Several brokers have now turned cautious, including NatWest Securities and Strauss Turnbull, which said: 'The company is vulnerable to defence cuts, health issues in both the UK and US, and the deep late cycle recession in civil aerospace.' The sentiment in Smiths hurt Rolls-Royce shares, which relinquished 5 to 127p, and FR Group, down 9 at 253p. It was, however, profit-taking along with worries about US taxation that led Siebe 6 lower to 463p. Bargain hunters in TI Group helped the shares bounce 10 to 293p. Motor stocks were in demand and GKN added 4 at 469p, ahead of figures next month, while Thomas Cowie apprecated 6 to 195p. A large stock overhang in J. Sainsbury weakened the shares, which closed 11 adrift at 511p. Marketmakers said a leading securities house had been unable to place a line of 1.25m shares, but had eventually parcelled them off at around 507p. Turnover was a bulky 4m. Relief greeted the bond issue by Argyll Group and the shares moved ahead 5 1/2 to 368p. Food specialists said a conversion bond had been feared. Shaved profits forecasts in Albert Fisher weakened the shares, down 1 1/2 at 66p. The latest government retail figures boosted sentiment in the stores sector. Boots, helped additionally by news on its Manoplax heart drug, advanced 6 to 491p, Dixons 9 to 218p, GUS 15 to 1585p and WH Smith 6 to 425p. NatWest Securities raked up concern over the Forte dividend and turned seller of the stock. The shares closed a penny better at 193p. Selected brewing stocks recovered from their weakness earlier in the week that was prompted by disappointing figures from Courage. Bass added 9 at 576p, with James Capel also said to be keen, while Scottish &amp; Newcastle improved 10 to 424p. A badly handled order upset Whitbread and the 'A' shares closed a net 2 off at 455p.

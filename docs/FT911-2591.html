			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Production and Employment: A Germany divided poses new challenges THE FALL-OUT from the monetary and political unification of east and west Germany last year has left German policy-makers facing two very different economic challenges. Reliable statistics for industrial production and employment in the eastern Lander are still hard to come by, but it is quite clear that the east German economy has collapsed over the past nine months under the dual burden of competition from the west and rapidly rising east German wages. Meanwhile, consumer demand and industrial output in west Germany have continued to grow at an apparently unsustainable pace, as the economic indicators show in the chart. The growth of output of west German companies has accelerated since the collapse of the Berlin wall in October 1989, when east German consumers were first able freely to travel to the west. Industrial production in 1990 was 5.2 per cent higher than in 1989. Companies have also switched resources away from producing exports in order to supply the expanding home market. The catalyst for this change was the deterioration in Germany's export competitiveness which has occurred over the past year. Rising German interest rates have attracted foreign capital into Germany, causing the D-Mark to appreciate and pushing the German current account into deficit in January of this year. Retail sales were buoyant in the western Lander in late 1989 and early 1990, but it was monetary unification last July, and the consequent rise in the purchasing power of east German savings, which provided the biggest fillip for west German retailers. Retail sales in the third quarter of last year were 13.3 per cent higher than in the equivalent period in 1989, compared to 6 per cent higher sales in the second quarter of 1990. The demand for labour in west Germany has also increased sharply as companies have expanded production to meet rising demand for their output. Vacancies in 1990 were almost double their level of 1986, while unemployment fell to 4.5 per cent of the workforce in February 1991, from 7.2 per cent in 1985. This increased tightness in the labour market has been manifested in a rise in the level of wage claims. This combination of strong consumer demand and increased wage pressure explains why the Bundesbank remains nervous about inflation and may want to increase interest rates in Germany again, despite falling output and rising unemployment in the east. These and many other trends in the world economy are visible in the fourth of our new series of statistical tables for the six largest industrial countries. It follows tables covering National Accounts (April 8 1991), Balance of Payments (April 15 1991) and Money and Finance (April 22 1991). Today's table consists of five series which together provide a detailed picture of both historical trends and future prospects for industrial output, retail sales and employment. The industrial production and retail sales series are shown annually in index form (1985 = 100), and quarterly and monthly as growth rates on the equivalent period in the previous year. Because all countries calculate unemployment rates in different ways, the table contains standardised unemployment rates for each country, adjusted by the OECD from national sources to approximate to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment. This definition includes only those persons of working age who are without work, available for work and actively seeking work. This unemployment definition may not adequately capture the true rate of unemployment. Published figures for unemployment in east Germany, for example, understate the true level of unemployment considerably, since many 'employed' workers are merely being paid to stay at home until they can legally be made redundant later this year. Changes in the level of job vacancies in an economy often provide an advanced warning of future changes in unemployment or inflation, yet few countries attempt systematically to record total available vacancies. In the UK, the available measure of vacancies - unfilled vacancies at job-centres - is estimated to represent about one third of total vacancies in the economy. No vacancy data are available at all for Italy, while in the US a help-wanted index, based on jobs advertised in main metropolitan newspapers, is used as a proxy for actual vacancies. The table contains a vacancy rate indicator which the FT has constructed for each country except Italy. The available raw vacancy data for each country, or proxy for the US, have been divided by total civilian employment, to adjust for changes in the size of the employed work-force, and converted into an index with 1985 = 100. This vacancy rate indicator is informative, but must be used with care. Only general trends in the index can be compared across countries, not levels or even percentage changes. Even within countries, percentage changes in the index over time must be interpreted with caution. The composite leading indicators are weighted averages of a number of forward-looking economic indicators for each country, which are compiled by the OECD. Cyclical movements in the monthly index should precede cyclical fluctuations in the index of industrial production by about six to nine months. The indicators included in the index vary across countries, but will often include share price movements, housing starts or results from surveys of business confidence. Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED STATES

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US-help wanted advertising, Japan-new vacancies, Germany and France-all jobs vacant, Italy-no data avaliable, UK-unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which generally precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA.</p>

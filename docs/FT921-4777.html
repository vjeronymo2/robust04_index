			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Appointments: A lady poised to develop her chamber Janis Bailey, who learned about business information systems with Hewlett Packard in Palo Alto, California, is the new managing director of Chambernet, a new Belfast-based electronic business information network owned by the Association of Chambers of Commerce and 41 individual chambers from around the UK. Bailey, who accompanied her husband to California when he won a Fulbright scholarship to Stanford, found on her return to Ireland in 1982 that there were few interesting openings for her newly acquired skills. So she took an MBA at Queen's, where she had earlier obtained a Diploma in Library and Information Services. She joined Price Waterhouse in 1988 as a senior consultant to develop marketing services. Chambernet, to be launched in May, is designed to provide detailed information on member companies' products, markets and personnel. Bailey, who claims to 'quite like' living in Belfast, is excited to have found an outlet for her business information experience, and is keen to develop Chambernet via links with similar services in Europe, and possibly the US.</p>

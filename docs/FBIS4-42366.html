			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] General Jean Cot, the commander of the blue  helmets in the former Yugoslavia between July 1993 and March  1994, has decided to leave the Army, where his grade of Army  general (five stars), the highest military rank, did not give  him much more headroom. The departure of the 60-year-old  General Cot, who still had one year of service to complete  before reaching the age limit, was confirmed at yesterday's  cabinet meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

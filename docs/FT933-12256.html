			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Aix proves bankrupt of ideas AS RECESSION bites in France, it is likely that the arts will face a difficult few years. There is a rumour that the Aix-en-Provence festival is uncertain how far its formerly secure patronage will be maintained next year. Unfortunately its fund of artistic inventiveness inconveniently seems to be running out at the same time. Of this year's three operas, two were intellectually bankrupt. The more important failure was Weber's Euryanthe, which always seems to be unlucky in the theatre. The opera is the very archetype of the early-romantic German lyric drama, an idealised vision of medieval chivalry, told in vivid musical narrative. There is no obvious reason why its spirit should be difficult to convey, although one might not have thought so from ENO's drab production in the 1970s. This effort at Aix was worse. For an evening of visual ghastliness it could hardly be surpassed. Forget romantic forests, rocky gorges, castle halls. For the opening scene the only prop was an enormous spiked ball hanging from the ceiling of a grey hall. The women of the chorus wore a variety of designer flowerpots on their heads; the men stood around in hang-dog fashion dressed as medieval oafs. When a group of girls in flimsy blue bikinis fluttered on, they seemed quite uninterested. Everything was enervated, gloomy, ugly. The producer of this sorry enterprise was Hans Peter Cloos, the designer Jean Haas. The extent of their combined ingenuity can be judged from the heroic battle in Act 3. In a wild ravine (empty stage, low lighting) Adolar is supposed to face a monster in combat. Insteaed he sits motionless on an empty stage, while his adversary turns out to be a woman who appears in a puff of dry ice on a platform way out of reach - poor girl, this was her second role of the festival, in the nude again, but now bald as well] For the stage-wise singer, ready to seize an opportunity, the production offered an open door. Karen Huffstodt, as the evil Eglantine, duly took it, staking her claim to the most dramatic role of the opera with a portrayal of Hollywood bad-girl glamour, school of Bette Davis, accompanied by singing of the fearsome vocal part that was confident and abandoned. She stole the show. In an interesting contrast, her partner-in-crime Lysiart was played by Andreas Schmidt, whose impeccably-moulded singing made inward all that she externalised so forcibly. Once past the ungratefully-written opening aria, Thomas Moser's Adolar was strong and secure. Elisabeth Meyer-Topsoe was an able, not very moving Euryanthe. Jeffrey Tate conducted what seemed an undersized English Chamber Orchestra, unable to give the music sufficient punch in this open-air venue. The opera should be seen to be the forerunner of Wagner's grand music dramas. Here it merely seemed to be as long as one.                           *       *       * Just a note on Don Giovanni. This was officially a revival, although in practice the original production last year had been judged such a disaster that the producer, Giorgio Marini, was asked to re-think from scratch. To anyone coming to this staging for the first time, it was difficult to see what his re-thinking had entailed. Or, indeed, if any thinking had taken place at all. Mozart described Don Giovanni as a 'dramma giocoso', but neither drama nor comedy was to be divined either from the stage action, or from Armin Jordan's stylish, but undramatic conducting. Once again, individual singers were left to put across their own performances with success, where they could. Hillevi Martinpelto as Donna Anna and John Mark Ainsley as Don Ottavio won the audience's enthusiastic approval, a view with which I would not take issue. Deborah Riedel stood in bravely as Donna Elvira at short notice. But this was not a Don Giovanni of festival standard.</p>

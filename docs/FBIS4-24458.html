			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (CNS) -- Minister of Railways, Mr  Han Zhubin, recently revealed that diversified business had  become an important economic pillar of railway enterprises in  China.    After more than ten years' development, railway enterprises  in the country have developed their business from the mere  railway industry to a dozen of industries including commerce,  trade, tourism, food and catering, storage and construction.  The diversified business has not only offered an economic  backing to the construction and development of railways in the  country, but also streamlined staff and workers in the railway  sector, creating relaxed conditions for the reform of railway  enterprises.    The diversified business of railway enterprises started in  1984 and by the end of last year, there were over 7,000  enterprises engaging in diversified business with employment of  more than 380,000. Business income earned by them in 1993 made  up nearly half of the total earned from railway shipment while  their profits surpassed that from railway shipment. According  to statistics, the diversified business income between 1986 and  1993 was RMB [renminbi] 75.7 billion and some 218,000 staff and  workers originally engaging in railway shipment had been  transferred to enterprises specializing in other businesses.    The minister said that the goal set for the railway sector's  diversified business in the next 6 years was to increase its  business income and sales value as well as profits all by four  times and streamline another hundreds of thousands of staff and  workers from shipment enterprises to diversified business ones.

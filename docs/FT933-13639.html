			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Romantic whose roots reached deep into the stony soil  -Michael Glover on the troubled life and misunderstood work of John Clare, the 'Northamptonshire Peasant' and poet whose bicentennial falls this week COTTAGE TALES by John Clare Carcanet Pounds 9.95, 158 pages JOHN CLARE: THE POET AND THE PLACE by Peter Moyse Crossberry Press, Helpston Pounds 11.95, 120 pages UNLIKE many other poets of the English countryside John Clare, who was born 200 years ago this week, had a thorough-going knowledge of every aspect of rural life and he wrote about it without sentimentality. Given his background, this is not surprising. Born in the small village of Helpston, then in Northamptonshire now in in Cambridgeshire, to parents that Clare himself described as 'illiterate to the last degree', he worked at a whole range of physical tasks as the occasion and the needs of the family demanded: as corn thresher, ploughboy, gardener (at Burghley House, Stamford), lime-burner and pot boy at the local inn. And even when at the height of his brief period of fame in the 1820s, he continued to plough the land. His 'conversion' to poetry took place at 13. He was lent a copy of Thomson's Seasons, a sequence of vague pastoral encomiums that was much in vogue at the beginning of the 19th century. The book made Clare's heart 'twitter with joy'. By the time he had reached his 20s, his own verse had been brought to the attention of John Keats' publisher, John Taylor, who released his first collection of poetry in 1820: Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenes by John Clare, a Northamptonshire Peasant - title fit to make a proud provincial blench. It was reprinted several times and Clare, on the wings of unanticipated success, made several visits to distant London, where he had his portrait painted by William Hilton (RA) and was generally lionised, at the age of 26, as the capital's newest literary celebrity. Unfortunately, the succeeding volumes sold less and less well. Clare, it seems, was unable to meet the general public's - and his own publisher's - incessant demands for novelty. In fact, by the middle of the 1820s his publisher, once a helpmate, had become a torment. Why was this so? Clare was a poet who worked by his own lights, spelling and punctuating exactly as he saw fit, and writing the kind of poetry that, in the opinion of his publisher, would be less and less likely to find appeal in the market-place. Unlike some of the other great Romantics - Shelley, Wordsworth and Coleridge, for example - Clare was not a man accustomed to seeing sermons in stones. What he saw were the stones themselves, all that hard, flinty glitter, and he did his utmost to describe them with a particularity unequalled by any previous poet. The countryside that surrounds Helpston, a terrain of harsh, spare beauty even to this day, is flat, with a great expanse of sky. It was Clare's ambition to preserve an honest record of it, and its customs, in the teeth of the double despoliations of the Enclosure Acts and the advent of the railways. John Taylor attacked Clare repeatedly for using 'the language of common everyday description' and for eschewing the pressing need to introduce an element of human interest into his nature poetry. These were, after all, the years in which the novel was coming into vogue. Poetry must be seen to compete. Clare remained his vulgar self, obstinately inclined to write of low rustic manners, doggedly refusing to soar into loftier regions. Taylor cut his manuscripts ruthlessly, changed words, objected to the vivid local usages that Clare felt most appropriate, and introduced an abundance of punctuation so that the eyes of the middle-class country tasters from the metropolis would glide smoothly from line to line and not be brought up short by bewildering grammatical or orthographical idiosyncrasies. Nowadays  -and it has taken this long for publishers to recognise that Clare was not being deliberately wrong-headed and perverse when he chose, like Yeats, to follow his own instincts - publishers print his poems just as he wrote them, warts and all, and the lack of punctuation, we now see, helps to give them a welling, teeming, gulping quality that adds to the richness of the poet's own observations. His later years were a protracted agony, the last quarter of a century being spent in the Northampton asylum, where he continued to write, though now it was poetry of a much more rootless kind. He had needed Helpston. Without the familiarity of his home village, its sights, sounds and smells, he felt wrenched up by the roots and tossed aside. Two new books have been published to coincide with the bicentenary of Clare's birth. Cottage Tales is a collection of narrative poems that Clare intended to include in The Shepherd's Calendar, his third book of poems; John Clare: the Poet and the Place juxtaposes poems by Clare with photographs of some of the places in and around Helpston with which he would have been familiar. The excellent John Clare Society can provide a list of bicentenary events (sae please) upon request to: Peter Moyse, The Stables, 1a West St, Helpston, Peterborough PE6 7DU.</p>

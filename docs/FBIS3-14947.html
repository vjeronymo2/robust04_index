			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1910 GMT on 28 February broadcasts the 60-minute,  recorded, "Without Retouching" program featuring an interview  with Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko by moderator  Georgiy Dolgov and a panel of press and broadcast  correspondents.    An ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent begins by saying that the  recent amnesty decision to release the putschists points to it  being a plot between parliament and government.    "You know", Shumeyko replies, "I could not see any sign of a  plot. If you want to speak about this, however, then Russia  told the whole world that it would build a law-based state and  that there would, at long last, be a division of powers in  Russia into legislative, executive, and legal powers. Each  branch of power has its own prerogatives. It so happened that  the Duma declared an amnesty, and it did so according to the  law. If you look at Article 103 of the Constitution, it is  there in black and white."    Shumeyko goes on to define amnesty as the release of  criminals from punishment and says that the legislative body  adopted the role of the court. He says: "Whatever my attitude  may be to the Lefortovo inmates, I believe that they treated  them incorrectly. Still, there had to be a trial, and the court  decided. Then there was an amnesty. Now it turns out that,  some people say, that once the inmates acknowledged the amnesty  and left prison they admitted they were guilty and admitted they  were criminals. They admitted they were guilty of everything  that happened. That is one point of view. The other point of  view says no. They were innocent. They should be released."    Shumeyko says it is a good that people have different views,  so long as it is according to the law. He adds that what has  happened is over, and we must see what happens next.    A SEGODNYA correspondent asks Shumeyko about budget  allocations to the agrarian sector in the first quarter.  Shumeyko says that this matter was discussed in the Federal  Council, and they arrived at a figure of 7 trillion rubles. He  adds that it is a matter of choosing the right path between high  inflation and supporting commodity producers and says that the  latter must be supported.    A KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks Shumeyko whether  Aleksandr Rutskoy, now that he is free, has information that may  be used against some of the present leaders, including Shumeyko  himself. Shumeyko says he does not think that Rutskoy has any  secret information. It is the same old story, he says, when  some people fabricate charges for personal gain.    Dolgov interjects that a commercial bank bought up documents  containing materials that compromised Shumeyko. Shumeyko says  he has never signed any document that could be interpreted as  corruption.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent then asks Shumeyko  what he has gained from recent moves in his career. Shumeyko  replies that he and his predecessor, Ruslan Khasbulatov, had  different opinions on many issues. He says he believes that  more than half the laws adopted by the previous Supreme Soviet  were of a political nature and that this merely hindered the  progress of the reforms.    A ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent asks if the Federation  Council would overturn the amnesty decision if it had the power.  Shumeyko says he believes that it would. He says he is against  the amnesty decision as a politician and chairman.    An IZVESTIYA correspondent asks about the technicalities  with  regard to Procurator General Kazannik's resignation. Shumeyko  says: "The Federation Council is not in session at the moment.  The next session will be on 15 March. It happened like this:  Procurator General Kazannik resigned. The president--on the  basis of Kazannik's resignation statement--wrote out his  instruction, or edict. He wrote that he had received Kazannik's  resignation and that he would go to the Federation Council with  a proposal to release Kazannik and to appoint Ilyushenko to the  office.    "I received this letter from the president. During the  recess between sessions, I said that there was no procedural  norm, so I signed the instruction. I do not have the right to  make the decision. I do not have the right to decide for the  whole Federation Council. Therefore, the instruction literally  said the following: until examination of the question of the  resignation/appointment by the Federation Council, in accordance  with Article 102 of the Constitution, to agree with the  president's proposal to entrust the execution of duties to  Ilyushenko. In other words, this is until 15 March. On 15  March, all these official letters of the president will be  submitted, and we will examine them in the proper manner. We  will adopt a decision then, or we will not adopt a decision."    Shumeyko continues by elaborating on the importance of the  struggle against crime and, hence, the importance of making the  correct decision over the post of procurator general.    An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA asks if Russia is not in a dangerous  position now with a new Duma in place and the possibility of  further confrontation. Shumeyko says he does not see any  confrontation between the powers at present. He adds that time  will tell how matters develop, but the main thing is that proper  laws are adopted and are accepted by the people. He says he  believes that everything can be solved politically.    A LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks when there will be  another October this year--alluding to a statement by Communist  Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. Shumeyko retorts that it will  be in October, according to the calendar. He says he takes  these statements with a grain of salt.    Answering a question from a Radio Rossii correspondent about  the make-up of the parliament and the different factions,  Shumeyko says that while there may be great differences in the  Duma, there are no such factional divisions in the Federation  Council. He adds that all deputies are equal and, therefore, it  will come to decisions more quickly.    A Radio Svoboda correspondents asks what Shumeyko thinks the  next round of presidential elections in 1996 will look like,  whether it will be a Zhirinovskiy-Rutskoy or  Chernomyrdin-Rutskoy-Zhirinovskiy clash. Shumeyko says he does  not like predictions, and it will be up to the people to decide  who their president will be. He add that he does not believe  the formulas Radio Svoboda has presented will in fact emerge.  He says that the thing to remember is that the institution of  the presidency is still a young one in Russia; it is still  emerging and needs to be consolidated.    Shumeyko then answers a question from PRAVDA about the state  of the media's finances. He says it is obviously a good thing  if the country has well-established papers, and PRAVDA has a  special place in the country's life. He adds that a reduction  in taxes would help the press.    Dolgov asks about television, and Shumeyko replies that  television also needs funds. He adds that as long as television  is owned by the state it is part of the budget. He says that  television, in general, is in need of investment.    The ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent cites an article in THE  FINANCIAL TIMES about vast sums of cash going out of the country  and then asks what Shumeyko is going to do about corruption in  the Federation Council. Shumeyko talks about the need for  foreign investment. He adds that there is not such a big  problem with regard to corruption.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks if Shumeyko  intends to elevate the status of the Interparliamentary  Assembly. Shumeyko says he does, particularly when it comes to  tackling issues in areas like Karabakh and others with a  Russian-speaking population. He says that a plenary session  will be held on 17-19 March and that all justice ministers and  chairmen of arbitration courts will be invited to debate a  Russian civic code. He adds that a social code also needs to be  worked out.    The SEGODNYA correspondent asks Shumeyko how inflation and  extra cash to Agroprom can be balanced. He then asks how far  Shumeyko is prepared to go to avoid extreme inflation.    Shumeyko replies that inflation can be curbed as long as the  money goes to the right areas and the agro-industrial complex is  one.    Shumeyko closes by giving brief answers to questions. He  says he is not planning to run for president at the next  election and believes it would be good for Russia if Yeltsin  were to hold office again. He says only fascist newspapers will  be closed down.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense Correspondent </F> in Munich]    [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned tonight  that military power might be used in Bosnia following the  carnage in Sarajevo, which he labelled a ghastly act of  terrorism.    But he stressed that the military option had a huge  price-tag  attached with severe implications for the humanitarian aid  effort.    He arrives in Bosnia tomorrow and is due to fly immediately  to Sarajevo aboard an RAF Hercules for urgent talks with the new  UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose.    "What one needs to do is to hear from the UN military  commanders on the spot whether they believe there is any useful  way in which the UN, by military means or any other way, can  help try to prevent a repetition of this ghastly incident," he  said.    Speaking after a meeting of NATO defence ministers in  Munich,  he said: "We are all conscious of that fact that our prime duty  in Sarajevo at the present time is seeking to ensure the people  there get the sustenance they require.    "If there are any initiatives of a military kind that the  military are able to recommend as being relevant, then clearly  that is something we would have to listen to very carefully."    U.S. President Bill Clinton indicated tonight that air  strikes on Serb positions was one of the options that would have  to be looked at.    But Mr. Rifkind emphasised it was essential first to find  out  from the UN commanders on the ground whether responsibility for  the marketplace attack can be definitely pinned on the Serbs.    "Whether the military role can be increased and enhanced is  a  very difficult and painful decision," he said.    "First, we have to hear the views of the military in Bosnia.  We have to be certain that any military initiatives are capable  of providing the solution we want to see. Otherwise, we would  be exposing our troops to unacceptable risk to their own lives."    And he insisted: "The military option has a huge price tag  attached to it with implications for the whole humanitarian  operation."    Sir Michael has adopted what he calls a "very hardline,  hardnosed approach" to ensuring humanitarian aid gets through.    He has promised the UN forces will be much more  "tough-minded" in refusing to be turned back by the warring  factions.    And Mr. Rifkind revealed that the general, a former head of  the SAS, had the full backing of the British Government.    "Sir Michael is taking a very robust approach to these  matters and he has the full and unqualified support of the  British Government in the way which he is approaching his  responsibilities," said Mr. Rifkind.    "What has often been a cause for concern are the delays that  have taken place and the extent to which small numbers of  persons from one or other of the factions have been able to hold  up aid.    "I think the attitude of the new commander will help deal  with that particular matter."    But he repeated there was no easy answer to the crisis  facing  Bosnia, particularly Sarajevo.    "Today's attack was an example essentially of terrorism," he  said. "We know about terrorism in the UK and we know there are  no simple answers.    "I don't think people in Britain or elsewhere believe we can  simply end this civil war by external military involvement. We  have seen the problems in Somalia."    Britain is due to make a final decision next month whether  to  keep troops in Bosnia to help the humanitarian aid effort and Mr  Rifkind's two-day fact-finding mission will be crucial.</p>

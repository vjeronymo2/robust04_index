The UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] communique, conveyed to TANJUG Friday [7  January], states that on January 5 seven armed Croatian soldiers  stopped, disarmed and arrested four Canadian peacekeepers who  were on a routine patrol in the area of Medak, south of the  republic of Serb Krajina.    The communique adds that the patrol commander had shown his  authorisation to cross the territory which was ignored and the  Canadian soldiers were forced at gunpoint to go to the local  Croatian Army headquarters. Describing the incident as  "shameful" Jean Cot requested of the Croatian authorities to  conduct an inquiry and punish those responsible. In an action  named "Scorched Earth" last September the Croatian Army has  occupied the Medak area, and burnt down 11 Serb villages and  brutally murdered 72 civilians. The republic of Serb Krajina  was declared by the Serbs in 1991 in parts of the former  Republic of Croatia where Serbs are a majority population, in  defiance of the forced Croatian secession from the former  Yugoslavia and their downgrading of the Serbs from a constituent  nation to a national minority.    Although the RSK has been under U.N. protection since March  1992 in that period Croatia has three times attacked the Serb  state that it does not recognize, with the aim of forcibly  placing it under its authority.</p>

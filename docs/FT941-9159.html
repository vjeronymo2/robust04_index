			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Doubtful benefits from tying UK overseas aid to exports Sir, A K Goldsmith (Letters, February 14) defends the use of overseas aid to promote British exports. Three points needs to be made in the light of his assertions. First, the Overseas Development Administration stated in its 1993 review of British aid that 'the aid programme's greatest priority is reducing poverty'. When ODA minister Baroness Chalker outlined the seven goals of the aid programme last year, promoting exports was not one of them. Furthermore, only 10 per cent of MPs believe that promoting trade should be a main aim of overseas aid, an Actionaid/Gallup opinion poll showed last July. It is true that other governments tie their aid to the exports of their own goods. Yet Britain ties 70 per cent of its bilateral aid, a higher proportion than most donors. Second, recent research contradicts Mr Goldsmith's claim that the aid and trade provision (ATP) benefits the British economy. A 1992 study by experts at the University of Bath noted that, while the ATP has created some commercial benefits, 'this does not, however, imply that there has been a net economic gain to the UK'. Regarding tied aid generally, the study concluded that 'it is quite possible that the net economic effect on the UK has been negative, or at least quite negligible'. A 1991 OECD study concurred, noting that 'it is improbable that aid tying provides significant macro-economic benefits to any donor's domestic employment or balance of payments aggregates'. Third, what taxpayers want from overseas aid is that it helps to reduce poverty. An Actionaid/BMRB survey last July found that 73 per cent of the public believe the government should increase aid to tackle global environmental and development problems. We share Mr Goldsmith's willingness to participate in a public debate on these issues. But this should take account of the needs of the world's poor rather than those of big business.

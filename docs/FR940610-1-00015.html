The request for revision shall be submitted to the Chief of the Assessment Operations Section, and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the revision sought by the institution. If additional information is requested by the Corporation, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the Corporation's request for additional information. Any institution submitting a timely request for revision will receive written notice from the Corporation regarding the outcome of its request.

Notice of the assessment risk classification applicable to a particular semiannual period will be provided to the institution with the first-quarterly invoice provided pursuant to &sect;327.3(c)(2). Each institution's assessment risk classification, which will be composed of a group and a subgroup assignment, will be based on the following capital and supervisory factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capital factors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Institutions will be assigned to one of the following three capital groups on the basis of data reported in the institution's Report of Income and Condition, Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, or Thrift Financial Report containing the necessary capital data, for the report date that is closest to the last day of the seventh month preceding the current semiannual period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Well capitalized. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For assessment risk classification purposes, the short-form designation for this group is ``1''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, this group consists of institutions satisfying each of the following capital ratio standards: Total risk-based ratio, 10.0 percent or greater; Tier 1 risk-based ratio, 6.0 percent or greater; and Tier 1 leverage ratio, 5.0 percent or greater. New insured depository institutions coming into existence after the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be included in this group for the first semiannual period for which they are required to pay assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For purposes of assessment risk classification, an insured branch of a foreign bank will be deemed to be ``well capitalized'' if the insured branch maintains the pledge of assets required under 12 CFR 346.19, and maintains the eligible assets prescribed under 12 CFR 346.20 at 108 percent or more of the average book value of the insured branch's third-party liabilities for the quarter ending on the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese campaign  to help orphans and if possible adopt them has aroused wide  attention among people of all walks of life since it was  initiated late last year.    The Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Radio, Film  and Television and the Ministry of Culture will jointly hold a  large show and a charity auction in a bid to raise more funds  for orphans.    A group of well-known cultural and artistic workers, and  business people have volunteered to join "Songs for Orphans", a  fund-raising program launched by the Beijing Music Radio Station.    More and more people are taking part in the publicity  campaign, which has also won great support from many overseas  Chinese.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Chairman  of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Qiao  Shi have recently each sent personal messages of support to the  campaign.    China is believed to have about 100,000 orphans. But living  standards of orphans are below the national per capita average.    Orphans now living in various welfare organizations across  the country only have an average monthly living expense of 50  yuan.    The helping-the-orphan program was initiated by the China  Society for the Promotion of Social Services, under the guidance  of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.    The program is aimed at pooling more funds and other  resources to help orphans live a better life, resume study, to  help upgrade endangered buildings in welfare centers and to buy  more medical equipment for welfare facilities.</p>

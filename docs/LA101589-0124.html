			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WEST VIRGINIA;  </P> <P> WOMAN CHARGED IN PLAN TO SELL CHILD  </P> <P> A woman who allegedly tried to sell her 2-month-old child to two different  couples for $3,000 has been charged with child neglect. Clay County Prosecutor  Richard Facemire said Lena Lynn Romine, 22, was charged with the misdemeanor  offense because there are no state laws specifically prohibiting the selling of  children. "It's clear that it's neglect of a child and it's abuse," the  prosecutor said. "A child isn't . . . a horse or a cow you can sell and trade."  The prosecutor said the court granted his motion to remove the child from  Romine's custody.  </P></p>

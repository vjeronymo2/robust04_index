			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kamal Jaballah in Sanaa] </F>   [Text] A ranking Yemeni Government official has announced  that the General People's Congress [GPC] set the return of 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, vice president and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], and Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas to Sanaa to assume their duties as a condition for  signing the "Pledge and Accord" document outside Yemen.    The official, who asked not to be identified, said that if  the document is not signed before the month of Ramadan  [approximately 10 February] it will mean that the YSP is buying  more time to prepare for separation. In his statement to  AL-AHRAM, the official expected a violent military confrontation  between the two sides if the crisis is not resolved. He noted  that YSP media are now paving the way for separation.    The official's statement coincided with growing speculation  by politicians and observers in Sanaa that the antagonist  political forces are preparing to divide Yemen once again into  two parts and perhaps more, as Hadhramaut is expected to secede  from the southern part. Informed Yemeni sources that asked to  remain anonymous said separation is now a matter of time and of  who will bear the responsibility before history and the Yemeni  people.    The sources said: The two poles of government, the GPC and  the YSP, are accusing each other not only of escalating the  crisis but of actually preparing for military confrontation if  separation intentions come true.    The sources said that before inaugurating the Hadhramaut oil  project, the YSP raised the cost of the project by $300 million  without the Council of Ministers or the Presidential Council  knowing about it. The additional money, according to the  sources, was used to buy weapons and ammunition in preparation  for the possible confrontation. For its part, the YSP accused  the GPC of buying some $20 million worth of weapons and  ammunition from Romania without the knowledge of the prime  minister, who belongs to the YSP.</p>

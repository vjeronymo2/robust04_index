			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Higher rates continue to hit US home sales Sales of existing homes in the US fell by 0.3 per cent in July from June, the third consecutive monthly decrease, as demand for housing continued to be squeezed by rising interest rates, the National Association of Realtors announced yesterday, writes James Harding in Washington. The drop in sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95m units follows a 3.6 per cent decrease in June and a 0.3 per cent fall in May. Sales of previously owned homes have fallen in five of the seven months since January as demand has been hurt by rising interest rates on mortgages, triggered by rate increases from the Federal Reserve which has been tightening credit to hold down inflation. Although the resales rate was down in July from June, it was up 2.6 per cent on the same period a year earlier. Mr Robert Elrod, president of the National Association of Realtors, said he was encouraged that existing home sales were higher than last year even though mortgage rates had risen. 'Apparently consumers realise that purchasing a home is still a sound investment,' he said. At the current rate, existing home sales this year would be the second highest on record, despite fluctuations in mortgage rates, he added. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported the average commitment rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 8.62 per cent in July, up from 8.43 per cent in June. The national median price for an existing single-family home was Dollars 111,500 (Pounds 71,935) in July, down 1.2 per cent from the June figure of Dollars 112,800.</p>

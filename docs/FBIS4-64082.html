			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- First Vice-Premier Oleg  Soskovets opened a regular session of the Russian Government  today, criticising Russian ministers for inadequate activities  in bringing home to the people the importance of Russian  president's decrees on boosting economic reform. Soskovets  described the government' activities in this field as "obviously  insufficient."    A package of documents on the reform of state-run  enterprises, strengthening taxation policies, streamlining  payments and abolishing export quotas and licenses was prepared  by the Russian Government and signed by the president on May 23.    "Despite an avalanche of comments on the latest presidential  decrees, the Russian ministers's voice is almost inaudible,"  Soskovets said. "It is the cabinet which should be the first to  analyse laws which the ministers will have to comply with, bring  them home to the people and make their forecasts," Soskovets  said.    On his initiative the government adopted a resolution to  establish control over the implementation of the president's  decrees on stepping up the economic reform. Under the  resolution, heads of federal and regional executive bodies were  instructed to hold conferences and seminars to discuss recent  presidential decrees, inviting managers of enterprises to attend.</p>

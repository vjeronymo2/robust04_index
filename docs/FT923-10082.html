			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Associates boost for Lex A SHARP increase in the share of profits from associates and a Pounds 6.6m fall in interest payable to Pounds 3.6m helped Lex Service, the motor group, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 16m in the six months to June 28. The half-year was one of change for the group. In March, Lex lost the UK import concession for Volvo cars, an important source of its profits for years. Volvo assumed direct control and paid Lex Pounds 73.5m compensation which constituted the bulk of Lex's Pounds 79.6m extraordinary gains in the latest res-ults. The money accrued, along with the profits on the sale of Lex Electronics Europe, enabled Lex to reduce its borrowings from Pounds 57m to Pounds 19m; to increase shareholders' funds to Pounds 244.6m (Pounds 203.8m); to buy in May Swan National Motor Group, then a wholly owned subsidiary of the TSB banking group, in a deal worth about Pounds 45m; and at the period-end to exercise its option to buy for about Pounds 5.7m the remaining 50 per cent it did not already own of Seltra, the Paris-based truck contract hire company. The share of profits from associates at Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 900,000) outstripped Lex's own operating profits at Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 13.5m). The company said that this would change once the period of transition was past. Arrow Electronics of the US, to which Lex sold its North American electronics components businesses for 6.9m shares, or 34 per cent of its equity, in September 1991, contributed Pounds 4.6m to Lex's associates' total. Lex was selling its stake 'in a controlled way'. It has already made Pounds 1.5m, taken as an extraordinary profit. The proceeds of the Arrow disposal, the company said, would be reinvested in Lex's core distribution and leasing sides. Some Pounds 4.7m of the associates' contribution came from the car and truck leasing companies, jointly owned with Lombard North Central, with cars chipping in profits of Pounds 3m (losses Pounds 900,000). Turnover from continuing businesses rose Pounds 3m to Pounds 324m giving trading profits of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.5m). Trading profits from discontinued activities were Pounds 7m (Pounds 13m). The company said that 'there were the weakest signs of recovery' in the new car market. Thanks to the one month of sales from Swan National, Lex lifted its market share, selling 14,000 cars. Operating profits in Lex Retail were Pounds 5.5m, 'slightly higher than' last time. Earnings grew to 10.5p (1.5p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 4p. See Lex</p>

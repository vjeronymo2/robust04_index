			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / ECGD adds Pounds 496m to bad debt provision BRITAIN'S Export Credits Guarantee Department has made fresh provisions against possible bad debt - mainly in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia  -amounting to Pounds 496m. The ECGD provisions, disclosed yesterday with the agency's annual report for the year ending March 31 last year, lift total provisions against sovereign debt in 1990-91 to Pounds 7.6bn. The former Soviet republics were 'off cover' for most of last year and remain so. Only yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, agreed in a meeting with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, that the UK would make available Pounds 280m in new export credits for Russia and the other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The provisions are sharply lower than in 1989-90, when a once-off charge of Pounds 3.37bn was made as the agency adjusted to the introduction of a controversial method of gauging its lending risks. Notional borrowings at the financial year-end from the Consolidated Fund - a discipline imposed by the Treasury - rose to Pounds 3.1bn from Pounds 2.39bn a year earlier. The ECGD remains coy on the exact levels of exposure to Yugoslavia and the former Soviet bloc, saying only that it is in the region of Pounds 1bn. That is small by comparison with Germany's export credit agency, which has exposure in excess of DM29bn (Pounds 10bn) to the former Soviet republics alone. While acknowledgement of the provisions will arouse critics who argue that taxpayers should not be asked to fund dubious export business, the comparatively limited exposure will be seen as a vindication of the ECGD's recent adoption of the portfolio management system, aimed at making a more rigorous assessment of the level of risk involved in providing credit cover to different countries. Exporters have protested at the system, introduced in May, because it has raised the cost of obtaining export credit insurance and put them at a competitive disadvantage to foreign competitors. Mr Brian Willott, chief executive of the ECGD since the start of this year, admitted yesterday that for Britain's top 20 export markets, ECGD insurance costs were between a third and two thirds more expensive than in France, Italy, Germany or the US. He said progress had been made in pressing foreign export credit agencies to raise rates closer to those of the ECGD. He pointed to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study due for completion in April which will 'reveal the facts' on losses other countries face as a result of adopting a laxer approach to the provision of export credit cover. The annual report showed that gross premiums amounted to Pounds 180m, down from Pounds 188m in the previous year. Claims paid rose to Pounds 968m, from Pounds 913m, leaving a trading deficit of Pounds 646m (previous deficit Pounds 3.13bn). Total business insured rose to Pounds 16.8bn from Pounds 15.7bn.</p>

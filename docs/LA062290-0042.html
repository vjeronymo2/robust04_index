			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Public Invests in "Bernadette': A musical about Bernadette of Lourdes, the  French girl who saw a vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858, opened in London's  West End Thursday, financed in part by investments from the public. Producer  William Fonfe says he appealed to the public after wealthy investors refused to  back "Bernadette" upon learning it was written and produced by unknowns. He  said his production company had received about $1 million from the public, and  he raised the rest for the $2-million production himself by re-mortgaging his  home, among other measures.

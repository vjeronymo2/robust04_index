			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA MAY LET FANG LIZHI LEAVE FOR AUSTRALIA SOON  </P> <P> China will allow dissident Fang Lizhi to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing  where he has been since June and travel to Australia before the end of this  month, a Hong Kong magazine said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Both the American and Australian consulates in Hong Kong declined to comment on  the report.  </P> <P> The magazine Pai Shing, without revealing its sources, said a preliminary  understanding was reached during a visit to Beijing in December by U.S.  National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. It was later approved by senior  Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> Fang, a scientist and one of China's leading dissidents, sought asylum with his  wife in the U.S. Embassy shortly after troops crushed pro-democracy protests in  Beijing on June 4.  </P> <P> Their presence in the embassy is hindering improvement in relations between the  United States and China.  </P> <P> Pai Shing, usually well-informed on Chinese affairs, said Fang is likely to  leave Beijing after Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke's visit to China in  mid-January and before the lunar new year Jan. 27.  </P> <P> In Washington, China's ambassador to the United States did not deny the report  of an impending deal on Fang.  </P> <P> "I can't say anything about that," Zhu Qichen told reporters after meeting  Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmit at the State Department. Asked  specifically if he would deny that a deal on Fang was in the works, Zhu  repeated the same reply.  </P> <P> The State Department also refused to discuss the subject.  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: BLB is 21 - Legal Briefs Congratulations to the FT's Business Law Brief, entering its 21st year of publication today. It is still edited by Dr A H Hermann, the FT's former legal correspondent, who started it in 1972 as the FT European Law Letter and maintains its robust criticisms of the shortcomings of the machinery of justice. In the January issue, a judge of the German Federal Supreme Court surveys the expanded jurisdiction of the court after unification and the Clinton administration's likely law policy is examined.

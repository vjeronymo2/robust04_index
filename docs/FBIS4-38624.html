			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Delhi, 31 May -- Russia will soon be delivering the  first batch of MiG-29M fighter-bombers to the Indian Air Force,  under a contract providing for the sale to India of 30 of these  aircraft, in addition to six MiG-29ChB combat training aircraft  worth a total of 25 billion rupees (about $780,000,000).  Informed high-ranking Indian sources announced this today,  saying that the MiGs would start arriving this summer and would  substantially enhance the combat capability of the Indian Air  Force, because "they can effectively intercept and inflict  strikes on ground targets deep within enemy territory."    Sergey Anishchenko, Delhi representative of the Russian Arms  State Company [Rosvooruzheniye], confirmed to the ITAR-TASS  correspondent that Russia has indeed sent an offer to the Indian  side on supplying the MiGs, 10 of them for state credit and 20  for commercial credit. Moscow has had no official response yet,  however, and Sergey Anishchenko therefore described the delivery  dates as "too optimistic." Sergey Anishchenko nonetheless  voiced the hope that there might be some reaction in the next  few days, given Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's official  visit to Russia scheduled for the end of June.    Russo-Indian military cooperation has clearly been moving  into higher gear over recent months, after several years of  decline. In mid-May the Indian Defense Ministry announced that  in fierce competition with British, French, and Israeli  companies the Mikoyan MiG aviation research and production  complex had won a tender to reequip more than 100 MiG-21 BIS  aircraft which make up the backbone of the Indian air force.  Viktor Samoylov, general director of Rosvooruzheniye, recently  signed a series of agreements here relating to building missile  patrol boats and frigates at the Goa and Bombay shipyards.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Personal Equity Plans (19): 'Tax-free' isn't always as good as it sounds - Charges / But new structures can benefit those who are able to invest a large sum for the long term Correction (Published 30th January 1993) appended to this article. EVER SINCE personal equity plans were introduced in 1987, charges have proved a booby-trap for the unwary investor. All too often, charges can outweigh the tax advantages of a Pep, especially for the basic-rate payer. But the industry has woken up to the problem this year. A range of new charging structures have been introduced, with most designed to reward long-term investors or those who can make the maximum annual contribution of Pounds 6,000. And a few managers have pared charges to the bone, in a manner which should reward all investors. The problem for most Pep investors is that the 'tax-free' label is less promising than it sounds. Very few people pay capital gains tax - only 100,000 in 1991. So the income tax exemption is the important factor for most investors. However, the dividend yield on many Peps may well be only 4 to 5 per cent, so that a basic-rate taxpayer will only save 1 per cent in tax. If the Pep manager imposes an initial charge of 5 per cent, then it will be around five years before the investor reclaims the charges in tax savings. And on some plans, the combination of low yields and additional charges may push the break-even point out to decades away. This can be particularly true on some managed Peps, where charges tend to be higher. What altered the calculations was the chancellor's decision, in the 1992 Budget, to allow all EC-based unit and investment trusts to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep limit. That created a battle to seize the biggest slice of the potentially lucrative market. Investors were starting to notice the impact of charges, in any case. Some advisers were recommending clients to get the full benefit of a Pep by adding the charges to their Pounds 6,000 investment. Clients were accordingly writing out a cheque for Pounds 6,400 or so - which made the charges much more noticeable than the traditional system of 'hiding' the costs within the bid-offer spread. So, to meet the new 'value-for-money' era, a range of charging systems is now in place: Exit fees: Under this system, the manager reduces the initial charge but imposes a fee (on a sliding scale) for those who want to sell their investments in the early years. The trend was started by Fidelity, which cut its initial Pep charge from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent, while imposing an exit fee of 3 per cent in the first year, declining steadily to zero after three years. Scottish Amicable replaced its 5 per cent initial charge with a flat fee of Pounds 45 plus VAT, and imposed withdrawal charges for those who sell in the first five years. It seems a good idea to design Peps to encourage long-term holders, because that is the essence of equity investment. But investors need to watch the impact of all charges. For example, Scottish Amicable imposed an annual Pep fee of 0.875 per cent on top of its annual management fee; and, over a long period, a high annual charge will outweigh the benefit of a lower initial charge. Flat fees: Managers do face administrative costs in setting up a Pep, but those costs are the same, whether the investor's contributions are large or small. A flat initial fee can help the management group to recoup its costs while at the same time rewarding those who invest the maximum amount. Take Martin Currie's flat-fee Pep, based on four of its investment trusts. The plan has an initial fee of Pounds 50 plus annual membership of Pounds 60. To someone investing Pounds 2,000 (the minimum allowed by Martin Currie), those fees would represent a charge of 5.5 per cent in the first year and 3 per cent in subsequent years, more than enough to wipe out any tax benefits. However, those investing the full Pounds 6,000 would pay only 1.83 per cent in the first year, and 1 per cent in subsequent years - and would very quickly earn back the fees in tax benefits. Low-load and no-load Peps. Some managers have decided to cut initial charges drastically, or eliminate them altogether. Murray Johnstone has an initial charge of just 1 per cent on its unit trust Pep (which includes the charge on the trust itself), compared with the 5 to 6 per cent charged by most unit trusts. Gartmore's UK index fund, which tracks the FT-A All-Share Index, has no initial charge and a 0.5 per cent annual charge. The fund is available in Pep form through broker WI Carr for an initial fee of Pounds 30 plus VAT, around 0.6 per cent for a full Pounds 6,000 investment. Cutting the initial charge does not, alas, eliminate the bid-offer spread. It still costs money for the manager to buy and sell the underlying shares, and those expenses are passed on to the investor. One way of looking at this is to work out the immediate realisable value of your Pep: what you would get back if you sold your investment immediately. On the Murray Johnstone Pep, the immediate realisable value is between 95 and 98 per cent; on other Peps, it could be as low as 92 per cent. It is unlikely that the whole of the Pep industry will change to the new charging structures. The old system of front-end charging enables fund management groups to reward financial advisers for selling the products. Some fund managers are still trying to pay commission, using the new charging systems, but it is more difficult, and possibly makes the entire exercise unprofitable. Although there are many good advisers, who will recommend a Pep regardless of whether there is a commission available - or who charge a fee - the absence of commission will inevitably limit sales prospects. In any case, some fund management groups adhere firmly to the line that performance matters far more than charges over the long term. They are right, of course. The problem is that future performance is, by definition, unknown, whereas charges are easily measured. By choosing a low-charging Pep, the investor is tilting the odds in his or her favour. CORRECTION THE END OF the tax year often leads to special offers from financial groups. Scottish Equitable* is offering to waive its fixed administration fee (Pounds 45 plus VAT) for those who buy its Premium personal equity plan between February 1 and April 30. The Premium Pep is linked to six unit trusts. There is no initial charge on these, which means investors buy units at the 'creation' price, which is well below the offer price. There is still a bid-offer spread of around 1 per cent, but this reflects Scottish Equitable's costs in buying and selling the shares the trusts own. Scottish Equitable does, however, impose an annual Pep charge of 0.875 per cent (plus VAT) on top of the normal yearly unit trust management charge of 1 per cent or so. And those who want to sell their Pep holdings will face exit charges within the first five years. Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is also offering a 2 per cent discount on Pep investments into its range of nine unit trusts for those who apply by March 26. *On p19 of the Quarterly Review, published today, I attribute this plan incorrectly to Scottish Amicable.

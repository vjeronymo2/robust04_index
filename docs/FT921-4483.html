			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Trade News: French bus maker near finalising joint venture with Czech group RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the French state-owned bus and truck maker, is near finalising a joint venture with Karosa, a Czechoslovakian company that makes buses and fire engines, William Dawkins reports from Paris. The two have signed a letter of intent for what will be RVI's most significant eastern European investment. The deal is expected to be completed by May. It is part of a push by RVI into east Europe, coming after two defeats against German competitors for alliances in Czechoslovakia. RVI lost to Germany's Mercedes-Benz in January in a battle for a partnership with Avia, the Czechoslovak truck maker. RVI's car-making parent, Renault, a year earlier had tried to get control of Skoda, but lost to Volkswagen of Germany. RVI and Karosa have been talking since December. RVI would take at least a 31 per cent stake in Karosa, in line with the Mercedes-Benz investment in Avia, for a sum to be settled. RVI would modernise Karosa's plant at Vysoke Myto, eastern Bohemia, adapting its production lines to make RVI trucks of 9-15 tonnes. Karosa's output of 1,500 vehicles a year compares with its 4,000-vehicle capacity.</p>

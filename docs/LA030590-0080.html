			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA CHEERED IN ZIMBABWE; AIDES CITE PACE, CUT HIS SCHEDULE  </P> <P> Black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela flew to Zimbabwe on Sunday on the  second leg of a foreign tour, but aides concerned about his ability to maintain  the grueling pace scaled back his schedule.  </P> <P> Mandela received a red-carpet welcome from President Robert Mugabe, who hugged  the recently freed prisoner as he stepped off a Zambian Airways flight from  Lusaka.  </P> <P> Mugabe then led him through a reception line that took nearly an hour to  traverse.  </P> <P> With a slow wave of his arm, Mandela, 71, silenced a cheering crowd of more  than 3,000 well-wishers who turned out to greet him. He then delivered a  15-minute address.  </P> <P> The black nationalist has yet to enjoy a day off since his Feb. 11 release from  27 years of imprisonment. He kept up a grueling schedule during his five days  in Lusaka.  </P> <P> From Harare, Mandela is scheduled to fly to Tanzania to visit ANC military  training bases. Although no official changes have been announced, it appears  that Mandela will then return to South Africa, cutting short his 17-day journey  and delaying a visit with ailing ANC President Oliver Tambo in a Stockholm  clinic.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Elder Interiano] </F>   [Text] Hector Rosada, coordinator of the Guatemalan  Government peace commission, said yesterday the government and  the guerrillas for the second time have failed to reach  agreement on the issue of uprooted Guatemalans, although the  foundation of a subsequent agreement was laid. This is why a  third meeting will be held next week in Mexico, he added.    The government official was in Puebla, Mexico, on 1 and 2  June heading the official delegation that held a "small meeting"  with the commanders of the insurgent Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity (URNG), because during the first round of  talks they failed to reach a consensus. On that occasion,  Rosada maintained the negotiations were not broken.    A CERIGUA news agency report points out the differences of  opinions and the difficulties in reaching a consensus after the  government delegation rejected the proposal by the Civilian  Society Assembly (ASC) were the reasons why the negotiations  failed. The Ramiro De Leon Carpio government rejected the  report and accused CERIGUA of attributing statements to the URNG  commanders, thus justifying its position that the URNG is  "politicizing" the human rights issue.    Rosada said yesterday there were positive results on a  possible agreement in the meeting with the URNG, but they agreed  to meet next week in Mexico to sign a document on the uprooted  people, a controversial issue at the negotiations. He pointed  out that during the meeting there was an exchange of opinions  within a framework of mutual "respect and resolve," which the  insurgent commanders recognized.    Although Rosada refused to give details of the issues  discussed during these conversations, he stressed that the  cease-fire in the area of Ixcan, Quiche Department, was indeed  discussed. This step constitutes a preliminary action in light  of the complete disarmament in December 1994, the rejoining of  political life by the guerrillas as a peace agreement is being  signed, and the ASC human rights proposal.    The official recalled that any decision made during the  meeting does not mean the irrefutable signing of an agreement,  because this signing will take place in Oslo, Norway, as the  discussions to find out the truth begin. Rosada added that  should we fail to reach an agreement on the uprooted people,  "the government commission would be unwilling to recognize other  proposals."</p>

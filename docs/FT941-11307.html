			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan looks for US help to open markets The arrival of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, in Tokyo this week may have put Japan's trade and finance ministry bureaucrats on the defensive, but some in the Japanese administration are counting on US pressure to open the country's financial markets. After many unsuccessful years trying to persuade Japan's ministry of finance to deregulate its tightly guarded public pension fund management, the ministry of health and welfare - which holds jurisdiction over the state pension system - believes that only foreign pressure can do the job. US pressure forced the partial liberalisation of fund management, corporate pension and mutual aid associations in 1990, allowing foreign investment managers into the market. The welfare ministry also wants better returns on the state pension investments, currently restricted to life assurers and trust banks. For many European and US fund management companies, which have failed to gain access to such funds due to the tight relationships between Japanese corporations and fund managers, winning public fund management contracts is the only way they can justify maintaining operations in Japan. Investment of state pension fund reserves totalling an outstanding Y100,000bn (Dollars 925bn) is controlled by the finance ministry, with the bulk funnelled into low interest loans for public works. Of the remainder, Y20,000bn is invested by the Welfare Service Public Corporation (Nenpuku), run by the health ministry - but rigid rules still govern how the organisation invests in the financial markets. The health and welfare ministry also wants to alter legislation limiting the state pension fund investment during the current parliamentary session. Another big concern is the large amounts allocated to one manager by Nenpuku. The organisation is only allowed to allocate funds to 14 life assurers and 15 trust banks, with one institution managing as much as Y2,000bn. Deregulation of the pension fund market is on the agenda for the bilateral trade talks between Japan and the US, with the deadline set for July. However, the Japanese welfare ministry is trying to convince bureaucrats at the finance ministry to open state pension fund investments during budget negotiations this month. Laws governing the state pension system are reviewed only once in four years, and government officials say changes on the system and investments must be made together by April.</p>

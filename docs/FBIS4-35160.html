			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 29 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Some 20 former contras  occupied the offices of the Nicaraguan Institute for Agrarian  Reform (INRA) in the city of Chinandega today, Wednesday, to  support similar actions staged in Managua by two other former  anti-Sandinist rebels.    One of the occupiers, who identified himself as "Commander  Piloto," read a communique on a Managua radio station to  announce that the peaceful occupation is part of the actions  being carried out by fomrer contras to demand that the  government fulfill the obligations in 1990 demobilization  agreements.    "We are demanding that we be given land, credits for  productive programs, housing, and security for our lives," the  leader of the occupiers stated.    The occupation of the INRA building in Chinandega, 120 km  west of Managua, is "in support of other brothers who maintain  their demands" in Managua, stated the leader of the group. The  group consists of 20 people, including men and women.    Since Tuesday, a group of former contras have occupied the  headquarters of the International Commission of Support and  Verification (CIAV-OAS). Six other former members of the  Nicaraguan Resistance are occupying the Colombian Embassy, where  they have requested asylum.    Nicaraguan authorities said today that they will not  negotiate with the former contras. Authorities consider these  acts of protest dangerous for the country's stability.</p>

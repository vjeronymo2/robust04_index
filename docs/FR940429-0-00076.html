Typically under this standard, an agency should require the institution or program to document and assess the educational achievement of students in verifiable and consistent ways, such as student grades, grade point averages, theses or portfolios, the results of admissions tests for graduate or professional school or other standardized tests, transfer rates to institutions offering higher level programs, job placement rates, completion rates, results of licensing examinations, evaluations by employers, follow-up studies of alumni, and other recognized measures of educational outcomes. The agency should also typically require the institution or program to use effectively the information obtained in this manner to improve student achievement with respect to the degrees or certificates offered. Finally, the agency should typically monitor in a systematic way the institution's or program's performance with respect to student achievement, including, as appropriate, completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing examinations, or other appropriate measures of occupational competency, to determine if performance is consistent with both the institution's or program's mission and objectives and any measures the agency may have for institutions' or programs' performance with respect to student achievement. For programs that provide vocational education, agencies should establish quantitative standards for completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(14) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the Act, based on the most recent data provided by the Secretary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's default rates in relation to the institution's overall ability to meet the agency's standards. Typically, an agency might evaluate an institution to determine whether the institution is out of compliance with its accrediting standards if the institution's latest cohort default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students program equals or exceeds 25 percent or if it has increased significantly in relation to its rate the previous year. Under this standard, an agency is not expected to do the work of the Federal government with respect to institutional default rates. Rather, the agency is expected to review the default rate information provided by the Secretary, determine if that information calls into question the institution's compliance with agency standards, and take follow-up action as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's or program's record of student complaints received by or made available to the agency. Under this standard, the agency should typically review student complaints that relate to the agency's standards and take appropriate follow-up action with regard to those complaints. If necessary, the agency would refer complainants to appropriate Federal, State, and other agencies if the complaints do not relate to the agency's standards. Finally, it would require institutions or programs to make available to students the agency's mailing address or telephone number for complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(11) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance with the institution's program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities in relation to the institution's overall ability to meet the agency's standards. The agency's assessment under this standard is based on program reviews, financial and compliance audits, audited financial statements, and any other information that the Secretary provides. Under this standard, the agency is not expected to do the work of the Federal government in reviewing institutions for compliance with their Title IV, HEA program responsibilities. Rather, the agency is expected to review the information provided by the Secretary, determine if that information calls into question the institution's compliance with agency standards, and take follow-up action as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the concern raised by one commenter about the need for quantitatively validated standards, the Secretary notes that &sect;602.23(b)(5) requires agencies to have in place a program for the systematic evaluation of the validity and reliability of its standards. In light of the Secretary's decision to eliminate all but the statutory language for the required standards, this ``validity and reliability'' provision takes on added importance, as described in the discussion of the changes to &sect;602.23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tough conditions in US behind decline at Ocean Ocean Group, the freight, environmental and marine services group, blamed among other problems the difficult trading conditions in North America for its international airfreight and logistics business for a decline in first half profits. The group, which also announced yesterday that Mr John Allan, a marketing executive and main board director of BET, will become chief executive at the end of this month, said pre-tax profits slipped by 5.3 per cent to Pounds 19.7m in the six months to June 30 from Pounds 20.8m in the 1993 first half. Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 497m (Pounds 444m). Earnings dipped from 9.4p to 9p per share, but the interim dividend is held at 4.71p. The shares closed 2p lower at 268p after Mr Peter Marshall, chairman, warned that the outlook for the year 'remains uncertain with our businesses operating in highly competitive markets.' Operating profits fell to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 24.4m) with MSAS, the airfreight business, reporting a decline in profits to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.6m) despite higher aircraft revenues. Mr Marshall said that airlines had taken the opportunity of a firmer market to increase rates, which tended to depress the profitability of MSAS in the short term. The main shortfall was in North America, where customs brokerage performed poorly, but the group said the benefits of a restructuring in April, aimed at saving Pounds 2m in a full year, were already becoming apparent. McGregor Cory, the group's contract distribution business, also saw profits fall although the UK operations performed well. Cory Environmental lifted its profits contribution by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.1m, although the market for industrial waste treatment remained unfavourable. NET, the US environmental testing business, incurred a Pounds 1.2m loss against a Pounds 200,000 profit in the 1993 first half. Once again the results were underpinned by an improved performance in the Marine operations, which reported profits of Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 14.6m). OIL, the group's offshore supply business, had a good first half and pursued opportunities in the important south-east Asia region. however, Mr Marshall noted that political and economic uncertainties remained in West Africa. COMMENT Mr Allan faces a tough challenge re-shaping Ocean's rag-bag of businesses and boosting the group's financial performance, which continues to disappoint. In the meantime the company is leaning heavily on its marine businesses, which include the uncertain West African offshore supply operations. With uninspiring pre-tax profits of about Pounds 43.5m and earnings of about 20p a share expected this year, the shares continue to be supported by their 5 1/3 per cent yield.</p>

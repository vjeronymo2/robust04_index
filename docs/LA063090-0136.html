			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOOTHILL GROUP BACKS N. TUSTIN CITY PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The Foothill Communities Assn. board voted this week to support cityhood for  the region, possibly as early as next year, said Bill Weber, the group's  president.  </P> <P> The association will encourage the formation of a group to bring the issue to a  vote in 1991, Weber said.  </P> <P> A survey taken at a town hall meeting showed general support for North Tustin  becoming a city, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in response to county supervisors' decision to disband the North  Tustin Municipal Advisory Council, the Communities Assn. is expanding the scope  and size of its land-use panel -- at least until the county replaces the  council with another body.  </P> <P> Five of the seven former members of the council are members of the land-use  panel. The committee will meet on the second Monday of each month at 7:30 p.m.  at Pomona First Federal Savings and Loan Assn., 17851 17th St.  </P></p>

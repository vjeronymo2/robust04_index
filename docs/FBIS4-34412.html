			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Rafael Caldera has said that the most  prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading rumors. He added  that this, however, is countered by reality because our  democratic system is firm and stable. Caldera made this  statement during a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime  Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva at the Yellow House. Caldera  recalled that recently rumors persistently circulated in the  country about his presumed death, which had to stop when all  Venezuelans confirmed that he was totally active.    [Begin Caldera recording] I am convinced that the democratic  system in my country is a firm and stable reality, and will be  maintained despite all the rumors unleashed by those who are  interested in creating situations of violence and instability,  taking advantage of the grave circumstances of an economic  crisis. We are all aware of the seriousness of this crisis and  we know that we must make great efforts to overcome it. [end  recording]    Caldera attributed the fall of the bolivar to the wave of  rumors, which in turn has increased inflation.    [Begin Caldera recording] We are fighting against inflation,  but rumors are the main cause for its increase. We are facing a  situation of shortages and price fluctuations in which  speculators take advantage of any factor or announcement that  the inflation rate is up to increase prices to unacceptable  levels. We will handle this problem with courage and  determination. [end recording]    President Caldera said that despite the crisis in the  financial system, the fact that foreign investors are still  interested in investing in our country is proof that Venezuela  will be able to overcome this crisis and reactivate its economy.    Meanwhile, Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said that  his country is willing to assist Venezuela under the current  circumstances and to strengthen commercial ties between both  countries.</p>

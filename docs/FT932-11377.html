			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Fazio to head Bank of Italy: Appointment breaks tradition THE governing board of the Bank of Italy yesterday broke with tradition by naming Mr Antonio Fazio, the deputy director-general, to take over as governor from Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who last Monday agreed to become prime minister. The prestigious post to head the central bank, with authority to act independently, has been assumed throughout the post-war era by the director-general. However, Mr Lamberto Dini, aged 62, director-general since 1979, has been passed over in favour of the 56-year-old Mr Fazio, number three in the bank's hierarchy. Mr Dini will continue in his present role at least until the new bank's four-man directorate is made known, probably before the governor's annual statement on May 31. Authorities might well seek a prestigious international posting for Mr Dini, who in 1986 was considered as a possible successor to Mr Jacques de Larosiere to head the IMF. The choice of Mr Fazio, the bank's most outstanding economist, was welcomed by most political parties. His appointment must be approved by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the cabinet. However, Mr Ciampi had a clear hand in his successor's appointment and the former governor is understood to have co-ordinated closely with the president on the matter. Although Mr Ciampi has long worked closely with Mr Dini, their approach has never been in complete harmony. By pressing to have a successor chosen so quickly, Mr Ciampi has signalled that he has no intention of merely keeping the governor's seat warm while he heads a brief transitional government. Instead this non-parliamentarian called on to be prime minister has shown he intends to make a clear division between this role and an independent Bank of Italy. The 72-year-old former governor had held the post since 1979 and had made it known he was anxious to retire. He even offered to resign last September during the currency crisis. Moves by Mr Giuliano Amato, the former prime minister, to find a replacement were blocked by the Christian Democrats who feared Mr Dini was being passed by. Mr Fazio, a devout catholic, studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under such illustrious figures as Modigliani and Samuelson. Considered a moderate Keynesian, his career has been inside the bank since 1963. He was responsible for drawing up the bank's first econometric model and is a strong intellectual force within the bank. Year of opportunity, Page 16 Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: A Brutus of the billiard-table business - Theatre A FINE new play at the Hampstead Theatre is about a father wilfully underating his sons and his sons wanting to hurt their father. It is so well-written that it can steer its audience from a zipping, uproariously funny start, through a mid-ground where laughter is both appropriate and inappropriate, to the gradual, serious contemplation of a moral dilemma. All about a small family business with three generations, it stirs up the raw feelings that can only occur within a family. Jack and Gordon, two surviving sons of Mr Chapel, have been preparing for 20 years to push their father, now 75, into retirement. The third generation, Barry, David, and Tony, are in their 20s, and can already see that the company needs changes more radical than those Jack and Gordon would initiate. Chapel, meanwhile, is not going lightly. Father/son conflicts ignite all over the place. A Going Concern catches all the chatty comedy pertinent to men sharing a workroom, and it picks up that brisk comic tone at several points. The family company makes, and repairs, billiard tables. The play's author is Stephen Jeffreys, who recently adapted the RSC's staging of A Jovial Crew and whose own comedy Valued Friends was a success at the Hampstead Theatre in 1989 and 1990. A Going Concern is based on autobiographical material for him. Matthew Lloyd directs; and I have only praise for his cast, and for the way the play introduces them as simple sit-com types and then deepens them, one by one. Reece Dinsdale is Tony, who emerges as the young Brutus of this family coup d'etat; David Killick is his fierce father Gordon; David Horovich is Gordon's milder brother Jack; James Clyde their nephew Barry, devoted to 1960s pop music; Adam Godley is Jack's son David, an Eng. lit. student who occasionally works for the company (plainly closest to Jeffreys himself); Henry Stamper is the heartless old fox Chapel. Each one is a vivid agent in the drama; and each then stands back to comment in alarm on what occurs. (This even goes for the non-family member of the workforce, Ray, played by Shaun Prendergast.) Samantha Holland is Vicky, the new accountant who finds herself suddenly involved with the business officially and in private. It is she who has the play's best line ('Right now, there is one sixth of a melon dusted with cinnamon sitting in a fridge in Muswell Hill with your name on it') - funny because of both its timing and her deadpan delivery; and it is she who exposes the family's most serious secret treacheries. The play shines with old-fashioned virtues. Every role is interestingly three-dimensional; the fluctuation of comic and serious tone is perfectly judged; there is even a quotation ('days of wine and roses'), skilfully introduced and woven through the play. I am not sure, however, why he sets it in 1966 and makes it a period piece (references to Donovan, The Man from UNCLE, et al). Just as the play's rawer surfaces grow exciting, some new period detail distances it from us. And several long speeches are conceived slightly too much as great set pieces. The play stirs me, but I occasionally wish it were less neat. A Going Concern by Stephen Jeffreys at the Hampstead Theatre.</p>

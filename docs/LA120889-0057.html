			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> N. HOLLYWOOD PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL CLOSED;  </P> <P> VANDALISM: LOS ANGELES CITY OFFICIALS SAY BECK AVENUE WALKWAY WAS A HAVEN FOR  GANGS, GRAFFITI ARTISTS AND VANDALS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city officials Thursday closed another pedestrian tunnel in North  Hollywood that residents said had long been a haven for gangs, graffiti artists  and vandals.  </P> <P> The closure of the tunnel under the Ventura Freeway at Beck Avenue marks the  third time in 18 months that the city has boarded up a pedestrian tunnel in  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Two tunnels under the Hollywood Freeway at North Hollywood Park were closed in  June, 1988, because police said they had become hide-outs for drug dealers and  prostitutes.  </P> <P> Moreover, city officials in recent years have closed more than 30 of Los  Angeles' 221 pedestrian tunnels, which were built as a way to cross busy  streets and freeways.  </P> <P> "It's really a shame, but the tunnels are just being used for the wrong  purposes," said Mary Presby, a field deputy for Councilman John Ferraro, who  backed the closure of the Beck Avenue tunnel.  </P> <P> Seven tunnels remain open in North Hollywood, said Sam Matsumura, an engineer  in the city's Bureau of Engineering.  </P> <P> Workers early Thursday nailed plywood across the two entrances to the Beck  Avenue tunnel, which was dark, smelly and covered with graffiti.  </P> <P> Presby said Ferraro will ask the City Council to approve spending about $53,000  to close the tunnel permanently by filling it with sand and concrete.  </P> <P> Earlier this fall, about 120 residents of the single-family neighborhood north  of the Beck Avenue tunnel submitted a petition asking Ferraro to have the  tunnel boarded up because of vandalism, which they attributed to students from  nearby Walter Reed Junior High School.  </P> <P> In addition to painting graffiti on the tunnel's walls, residents said, vandals  had dumped trash cans, broken off car antennas and set brush fires.  </P> <P> "Even when I went to school at Reed more than 20 years ago, the tunnel had a  reputation as a tough place," said Larry LaFace, 40, the resident who collected  the petition's signatures. "Everybody is elated that it's closed."  </P> <P> Capt. Rick Dinse of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood  Division said authorities considered the tunnel a haven for student  troublemakers and gang members.  </P> <P> He said he supports its closure because he could not devote the manpower  necessary to adequately patrol it.  </P> <P> Robert Selsor, Reed assistant principal, said school officials back the closure  because "whenever we'd have fights, that's where they'd frequently occur."  </P></p>

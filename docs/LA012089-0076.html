			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Have you ever wondered what kinds of lighting the experts use in their homes?  Are you entirely clear about the distinctions between a Watt-Miser 120-Watt  Indoor Reflector Flood and a 3-Way Soft-White Reader Light? New York artist  collaborators Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler have cooked up an installation with  eight discs of sandblasted glass, each inscribed with the name of a man and a  room in a house, and each illuminated by a different type of General Electric  bulb. The men are supposedly real-life GE lighting specialists who use the  designated bulbs in one of the rooms of their homes.  </P> <P> Ericson and Ziegler make a practice of working with non-art materials and  finding unexpected sorts of things to analyze and pigeonhole. Their work  contains both a subversive intellectuality and a sly visual appeal.  </P> <P> Each bulb casts a distinctive pattern of light (a "distinctiveness" that is  really mass-produced, of course). Because the piece hangs in the gallery, the  viewer is likely to begin to analyze each bulb's light-emitting quality only to  realize that the aesthetic quality of the light is really bound up with the  utility of the object. (If you're buying a bulb for your bedroom, you're likely  to choose it because of the kind of light it throws.)  </P> <P> So here you are, holding the concept of "bedroom" or "kitchen" or "closet" in  your mind while trying to match it with the kinds of light thrown by various  bulbs. You're performing the same kind of mental gymnastics you're apt to do in  front of a conceptual piece of art (which this is) and simultaneously realizing  this is what you do in a utilitarian, daily-life context. Clever stuff, and  rather delicious at that. (Burnett Miller Gallery, 964 N. La Brea Ave., to Feb.  11.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

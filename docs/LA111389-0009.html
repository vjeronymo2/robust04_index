			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED ARMY CHORUS  </P> <P> I was fortunate enough to attend a performance of the Red Army Song &amp; Dance  Ensemble at the Shrine Auditorium. In spite of the pickets, I enjoyed the  entire presentation more than anything I have seen in ages.  </P> <P> Tremendous, to say the least!  </P> <P> Glasnost not to be excluded, however, I found it incredulous that the program  began with "The Star-Spangled Banner" and concluded with "God Bless America"  while slipping in a song in the middle titled "Do the Russians Want War?"  Attempted partially in English no less.  </P> <P> Who is trying to tell me what?  </P> <P> EUGENE POOLE  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / People: Royal Bank of Scotland Jeff Thornton, a high-flying Scottish civil servant, is leaving the Scottish Office to join Royal Bank of Scotland, where he is to set up a specialist group to assemble private finance for public sector projects. Thornton is currently head of industrial policy and technology at the Scottish Office. He has been private secretary to Malcolm Rifkind, formerly Scottish secretary, and head of the Scottish inward investment operation in the western US, successfully luring high-tech companies to Scotland. George Mathewson, the bank's chief executive, says the new unit is the first set up by a bank in response to the government's private finance initiative which aims to find private money for projects such as bridges, railways, sewage works and hospitals. Scotland, with a second Forth road bridge on the drawing board and plans to involve the private sector in the water and sewerage industry, is a key area. Thornton is yet another recruit to the Royal Bank who has previously worked with Mathewson at the now defunct Scottish Development Agency. He was assistant to Mathewson when the latter was the SDA's ceo in the 1980s. Others in this category are Iain Robertson, Mathewson's successor as the SDA's chief executive, who now runs the bank's corporate and institutional banking, and Frank Kirwan, director of retail banking services. Kirwan was previously head of strategy at the bank, and earlier at the SDA.</p>

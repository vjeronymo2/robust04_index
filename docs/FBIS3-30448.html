			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 2 (BTA) -- The three-day official  visit to Bulgaria by Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati ended this morning with the signing of a protocol on  cooperation and consultations between the Foreign Ministries of  Bulgaria and Iran and of a trade agreement. Having signed the  protocol, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and Dr.  Velayati expressed their satisfaction with the talks held in  Bulgaria which the head of Iranian diplomacy described as  constructive. "There are good signs about the future  development of Bulgarian-Iranian relations. They appear to have  entered upon a new stage," said Dr. Velayati. Yesterday he was  received by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.    Under the agreement on trade and economic cooperation  between  the Governments of Bulgaria and Iran signed by Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev and Iranian  Deputy Minister of Trade Hoseyn Noqrehkar Shirazi, the two  countries grant each other most favoured nation status. It is  agreed to settle payments in convertible currency, to use some  other forms established in trading and to set up a special joint  commission on the problems of trade. The two foreign ministers  said that the next session of the Joint Commission on Economic  Cooperation which is due early in April in Sofia would be a  major step forward in the development of relations between the  two countries.    "We hope the trade agreement will give an impetus to the  promotion of Bulgarian-Iranian economic relations which have  been on the decline over the last few years," Bulgarian Foreign  Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters after Dr. Velayati's  visit ended. In addition to the issues concerning bilateral  relations, Mr. Daskalov and Dr. Velayati discussed international  problems, the situation in the Balkans and the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It was a most useful exchange of opinions,"  Bulgaria's chief diplomat said. Answering a question if Dr.  Velayati had assumed a commitment to support Bulgaria's request  to the Islamic Conference Organization to take the issue of  Bulgarian Muslims off its agenda, Mr. Daskalov said that the  Iranian foreign minister was willing to do so. "Of course, this  does not depend on Iran only but on all other members of the  Islamic Conference Organization, however, Dr. Velayati hopes  this would be possible," Mr. Daskalov said.    According to the Bulgarian foreign minister, the incident,  in  which four Iranian citizens were shot dead last December while  resisting arrest and two Bulgarian policemen were killed, was  mentioned cursorily. "Both sides expressed their hope that the  case will soon be clarified. The investigation has not been  completed yet," Mr. Daskalov said.    Invited to comment on a Tehran press publication alleging  that Bulgaria has busted the embargo against ex-Yugoslavia and  asked if it had been discussed with Dr. Velayati, Mr. Stanislav  Daskalov stressed Bulgaria observes the embargo. "Indeed, there  are attempted violations, which is understandable for a country  neighbouring on the former Yugoslavia. But the issue was not  discussed," the head of Bulgarian diplomacy said.    Commenting on Iran's suggestion to build a transport route  across Caucasus, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov said that it had already  been discussed and that the two countries were ready to continue  the talks. "Building the route, however, would largely depend  on the situation in Georgia and Azerbaijan. The prerequisites  for such a route are good transport conditions and peace," Mr.  Daskalov said.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> VIRGINIAN-PILOT TO GO ALL-DAY  </P> <P> The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star will become an all-day newspaper in  September, published and delivered in both morning and afternoon under the name  of The Virginian-Pilot, the company announced today.  </P> <P> "At present, the same reporters write for both newspapers, and many of the  stories appear in both newspapers. Having one name on the masthead recognizes  that The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star are almost the same newspaper  today," said Frank Batten Jr., associate publisher of the newspapers.  </P> <P> Current subscribers to The Ledger-Star will receive the afternoon editions of  The Virginian-Pilot.  </P> <P> Batten said there will be no significant savings to the company. The change  will not affect the number of people the company employs, Batten said.  </P></p>

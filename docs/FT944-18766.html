			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport in the US: Three strikes, you're all out Last month, a glorious major league baseball season ended prematurely when a strike by players closed the game down after they failed to agree with the owners on how to divide the sport's billion-dollar revenues. Now, a similar dispute over revenue-sharing between ice hockey players and the management of the National Hockey League is about to lead to the postponement of this weekend's opening of the 1994-95 season. Barring a last-minute reprieve, the season that was supposed to cement ice hockey's position as the fastest-growing and most fashionable sport in America will be put on temporary hold. To lose one professional sport to a labour dispute may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness. But what if three were lost? There is a possibility - a slim one, admittedly - that the coming basketball season may be disrupted by the failure of the players and the league to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. The players' union and owners have already tangled in the courts over pay and other issues, and the dispute could yet culminate in a lockout. If the National Basketball Association season were interrupted before the year's end, the only professional team sport left would be American football. But even in the National Football League, all is not well. Both players and team bosses are struggling to come to terms with life under the NFL's new salary cap - the league-wide ceiling on team pay that the players' union and management accepted for the first time this year. In order to keep team pay within the cap, clubs have been forced to jettison veterans or cut their salaries dramatically, and put their faith in a larger-than-usual number of untested young players. This has made a lot of players and team managers unhappy. Many now wish they had never agreed to the salary cap. What is so frustrating for the fans, is that baseball, football, basketball and ice hockey are all extraordinarily successful sports. The players are paid hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars, the owners earn vast sums from television contracts, attendance and merchandising, and the individual franchises - the clubs - are each valued at anything between Dollars 50m and Dollars 200m. Yet, it is the very financial success of American sports that is at the root of the problems. The country's four biggest team sports have become huge cash-generating businesses. Exact figures on earnings are not available (primarily because the owners want to keep the players in the dark), but according to Financial World magazine, baseball last year generated annual revenues of approximately Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.07bn), football Dollars 1.5bn, basketball Dollars 1bn, and ice hockey Dollars 680m. These totals are considerably understated, because they do not include earnings from the sale of sports merchandise, which is controlled by the leagues. Clothing and hats bearing team logos and colours are so popular in America and overseas that revenues from merchandising range from Dollars 800m in ice hockey to Dollars 2.5bn in football. All of this would be great news for everyone, if only the players and owners could agree on how to share the booty. There is a single issue at the heart of the labour-management disputes in baseball, ice hockey, basketball and football: how best to divide the spoils. More specifically: although revenues in each sport have been rising steadily since the early 1980s, player salaries have been rising even faster, and the owners, who have fuelled the rise with their eagerness to pay ever increasing amounts to star players, want to put a stop to it. To limit the rise in salaries and keep more of the revenues for themselves, the owners in each sport have either imposed, or are seeking to impose, a salary cap on the teams. The players, naturally, do not like the idea of accepting a limit on what they earn. In those sports where a cap is demanded by the owners (baseball and ice hockey), the players refuse to accept it - hence the strike and the lockout. In those sports with a cap (football and basketball), the players want to get rid of it - hence all the unhappiness and potential unrest. There is another factor behind the dire labour relations in American sports: the changing natures of players and owners. Today's sports stars are different from the heroes of the past: they are much better-paid; they are less loyal to any one team; they are advised by a legion of agents, lawyers and accountants; and they are members of stronger unions. Players want their share of the spoils, and are willing to fight for it. The owners have changed greatly over the years, too. Today, they are likely to have fewer ties to the local community, be less respectful of tradition and more interested in making a profit. They are also less willing to share the revenues among each other for 'the good of the game', and more willing to stand up to the players. The result is more confrontation, and less compromise. Finding common ground between the two sides will not be easy. Some of the country's best minds have struggled with the issues that crippled the baseball season, but no one has come up with a remedy. The commissioner of ice hockey is a clever, level-headed lawyer, yet he is ready to close down the sport just when it is on the verge of winning over a new generation of fans. Instead the owners and players will direct their highly-developed competitive instincts to beating each other, even if they risk losing everything else in the process.</p>

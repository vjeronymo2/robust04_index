			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRUNSWIG PUTS CANYON IN PLUS COLUMN  </P> <P> Jeff Brunswig scored three touchdowns to lead Canyon High School to a 20-6  victory over Magnolia in a nonleague football game Friday at El Modena High  School.  </P> <P> Canyon (1-3) was led by Brunswig's 68 yards rushing.  </P> <P> Magnolia is also 1-3.  </P> <P> Canyon scored on its first possession. Brunswig culminated a 15-play, 67-yard  drive with a 15-yard touchdown run up the middle with 4:41 left in the first  quarter. The touchdown was set up by a pass interference penalty.  </P> <P> The penalty seemed ironic because the game had so little passing. Canyon  quarterback Darren Lish was two for three for 22 yards and Magnolia quarterback  Doug Isaacks was not allowed to throw until the second half when he completed  three of six for just 10 yards.  </P> <P> Brunswig's second touchdown came in the second quarter after Magnolia fumbled  the snap on its two-yard line. Brunswig took the ball on next play and dove for  the touchdown.  </P> <P> The next time Brunswig got his hands on the ball, he scored on a one-yard run  with 30 seconds left in the half.

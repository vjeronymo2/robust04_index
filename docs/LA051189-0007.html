			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN AND TAKEOVERS  </P> <P> My thanks to Robert A. Jones for clarifying the debate surrounding Michael  Milken and the ethics of corporate takeovers ("Feeding Frenzy in the Redwoods,"  Part I, April 25).  </P> <P> It's been hard to refute the appealing argument that junk bonds provide  entrepreneurs with the means to buy out ineffective companies, replace their  fossilized management, shed unproductive assets, etc.  </P> <P> But the experience of Pacific Lumber Co. shows that Milken's methods for  financing this activity do not result in a healthy renewal of the national  economic body. It is, rather, a form of cancer, an uncontrolled growth that too  often destroys healthy, sustainable, local economies. The result is not greater  productivity, but the simple transfer of wealth from local communities to  professional investors.  </P> <P> Milken isn't entirely to blame for this, but he deserves no sympathy from those  who care about the long-term future of this nation.  </P> <P> JOHN L. JOHNSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

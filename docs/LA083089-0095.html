			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES IN CLOSE RACE FOR PEPPER'S SEAT  </P> <P> A Republican hoping to become the first Cuban-American elected to Congress was  in a tight race Tuesday with a Brooklyn-born Democrat to fill the late Claude  Pepper's seat following an ethnically divisive campaign.  </P> <P> GOP state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen faced attorney Gerald Richman, in his first  run for elective office, in the election made necessary by Pepper's death May  30 at age 88. Pepper, a Democrat, had held the seat since its inception 27  years ago.  </P> <P> With 39 of 146 precincts reporting, Ros-Lehtinen had 8,716 votes, or 50.3%, to  Richman's 8,622 votes, or 49.7%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tense Race  </P> <P> Ethnic-bloc campaigning dominated the short, tense race between Ros-Lehtinen,  37, and Richman, 48, for the remaining 14 months of Pepper's term. Richman had  come under fire for declaring: "This is an American seat."  </P> <P> Elections officials predicted a turnout of about 43%, far higher than normal  for a special election.  </P> <P> Richman, who is Jewish, hoped to capitalize on the 30,000-plus edge that  Democrats, mostly blacks, Jews and retirees, hold in registration.  Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Havana, looked to the Latino community, which  makes up 40%-plus of the vote.  </P> <P> Polls in the final week of the race all indicated it was too close to call.  </P> <P> Turnout was heaviest Tuesday morning in Cuban-American precincts, where  Ros-Lehtinen was strongest. Central Little Havana voted at a projected 77.3%  clip.  </P> <P> By contrast, north Miami Beach condominium precincts, where Richman was said to  have the advantage, were projected to have a 46.3% turnout.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Controversial'  </P> <P> "It's been a very controversial election," Dade County Elections Supervisor  David Leahy said. "There has been a tremendous amount of media exposure, and we  think both camps are getting a lot more people out to vote."  </P> <P> The GOP hoped to add to its 10-8 majority in Florida's congressional  delegation, while the state Democratic Party tried to erase its recent image of  disunity and decline.  </P> <P> Ros-Lehtinen refused to appear with Richman during the campaign, charging his  "American seat" message was bigoted.  </P> <P> However, the same charges were made against her campaign over a  Spanish-language mailing that urged Latinos to show how American they were even  though they were not born in Brooklyn and did not speak English like Richman.  </P> <P> Richman said his "American seat" remark was an appeal to voters to decide on  qualifications, not birthplace. He said it was a response to GOP National  Chairman Lee Atwater's statement that the party wanted to elect a  Cuban-American.  </P> <P> Ros-Lehtinen, whose husband, Dexter Lehtinen, is U.S. attorney in Miami,  portrayed herself as tough on crime and drugs. But Richman argued that her  legislative record against gun control showed softness on crime, because it  allowed criminals easy access to guns.  </P></p>

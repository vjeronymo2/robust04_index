			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Foreign investment in China slows China's foreign investment surge appears to be slowing, after a year of hectic growth when the contracted value of new agreements exceeded the total invested during the 14 years of Beijing's market reforms. The state administration for industry and commerce (SAIC) said yesterday that the number of newly established foreign-funded enterprises was down by 43.6 per cent to 10,739 in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. There was also a 50 per cent drop in both newly pledged foreign investment and in funds used, the official China Daily reported. Detailed figures were not made available. Mr Hou Lin, head of the state office's register of new foreign-funded enterprises, attributed the marked slowdown in new ventures to changes in the tax law which reduced preferential treatment. In the past, thousands of joint ventures were established to enable the partners to import duty-free cars. This privilege was suspended last year. Other factors included tighter credit policies in China itself - aimed at calming an overheating economy - and competition for foreign investment from neighbouring Asian countries. China's gross national product in 1993 grew by 13 per cent. This compares with 12.8 per cent in 1992. The authorities are seeking to slow the economy to 9 per cent growth this year. While the number of new joint ventures decreased in the first quarter by about 50 per cent, numbers of wholly foreign-owned companies grew by 6 per cent. Foreign-contracted investment in China surged last year to 83,000 projects valued at Dollars 111bn (Pounds 74bn). Actual utilised investment reached Dollars 25.8bn, an increase of 134 per cent over the year before. The state administration reported that there were 167,000 foreign-funded businesses in China by the end of last year. Hong Kong accounts for about two-thirds of the investment, but a new trend involves the US, Japan and South Korea in a number of large projects.</p>

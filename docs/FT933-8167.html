			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ralston Purina Ralston Purina, the St Louis-based manufacturer of pet food, batteries and a variety of food products, announced late yesterday that it was considering spining off its cereal, baby foods and other smaller 'grocery human foods' businesses as a separately-quoted company, writes Nikki Tait. Ralston said that the potential demerger would be reviewed by directors at a board meeting to be held on September 23. Ralston is a sizeable force in the cereal market, where it is best-known for the 'Chex' brands, although it ranks behind industry heavyweights, such as Kellogg and General Mills. The St Louis group has also been heavily involved in the private label cereal business, a growing segment of the overall market, and is reckoned to be the dominant producer. Its baby-food products are marketed under the 'Beech-Nut' brand name. This industry has been highly competitive recently, and subject to a price war between rival manufacturers.</p>

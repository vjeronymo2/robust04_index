			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Nimbies winning battle for Berkshire: Builders are watching planning policy in a politically sensitive county The leafy county of Berkshire, home of Royal Ascot and Windsor Castle, this summer finds itself at the centre of yet another planning wrangle. The outcome may determine how government intends to respond to demands from housebuilders to be allowed to develop in politically sensitive shire counties. Prospects for builders seeking to expand output sharply in some of Britain's most valuable property markets do not appear bright judging by recent policy statements by the Department of the Environment. The 1991 Planning and Compensation Act, supported by planning guidance notes from the department, allows county and district councils much greater authority to determine local needs and plans. The department's strategy was to ease pressure on diminishing countryside by encouraging greater use of urban land. Importantly it reversed government policy of the 1970s and 1980s which had assumed a presumption in favour of housing development to meet the growing demand for homes in southern England. The pro-development attitude reached its peak during the mid-1980s when the then Nicholas Ridley, as environment secretary, seized on the acronym Nimby (not-in-my-backyard) to attack local residents for trying to prevent newcomers from living and working in their area. In July 1989 Mr Ridley approved the construction of a country town of 4,800 homes called Foxley Wood at Bramshill Forest, in north-east Hampshire. The proposal was made by Consortium Developments, a group of 10 of the country's largest housebuilders. Three months later this decision was reversed by a new environment secretary, Mr Chris Patten, now Hong Kong's governor. For many of the post-war years, the main measure used by successive governments of the effectiveness of their housing policy had simply been to calculate the number of homes built annually. Mr Patten signalled a marked shift in this strategy, announcing that the previous guidance to planners to presume in favour of housebuilding was being withdrawn. He added that it was up to local people, through councils rather than central government, 'to decide how and where their (housing) requirements should be met'. Within 18 months, Consortium Developments had been disbanded. The strength of government commitment to this new strategy has never been fully tested. The desire of housebuilders to acquire expensive sites in controversial areas fell sharply during the recession. Only now are ambitious development plans beginning to surface as the housing market recovers. Hence the importance attached by builders to the final draft of the Berkshire structure plan. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, recently emphasised his commitment to encouraging development in towns and cities. In a policy statement on transport planning he said he wanted to 'ensure the vitality of rural areas, so that people who live there do not become long-distance commuters'. He added: 'Housing development needs to be accessible to public transport so that there is an alternative to the car.' Berkshire in the 1980s was the subject of a series of bitter battles between housebuilders, planners, environmentalists and local residents. The latter often complained that they were in danger of being over-run by concrete. At the moment they appear to have the minister's ear.</p>

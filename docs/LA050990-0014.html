			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> ZONING PLAN OKD FOR INDUSTRIAL PARK  </P> <P> The Fillmore City Council on Tuesday night established a zoning plan for its  proposed industrial park, with heavy industry confined to the northernmost  section of the city and separated from the nearest housing by a buffer zone of  light industry.  </P> <P> Although there are differences in the two sections, neither would permit the  manufacture of soap, acetylene gas, plastics or pickles.  </P> <P> In addition, the light-industry zone at the south end of the park would  prohibit yards for construction equipment and businesses that rent heavy  equipment.  </P> <P> Business owners already operating in the industrial sector were assured at a  council meeting last month that they would not be forced to change or relocate  their businesses to comply with new regulations. In a few special cases,  boundaries may be adjusted to accommodate them, or the city will grant them an  exemption.  </P> <P> A vote on an assessment district, which would raise funds for basic  improvements to the proposed industrial park, is scheduled for late July.  Property owners must agree to tax themselves more than $5 million before  development can proceed. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Swiss ease property curbs The Swiss parliament has approved measures to make it easier for foreigners to buy and sell property in the country. Right-wing opponents have promised to try to force a referendum on the issue. They have 90 days to raise the required 50,000 signatures and their chances are considered good. Changes to the so-called Lex Friedrich would enlarge the quota of holiday homes that can be sold to foreigners from 1,420 per year to 4,000 every two years and eliminate curbs on foreign residents buying property for their own use. Foreign-owned companies would be free to buy property for their business but property purchases for investment would remain restricted. Distress sales, or sales by one foreigner to another, would no longer be counted against the quota. The reform would probably come into effect next March if no referendum were required.</p>

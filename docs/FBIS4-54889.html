			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G.B.: "Strangling Greek Embargo"] </F>   [Text] The spring cucumbers and tomatoes that farmers from  the southern Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] village of Bogdanci will gather and bring to  market in just a few days will be terribly expensive this year,  because of the Greek economic blockade of Macedonia that has  already lasted for two months. According to Gjorgi Icev,  financial director of the enterprise Izvorski, which with 24  hectares covered with plants is the biggest agricultural  exporter in the region, their business is in a tragicomic  situation: "We used to obtain the fuel for heating the plants  and all the pesticides through Greece, but now it all has to  travel here through Bulgaria as well."    The embargo that Greece decided on for extremely  questionable  political reasons is having destructive consequences for the  Macedonian economy. The country was already seriously weakened  because of the sanctions against Serbia, which at one time was  its most important trading partner, and also because of the  harsh requirements of a stabilization program under the  supervision of the IMF; now everything is even more difficult.  The Macedonians estimate that every month the blockade is  costing them approximately $80 million, which includes both lost  exports and the higher transportation costs for shipping goods  through the Black Sea entrance to Bulgarian Burgas and Albanian  Durres.    Only a few Macedonian exporters were as far-sighted as  Izvorski, which compensated for the lost "Greek route" in time  through a joint company with a certain Austrian commercial  enterprises, which will take this year's early vegetables, worth  10 million German marks [DM] to the markets of Eastern and  Central Europe by air. On the other hand, heavy industry is  literally collapsing; a few days ago the Skopje state steelworks  finally closed its doors and dismissed 8,000 workers; something  similar is in the outlook quite soon for the other state  enterprises, which were dependent upon the railroad link with  the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki.    After Macedonia's GNP declined by 15 percent in 1993, it is  expected to drop another 8 percent this year. Last year the  annual income per capita was $700, and inflation is ranging  around 70 percent. In spite of everything, the Skopje government  does not intend to give in, since it does not have any guarantee  that Greece will not resume the blockade again even after its  demands are met. According to some estimates, Macedonia only has  oil reserves in its warehouses for another two months, and  during that period it will attempt somehow to acquire the  necessary funds ($120 million) to build a 65-kilometer-long  railroad link with Bulgaria, from which it would obtain crude  oil for the Skopje refinery. According to the latest news, oil  is already coming into the country by road from Albania, and  Macedonia thinks that it could bring 7,500 metric tons of black  gold a day from Durres.</p>

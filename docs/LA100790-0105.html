			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S ANOTHER WILD LOSS FOR MCGWIRE, 52-51;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE: QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 415 YARDS AND FIVE TOUCHDOWNS, BUT  TWO-POINT CONVERSION FAILS AND WYOMING WINS.  </P> <P> For the second time in three weeks, San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire got  hooked up in a passing and scoring battle with an opposing quarterback, only  this time, the other quarterback's name wasn't Ty Detmer.  </P> <P> It was Tom Corontzos, a relatively obscure quarterback from the University of  Wyoming. But it didn't matter. The Aztec defense couldn't cover its own shadow  Saturday, and Wyoming (6-0, 3-0) ended up with a wild, 52-51 Western Athletic  Conference victory before 16,713 in War Memorial Stadium.  </P> <P> The Aztecs (2-3, 1-2) had a chance to win with 2:10 to play. That's when they  scored the last of their six touchdowns, pulling to within a point at 52-51,  and Coach Al Luginbill decided to go for a two-point conversion. McGwire faded  back to pass and Wyoming defensive end Mitch Donahue bore down on him. Receiver  Jimmy Raye broke for the right side of the end zone, but linebacker Pete Gosar  was able to stay in front of him and McGwire's pass went over Raye's head.  </P> <P> The Aztecs tried an onside kick, but Wyoming recovered and almost ran out the  clock. The Cowboys punted on the last play of the game, but there was no  return.  </P> <P> The teams combined for 13 touchdowns and four field goals. Wyoming had 648  yards total offense; the Aztecs had 615. The 103 combined points is the most  scored in a game in Laramie.  </P> <P> Luginbill said he had no reservations about going for the two-point conversion.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to come all the way up here to play a tie," Luginbill said.  "That's insane. How could I look those kids in the eye? Those kids played their  tails off."  </P> <P> By the time it was finished, the Aztecs were stunned into making such  statements as the following, from McGwire:  </P> <P> "We just didn't put enough points on the board."  </P> <P> McGwire was impressive, completing 27 of 42 passes for a season-high 415 yards  and a career-high five touchdowns. He didn't throw an interception. And 51  points generally is not considered a lacking offense.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, McGwire passed for 362 yards and three touchdowns against BYU,  but the Aztecs were defeated, 62-34.  </P> <P> Saturday, he just didn't complete the final two-point conversion attempt.  </P> <P> Wyoming had an easy time against the Aztec defense, averaging 10 yards per  play.  </P> <P> Two of its touchdown drives -- one that went 80 yards and another that went 48  -- took one play.  </P> <P> Corontzos completed 20 of 32 passes for 421 yards and three touchdowns. The 421  yards were a career-high for Corontzos and ranked as the second-best passing  day in school history.  </P> <P> Corontzos isn't known as a dominating passer, but the Aztecs sometimes have a  way of making opposing quarterbacks into stars.  </P> <P> "Those were not blown coverages," Luginbill said. "Let's get that straight. We  did not make the plays. We had people there, and they either got beat or they  didn't make the plays."  </P> <P> Aztec wide receiver Patrick Rowe caught 10 passes for 174 yards and a  touchdown. Aztec receiver Dennis Arey caught eight for 171 yards and three  touchdowns. It was Arey's fourth consecutive game of more than 100 yards  receiving, becoming only the third receiver in school history to do so.  </P> <P> Shawn Wiggins caught eight of Corontzos' passes for 166 yards and one  touchdown. Robert Rivers had 117 yards on four receptions.  </P> <P> The Aztecs built a 27-14 lead in the third quarter but blew a chance to take  command when their defense, on third and 13 from the Wyoming 17, watched  Corontzos and Wiggins hook up on a 30-yard pass play. Wiggins was  double-covered by Robert Griffith and Johnny Walker but neither of them turned  to look for the ball and Wiggins was able to make the catch.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Corontzos passed 25 yards to Wiggins for a touchdown,  bringing Wyoming to within six, 27-21. From that point, the race was on.  </P></p>

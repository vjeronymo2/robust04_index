			<p>BFN     [Text] Matsumoto, Nagano Pref., May 28 KYODO -- The chief  of the largest opposition party said Saturday [28 May] it is  inevitable that his party will submit a no-confidence motion  against the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  after passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget through the Diet.    Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  told reporters that he regards the Social Democratic Party's [of  Japan] [SDPJ] call for resignation of the Hata cabinet en masse  as a sign of no-confidence in the cabinet.    Kono expressed readiness to strengthen the alliance with the  SDPJ, the second largest opposition party, saying it is  important for the two parties, which have great influence in the  Diet, to have talks.    SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo on Thursday called on  Hata  to resign voluntarily once the state budget clears the Diet and  before a no-confidence vote is taken so as to fashion a new  coalition government.    Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDPJ, has indicated that the SDPJ  may move to bury the hatchet with its former coalition partners  and join a new ruling union.    The SDPJ walked out of the coalition in late April to  protest  the abrupt formation by other coalition parties of a new  parliamentary group excluding the SDPJ, forcing Hata to form the  first minority government in 39 years.</p>

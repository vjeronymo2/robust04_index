			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the decision of the Exchange's Appeals Committee panel is subject to review by the Board of Directors of the Exchange on the Board's own motion, on the written request of the appellant, or at the request of the Exchange's President or the relevant Exchange Committee Chairman. The review must be conducted by the Board or by a Board Committee consisting of at least three Directors (other than Directors who sat on the Appeals Committee in the matter). An appellant has an opportunity to address issues raised specifically by the Board or the Committee, and in addition may submit oral or written arguments if the Board so allows in its discretion. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See CBOE Rule 19.5, ``Review.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE states that in a related context the Commission has noted the appropriateness of fees like those proposed herein, particularly when coupled with appeal rights. Specifically, in approving a CBOE proposal that included procedures for contesting the fees assessed for delayed submission of trade data, the Commission stated that ``Although such formalized procedures are unusual for challenging fee assessments, they actually make the imposition of the fee fairer by allowing members to challenge erroneous fee charges. Moreover, these procedures are reasonably designed to afford a member assessed a fee the opportunity to challenge the veracity of the assessments.'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30001 (November 26, 1991), 56 FR 63529 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;90&hyph;06). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that the proposed fee schedule is appropriate and equitable given the additional requirements imposed on participants in OEX RAES in the RAES Fee Approval Order. Furthermore, to ensure that all members are treated alike under the RAES Fee Approval Order, the Exchange will apply the revised fee schedule retroactively from April 30, 1993, the effective date of the RAES Fee Approval Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also deletes the automatic disqualification provisions that appear in current CBOE Rules 24.17(a)(iv), (b)(vii), and (c)(viii). The CBOE believes these deletions are appropriate in view of the new requirements imposed under the RAES Fee Approval Order and the fee structure imposed hereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to allocate reasonable dues, fees and charges among CBOE members and to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the CBOE's automatic execution system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

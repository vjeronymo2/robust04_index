			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Halifax knocks C&amp;G off top of league table Halifax, the UK's biggest building society, has for the first time taken top position in the annual analysis of performance of the 20 biggest societies by Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS. The league table assesses societies on the basis of 12 ratios, which reflect aspects of performance such as management expenses, capital strength and market share. While there has been some criticism of the table, it is watched closely by society executives. It was noticeable yesterday that Halifax, for example, sounded less dismissive of the analysis than has sometimes been the case. Given the recent interest by banks and other financial organisations in societies as potential acquisitions, the report may have a wider audience than usual. In joint second place for 1993 were Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth-largest society which topped the table last year, and Yorkshire, the 12th-largest. In April Lloyds Bank offered Pounds 1.8bn cash for C&amp;G. The two worst performers on the UBS analysis stayed in the same positions as last year - Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-biggest society which took the 19th slot, and Skipton, which took 20th place. Mr Wriglesworth said that Skipton had suffered sustained high levels of bad debt losses, particularly from its non-residential mortgage book. B&amp;W's performance had been hampered by high costs, relatively poor capital strength and high levels of arrears. The biggest improvement in position came from Birmingham Midshires, the 13th-largest society, which rose from 15th place to eighth. The sharpest fall came from North of England, which is to merge with Northern Rock under an arrangement approved by members of both societies earlier this week. North of England fell eight places to 15th. Northern Rock slipped to take fourth place, having come third last year on restated league results. Abbey National, the home loans and banking group that was formerly a society, was not included in the report, but UBS said its business was still close enough to that of a building society to make a comparison. Had it been included in the league table it would have taken 10th place. Mr Wriglesworth contrasted the position of Abbey, the UK's second-biggest mortgage lender, which has been slipping in terms of relative performance on the basis of the UBS ratios, with that of Halifax, which has been rising in the league table since 1990. On Monday Abbey reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 423m for the first half of this year compared with the first six months of last year.

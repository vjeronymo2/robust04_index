			<p>BFN     [Text] Dhaka, April 4 (XINHUA) -- China and Bangladesh  will possibly set up a joint venture paper mill with a yearly  capacity of 50,000 tons in this South Asian country.    This was discussed on Sunday [3 April] between a visiting  delegation of the China National Chemical Engineering Group  Corporation and the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation.    The Chinese visitors were impressed with the quality of  industrial grade paper made from green jute and expressed their  optimism about the possibility of setting up the paper mill and  eventual export of green jute based pulp from Bangladesh to  China.    At present, Bangladesh has tried hard to diversify the use  of  its rich jute resources as the prices of raw jute are too low in  the world market and the country's jute industry has been  shrinking drastically over the past decade.    Recently, local paper makers have successfully produced  quality paper from green jute while the government has urged  local and overseas investors to pour their money into the jute  sector which has been suffering huge losses.</p>

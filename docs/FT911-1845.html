			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: L'Oreal seeks to keep its gloss  -The cosmetics group faces rising competition FOR decades, L'Oreal has dominated the international cosmetics industry from its headquarters in Paris. Today, its position is under attack. L'Oreal still makes more lipsticks, mascaras and skin creams than any other company, but competition is intensifying. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, has increased its cosmetics interests. Shiseido and Kao, the giant Japanese cosmetics companies, are diversifying into the West. Last month, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US became the French company's closest competitor in international cosmetics, buying Max Factor and Betrix from Revlon for Dollars 1.1bn. Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, the 44-year-old Welshman who has chaired L'Oreal since 1988, appears to be unabashed. 'Of course we recognise P&amp;G and the rest as formidable competitors,' he said, 'but we have always lived with competition. Life in this industry should be very interesting over the next few years.' So far, L'Oreal shows no signs of suffering from increased competition. Last week, it announced a 15 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.69bn for 1990 on sales up 12.5 per cent on a comparable basis to FFr30.4bn. Given that 1990 was a difficult year for the cosmetics industry - notably in the US where the financial plight of the department stores, the main distribution channel for upmarket products, aggravated the problems of recession - Mr Owen-Jones has every reason to seem sanguine. This year seems set to be even more difficult. The impact of the Gulf war on international travel and the duty-free market created chaos in January and February. Mr Owen-Jones said L'Oreal's sales rose by just 5.5 per cent in the first quarter. However, the market has recovered in April and he hopes to achieve double digit growth in sales and profits for the full year. Conditions ought to improve in the longer term. The underlying trends of an ageing population and the drive towards higher-quality products augur well for a company like L'Oreal, which makes Lancome skin creams, Helena Rubinstein cosmetics and Ambre Solaire sun screen. However, Mr Owen-Jones expects slower growth in the 1990s than in the bullish era of the 1980s. Slower growth is only one of the challenges confronting L'Oreal. It may face mounting legislation over cosmetics product claims in both the US and Europe. It must also come to terms with pressure from environmentalists on packaging and product testing. L'Oreal, which spent FFr100m over the past 10 years on researching alternative forms of testing, is already a target for animal rights protesters. But the dominant issue on the agenda is the expansion of P&amp;G and Unilever. In the past, L'Oreal had the advantage of being one of the very few cosmetics companies to have both the research resources for dynamic product development programmes and the critical mass to exploit its research through economies of scale in production. P&amp;G and Unilever not only have research and production resources on the same scale, they also have the benefit of good rapport with the supermarkets and drug stores that are increasingly important channels of distribution. L'Oreal is battling back by maximising its own resources. Mr Owen-Jones still sees research as the backbone of the business. L'Oreal, which was founded by a chemist, spends at least 5 per cent of sales on research and development. Shiseido, by contrast, spends 3 per cent. The group has also boosted marketing expenditure. It refuses to disclose budgets, but new products, such as Tresor, the Lancome fragrance, have been treated to lavish launch campaigns. Mr Owen-Jones is dismissive of the 'quick fix' acquisitions of his competitors, but L'Oreal has conducted some acquisitions of its own. Its most important test will come later this year with the relaunch of Helena Rubinstein, which was taken over two years ago. L'Oreal has rationalised Rubinstein's manufacturing and is now in the final stages of overhauling its products. It is doing the same to the Lanvin perfumes which it owns through its Orcofi joint venture. L'Oreal's own ownership seems secure even in the acquisitive world of cosmetics. It is controlled by Gesparal, which is 51 per cent owned by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of L'Oreal's founder who is now in her late 60s. Nestle, the Swiss food group, owns the rest of Gesparal and has rights over Mrs Bettencourt's stake in an agreement which runs until 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] If Yasir 'Arafat continues to make statements  contradicting the peace agreement, Israel will not implement the  next phases. This warning was issued yesterday in the Knesset  by Police Minister Moshe Shahal, although he added that Israel  would continue the dialogue with the Palestinians. The minister  was responding to several opposition motions of no confidence.  They were all defeated, as we hear from our parliamentary  reporter David Ze'ev:    [Begin Ze'ev recording] Police Minister Moshe Shahal talked  tough but held back in terms of taking action now against the  statements of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Shahal told the  Knesset plenum if the terrorist attacks continue, along with  statements by 'Arafat and others contrary to the peace accord,  Israel will continue to talk to the Palestinians but will not  implement future stages until the PLO -- and here the police  minister throws in a second issue -- proves its ability to rule  over Gaza and Jericho in an effective manner. In other words,  if the PLO does not prove it can control Gaza and Jericho,  Israel will not hand over the remainder of the West Bank.    Shahal called 'Arafat's explanations on what he meant when  he  called for a jihad holy war ridiculous, and the police minister  said 'Arafat's statements run contrary to the exchange of  letters that led to mutual recognition between the PLO and  Israel.    The toughest opposition speaker presenting a motion of no  confidence was Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq Levi of the National  Religious Party, who said 'Arafat is spitting in the  government's face, and the government thinks it is raining.  Levi said if the government does not stop the PLO chairman from  entering Jericho, we will have to stop him. Moledet MK Rehav'am  Ze'evi called from his seat: If he does enter, he will not come  out alive. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UN paves way for troops in Sarajevo A UNITED Nations convoy was attacked in Sarajevo yesterday while on its way to meet UN military officers who are to prepare the way for 1,000 troops whose task will be to lift the siege of the city's airport. Sarajevo radio said one man was injured in the attack on the peace-keeping convoy before it met up with the officers, who had just arrived on the outskirts of the city after a day-long drive from Belgrade through Bosnia-Hercegovina's war zone. The officers, led by senior peace-keeper General Lewis Mackenzie, hope to arrange the removal of all anti-aircraft weapons held by Serb irregulars surrounding the airport and oversee their withdrawal from the immediate vicinity to allow the transport of supplies for thousands of hungry residents. UN officials stressed that the operation 'was highly dangerous' since it depended on all sides honouring a ceasefire. 'Ceasefires come and go, but we have to keep trying,' said Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN's chief negotiator. The officials also warned that they did not have the means to provide air cover for the UN troops. The 1,000 troops, which will be drawn from Canada's Royal 22nd regiment, will be equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers to safeguard the flow of humanitarian relief supplies through the airport into Sarajevo. In Washington yesterday, a senior US senator warned that military action might be needed to curb Serbia's territorial ambitions. 'The time for drawing the line has come,' said Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. 'The UN should authorise nation states to use force. Nato should draw up plans for a comprehensive use of force as thorough as that formulated for air, sea and ground forces in Desert Storm,' he added. Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to end US political indifference to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina. No shelter from the storm: Page 20</p>

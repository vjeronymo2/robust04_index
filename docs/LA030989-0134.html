			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY MAN SHOT DEAD BY POLICE AT DOOR OF HIS HOME  </P> <P> Two Fountain Valley police officers responding to a woman's call for help on  Wednesday shot and killed a man in a scuffle at the front door of his home,  police and neighbors said.  </P> <P> It was the fourth time this year that police officers in Orange County have  fired fatal shots in confrontations.  </P> <P> In the latest incident, Harry Owen Clark, 53, suffered multiple gunshot wounds  to the chest and arm after he apparently fought with two officers at the front  door of his home in the 9300 block of Daisy Avenue, according to Fountain  Valley Police Lt. Rod Gillman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Details Disclosed  </P> <P> Gillman said Clark died at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center  at 7:14 p.m., about two hours after being shot. The two officers involved in  the shooting were not identified.  </P> <P> Police disclosed few details of the shooting and said that, in accordance with  department policy, it was being investigated by the Orange County district  attorney's office.  </P> <P> According to initial police reports, the officers first responded to a  disturbance call at 4:07 p.m. at the Bushard Market, where a woman identified  as Norma Clark explained that she had been involved in a bitter argument with  Harry Clark.  </P> <P> Neighbors in the quiet middle-class cluster of homes just off the San Diego  Freeway said Harry Clark was Norma Clark's former brother-in-law, but that they  had lived together on and off for the last 10 years.  </P> <P> Gillman said the officers escorted Norma Clark back to her beige, two-story  tract home on Daisy Avenue, and "confirmed that the suspect was not there prior  to leaving."  </P> <P> An hour later, however, Gillman said the woman called from a neighbor's home to  complain that Harry Clark "had returned and was trying to kick the door to her  home down."  </P> <P> Two uniformed Fountain Valley police officers returned and, according to one  neighbor, approached the house with their guns drawn.  </P> <P> Police said some kind of scuffle ensued at or near the front door and Harry  Clark was shot. It was not clear just where Norma Clark was at the time of the  shooting.  </P> <P> Gillman said he did not know if the victim was armed or how many times he was  shot.  </P> <P> "As far as I know they are still determining time of death, the number of  wounds and that kind of thing," he said. "They have to look at the guns, check  the deceased."  </P> <P> Gillman said the shooting apparently took place "around the front door area,  either just inside or just outside the door."  </P> <P> First reports of the shooting indicated that one of the officers had suffered a  broken arm in the fracas, but Gillman said X-rays at the hospital proved  negative.  </P> <P> "I don't know what happened, but I know that the officers were hit with some  kind of object other than a fist" before the shooting, he said.  </P> <P> Hours after the shooting, police officers and investigators from the district  attorney's office remained at the house collecting evidence and taking  pictures. Knots of neighbors stood outside the house in the street and talked  about what they had heard in the afternoon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Argument Heard  </P> <P> One neighbor who lives down the street said several people had heard the Clarks  arguing in the early afternoon, but that at 3:30 p.m., someone had seen Norma  Clark at Bushard Market buying lottery tickets.  </P> <P> James Sigmond, who lives directly across the street from the Clarks, said that  shortly after the shooting, Norma Clark called him from an undetermined  location and asked what had happened at her house, indicating that she was not  home at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> Another neighbor, Richard Seymour, described Harry Clark as about 6 feet, 4  inches tall, weighing about 250 pounds. He said he recognized Clark as the man  on the stretcher, covered with bandages on his chest and arm, as he was taken  from the house to an ambulance.  </P> <P> Other residents said Norma Clark had been divorced for more than 10 years and  had lived off and on with her former brother-in-law. They said she had two  children from her marriage -- a son in the Marine Corps and a daughter who no  longer lives at home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earlier Shootings  </P> <P> "They kept pretty much to themselves," Seymour said. "The only time either was  here was to pick up their dog when it strayed in our yard."  </P> <P> Clark's death was the fourth as a result of a police shooting in Orange County  since the first of the year.  </P> <P> On Jan. 29, Garden Grove police shot and killed a man who allegedly pointed a  toy gun at them. Four days later, on Feb. 2, Anaheim police shot and killed an  unarmed man outside an Anaheim motel room near Disneyland.  </P> <P> On Feb. 19, a 26-year-old man was killed by Huntington Beach police after he  allegedly charged at two officers with martial arts weapons.  </P> <P> The previous cases all are under investigation by the district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Lt. Gillman said the officers involved in Wednesday's shooting are on  administrative leave, pending an internal investigation. Both will receive  counseling, which is routinely given after officer-involved shootings.  </P></p>

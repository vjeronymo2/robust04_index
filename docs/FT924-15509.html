			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Dispute over van duties European Commission plans for 10 per cent duties on imports of Chrysler minivans from Austria could stir up a political row between Vienna and Brussels, Austrian officials warned yesterday, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Austria, which is applying for EC membership, was given three weeks to cut state subsidies to Chrysler's plant near Graz, or face duties. But the Commission and the Austrian authorities could not reach agreement before the deadline. Ford of Europe is stopping production for five days at its car assembly plant at Valencia, Spain, in October, to reduce output in line with falling sales across Europe, Kevin Done writes. It is also reviewing production levels in Germany.</p>

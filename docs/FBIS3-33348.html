De la Rua, who made the announcement during a brief news  conference at the UCR Buenos Aires precinct, said the crisis  affecting the UCR causes him "great bitterness." He also  harshly criticized the UCR National Board because "it proscribed  the Movement for Participation and does not understand that  party unity is achieved through differences of opinions."    De la Rua explained that he decided to withdraw the Movement  for Participation list from the party elections "because of the  proscription issued by the UCR National Board." He added that  to continue with the campaign for the Constituent Assembly  elections scheduled for 10 April "would be a contradiction"  because the party faction he heads "never approved the Olivos  Pact."    De la Rua added: "The UCR National Board resolution is an  official party statement and its enforcement is compulsory. It  compels us to proscribe ourselves because we have always  rejected the basis of the Olivos Pact."    He referred to the [Raul] Alfonsin faction as "those who  left  us out of the referendum issue" and reasserted that "we had more  than 30,000 signatures supporting the holding of the referendum."    Minutes after making this statement to the press, De la Rua  went to the first floor of the building where the UCR Buenos  Aires precinct headquarters are located to address about 200  members of the party faction he leads.    Escorted by UCR leaders Felipe Figuerero and Roberto  Clienti,  Fernando De la Rua, leader of the Movement for Participation,  asserted that his decision to not include his name on the list  of candidates "is based on ethical reasons." He again  criticized the resolution that compels party candidates to  adhere to the Olivos Pact because "it is a manipulation of the  party grass roots"    Clearly alluding to the Alfonsin-led faction, he said: "They  have locked up the ballot boxes but we will not surrender  because the UCR will overcome this crisis."    De la Rua's brief speech was followed by his supporters'  chants of: "We are proscribed for not signing the pact but we  are a majority in the capital."    Felipe Figuerero, president of the UCR Buenos Aires  precinct,  spoke after De la Rua. After explaining that this was "the most  painful" day in his party life, Figuerero formally proclaimed  the Movement for Commitment headed by Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus  Rodriguez as the single UCR list in the capital.    The document approved by the majority of the Electoral Board  explains that the Movement for Participation list was not  included because of "the regrettable situation raised by the  official and compulsory enforcement of the UCR National Board  resolution."    The resolution, signed by the majority of De la Rua's  followers, adds that "The Movement for Commitment is the only  one that has met all the requirements to be officially  proclaimed."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sources well versed in Japan-DPRK relations  disclosed on 11 January that the North Korean leadership had  rapidly developed a bad impression of Japan since the  inauguration of the Hosokawa government. They said the  resumption of negotiations between Japan and the DPRK on  normalizing diplomatic relations, which have been suspended  since November 1992, "is unlikely unless relations improve  greatly." The sources said Pyongyang sees Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], a main force within the Hosokawa coalition  government, as "a lackey of the United States" and it is unhappy  with the alliance between Shinseito and the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ], which once had friendly relations with  the Workers Party of Korea [WPK]. These are the reasons for  DPRK's bad impression of Japan, the sources said.    Representatives of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) did not attend the SDPJ national  convention and this seems to be the reflection of the opinion of  the North Korean leadership. The SDPJ and Shinseito paved the  way for normalization talks after Shin Kanemaru, (then) vice  president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], visited  Pyongyang in the autumn of 1990. They were believed to have  formed close relations with the DPRK. Therefore, a Foreign  Ministry source said: "We have not expected that the DPRK has  such a bad impression of Japan."    The sources met with Hwang Chang-ye [name as published] and  other North Korean senior officials in charge of diplomacy since  the Supreme People's Assembly renewed the North Korean  leadership last month. The sources said the North Korean  leadership considers "relations with Japan below zero, compared  to the U.S.-DPRK and North-South talks."    The sources quoted a North Korean leader as saying: "The  Hosokawa government is worse than the LDP government. The SDPJ  has failed to establish its independece within the coalition  government and it can no longer be considered friendly to the  WPK. The SDPJ has joined hands with (Shinseito Chief Secretary  Ichiro) Ozawa. Ozawa and (former Defense Agency Director General  Keisuke) Nakanishi are puppets of the United States dressed in  the clothes of the United Nations." They also quoted another  North Korean leader as saying: "Pyongyang expects nothing from  Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. We do not think he  can do something in defiance of Ozawa's will."    The sources indicated that prospects for resuming  normalization talks are dim and that it would be difficult to  carry out a plan of promoting bilateral exchanges at a political  party level.</p>

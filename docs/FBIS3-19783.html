			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed YR/SV: "The European Union and Eastern </F> Countries -- Commissioner Van den Broek Advocates a  Premembership Strategy"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Brussels, 17 Mar (ATS) -- According to Commissioner  Hans van den Broek, the European Union (EU) should propose a  "premembership" strategy for the countries of Central and East  Europe (CEEC). A multilateral political and economic context,  which would be a "real forerunner to membership," should be  established with those countries.    The accession of CEEC's to the EU will be facilitated by  applying the bilateral association agreements that have been  signed so far to each of them, Mr. van den Broek said. The  commissioner, who addressed the Free University of Brussels,  pleaded in favor of a "multilateral relation between the EU and  the CEEC's which would eliminate the problems in trade exchanges  and create a market big enough to attract investors."    A multilateral solution of that kind would be the best means  to help CEEC countries meet the membership criteria settled at  the European Council of Copenhagen in June 1993, he added.  <H5>  Criteria for Membership </H5>   The criteria have been extensively defined: a state ruled by  law; institutional stability that guarantees democracy, respect  for human rights, protection of minorities; ability to cope with  the market trends within the Union.    But the enlargement to the east will also depend on the  Union's ability to include new members, particularly with  respect to the working mechanism of the Union. A date for  opening negotiations cannot be settled at this point as two many  uncertainties still remain on both sides. Mr. van den Broek  thinks that 1997 should be an appropriate time to assess how the  CEEC's are progressing toward membership and to decide what the  next steps should be.    Poland, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and  Bulgaria each have signed an association agreement or a European  agreement with the Twelve. Negotiations will soon start with  Slovenia and later with the Baltic states.  <H5>  Political Dialogue </H5>   Those agreements allow for the establishment of a political  dialogue. The Twelve have suggested that the CEEC's adopt a  multilateral approach for enforcing them. However, several CEEC  countries want to retain the possibility of a bilateral dialogue  with the EU so as to break free from the others.    Hungary has announced that it intends to apply for EU  membership in April. Other CEEC countries could follow. Mr.  van den Broek made a statement aimed at those countries, saying  that the order in which the applications would be introduced  would not influence the order in which they would be accepted.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Ford warns of over-capacity in the UK Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, has warned union officials that it has too much capacity in the UK. The company has told white-collar unions that 62 salaried jobs must be cut in the UK in addition to the 1,487 hourly paid jobs that are to be cut by the end of the year. Sales of its Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars and light vans were forecast 'to remain low', said the company. It has warned the unions that if it did not take action 'this reduced demand would lead to . . . a worsening cost position which would put at risk new product and other investment programmes'. Ford is cutting capacity at its assembly plants in Dagenham, east London, and Halewood on Merseyside by around 20 per cent, and production levels at its component plants will also be affected. It warned that 'the situation could deteriorate even further' forcing the company into more cutbacks.</p>

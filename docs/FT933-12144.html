			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bosnia view not logical Sir, Mate Boban (Personal View, July 22) justifies the ethnic partition of Bosnia by comparing it to the confederation of the 13 colonies into the United States. The inadequacy of this analogy exposes the poverty of the partitioners' case. No outside powers sought to impose a constitution, and the US was established on the basis of the separation of religious identity from governmental powers. If Owen-Stoltenberg, UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and President Bill Clinton go along with the Boban logic they will be tearing up a 200-year-old tradition of civic rights and returning Europe to those wars of religion by which semi-feudal regimes enforced religious homogeneity. Some Bosnians may have voted on 'ethnic' lines. None was given the chance to choose democratic and negotiated reforms rather than military partition. If the United Nations could organise democratic choice in Cambodia, why not - even now - in Bosnia? Bryn Jones, 7 Dowding Road, Bath BA1 6QJ</p>

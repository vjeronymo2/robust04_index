			<p>BFN     [Text] President Itamar Franco has determined that the Army  troops currently occupying Federal Police [PF] facilities should  return to barracks. Here is Alexandre Garcia's live report from  Brasilia:    [Garcia] After a 150-minute cabinet meeting to evaluate the  situation, President Franco decided to order the Army troops to  return to barracks wherever this is possible. In writing,  however, he left a warning. He said that whenever and wherever  abusive attitudes by striking movements take place, the  government will use all the instruments at its disposal to  maintain order, although it recognizes citizens' right to strike.    Planalto Palace reported the governmental decision to the  president of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee a few  moments ago. He reported the news to the strike command, which  has been holding a meeting with the National Defense Committee  at the Chamber of Deputies.    The committee president said that during the evaluation  meeting, it was established that the president of the Republic  acted firmly and openly, and that today he used his common sense  when he realized that the troops could be withdrawn.    A few minutes ago, the president of the National Federation  of Federal Policemen -- Francisco Garisto -- said that during  the 52 days of the strike several abuses had been committed, and  that this brought about the military intervention. He added  that from now on such abuses will be avoided, to show the  president of the Republic that the strike is seeking purely to  ensure better salaries for the PF. As a result of today's  detente, he said, negotiations can be resumed. Garisto also  asserted to the president of the National Defense Committee that  beginning tomorrow, 30 percent of the PF contingents will  perform essential services, without again upsetting the people.  They will resume control of airports; border posts, including  Foz do Iguacu; passports issuance; control of penitentiaries;  and drug enforcement operations.</p>

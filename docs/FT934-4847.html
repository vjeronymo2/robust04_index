			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Gore in appeal to Latin America US Vice President Al Gore called yesterday for a new partnership between the US and Latin America based on open trade, respect for sovereign rights and co-operation on common social and environmental problems. He said President Bill Clinton would invite to the US next year all the democratically elected heads of the countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean to a western hemisphere summit. The meeting 'will codify our shared principles and set forth a vision of economic and cultural progress'. Mr Gore's speech to 5,000 Mexican business people was billed as a significant statement by the Clinton administration on US-Latin American relations after congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The proposed summit would find 'creative solutions to regional problems', including promoting trade and investment, expanding democratic political culture, and protecting the environment throughout the hemisphere, the vice-president said. However, Mr Gore did not propose any new free trade agreements in Latin America, which may disappoint some countries wishing to follow Mexico's path. Instead, he merely said that the US's 'commercial and financial future will become increasingly integrated with the Americas, not only with Mexico and Canada, but with Central America, Caribbean and South America'. 'Nafta was a starting point for dealing with the common challenges of the Americas,' of which free trade was only one element, Mr Gore argued. He hailed the side agreement on labour and environment, describing it as a 'revolution in itself' and called for similar co-operation throughout the hemisphere.</p>

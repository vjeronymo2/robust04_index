			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- The Republic of China will  not interfere in the political operations of Hong Kong even  though it has been a firm supporter of democratic development in  the British colony, President Li Teng-hui said Tuesday [31 May].    Li made the remarks while meeting a group of Hong Kong media  representatives at the presidential office.    He said the government has been very concerned about the  lives and well-being of Chinese in Hong Kong, and said  regulations are now being drafted governing relations with Hong  Kong, as well as Macao, to safeguard the rights and interests of  the two colonies' residents after they revert to mainland rule  in 1997 and 1999, respectively.    Turning to cross-strait relations, Li said Hong Kong has and  will continue to have an important role to play. He said that  instead of seeking detente with the mainland, as it has done in  the past, Taipei in the future wilt try to push ahead with  peaceful and positive exchanges with the mainland.    He said people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should  increase their mutual trust to build a foundation for national  unification, but that the world should also understand that  China is now divided and under separate rule.    He rejected Beijing's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan,  saying that from a historical point of view, Tokyo returned  Taiwan and Penghu to the ROC in the peace treaty it signed with  Taipei in 1952.    "The Chinese Communists have never taken a step on Taiwan,  nor have they collected a penny of tax from people on the  island, so how can they justify their sovereignty claim over  Taiwan?" Li asked.    He said the reason he called mainland officials "a bunch of  bandits" after the March 31 Lake Qiandao disaster, in which 24  Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and crew were robbed  and murdered, was because they had in the beginning tried to  avoid taking responsibility for the incident.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Observer: Chek it out Anatoly Chubais, the Russian deputy prime minister masterminding the vast privatisation programme, is a worried man. One of his government's best English- speakers, Chubais is taking time off from one of the world's tougher assignments to fret about the purity of the Russian lingo. Apparently backed up in his sensitivities by the non-anglophone President Yeltsin himself, he was yesterday entreating reporters to refer to the bits of paper being distributed to the citizenry taking part in privatisatsiya as cheques not vouchers. 'Vayoucher' sounds too foreign to his well-tuned ear, whereas 'chek', believe it or not, is good Russian.</p>

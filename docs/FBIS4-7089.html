			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) --  The Central Standing Committee of the General Association of  Korean residents in Japan (Chongnyon) strongly demanded that the  Japanese Govermnent authorities immediately stop the hostile  policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which  they are pursuing in conspiracy with the United States and the  South Korean authorities.    Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee  of Chongnyon, released a statement of the Chongnyon Central  Standing Committee at a press conference in Tokyo on April 21.    On April 19, gangsters of a Japanese rightwing organisation  thronged to the central headquarters of Chongnyon and cried  "Koreans, get out of Japan" and "Chongnyon, get out of Japan".  On the same day, a similar rowdyism was staged by scores of  loudspeaker cars of the rightwing organisation in front of the  buildings of the Federation of Korean Credit Associations in  Japan and the Tonghae Trading Company.    On April 14, a schoolgirl of the Tokyo Korean middle and  high  school was beaten on the head by an unidentified man in a  tramcar. Such cases of violence are frequently reported from  various parts of Japan.    The statement said the responsibility for these cases rested  with the Japanese Government authorities who have pursued a  hostile policy toward the DPRK and incited hatred for the Korean  residents in Japan, while strengthening the "cooperation system"  of the United States, Japan and South Korea under the pretext of  fictitious "nuclear issue of the North".    "The current trend in which they foster persecution of the  Korean residents in Japan, spreading unfounded rumours, reminds  us of the eve of the great earthquake of 1923 in Kanto district  after which Koreans were massacred," the statement said, and  added:    "We demand that the Japanese Government authorities promptly  renounce their hostile policy toward the DPRK and take measures  to prevent recurrence of outrages by rightwing gangsters and  that some media stop unwarrantable anti-DPRK propaganda and  prejudiced reporting that incites chauvinism."</p>

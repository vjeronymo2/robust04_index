			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beirut, March 28 (AFP)--Several mass circulation  newspapers Monday accused the government of stifling freedom of  expression in Lebanon after it banned news programs on private  radio and television stations.    The criticism came as authorities prepared to take legal  action against two newspapers for reports on the investigation  into the bombing of a Maronite Christian church and allegations  that a leading suspect was beaten up in custody.    Ten people were killed and 54 wounded when a bomb exploded  in  the Our Lady of Deliverance Church in Zuq Mika'il, north of  Beirut, on February 27.    "In five days a party was dissolved, radios and televisions  were silenced and (now) they are after newspapers," said the  pro-Syrian AL-DIYAR daily on Monday.    "Is the government of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri trying  to transform the country into a big jail?," asked the daily's  political commentator.    Newspaper publisher and Lebanon's former ambassador to the  United Nations Ghassan Tuwayni blasted Information Minister  Michel Samahah describing him as a "little Goebbels."    "We fear the country will become a third world dictatorship  with tribunals like those of the 1930s under Stalin," said  Tuwayni in a front-page editorial in his Arabic-language daily  AL-NAHAR.    Tuwayni, who up until now supported al-Hariri's government,  called for a cabinet reshuffle.    Authorities last week charged that seven out of nine  suspects  in the bombing were members of the disbanded Christian Lebanese  Forces militia.    The group, which became a political party in 1991, was  outlawed after its deputy leader Fu'ad Malik, was arrested as  part of the inquiry.    The cabinet also banned private radio and television  stations  from broadcasting news and political programs from midnight  Wednesday until parliament approved legislation to regulate the  media. The ban restricted news coverage to the state-run Tele  Liban and Radio Liban.    The state-run National News Agency (ANI) said the state  prosecutor would take action Monday against AL-DIYAR over a  report alleging that Malik was beaten while under arrest.    Action would also be taken against the pro-Syrian newspaper  AL- SAFIR which alleged the Israeli Shin Beth internal security  service had "planned the attack on the church," according to ANI.    ANI said legal officials had "warned against any violation  of  the secrecy surrounding the investigation and maintain they will  take action against anyone publishing information without  official proof."</p>

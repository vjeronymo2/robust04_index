			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Union challenge to water company Unison, the public services and utilities union, yesterday said it was launching an action in the High Court challenging South West Water's refusal to recognise the union. The company withdrew recognition for its 1,200 Unison members in October. Unison is seeking to apply the recent European Courts of Justice ruling which held the UK government had been in breach of its obligations under the Acquired Rights Directive. Unison said the action was the first time a union had attempted to apply European law on union recognition to a former nationalised industry.</p>

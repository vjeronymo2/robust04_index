[end editor's note]    As a general rule, people go into business using as a basis  their own experiences and what they have learned from others.  With certain assurances, they then risk their own money or  someone else's. Very few run their business according to what  teachers have told them. Even fewer seek advice from  politicians. This is because what teachers and politicians can  offer in the way of advice is already taken for granted -- it is  a constant factor in economic activity.    Competent entrepreneurs are those who utilise their  foresight  and judgement in that domain of uncertainty, or who fall upon  good luck (and achieve success). From a different point of  view, the more fixed and guaranteed the economic and legal  system, the smaller the domain of risk. Such an environment  safeguards not only the income of employees but also the profits  of entrepreneurs and traders. Since entrepreneurs can devote  time and energy to a smaller area of changeability, their  efficiency quota will be higher and their luck can improve, even  though not everyone will strike it rich.    The history of developed countries is a good example.  Crosscountry comparisons do not easily give simple, clear and  explanatory analysis because they are confused by many factors  including different cultural backgrounds, historical geography,  resource circumstances and even the number of people. Some  academics prefer the most complex approach and the most dubious  answer because that helps increase attention paid to their works  and puts off critics (readers confused by the superfluous and  boring works will find it just as hard to understand what the  critics are saying). But businessmen and politicians tend to  state and solve problems only in the simplest and clearest way  in order to avoid missing an opportunity.    I can sum up simply: By comparing people at different  levels, the benefits of the people (businessmen included) will  be secured and the competency of businessmen will be increased,  since in any country, as the standard of the authority and the  justice in the legal system of all countries is improved, the  rights of the people will be better guaranteed, and their  economic capabilities enhanced.    I do believe that businessmen have different degrees of  talent and this may have no relation to educational attainment,  because the one who gets the highest grades will not necessarily  be the winner in the world of business.    Consider for a moment the developmental history of other  countries, which makes it clear no country or society can  dispense with legal protections or economic environment  standards if it is to upgrade its economy.    This is an important issue for investors to consider.    Anyone who does not believe this, need only look back on  their own country's development history or consult a veteran  businessman who has experienced this history. Most of them  would agree with my simple conclusion here.    But in no circumstances should you consult the professor who  has written many volumes of academic writings. If you do, I  doubt you will ever reach the correct conclusion. Most people,  unlike the professor, would find it difficult to avoid fainting  under the weight of tedious and cliched conjecture.    What I have been discussing here is directly relevant to the  current investment environment in China. This explains why  China -- a nation which has considerable business experience --  has not produced many successful businessmen or companies. The  reason is that the economic environment in China lacks the  constant factors that are so prevalent in the West, and it does  not have an effective and fair legal environment. It has  nothing to do with any supposed shortage of talent or lack of  desire to get rich.    Some Western businessmen arrogantly claim "China does not  protect the property of its own people from encroachment, but it  does protect property owned by foreigners". There are also some  smooth talkers in the Chinese government who are offering  guarantees to everyone, saying: "Although China's economic  environment is not perfect, the Chinese government provides  preferential conditions to foreigners," and so on.    I think people who say things like this are tricksters, or  at  least they lack judgement and foresight. If you invest your own  money or that of others on the basis of their poor judgement, it  is certain the risks will be several times greater than for an  investment in your own country: This is because most people  make judgements conditioned by their experiences in their own  countries. So it is certain that someone will be cheated.    Just as some people accustomed to the affluent lifestyles in  the West cannot imagine how Chinese people survive on an income  of less than US$100 a year, managers and businessmen who are  used to legal protection find it difficult to estimate risks in  a society like China where there is no legal protection.    In fact, if I were to make a list of the contingencies you  would face, it would be as long as the writings of the  professors. I can only tell you this: In a situation where you  are protected, then it is easy for you to know what that  protection is; but when you are not protected, you will find it  very difficult to know what risks you may face.    Logic would suggest that any government that fails to  provide  an adequate economic environment for its citizens while, at the  same time, offering preferential treatment to foreigners is  treating its citizens unfairly.    The citizens of this country will not put up with such  unfair  treatment for long. They will use every means to change this  situation. We know from history that at times of great social  change, unfair phenomena can easily change to the opposite  extreme. That is, while it is the Chinese citizens who are  treated unfairly, in the future it may be the foreigner.    There are numerous instances over the past century which  illustrate this. This is particularly so in situations where  foreigners have participated in the exploitation and oppression  of local citizens, and more so when this oppression and  exploitation drives the majority of people to anger past reason.  Even a great and powerful politician would have no choice but  to give way to this kind of deep, popular emotion of revenge.    The Chinese people are a rational race, but other people  must  be rational as well. The Chinese, moreover, always look down on  unscrupulous businessmen who are concerned only with profit.    The main problem with investing in China, therefore is that  what is needed first of all is a political investment. This  would not only be helpful to the Chinese people, but would allow  foreign businessmen to create a favorable economic environment  for themselves, and contribute to protecting the economic  interests of all.    The potential of China's vast market is very seductive. But  if investors fail to invest in helping the rational forces of  democratic reform, and instead leave China's fate in the hands  of reactionary autocrats or other unpredictable elements, then  this is not merely harmful to the interests of the Chinese  people. It is also harmful to the interests of the businessmen  who have invested in the China market themselves.    Because it doesn't matter what passport you hold; when you  are operating in China you have become a part of the Chinese  economic system -- a passport has no validity in the market.    You may be thinking like many Chinese private entrepreneurs:  "Take advantage of the situation while the communist party  hasn't got on to me, make a bundle quick and then get out." If  you do this you may be able to make a great deal of dirty money.  But I warn you to make sure you get out at the right time.  Don't get your feet so stuck in the mud that you can't pull  them out.</p>

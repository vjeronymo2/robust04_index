			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The assembly of members of parliament of  the Council of Europe is news today and will be for the next few  days. A historic event is taking place today. For the first  time a delegation of the Bosnian parliament is going to be at  the Council of Europe assembly, and the new Russian delegation  will also be attending. Miguel Angel Martinez, president of the  assembly of members of parliament of the Council of Europe, is  on the line. Today is an important day for the assembly of  members of parliament of the Council of Europe. The  representatives of the Bosnian parliament will be at this  assembly for the first time.    [Martinez] Yes, with the president of the Bosnian parliament  leading them, they are going to take their place for the first  time as specially invited guests, that is, a candidate member  country to affiliation to the Council of Europe.    [Announcer] There is also more news. For example, Boris  Yeltsin is in Spain. Russia, with these problems about the  Black Sea Fleet, the complaints about not having been informed  about NATO air strikes around Gorazde, and the new Russian  delegation taking its place in the assembly of the Council of  Europe. What do these two developments mean for this  organization, the assembly of the Council of Europe?    [Martinez] What this means is the new role of the Council of  Europe and the new dimension of the European contruction --  which now far surpasses the narrow and almost subregional  framework of the European Union, the EC, and Europe, now that  the world divided into blocs is over -- is expanding to all the  countries, interpreting their aspiration to live in freedom and  democracy. I refer to the countries on the map of the  continent. They identify that aspiration with participating in  the construction of Europe, and here we have important countries  such as Russia with which, obviously, the dimension of  construction is growing in terms of countries, of people who are  going to come under the blue starred flag, and, as you can  imagine, the complexity of our work increases.    [Announcer] There is another important bit of news which  goes  slightly beyond Europe's sphere and it is the participation,  that presence, of Yasir 'Arafat, who is going to be at the  Council of Europe shortly. Will the Council of Europe have much  capacity to intervene or support the Middle East peace process?    [Martinez] One of the responsibilities practically falling  on  us, without us having made any request, is to be Europe's voice  in dialogue and, if you like, negotiation with the other big  countries or other big blocs of countries with which, by  necessity, Europe has to speak to construct the world order and,  above all, to keep peace in the world. I have just returned  from China as part of a very high-level delegation. Yesterday I  saw the U.S. ambassador to France in my office; she was carrying  a message from President Clinton. Today I am receiving a  delegation of 15 Arab countries, and tomorrow Yasir 'Arafat is  coming. Europe must speak, talk. It must be a partner with  these others to create a world in peace, and naturally it would  appear that the Council of Europe is the most representative  instrument because we are all here.</p>

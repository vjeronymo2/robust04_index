			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLOIST'S CONCERTED EFFORT WINS MVP  </P> <P> Even as Rickey Henderson was receiving the most valuable player award for his  performance in the American League playoffs, the Toronto Blue Jays continued to  malign his and the Oakland Athletics' style.  </P> <P> "It was almost like Rickey was pointing to the seats and calling his shots,"  A's general manager Sandy Alderson said of Henderson's in-your-face dominance  of a five game series in which Oakland repeated as AL champion.  </P> <P> Henderson sustained his impact Sunday as he tripled, singled and stole yet  another base, driving in one run and scoring a second in the 4-3 victory.  </P> <P> "Rickey kept altering his game to the opposing pitcher and he did it at will,"  Alderson said.  </P> <P> "Against right-handers he would be more patient, just trying to get on base,  knowing he could steal. Against left-handers, knowing he would have a tougher  time stealing, he went for the extra-base hit.  </P> <P> "It was like this was his stage, his Carnegie Hall, and he rose to the occasion  with a virtuoso performance."  </P> <P> Henderson's next recital comes Saturday in the first game of the World Series  in Oakland.  </P> <P> Henderson grew up in the Bay Area rooting for the Giants. Now, he wants the  Giants to defeat the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs so that it  will be a short commute from his Oakland Hills home.  </P> <P> But he wiped the champagne from his face Sunday and added:  </P> <P> "I'm confident I can run against either team.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I can top this, but I think I can do just as well."  </P> <P> How well did Henderson do?  </P> <P>  -- He had a slugging percentage of 1.000, an on base percentage of .609 (14  for 23) and a batting average of .400 based on six for 15, not including seven  walks.  </P> <P>  -- He set a championship series record with eight stolen bases, tied another  by scoring eight runs and either scored or drove in 11 of the A's 26 runs.  </P> <P>  -- He led both clubs in RBI and extra base hits with five each, and tied  teammate Dave Parker for the most home runs with two.  </P> <P> In addition, of course, he seemed to intimidate the Blue Jays, distracting  their focus.  </P> <P> In Game 1, he walked twice, stole two bases, scored one run and accounted for  two others by breaking up a double play with a pivotal slide at second base.  </P> <P> In Game 2, he walked twice, singled twice, scored two runs and infuriated the  Blue Jays with his tiptoe approach to second base on a seventh-inning steal  that failed to draw a throw.  </P> <P> In Game 3, the only A's loss, he doubled, walked, stole once and scored two  runs.  </P> <P> In Game 4, he hit two homers, drove in three runs and walked.  </P> <P> And Sunday, aware, as he said, that opposing pitcher Dave Stieb is prone to  rattle, Henderson walked to open the game, stole second and scored on Jose  Canseco's one-out single. Two innings later, he tripled to right-center field  for a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> "If you get to Stieb early, you can frustrate and intimidate him, and I think  that's what happened," Henderson said. "He's a tremendous pitcher, but he  shouldn't let people intimidate him the way he does."  </P> <P> Inevitably, it came down to a final exchange of words Sunday, with the Blue  Jays' George Bell calling Henderson a great leadoff hitter who doesn't need to  "showboat and show up people the way he does," and catcher Ernie Whitt, who  threw out one of 14 A's base stealers, saying of Henderson's performance:  </P> <P> "To me, he was the key going in. We knew we had to keep him off the bases and  that didn't happen. We held down the Oakland big boys, but couldn't contain  Rickey.  </P> <P> "He had a great series, but I still don't appreciate the way he goes about it  at times. You don't try to embarrass the other guy in the process."  </P> <P> Henderson smiled. Showmanship, he said, is the name of the game.  </P> <P> "I don't think George Bell or any of those guys know what this was all about,"  he said. "Maybe it was because I wanted it more, but I don't think they  recognized the excitement and emotion of it.  </P> <P> "They kind of went out and stood around, but that's fine. I'm just a little  hurt and disappointed that they have to make it personal again, that they can't  admit they were outplayed."  </P> <P> Striving to reach his first World Series, Henderson said he was on a mission.  He cited the effort that went into it and said he wasn't surprised by his  success, calling it and the A's pennant a dream come true, the happiest moment  of his career.  </P> <P> He also credited the byplay with fans here and the Blue Jay comments for  keeping his adrenaline pumping, and said, "I enjoy having the spotlight on me.  I strive to raise my game in that situation. I'm honored when people say I'm  the best leadoff hitter ever, but I don't know about that. I feel I'm one of  the best of this decade. I don't know much about what happened before."  </P> <P> There was a spotlight in New York, of course, but Henderson didn't always  respond in a consistent manner, as he did with the A's.  </P> <P> Traded to the A's June 20, he stole 52 bases in 58 attempts and had 160 hits  and walks while reaching base in 80 of 85 games. He hit .247 in the first half  and .294 in the second.  </P> <P> Eligible for free agency when the World Series ends, Henderson said he hopes to  remain with the A's, although he had previously said he would consider all  options.  </P> <P> "I'm relaxed. I feel less pressure than I did in New York," he said. "The  people in this organization let you know they're high on you, they care for  you. It's a great feeling."  </P> <P> Alderson, aware that his praise only enhances Henderson's sales pitch, said he  would not begin negotiations until the World Series is over.  </P> <P> "Rickey knows we want him to stay. We've told him that we'll do everything we  can to retain him. He obviously has given us a dimension we didn't have last  year. And if we hadn't had him this year, this series easily could have gone  the other way."  </P> <P> Indeed. Henderson's postseason performance probably will stand as a yardstick  against which all others are measured.  </P> <P> Said Bill Rigney, an adviser to Alderson and a baseball man for almost 50  years:  </P> <P> "People ask me who I compare Rickey to and I have to say Jackie Robinson when  it comes to daring on the bases.  </P> <P> "But I have never seen anyone play so hard and do so many things in a five-game  series. He wanted it, and it rubbed off on everyone else here."  </P></p>

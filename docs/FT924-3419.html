			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Opec's message to oil traders falls on deaf ears: Why the price of crude has fallen NERVOUS futures traders in New York and London have sent the oil price down after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has failed to convince them it can discipline the production of oil. The price of North Sea Brent crude has tumbled by almost Dollars 1.50 a barrel following Opec's meeting at the end of November, adding up to a drop of Dollars 3.50 a barrel since October. The price of Brent for January delivery was Dollars 18.15 a barrel in London last night. The problem for Opec members - most of who urgently need higher oil revenues to revive their struggling economies - is that market traders have little confidence that the producers' club can staunch the flow of oil from its members' pumps. In spite of agreeing to cut production in Vienna, Opec members saw prices fall rather than rise by Dollars 1 or Dollars 2 a barrel as they had hoped. Opec's task of talking up oil prices has been made more difficult by a rise in stocks of oil products such as gasoil, or diesel, which are held by companies and consumers over the winter. This has been accompanied by milder weather than was forecast, depressing demand. Companies do not like to tie up their cash by holding stocks when demand is low and spring is approaching. Traders fear that this extra oil could start flooding on to the market early next year if there is no recovery in demand. Traders have been nervous since October when stocks started to increase, an unusual event for that time of year. Refineries in Europe and the US were running at high production rates which, combined with depressed demand, led to excess supply. European stocks of fuel oil, for example, rose to 144m barrels at the end of October, compared with 137m barrels at the same time last year, according to one market observer. Opec members were also flouting September's agreement to trim output. Most members pumped as much as they could with the result that production was more than 25m barrels a day (b/d) in November rather than the agreed ceiling of 24.2m b/d. Now Opec wants oil traders to believe that it will slice into its output to cut production to 24.58m b/d between December and March to bring supply and demand into a steadier balance. It has even shared out production allocations among members to reinforce their commitment to the agreement - the first time it has managed to do this without any country making an official objection to its share since the Gulf war. But the Opec accord, like most of the club's recent deals, has massaged production figures to try to gain acceptance for the deal from among the cartel's fractious members. This means the accord does little more than sanction current over-production. 'The Opec agreement just does not go far enough. The market has no faith that Opec can make the cuts needed,' said Mr Andy LeBow, a New York trader with ED&amp;F Mann, an international trading house. The latest accord excludes Ecuador which has opted to leave the producers' club. Ecuador was producing around 300,000 b/d in November and once this is deducted from Opec's overall output that month of 25m b/d it brings production to 24.7m b/d. This implies a cut in production for the remaining Opec members of just over 100,000 b/d for the first quarter of next year to reach the new ceiling of 24.58m b/d - hardly the substantial reduction that traders had been expecting. Moreover, Kuwait has been given room to exceed its production allocation of 1.5m b/d if market conditions allow. The emirate has said it wants to produce 1.75m b/d as it rebuilds its oil industry after the Gulf war. Iran is intent on building its capacity and has previously flouted production constraints. 'The market always expects too much from Opec,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the industry consultants, 'this agreement is the best that could be achieved given the conflicting political objectives. But it is not enough.' Political conflicts within Opec have partly stymied the organisation's attempts at managing oil supply. Since the Gulf war, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been involved in a tussle for oil market share which has dictated Opec policy. Both countries have resisted making cuts in their own output. In fact, Iran has been engaged in a drive to increase its production capacity which it says could reach 4.5m b/d by March. This has led to resentment among many of the smaller, debt-laden producers. 'If you have the ability to do damage in the market, you are listened to at Opec,' said Mr Taiwo Idemudia, general manager of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company's London office. The market could really be weakened if member nations do not implement even the modest production cuts envisaged in the November deal. In February, when Opec meets again, demand for its oil will be fast declining as the industry prepares for warmer weather. The organisation must agree to bigger cuts then, if it is not to see a full-scale price collapse. 'I think we will face a big fight in three months,' said Mr Hacene Mefti, Algeria's energy minister, after the last Opec meeting. The fight is likely to come over market share when Opec gets around to dividing up a much smaller production ceiling among its members. More painful cuts will also have to be made once Iraq is allowed to export oil again. Baghdad is currently barred from the export market by United Nations sanctions imposed after the Gulf war. When it returns to the market, other nations will have to implement cuts to accommodate it. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, believes that Opec could achieve production cuts necessary to boost prices if it is desperate enough. 'Opec's failures have rarely been because of a lack of arithmetical solutions to their problems but because of a lack of political will and differences in short-term price objectives.' The organisation has, in the past, been jolted into decisive action by an imminent crisis in the market such as a big price collapse. Opec could still be helped out by colder winter weather which would push up oil usage, or a threat to supplies from a political crisis in Russia - the world's biggest oil producer. But what is really needed for a sustained recovery in prices is a faster-than-expected economic recovery. Recent economic statistics from the US suggest that there the recession may be ending. The market was also encouraged by demand estimates from the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based monitoring body, on Friday which expects world demand to reach 68.6m b/d in the first quarter. This is higher than Opec's own estimate for demand of 66.48m b/d. But there is unlikely to be any rapid rise in oil prices: for the next month at least uncertainty over action by Opec members, combined with full stocks and weak demand is likely to keep prices low.</p>

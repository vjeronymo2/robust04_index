			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CITY SEEKS INCLUSION IN HARBOR DISTRICT  </P> <P> The Ventura City Council, entering the political fray over the Oxnard Harbor  district, has voted to seek a change in district boundaries which would include  the city.  </P> <P> On Friday, the Local Agency Formation Commission will consider rival proposals  to expand and shrink boundaries of the harbor district, which now includes  Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Camarillo and parts of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> The Ventura resolution, passed Monday evening, supports Oxnard and Port  Hueneme's position of excluding the rest of the county from the district, but  calls for Ventura's inclusion on grounds that it is affected by port activities  and its residents should "have a voice and a vote in the operations of the  port."  </P> <P> Last week, LAFCO received a report calling for the harbor district to be shrunk  to include only Oxnard and Port Hueneme, arguing that the two cities bear most  of the brunt of truck traffic to and from the seaport and that residents of the  two cities would be better served by a smaller port district.  </P> <P> In contrast, the Oxnard Harbor District wants district boundaries to be  expanded countywide. The increased prestige would help the harbor obtain trade  advantages that would increase business and revenue, port officials contend.  SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

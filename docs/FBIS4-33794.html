			<p>BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro stated that the Cuban  people face a difficult struggle and that their long journey has  not yet concluded. After pointing out that only in the last 35  years have we been owners of our destiny, Raul warned that now  we must begin all over again and there is no other way.  Furthermore, he highlighted that even if it were out of respect  for our dead, we must be loyal and firm.    Raul, who is second secretary of the party and minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], spoke to pilots of the  Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR]  brigade in Santa Clara, after visiting the Central Army's air  base. Raul also visited the daycare center and the elementary  school of that military community.    The exposition presented by Brigadier General Nilvio  Sanchez,  head of that unit, demonstrated how all of its air and antiair  units are being protected and are ready for combat, or are being  preserved and are ready to be taken out of the bowels of the  earth and put into action within little time.    In the same manner, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro,  first vice minister of the FAR, underscored that such a high  level in the condition of the equipment had never been obtained  before, which responds to the capacity developed by Cuban  specialists to repair and maintain even the most complex  equipment. Ruben Martinez, head of the DAAFAR, added that $13  million had been saved in airplane engine repairs alone last  year.    During his tour, Raul was also able to witness the intense  labor carried out at the Victoria de Santa Clara  agricultural-livestock farm and how all the resources of a large  tank unit in Villa Clara are being maintained and properly  protected.</p>

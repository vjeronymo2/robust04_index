			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Consumer confidence fall boosts market sentiment A BIG drop in consumer confidence provided a welcome boost to US Treasury market sentiment yesterday, although the pressure of fresh supply following the afternoon auction of two-year notes pegged back early price gains. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  11/32 at 100 5/8 , yielding 7.938 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32 at 99 1/16 , to carry a yield of 5.374 per cent. In the morning, the Conference Board's report that its consumer confidence index fell to 46.3 in February - the lowest seen since 1974 - from 50.2 in January, surprised the market, which had been expecting the index to rise. The report overshadowed the second leg of the Federal Reserve chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress. Although Mr Alan Greenspan made some mildly encouraging noises about the economy, he warned that it was too soon to assume that the recovery was assured, and hinted that further monetary stimulus may be required. After several weeks of steady losses as hopes for more interest rate cuts dwindled, this was exactly what the market wanted to hear. The results of the Dollars 14.25bn auction of two-year notes, however, meant prices fell back from their highs. EUROPEAN markets responded in knee-jerk fashion to the news from the US, with most markets bouncing significantly higher in late trading. UK government bonds gained around half a percentage point on the day, after the market had earlier shown some disappointment that the UK authorities did not follow their Spanish counterparts in cutting interest rates. The expected rate cut in Spain, of  1/4 point, provided the opportunity for the UK to steer rates lower, too: but with a national budget announcement two weeks away and an election campaign about to get into full swing, political considerations appeared to determine that now was not the optimum time for a rate cut. Early firmness in the gilts market eased as a result, helped by rumours of a poor opinion poll showing for the Conservative government. The news from the US later, though, brought a busy afternoon's trading - with around 31,000 contracts in the March gilts future traded on Liffe - and a sharp upturn. The Liffe future ended at around its high for the day of 97.30, up from its opening of 97.18. GERMAN government bond futures also jumped in late trading, but failed to break out of their current trading range. In a quiet morning, the March bund futures contract firmed from its opening of 87.74 to around 87.80, before the news from the US pushed it up to its resistance level of 88.00. With inflation data due this week, the up-turn brought little trading from investors, though the heavy day on the futures market suggested that traders were positioning themselves for future buying. AFTER a weak start to the week, Japanese government bonds advanced in early trading in Tokyo as hopes of an official discount rate cut were rekindled. However, the early advances were lost during the afternoon, with the benchmark bond No 129 closing at around the same level as Monday, when it closed with a yield of 5.385 per cent.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Bush to call in G7 ministers: Germany comes under renewed US pressure to cut interest rates PRESIDENT George Bush will call finance ministers and central bank governors at tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in Washington into the White House to press the case for lower interest rates. In particular he is expected to increase pressure on Germany to cut its rates and so help boost the world economy. But Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, said in a speech in Washington yesterday that German monetary policy would remain tight for the time being to mop up excess liquidity which had been created by the economic and monetary union of the two Germanys. Repeated US demands for an easing of German monetary policy and the refusal of the finance ministry in Bonn or the Bundesbank in Frankfurt to alter their stance will make the G7 meeting difficult. If anything, the differences on monetary policy and growth between the US and Germany have widened in recent weeks. In Bonn late on Thursday, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said Germany was not prepared to lower rates and added that the US should not seek to end its recession through inflation. At the same time, a US Treasury official in Washington said European pre-occupations with combating inflation appeared passe in view of the problems facing the world economy since the political liberalisation of eastern Europe and the Gulf war. The US believes that Europe has failed to understand the implications of a huge demand for finance from the Soviet Middle East. In these circumstances it is feared high real interest rates threaten the world economy and political stability. The US wants stronger global economic growth and is concerned that growth in Europe is slowing and that there is no clear evidence of recovery in the US, Britain and Canada. The US Treasury official suggested that the time may have come for the G7 countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - to shift their aims from achieving non-inflationary growth to achieving growth with low inflation. For its part, Germany will underline that it is performing an service for the world economy through its financial support for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Mr Waigel said in Bonn that Germany had earmarked DM25bn (Pounds 8.3bn) for this purpose. Mr Pohl said Germany's trading partners would benefit substantially from the country's unification. Strong growth in western Germany would be welcomed by countries in recession, while a 'drastic decrease' in Germany's trade surplus provided an important growth stimulus for Germany's trading partners, he said. Mr Pohl said it was difficult to understand complaints that Germany was draining global savings to finance union. Instead of blaming Germany, there should be a sustained effort by all deficit countries to improve national savings and bring about early implementation of agreed plans to boost the financial resources of the International Monetary Fund.

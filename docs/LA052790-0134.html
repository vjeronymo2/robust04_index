			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HENDRIX, MCBRIDE PREVAIL; CSUN MEN TAKE 2ND  </P> <P> A seasoned veteran and a relative newcomer used the same tactic to win their  respective races and lead the Cal State Northridge men's track and field team  to a second-place finish in the NCAA Division II championships Saturday.  </P> <P> Redshirt junior Kevin Hendrix won the 100 meters and freshman Erick McBride  took the 800 at Hampton University's Armstrong Field. Both started quickly and  never looked back.  </P> <P> As a result, the Matadors totaled 60 points to finish behind St. Augustine's  (N.C), which scored 111 points and won its second consecutive team title.  </P> <P> Hampton (56 points), California Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion Cal Poly San  Luis Obispo (53) and Cal State Los Angeles (49) rounded out the top five.  </P> <P> Lolita Pile led the Northridge women to a fifth-place showing by finishing  second in the triple jump for the second consecutive year, and the Lady  Matadors' 400-meter relay team placed fourth.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo scored 116 points to win its second consecutive title, followed  by Norfolk State (72), Abilene Christian (62), Alabama A &amp; M (56) and  Northridge (44 1/2).  </P> <P> "We couldn't have asked for much more," Northridge assistant Tony Veney said.  "To have three individual champions is just super."  </P> <P> In addition to Hendrix and McBride, freshman Chris Perry won the long jump  Thursday, marking the first time the Matadors have produced three men's winners  in the Division II meet.  </P> <P> Set to move to Division I in the fall in all sports except football Northridge  went out in style.  </P> <P> Hendrix, who has been nursing a foot injury all season, got off to the "best  start of my life" in the 100 in upsetting favorite Kenneth Brokenburr of St.  Augustine's, 10.50 seconds to 10.52.  </P> <P> Hendrix, who teamed with Melvin Jones, Chris Pippins and Wade Smart to place  fifth in the 400 relay (40.46), would have had a greater margin of victory but  raised his arms in celebration five meters before the finish line.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe how well I got out," Hendrix said. "I couldn't feel anyone  around me after the first 10 meters and that really surprised me. For a split  second, I thought I might have false-started, but when I didn't hear a second  gun, I just kept pouring it on."  </P> <P> Although Hendrix came back to set a Northridge record of 20.87 seconds in the  200, he finished third behind Terrence Warren (20.67) of Hampton and Brokenburr  (20.70).  </P> <P> Fourth coming off the turn, Hendrix made up a couple of meters on the leaders  in the final 100.  </P> <P> "Because of my foot, I just can't run the turns that hard," Hendrix said.  </P> <P> McBride did not finish fast in the 800, but he didn't have to after blowing the  race open early.  </P> <P> McBride, the Southern Section 4-A Division champion at Palmdale High last year,  had a 10-meter lead after passing the 400 mark in 52.3. When he had run 600  meters in 1:19.8, his advantage had grown to 12 or 13 meters.  </P> <P> Ali Mahamed of St. Augustine's made a rush in the final straightaway but  finished two or three meters behind McBride, who won in 1:49.34.  </P> <P> "The first 400 felt really comfortable and easy," McBride said. "But I started  to get scared in the last 200. I kept waiting for someone to come up on me, but  it never happened."  </P> <P> Shunning conventional tactics, which say that runners win national  championships in the 800 by outkicking opponents, McBride dared his competitors  to start quickly with him.  </P> <P> "We figured if he went out fast, he was strong enough to hold off the rest of  the field," Northridge assistant Bob Augello said. "We thought it would have  been a bigger gamble to let it turn into a kicker's race."  </P> <P> Pile was hoping to challenge Diana Wills of Army in the triple jump, but the  two-time defending champion never gave her the chance, bounding a wind-aided 44  feet 11 3/4 inches in the second round of the first flight of jumpers.  </P> <P> Jumping in the second flight, Pile was forced to play catch-up, but her  wind-aided 41-10 3/4 in the sixth and final round left her well behind the Army  senior.  </P> <P> Tonya Conner, Pile's freshman teammate, finished sixth at 40-2 3/4.  </P> <P> Other top Northridge performances came from freshman Cela Taylor, who finished  fifth in the women's 400 in a personal best of 55.32, and Pippins, who placed  fifth in the 100 in 10.64.  </P> <P> The wins by Hendrix and McBride, which came within 20 minutes of each other,  helped turn around a day that had started poorly for the Northridge men. Perry  had placed a non-scoring ninth (47-5 3/4) in the triple jump and Jorge Castro  and Sasha Vujic had finished out of the money in the 1,500.  </P> <P> Vujic, still recovering from a fractured left foot, finished 12th; Castro  dropped out after 500 meters because he was having difficulty breathing due to  a chest cold.  </P></p>

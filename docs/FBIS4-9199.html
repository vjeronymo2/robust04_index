			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- At a session in Knin this  afternoon, deputies of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]  assembly elected a government of national unity proposed by  Borislav Mikelic. Fifty deputies voted in favor of the  government, 14 were against, and nine abstained. The election of  the government was preceded by a brief discussion during which  the deputies gave overall support to the program and composition  of the government.    There will be no representatives of the Serbian Radical  Party  in Mikelic's cabinet, but Mikelic himself said that a  reconstruction of the government could be expected very soon  because of the construction of new ministries. Mikelic added  that the first government session will be held tomorrow to put  the new program into action.    RSK President Martic told TANJUG that the election of the  new  government greatly contributes to the stabilization of internal  affairs in Krajina.</p>

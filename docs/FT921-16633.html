			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Establishment takes fright at Algeria election results: Francis Ghiles looks at the fall-out from last week's first round wins for Islamic extremists PRESSURE is mounting on President Chadli Bendjedid to cancel the second round of the country's first multi-party elections which last week confirmed the opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) as the main political force in Algeria. Some political leaders such as Dr Said Saadi, the secretary general of the Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Democratie, one of the lay opposition parties, are quite clear. A second round, he says, will 'bury Algeria. It will condemn us to chaos.' He has called for a general strike. Such a strategy is backed by the Committee for the Safeguard of Algeria, which includes leading trade unions and employers federations and appears to have the tacit support of senior figures in the establishment. Earlier this week it issued a proclamation arguing that 'it could not allow those who benefit from the rules of democracy to abrogate, tomorrow, the very same constitution which guarantees those rules'. It pointed out that the FIS ruling council still meets in secret and that nobody knows the names nor the exact number of its members. For his part, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, whose Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS) won 25 seats in Kabylia, the Berber stronghold in the north, and whose candidates are strong runners-up to the FIS in a number of constituencies in the heart of Algiers, refuses for the present to go that far, arguing such a move would make Algeria look like a 'banana republic'. He has called for Algerians to march through the heart of the capital today in a show of strength against totalitarian forces. But as he pointed out in an interview yesterday he still cannot get the authorities to lay on special trains for those of his supporters who wish to come into the capital. This much respected veteran of the war of liberation against France and long-time political exile expresses serious misgivings about the fairness of the elections, saying that state-controlled television gave no time for his meetings, concentrating all its news and reporting on the Islamic fundamentalists and the ruling National Liberation Front. He argues - and independent evidence increasingly supports him - that fraud was practised on a much wider scale than observers had thought until a few days ago. They assert that 10 per cent of the ballot papers cast were not valid; 900,000 electoral cards never reached those they were destined for; and that a good half of the elections of successful candidates in the first round would be contested in the Constitutional Court. The vast majority of town halls have been under FIS control since the party's victory in the municipal elections of June 1990 and the names of many people who then abstained appears to have been struck off the electoral register. Since December 20, in the run-up to the polls, a string of violent incidents across the country are adding to a climate of growing uncertainty. Some of these incidents are only now being made public, and several resulted in the deaths of members of the security forces. Externally, the Moroccan authorities have announced they will close their frontier with Algeria from January 15, the day before the planned second round. Already Tunisia appears to have sealed its border with Algeria. Anxiety in Paris has been all the greater because French leaders appear, as in June 1990 when the Islamic party swept the polls in local elections, to have misread the way the vote would go. They are in good company, however, as their optimism about the capacity of the FLN to resist the FIS onslaught appears to have been shared by Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, and his minister of the interior, General Larbi Belkheir. Other senior members of the government fear the worst. They believe that if the FIS wins a majority, it will be forced into radical measures in order to keep their promises it has repeatedly made to its followers. They are apprehensive that the FIS will turn first against the rich, then against the educated middle classes - it has already publicly promised to replace a certain number of technicians with 'Islamic' technicians it will import from the Middle East. Then will come the turn of the Berber heartland of Kabylia - with the added twist that many key FIS leaders such as Mr Mohammed Said and Mr Ahmed Merani are themselves Kabyle Berbers. The scene would then be set for what has historically often been feared - a fight to the finish among a group of Berbers. The worst may yet not come to pass but Tuesday's New Year's eve celebrations in packed restaurants and hotels in Algiers had a slightly desperate touch.</p>

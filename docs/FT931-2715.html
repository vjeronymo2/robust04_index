			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Avonside declines to Pounds 4.56m Avonside Group, the building services and housebuilding group which operates in Scotland, northern England and Wales yesterday reported a pre-tax outcome of Pounds 4.56m in 1992 on almost static sales of Pounds 51.5m. In its first full set of results since flotation last March the group saw a 42 per cent decline from Pounds 7.88m but paid a final dividend of 2.2p for a total of 4p. Earnings per share fell to 7.08p (12.4p). Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman, said base rate fluctuations prior to the withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism had undermined confidence among housebuyers in the closing months of 1992. However, in 1993 an upturn had been identified following the reduction in real interest rates. Avonside also reported the Pounds 480,000 cash acquisition of a glazing company to complement its BS heating subsidiary.</p>

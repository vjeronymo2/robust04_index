Progressive Party President Alvaro Dias (Parana  State) said the government "makes too many mistakes, and is  clumsy."    In a conciliatory manner, Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais  State), PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] leader in the  Chamber of Deputies, agreed with President Franco, admitting  that the traditional absence of congressmen in Brasilia on  Thursdays represents a problem he has been trying to solve:    "We are going through a very serious crisis, and the  economic  plan should be fully supported by the Congress," he said.  [passage omitted]    Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who was charged  with  hindering the voting, said Franco's attitude against a weakened  Congress was cowardly:    "It is cowardly to threaten Congress. Realizing that  Congress is weakened, Franco wants to force it to approve a tax  increase. What he doesn't realize is that he is as weak, or  weaker, than Congress," Magalhaes said.    Refuting Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's  remarks  about breaking an accord for the approval of a tax increase,  Magalhaes said:    "I had no agreement with him. From the beginning I made it  clear that I was against increasing taxes," Magalhaes said.    He added that the Congress overcame its fragility by voting  against the government's proposal to increase taxes to be  collected from enterprises. He pointed out that Congress is not  responsible for the tax increase to be paid by individuals,  because it was proposed by the government:    "Cardoso cannot continue fooling the country with his  stewardess smile. I would like to challenge him to a television  debate," the governor said.    In Magalhaes' opinion, the government presented a plan based  only on tax increases. It did not propose any measure to hurt  the interests of the financial system or the oligopolies. The  Bahia State governor believes that these two sectors of the  economy would not be affected by an increase in taxes paid on  enterprises' profits, because the companies would cover this  difference by increasing prices, the consumers would end up  paying for it.    Magalhaes remarked caustically: "Franco is a fool."    Federal Deputy Delfim Netto (Progressive Renewal Party --  Sao  Paulo) said on 29 January that Franco should send a copy of the  letter he handed to the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies  and the Senate to each one of the 75 congressmen of the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and PMDB who did not appear  at Congress last Thursday, 27 January, to vote on the increase  in the enterprises' income tax.    Referring to the last part of President Franco's letter  calling for congressional support, Delfim Netto asserted that  the country is not ungovernable:    All the president must do is govern. The country has been  waiting for that. Everything else is empty talk and seeks to  justify what is not functioning. The country's governability  depends solely on him.</p>

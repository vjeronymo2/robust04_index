			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Citizen's Charter initiative slows THE flow of Citizen's Charters is drying up, Mr William Waldegrave, public-service minister, told MPs yesterday. So far some 27 charters have been published in following up the original initiative, but there are only another six planned over the next six months. The first of those, the much-delayed Courts Charter, will be published tomorrow, along with the white paper on progress with the Citizen's Charter programme.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco production cuts send nickel prices higher THE NICKEL market was sparked to life yesterday, first by rumours of a strike at Norilsk in Russia, the world's biggest producer, and later when Inco of Canada, the second-largest, said that it would cut output this year by about 10m lb (4,500 tonnes). Inco said that its highest-cost mine would temporarily close and holidays at its Ontario division mines would be extended. Analysts suggested Inco hoped to stop the nickel price falling. Nevertheless, at the close last night the London Metal Exchange price of nickel for delivery in three months was up Dollars 57.50 a tonne at Dollars 7,530. Earlier, the price had been buoyed by the Norilsk strike rumours. These helped push three-month nickel to Dollars 7,535 at one stage. However, Reuter last night reported Russian sources as saying there were no labour problems at Norilsk. Inco said it would suspend production at its Shebandowan mine near Thunder Bay, Ontario, for three months. About 350 contract employees are affected. Inco will also extend from four to five weeks the planned summer holiday shutdown at Ontario division mines. Analysts suggest the 10m lb production cut represents about two per cent of Inco's previously scheduled 1992 output. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda group, said: 'This won't push the market higher on a sustained basis, but it will help to stop the price moving below Dollars 7,200 (a tonne)'. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary, also suggested the cut would have little impact on nickel prices given the level of LME stocks (down 66 tonnes yesterday to 26,202 tonnes) and the market's expectation of more Russian nickel exports. He said another Russian boat carrying 11,000 tonnes of nickel left for Rotterdam yesterday 'and, when it has been cut, most of it will make its way on to the LME'. Refined nickel production in the western world reached 600,000 tonnes last year and the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy organisation estimates that this year output will be between 575,000 and 585,000 tonnes. It suggests shipments from Cuba and Russia will far outweigh imports by China, so western producers must trim output to halt further price falls, 'particularly as marginal producers are uncomfortable with prices much below Dollars 4 a lb (Dollars 8,816 a tonne)'.</p>

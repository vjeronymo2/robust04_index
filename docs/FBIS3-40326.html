			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miroljub Jevtic: "The Masks Have Fallen"] </F>   [Text] The arrest of almost the entire leadership of the  Montenegrin branch of the Party for Democratic Action [SDA],  including its president Harun Hadzic, precisely at the time of  the trial of their compatriots in Novi Pazar, displays the  party's real face. The authorities have found an arsenal of  sophisticated infantry weapons in the apartments and hiding  places of the leaders of this Muslim political party. The arms  were intended to be used for bringing down the Montenegrin state.    The masks have, therefore, finally fallen. After this, how  can anyone say that the critical remarks regarding the activity  and behavior of this party were exaggerated and an "expression  of inborn mistrust of the Muslims," which is how Alija  Izetbegovic's followers like to qualify them? When their  activity is linked with elements of the Novi Pazar indictment,  which stress that their [the defendants'] goal was to carry out  attacks on military buildings, the destruction of roads, and the  liquidation of undesirable Muslim and Orthodox citizens, then  the framework of the SDA mosaic is complete. To anyone who is  vaguely familiar with the described game of this party, and the  ideology that inspires it, this must have seemed inevitable.    From the very beginning, the founders of the SDA branches in  Montenegro and Serbia took as their basic ideological foundation  Alija Izetbegovic's political program, explained in the famous  Islamic Declaration. It is practically a declaration of war on  all those who think differently and quite directly stresses that  the Muslims not only can, but should use the most brutal  violence to stifle their opponents' resistance.    It is particularly important to note that the followers of  the SDA, particularly of its leadership, did not have a choice,  since the individuals in charge of purity of religion pointed  out that this was the only real Islam. The now already former  Reis Ul Ulema Jakub Selimovski, talking about Alija  Izetbegovic's declaration, said the following: "Alija  Izetbegovic's declaration expresses his opinion and views  regarding things in general, based on his religious education  and affiliation to Islam." Therefore, if the Reis himself -- a  man who interprets what is, and what is not correct according to  Islam -- says that Izetbegovic's declaration is based on real  Islam, then it is logical that Harun Hadzic and the others -- as  devout Muslims -- should act according to the norms prescribed  by their religion.    The Yugoslav public, and particularly the authorities, have  to be clear about the fact that this ideology will not stop  bringing forth new branches for as long as Islam does not  emancipate itself in the same way that Christianity has done,  based on the principle -- religion on one side, politics on the  other.</p>

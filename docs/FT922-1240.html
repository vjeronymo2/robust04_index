			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (14): Social life centres around funerals - Sulawesi ON Friday morning in Rantepao, capital of Tana Toraja in Sulawesi, the market comes to life. It is the day farmers bring their livestock to sell - buffalo, pigs and chickens - and the market, with its cacophony of farmyard noises and sharp smells, reflects the agricultural heart of Sulawesi. The farmers make their way from hillside homes, past thousands of acres of terraced paddy fields and small clusters of coffee, cocoa and clove trees. As an admirer of sows, I searched out the pig section of the market; Indonesia is the world's largest Moslem country but the people of Tana Toraja are predominantly Christian and have an affinity for pork. With their coats of dark, coarse black hair, the pigs are brought to market trussed up in twine and fixed on their sides to large bamboo trays, squealing loudly. Piglets fetch about Rp50,000 (Dollars 25), while adult pigs cost as much as Rp200,000. In a small covered square at the centre of the market lay about 150 pigs, their distressed trotters twirling in the air. The largest sow needed four men to be carried and must have weighed in at more than 20 stone. It brought a tear to the eye to imagine that the Empress of Rantepao was destined for the platter. Social life in Tana Toraja centres around funerals which, while presided over by Christian priests, are rooted in traditional religion and have as their centrepiece the slaughtering of pigs and buffalo. Families may save up for months or years for the funeral, keeping the deceased wrapped in cloth, waiting in a back-room. This also allows relatives living outside the district to make their travel plans. The largest funerals will be witnessed by several hundred relatives. Dozens of pigs and buffalo may be slaughtered and poorer families may take years to pay off the debt - a buffalo can cost Rp5m, more than four times Indonesia's annual per capita income. Government officials now attend funerals to collect a tax on each slaughtered animal but funerals have become, if anything, more lavish. They are also, with the broad support of the local people, an important tourist attraction. 'I was sat down by the grandmother of the deceased, a 10-year-old boy, who explained to me how the child had died of an illness, showed me the coffin and led me through the funeral ceremony,' said one tourist. A sanguine view of death is at the heart of the region's cultural identity which, despite recent generations leaving the region in the search for wealth, remains strong. In part this is due to its past isolation in the once remote hills of Sulawesi; it was only in 1905 that the Dutch colonisers subdued the area after a two-year war and forced it into a wider world. By the side of the road near the village of Lempo hangs a sign which reads 'Baby tree graves, 900 metres'. Down a red earth track and across a stretch of vivid-green paddy field is a small copse. In the trunk of a hardwood tree were dug three small cavities, closed off by rattan patchwork. Babies which die before teething are placed into the cavities; eventually the trunk will grow around the grave, embracing the child's corpse. Elders from noble families - Tana Toraja historically has a class system, now dying out - are buried in chambers chiselled into large rocks which scatter the landscape or in chambers in mountain cliffs. Outside the chambers, life-size wooden effigies are placed. It remains to be seen, however, how the region will cope with the demands of the modern world. Several large hotels are currently being constructed and it will have to come to terms with the negative aspects of tourism - foreigners wielding cameras - as well as the benefits of increased foreign exchange. Modern influences are already noticeable in the construction of new buildings. Tana Toraja is reknowned for its Tongkana homes; wood-panelled houses with large saddle-shaped bamboo roofs which curve sharply up at each end. Raised on poles, they are a glamorous sight, with gaily-painted walls and a central pole bedecked with the horns of buffaloes. The houses are an important symbol of wealth but they are also uncomfortable, with tiny windows and little ventilation. The new monied class often build airconditioned bungalows beside the traditional house, or come up with an architectural mish-mash placing the old Tongkonan structure atop a new concrete residence, like a cherry on a cake. What political demands of the region there might be - such as more local autonomy - are kept firmly beneath the surface by Indonesia's inflexible political system. Whereas the political campaign for the June 9 election brought millions to the streets in Jakarta, in Rantepao life seemed to drift on by. Either the region is solidly behind the ruling Golkar party, or disillusion has turned to apathy. However, with the mountain water slowly trickling through the paddy fields, buffalo lazily submerged in streams cooling off after a hard day's work and pigs snuffling contentedly in their stys, it is difficult to believe that anything but tranquility is brewing in Tana Toraja. It is a region resting in peace.</p>

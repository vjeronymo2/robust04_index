			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Gilts in for another bumpy ride - Capital &amp; Credit The Bank of England's rate cut, rising US bond yields following the Fed's unexpected tightening and talk of heavy overseas selling sent gilts tumbling last week, and amid the cloudy international interest rate outlook and a raft of UK data this week, the market is in for another bumpy ride. 'I expect gilts to remain volatile, with a downward bias,' predicts Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. In the past week, gilt yields rose by about 20 basis points across the curve, steepening to the 10-year area but flattening to the long end of the yield curve, he says. Some feel the market's recent poor performance against its European counterparts has largely run its course. Gilts dramatically underperformed German bunds in recent weeks, with the 10-year yield gap over bunds rising to nearly 90 basis points on Friday from 40 basis points on January 24. 'Gilts' underperformance shouldn't continue in any sustained way - spreads have widened out enough to offer a reasonable risk premium,' said Mr Ifty Islam, European economist at Merrill Lynch. But many still fear that the Bank's  1/4 point cut on Tuesday may have dented investor confidence, resulting in a higher risk premium for gilts. It was the size and timing of the rate cut that puzzled investors, leading many to wonder whether it had been politically rather than economically inspired. Not only did it come during a difficult time for the government, but it was followed on the same day by a Bank of England Inflation Report which warned that the risks of a rise in underlying inflation were greater than those of a fall. Some also felt that the small size of the cut reflected a compromise between the Treasury, which wanted a larger cut, and the Bank, which wanted none. 'The conclusion which is starting to be drawn is that the UK authorities may be getting too relaxed on inflation,' says Mr Shepperd at Yamaichi. However, others feel last week's doom and gloom has been overdone. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, argues that shares, gilts and sterling, vulnerable after their December rally, were 'set for a fall, more or less come what may'. In times like this, he argues, 'it is important to keep eyes fixed on the fundamentals: rates are still set to fall in France, Germany and the UK, and inflation is set to reach and sustain very low levels'. With inflation at the forefront of everyone's mind, Wednesday's publication of the January retail price index will be keenly watched. The market consensus is for the headline rate to have risen to 2.6 per cent from 1.9 per cent in December and for the rate ex-mortgages to have risen to 3 per cent from 2.7 per cent. 'This month's RPI numbers won't help gilts, but as the inflation picture improves over the months, gilts' yield premium should narrow back,' says Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers. 'Tactically, the rate cut was messily presented, but inflation evidence will eventually show it was justified.' Some are less optimistic. Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, warns that real commodity prices may rise as global demand picks up. Moreover, 'our expectation of a 10 per cent depreciation in sterling/dollar this year will also place upwards pressure on UK import prices', he says. Last, an increasing headline inflation rate, together with a strengthening economy, suggests UK earnings growth could rise, he warned. 'This is likely to be treated especially badly by the gilt market, as a precursor of higher inflation.' Gilts have also been vulnerable to the weakness in US bonds after the Fed's tightening. Investors have long judged the US experience as a guide for the UK, and 'with the Fed now tightening, the perception is that the next market to suffer in cyclical terms is the UK', says Mr Shepperd. However, while the short-term outlook for gilts remains glum, many expect a further rally, helped by a recovery in the bund market and several months of stable core inflation in the UK. 'Although gilts are further ahead in the cycle than most other European bond markets, we feel UK interest rates are likely to stay around current levels or even fall a little further from here, and we see no great danger arising from the inflation side at this stage,' says Mr Heinz Fesser, head of fixed-income at DWS, the investment subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. 'We haven't been sellers of gilts - actually, we bought some more on Friday to get in at the current lower levels.' A key test of overseas demand will come next week, when the Bank of England auctions gilts in the 2000 - 2004 maturity range. Foreigners favour 10-year maturities and given that this sector saw the biggest losses in recent weeks, a 10-year auction 'could be a good opportunity for overseas investors to switch back into gilts', says Merrill's Mr Islam.</p>

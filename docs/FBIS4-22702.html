			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Release by the press service of the Parliament of the </F> Kabardino-Balkar Republic: "Equal Development Opportunities for  the Three State Languages. From the Proceedings of the Soviet of  the Republic--Parliament of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic"]    [Text] After discussing very quickly the proposals  concerning Temporary Regulations of the Chambers of the KBR  [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] parliament, on which Kh. Shogenov,  deputy chairman of the Commission for Legislation, Legal Order,  Security, and Human Rights, made a report, the deputies moved on  to the draft KBR Law "On Education." It was presented by V.  Tlupov, chairman of the Social Policy Commission.    Let us note that an extensive draft was prepared by the  relevant commission of the Supreme Soviet in its time, but was  never passed.    According to the draft, the sphere of education is  proclaimed  to be a priority. A republic program for the development of  education which would be prepared and revised on a competitive  basis would be the foundation of the state policy of the KBR in  the area of education. All citizens of the KBR would be  guaranteed free general education and, on a competitive basis,  free vocational education. Conditions would be provided for  developmentally impaired children to receive education; those of  outstanding ability will be assisted in receiving an elite  education.    Having passed through the first section without much  disagreement, the deputies dwelt for a long time on the second  section devoted to education and national culture. Despite  clarifications from Z. Nakhushev, the speaker of the chamber, to  the effect that the law was being developed for the long term  (this is also stated in Point 3, Article 6 of the first section:  "State educational standards for new educational programs shall  be introduced, as a rule, five years after the beginning of work  under the programs in question"), members of the Social Policy  Commission who introduced the draft had to answer many questions  and stoically defend a number of its provisions and articles.    Citizens of the KBR are entitled to receive primary general  education in their native languages, as well as to select the  language of instruction within the framework of opportunities  provided by the educational system (Point 2, Article 7). In this  case, queried V. Protasov, why adopt Point 6 of the same  article: "The language of one of the indigenous peoples (either  Kabardin or Balkar), at the option of the student, as one of the  state languages of the KBR shall be introduced as a required  course in all educational establishments (general-educational,  secondary) in which instruction is offered in the Russian  language." It was explained to him that the language of  instruction and the subject of study are different things, and  that the three languages proclaimed to be the state languages of  the republic should have equal opportunity for development.    Differences over the language policy were quite substantial  and led to many hours of discussion which, however, proceeded  quite properly, in parliamentary form and expression. There was  no dearth of arguments from both sides, with each side trying to  convince the other that its particular arguments were weighty.  The polemics were protracted, and the words of KBR Deputy  Minister of Public Education V.V. Shibeleva, who attended the  proceedings, sounded, in a way, surprisingly conciliatory: "The  problem is indeed great, but the children have no doubts. They  have this subject (Kabardin or Balkar) on their curriculum, and  they study it in peace. Everything will be normal--given that  the approach is professional and the methodology is competently  developed. Nobody will be harmed by knowing another language."    They settled on this, although repeated disputes arose  later.  Thus, having read in Point 2, Article 8: "...Any politicization  of the history of KBR nations shall not be allowed," the members  of parliament began to have doubts: Is this possible? After all,  history in itself is politics. Nonetheless, they resolved that  they should strive for lay, unpoliticized education.    In two days the deputies covered only two sections out of  seven. Well, the draft law "On Education" is one that applies to  all without exception. In essence, the kind of society we will  create directly depends on this draft law. Therefore, such  painstaking work should be justified.</p>

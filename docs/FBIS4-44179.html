			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgar Auth: "NATO Reaction Force Put Into </F> Service"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 23 Jun -- The Multinational  Division, whose staff (leadership) is deployed in Rheindahlen  near Moenchengladbach, views itself as a "milestone in the  history of NATO and multinational cooperation." The armies from  Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Germany participate  with one brigade each in this "Multinational Division-Central"  [MND(C)], announced Lieutenant Colonel Ernst-August Petermann,  the press officer. Each of the four countries involved provides  a quarter of the staff members, and the position of the  commander in chief is subject to the principle of rotation. The  first commander in chief is Major General Pieter Huysman from  the Netherlands. His deputy is from Great Britain.    Depending on the kind of operation, the MND(C) can comprise  up to 20,000 men, Petermann pointed out. It is designed for  various kinds of operations: humanitarian aid, disaster aid,  safeguarding of peace, and "peacemaking measures if need be" --  that is combat missions -- the press release stated. Petermann  considers putting the division into service a "political issue."  He admitted that international operations will continue to be  controversial in Germany until the Constitutional Court passes a  ruling on the participation of the Bundeswehr in out-of-area  operations. In the event of a negative ruling, "we might have  to kick the Germans out again," Petermann told FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU. The lieutenant general would consider it "extremely  embarrassing" if the division one day had to be deployed without  German soldiers. Above all, the lack of a quarter of the  leadership would cause big problems, he stated.    The Bundeswehr has placed the 31st Airborne Brigade from  Oldenburg at the disposal of the MND(C). According to  Petermann, this brigade also includes a normal number of  conscripts. The main parts of the division are easily  transferrable. The Netherlands provides artillery, Belgium  combat helicopters, and Germany transportation helicopters and a  service battalion.    Petermann announced that NATO has been planning to set up  such a force since the middle of the 1980s. At the time of the  East-West confrontation it was intended as a mobile reserve unit  in the event of an attack by a Warsaw Pact state.</p>

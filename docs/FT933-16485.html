			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / A novel forger says sorry to Mellor: The hoaxer - This week claim, counter-claim and hoax over the Asil Nadir affair competed for attention in parliament and the press. FT reporters look at the latest twists in an increasingly bizarre saga THE MEDIA furore that has surrounded the Asil Nadir affair took another bizarre twist yesterday when it was revealed that the forged letter which linked the former cabinet ministers Mr David Mellor and Mr Kenneth Baker to Mr Nadir had been written by a self-styled novelist living in Torquay. Mr Trevor Timbs, the author of the letter, now faces questioning by the police. Following a call from Mr John Major for a full-scale inquiry into the 'smear tactics' used over the Nadir affair, Mr Timbs yesterday sent an apology to Mr Mellor in which he said he 'deeply regretted' the incident. The letter, offered for sale last week to the Sun and Daily Mail newspapers, purported to be from Mr Mellor to Mr Nadir, thanking Mr Nadir for donations made to the Conservative party. Mr Timbs yesterday said that he had produced the letter on a computer as a joke while he was writing his novel, taking the forged letterhead from a letter that Mr Mellor had written to Mr Timbs a year before. According to Mr Timbs the letter had been shown to Mr Nic Szeremeta, a former journalist friend, who had faxed it to the newspapers in London. Mr Szeremeta yesterday said that he had believed the letter to be genuine. Mr John Darby, the solicitor acting for Mr Timbs, confirmed that Mr Timbs met with the Daily Mail and Sun newspapers last Monday, and had been offered money to reveal his sources. However, he had then told the Sun on Tuesday that the letter had been a fake. 'This letter was never intended for publication. It was faxed on without his knowledge,' Mr Darby said. Mr Mellor said he was glad that the matter had been cleared up. 'I hope this puts an end to this kind of silly dirty trick of which we see too much these days,' he said.</p>

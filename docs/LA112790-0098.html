			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> AFTER-HOURS TUTORING FOR MINORITIES  </P> <P> At precisely 2:50 p.m., the bell rings at Buena Park Junior High School,  sending excited students scrambling for the bus. But while her classmates  hurriedly make plans for the evening and gossip about the day's events, Kenya  Jamison buckles down for another hour of work.  </P> <P> The eighth-grader isn't staying after school because she is in trouble, but  rather because she chooses to. A slender girl with dark-brown eyes and a  penchant for volleyball, Jamison wants to go to college.  </P> <P> "I have a 2.86 average," she explained in between math problems. "I really want  to get it up to at least a B."  </P> <P> To improve their grades, Jamison and 28 other students have volunteered to put  in extra hours at school. They are participating in a pilot program sponsored  jointly by Fullerton College and local schools that is geared for students who  have the potential to go to college but who, for some reason, are not doing  well.  </P> <P> "We are dealing with a society that has changed dramatically," said Richard  Ramirez, dean of student support services at Fullerton College. "We are  recognizing that we have to do more than stay on campus."  </P> <P> For these "at-risk" students -- many from ethnically diverse backgrounds and  low-income families -- it is a matter of being pointed in the right direction,  he said. Besides lacking economic support, they frequently don't get course  materials that suit their needs. "Often it is a question of not having a  curriculum that culturally different folks can identify with," Ramirez said.  </P> <P> To give students this sense of connection -- and keep minority students from  dropping out -- Ramirez and other school officials decided to bring part of the  college experience to them.  </P> <P> Fullerton College has allocated $24,000 to get the special tutoring program off  the ground. So far, six junior high and high schools in Buena Park, Fullerton  and La Habra have elected to participate.  </P> <P> The money is used to help provide an hour of free tutoring every day. To create  a sense of responsibility and a "college-like" atmosphere, the students have  the choice to show up or not. Typical high school rules don't apply, such as  the prohibitions against eating and talking with friends.  </P> <P> "We didn't want it to be like a classroom," said Debbie Diaz, coordinator of  the Learning Center at Buena Park Junior High School, where the tutoring  occurs. "The kids don't have to be here. . . . We tell them that. We are not  mandating anything, just providing the service."  </P> <P> Parents also get involved with group meetings and are taught how to encourage  their children to do well in school. Moreover, there are field trips to local  colleges.  </P> <P> This month, for example, the students visited Fullerton College. Other stops  will include Cal State Fullerton and a private school.  </P> <P> For Jamison and several of the other students, the trip to Fullerton College  was the first look at higher education. "At first I thought it was just going  to be more school," Jamison said. "But it looked exciting."  </P> <P> Some students said they actually like the tutoring they receive. "It is good,  because you feel free to ask questions," said Jeff Cervantes, who would like to  attend USC. Cervantes, who wore a "Learning Center" sweat shirt, said that the  program's popularity has spread around campus. "At first other people would  call us stupid because we need tutoring," he said, "but when they found out  about it, then they wanted to get in."  </P> <P> On a typical day, seven to 10 students show up for the tutoring session. The  class is led by a student from Fullerton College and peer tutors like Alejandro  Vazquez, an eighth-grader with a 3.71 grade-point average. Vazquez, 13, said he  enjoys helping his friends. "When I came from Mexico, I didn't know English,"  he said. "People helped me, so I want to help them back."  </P> <P> The students work on subjects they are having trouble with, and when they  finish, they are free to leave. They are also permitted to work in groups or  get individual help with the tutors.  </P> <P> Although the program began only recently, Diaz, the program coordinator, said  she is astounded by the response, especially since the students must give up  free time to do schoolwork. "When we first started, I thought if we got five or  six kids it would be great," she said.  </P> <P> To date, however, as many as 29 have signed up, and more are showing an  interest.  </P> <P> "They are coming," Diaz said. "It is wonderful."LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

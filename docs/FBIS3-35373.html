In their meeting last night,  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and PLO representative  Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] failed to overcome the disagreements  between the sides. Our correspondent Yo'av Tocker reports that  the meeting lasted five hours ending without results. The main  dispute concerns the issue of joint customs duties to be levied  by Israel and the autonomy.</p>

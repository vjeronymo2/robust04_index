			<p>BFN     [Text] The Burmese junta's fragile ceasefire agreement  with some of its rival ethnic guerrilla groups is facing  breakdown with the possibility that fighting will re-erupt in  the northeastern Shan State.    Intelligence and ethnic sources monitoring the situation  along the Thai-Burmese border said several of the 11 armed  ethnic groups which are party to the ceasefire have expressed  their frustration over Rangoon's indifference to their political  objectives and demands for greater autonomy.    The groups have come to realize that they have little or  nothing to gain from the truce while the junta, better known as  the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), has  exploited the situation by claiming all the credit for the peace  pact, the sources said.    Most ethnic groups have not openly aired their  dissatisfaction. But the Wa guerrillas, the strongest group and  the first to strike a truce with Rangoon in 1989, have stood up  to express their views.    Forming the major and grassroots component of the Burma  Communist Party, the Wa in early 1989 revolted against the  ageing Maoist leaders and seized control of the communist  headquarters as well as large stocks of heavy weaponry and  ammunition supplied to the Party during the communist heyday by  China.    Karen leader Gen Bo Mya said recently he had received  information that some of the 11 armed ethnic groups "are very  frustrated" that there have been no political developments or  negotiations since the ceasefire was agreed. Some groups have  threatened to break the truce.    "There is no progress. They were told that if they want to  talk politics they must first lay down their arms and return to  the legal fold," he said.    Bo Mya also predicted that fighting would re-erupt. The  Karen leader's statement was confirmed by intelligence sources  and a Wa official who requested anonymity.    The official told THE NATION that the Wa are disappointed  with Rangoon's rejection of their demands for a Wa State. He  said bilateral relations have been "very tense" lately following  several incidents.    Among others, Rangoon has refused to consider or discuss a  proposal for the setting-up of the Wa State submitted by Wa  representatives to the National Convention, he said. The  convention was arbitrarily set up early last year by the Slorc  to draft the country's new constitution.    "The draft constitution only mentions seven states and seven  divisions," which do not include the Wa State, the official said.    He said a senior leader of the United Wa State Party  travelled from the Wa headquarters at the Sino-Burmese border in  Shan State to Rangoon at the end of April to reiterate the  groups' demand for a separate state. He said the Wa had  threatened to break the ceasefire deal with Rangoon unless their  demands for statehood were responded to positively.    "Just after we celebrated our 5th anniversary of the Wa  revolution against the Burma Communist Party on April 17, a Wa  leader went down to Rangoon. He warned the Slorc that without a  genuine Wa State, the (Wa-Slorc) ceasefire would not last long,"  he said.    The Wa official, however, said he did not know if the Wa  leader had yet returned from Rangoon and could not confirm a  report that he had been detained in Rangoon since the end of  April.    He said other armed groups were also unhappy with the Slorc  indifference to their political cause and demands for political  discussion but did not openly show their dissatisfaction due to  the military weakness of the groups.    "The Wa is holding the key to the success of the Slorc's  truce with other ethnic groups. If the Wa ceasefire breaks  down, other groups will follow suit as we are the largest  group," he said.    The Slorc has for the past several years pressed the Wa to  reduce the number of its estimated 25,000-30,000 troops to  3,000, a demand rejected outright by the ethnic guerrillas.    The latest incident contributing to the worsening of  Slorc-Wa  relations was the Wa's discovery at the end of January of 87 C-3  and G-4 guns hidden in 3,000 sacks of rice rationed every month  to the guerrillas as part of the bilateral ceasefire agreement,  according to the Wa official.</p>

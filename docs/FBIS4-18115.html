			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Piller, president of the National </F> Association of the German Aviation and Aerospace Industry, by  Peter Schmalz; place and date not given: "Europe Is Not Ready  To Follow the German Model"]    [Text] [Schmalz] As early as one year ago, Fighter-90 was  supposed to take off. It has now been given the name of  Eurofighter and still has problems flying. Is this project,  which involves enormous sums, too big for the industry?    [Piller] Let us talk about the name. The name Fighter-90  developed -- similar to the term "great bugging campaign" -- as  a result of public discussion. Eurofighter is not the final  name either. One should always give things a name that  describes the contents properly. What is important is that it  is a European air defense aircraft.    [Schmalz] But the air defense aircraft is not yet able to  fly. Is the project too complicated?    [Piller] It is complicated because it is one of the most  extraordinary high-technology projects in Europe. However, it  is certainly not too big a challenge for the European aviation  industry in the technological sense. Quite the contrary. With  projects like the Tornado and the Airbus, the Europeans have  proven that they are capable of top achievements. The Tornado  is the best fighter aircraft of its kind, and the Airbus family  belongs to the technical vanguard in the civilian aviation  industry. Yet the difficult political process of arriving at a  decision did not promote the project. You can imagine how  difficult it is to tell a crew of thousands of technicians and  engineers alternately to stop and to continue their work.  Moreover, there was the crash of the Gripen interceptors...    [Schmalz] ...a Swedish prototype.    [Piller] ...which requires great care. We must not forget  that aircraft of this kind are aerodynamically unstable. Only a  highly complicated control mechanism keeps them in the air. The  software is of decisive significance here because we do not want  to take any risks. Also, there is no hurry because, if the  European combat plane is to be bought by the Bundeswehr in the  year 2002 or even 2003, it will still be early enough if the  maiden flight takes place some time this year.    [Schmalz] The problem regarding software seems to be that  numerous countries and an even larger number of firms are  involved in the development.    [Piller] I am not sure whether this is the reason for the  delay. Cooperation is difficult because it took such a long  time for the four responsible countries to agree on the tasks  that the aircraft has to fulfill. The borders in Europe were  also a problem. Goods are involved here that fall under the war  weapons control law. I have repeatedly been informed about  delays that were linked with the German foreign trade law -- if  components had to be transported to other European countries,  for example, that had to be integrated into a subsystem. In  fact, we always claim that we no longer want any borders, but we  Germans are doing a great deal in this sphere to maintain the  borders and to prevent European harmonization regulations.    [Schmalz] When will the first European fighter fly?    [Piller] We are confident that the first prototype built by  us in Manching will make its first flight late in the spring.    [Schmalz] The industry is being accused of juggling with the  prices. Might this still lead to a failure of the fighter plane?    [Piller] I do not think so because, on the basis of the  offer submitted by the industry, the prices mentioned at the  time are being adjusted according to a certain procedure. This  is one aspect. On the other hand, however, one must bear in  mind that a development project extending over several years is  involved here upon whose completion a decision will be made as  to whether it will be purchased or not. This is an unusual  case. Moreover, the responsible officials have not made any  final statements as to what the aircraft should look like and,  above all, how many units are to be produced.    [Schmalz] Will the aircraft be produced on a large-scale  basis?    [Piller] I proceed from this premise because I still believe  in a certain rationality among politicians. If politicians  think rationally, they must be aware that national defense and  fulfilling the duties within the alliance are not possible  without national armed forces. As the example of Yugoslavia has  shown, these duties cannot be fulfilled without a functioning  air defense.    [Schmalz] Is the awareness of the need for defense  decreasing?    [Piller] Yes, indeed. Yet the pendulum has starting  swinging in the other direction again. Shortly after  reunification and the collapse of the Soviet Union, 85 percent  of the Germans were convinced that eternal peace would break  out. However, a glance at the newspapers shows that we are  confronted with a larger number of conflicts that also affect  Europe today than at any time in the past.    [Schmalz] A man like Zhirinovskiy might also open people's  eyes...    [Piller] As a citizen of this country, I hope that we will  realize our interests, opportunities, and dangers without such  phenomena. However, the awareness that vigilance and readiness  for defense continue to be necessary is certainly being promoted  by people like Mr. Zhirinovskiy.    [Schmalz] Your employer is the German Aerospace Company,  which offers a considerable range of military products. How do  you feel about the term "weapons concern"?    [Piller] I have two different feelings. First, the  precondition for your question does not exist because the share  of defense technology in the German Aerospace has dropped to 27  percent. Second, I believe that stability and peace must be  paid for and defended if need be. To ensure that, products are  required that must be developed and produced. In Germany, the  term weapons industry belongs to the arsenal of rhetorical and  semantic warfare. It certainly has a negative connotation in our  country. However, I would like to use it in a positive way and  claim: Possessing weapons means having the required instruments  for all vicissitudes of life. In the private sphere, this is a  matter of course for us. We take out insurances for household  equipment and against fires and old age insurances, and we  attach utmost significance to a good education for our children.  Should all this be wrong in the public sector?    [Schmalz] A controversy erupted at the international  aviation and aerospace exhibition in Berlin two years ago over a  wooden model of the Fighter-90. This year the German Aerospace  does not participate in the exhibition. Is there a link?    [Piller] The decision was exclusively made on economic  grounds. The management believed that the costs for the  participation were too high in view of the closure of works and  the reduction of jobs.    [Schmalz] The threat was heard in German aerospace circles  that production might be transferred abroad. Has Germany become  too expensive for you?    [Piller] There can be no talk of a threat because we are  confronted with natural economic laws that cannot be avoided.  If we close plants and reduce jobs, this means that we are  adapting our structures to competition and the economic  development in the world.    [Schmalz] If the economy should recover, industrial jobs  that have been eliminated under great difficulties will  certainly not be restored easily.    [Piller] You are right. We are slowly starting to realize  that numerous legal stipulations, collective agreement  provisions, and other regulations have become unintended  barriers that have a negative impact on the economy. Jobs that  have been abolished under difficult conditions and high costs  will in all likelihood not be recreated in Germany. The wage  cost factor is only one aspect. The ossification of old  structures and the difficulty to change and adapt them are an  equally strong factor.    [Schmalz] You just mentioned the war weapons control law.  Do you consider it to be part of the ossified structures?    [Piller] The German position on the export of military  equipment and goods that can be used for civilian and military  purposes is increasingly turning out to be the big obstacle to  European integration. In fact, we like to stress day in, day  out, and particularly in Sunday speeches the need of  integration. Yet the unilateral German measures are a barrier.  The aviation and aerospace industry suffer particularly.    Contrary to the tank and shipbuilding industries and the  production of ammunition, up to 80 percent of our projects are  carried out on the basis of international cooperation. If we  want to survive, we will have to prove our ability to cooperate.  However, this means that our partners must be able to rely on  our deliveries. Experience has shown that particularly the  French and the British no longer want to depend on internal  German developments. European cooperation is increasingly  taking place without the German industry. We know that the  British and the French are already developing technologies for  the successor generation of the Tornado and the European air  defense aircraft. Initial talks have already taken place without  the Germans because we are no longer considered reliable  partners. If we stick to our position, there will no longer be  a German defense industry over the medium term. And there will  certainly no longer be a military aviation and aerospace  industry, because an industry that is not able to cooperate will  cease to exist in this area.    [Schmalz] You are cooperating intensively with the French  on the helicopter project Eurocopter. There is considerable ill  feeling over our "dual use" regulations.    [Piller] The helicopter is a classical "dual use" example.  Like numerous other products, a civilian helicopter can also be  used for military purposes. There will never be a satisfactory  solution to this problem. Yet we should stop convincing Europe  that we have the only right standards and yardsticks. Europe is  not willing to follow the German model.    [Schmalz] You sound as though you were announcing the death  of the German high technology industry.    [Piller] In any event, the situation is very serious.  However, I am confident that the awareness of these dramatic  developments is also growing in Bonn and, above all, in the  Foreign Ministry.    [Schmalz] Thus, you are still hoping?    [Piller] My hope is based on some signs that can only be  discerned with a very sensitive instruments.    [Schmalz] Have you discussed this topic with the candidate  for chancellor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]?    [Piller] I had the opportunity of holding a longer  conversation with him. I have the impression that the awareness  of this problems is also increasing in the SPD on a broad basis.    [Schmalz] Both the United States and France are proud of  their successes in the aviation and aerospace industry. In  Germany, one has the feeling that the strategic significance of  this industry is not being recognized.    [Piller] Unfortunately, your description of the situation is  not wrong. Yet we are convinced that the aviation and aerospace  industry belongs to the great technological potentials of the  future.    In the United States, in Japan, but also in China and other  Southeast Asian countries, and naturally in France and Great  Britain, it is being recognized as an integrating part of the  economy for structural, technological, and political reasons.  In Germany, this awareness does not exist, but we are all  making efforts to promote it.    [Schmalz] Who is "all"? The teachers, for example?    [Piller] This is an important point: I believe that we must  also set new priorities in the sphere of education. Natural  science and technical training are not accorded the required  significance. In Japan, the share of engineers and natural  scientists among younger people is three times as high as in  Germany. This has an impact on the acceptance of technology.    [Schmalz] Is that a hidden call for political leadership?    [Piller] I have a very old fashioned concept of political  leadership which was shaped when I was still cooperating closely  with Franz Josef Strauss. For me, political leadership is  convincing people of what is necessary. This requires the  courage to tell people that we need an economic basis for a  national weapons industry, and that we urgently need the  technological potentials of the aviation and aerospace industry.    [Schmalz] If a teacher called you, asking you for advice on  how he can convince his students, what would you tell him?    [Piller] I would advise him to take his students on a mental  journey and to ask them to imagine a world without aviation and  aerospace industry. It is the driving technological force of  the national economy in the industrialized countries and an  indispensable precondition for ensuring our living standard in  the future, because this is only possible with the help of the  most advanced technology of the aviation and aerospace industry.  In a science fiction film oriented on the past, one would have  to do without the usual weather chart, and the live transmission  of a tennis match from Flushing Meadow would be impossible.  Without satellite communication, without the mobility ensured  by airplanes, and without the exploration of space, our lives  would be completely different. I am firmly convinced that we  only discovered the vulnerability of the earth's atmosphere  after we started moving outside our planet. The mental trip  would also make the students realize that the world would be  different politically and economically. The GDP would only be  50 percent of the current volume, and starvation, oppression,  and dictatorship would stand at twice the current extent. For  me, it is no historic coincidence that the Soviet Union and many  other dictatorships collapsed at a time when it became possible  to spread information on freedom and justice across borders with  the help of telecommunications.    [Schmalz] Let us return from the mental journey to the  tough reality. The conflict over subsidies between the European  and the North American aviation industries was not resolved in  the GATT round. Will a hot trade war break our in the air?    [Piller] I hope not. Yet the following must be clear: The  GATT negotiations represent a defeat for the European aviation  industry because distortions of competition that threaten the  existence of European aviation and which favor U.S. air carriers  have been adopted. The United States is no longer interested in  serious negotiations because it achieved its goal without talks  -- the abolition of direct European subsidies. The United  States will continue or even increase its extensive indirect  subsidies for the civilian aviation industry, which currently  amount to $2.7 billion annually, because these subsidies -- and  particularly the military subsidies -- are not covered by the  existing GATT disciplines. In view of the U.S. interests, it is  imperative to create a suitable set of promotion instruments  within a German or European framework. The simplest solution  would be for the United States to stop subsidizing the research  and technology projects of their industry with enormous sums.    [Schmalz] The Europeans are also supporting the Airbus with  sizable sums.    [Piller] Historically, the direct promotion system has  developed in Europe as a result of the numerous national states.  This means that in Europe the development and production of  large civilian aircraft is primarily being promoted through  repayable loans and state-covered credits. In the United  States, the indirect promotion of research and technology has  developed. Billions of dollars are being provided by the  defense budget for new technologies, engines, new wings, and  experimental aircraft every year. The results are placed at the  disposal of the industry.    [Schmalz] What sums are involved?    [Piller] This is difficult to say because there are also a  great number of black boxes in the United States involving  presumably between $2-3 billion -- projects that are subject to  utmost secrecy. We estimate the annual subsidies for our  competitors Boeing and McDonnel Douglas at $1 billion. This is  a massive distortion of competition that cannot be justified in  a private economy.    [Schmalz] What is the solution?    [Piller] The European Union should either persuade the  Americans to stop this promotion, or the European Union should  ensure that the Europeans receive the same subsidies.    [Schmalz] Boeing now wants to develop a super jumbo together  with the German Aerospace Company. Have the Americans chosen a  junior partner whom they would like to swallow?    [Piller] No, certainly not. This is not correct. The fact  that Boeing talks with the Europeans at all shows that we are  growing up and that we are being taken seriously as partners.  The project itself -- an aircraft with up to 800 seats --  requires enormous investments which neither the United States  nor the Europeans would be able to provide on their own. Only a  trans- Atlantic cooperation can handle the comprehensive  technological problems and the financial risks.    [Schmalz] The fact that the United States has chosen the  German aviation industry as a partner shows that it is not  completely at the end...    [Piller] No, but it is necessary to point out the  distortions of competition stipulated in the GATT agreement in  favor of the U.S. aviation industry and to remind the  authorities time and again that the political framework  conditions of the German aviation and aerospace industry have to  be improved if it is to remain efficient.</p>

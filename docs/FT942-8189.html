			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotunnel beset by concern over financing Activity was muted with individual stories taking precedence as markets anticipated Monday's holiday closure. PARIS eased back with considerable attention being given to the 'Euro stocks'. The CAC-40 index lost 9.92 to 2,155.43 in turnover of FFr4bn, off 1.5 per cent on the week. Eurotunnel saw volume of some 5.5m shares in reaction to early reports that it might have difficulty raising the cash it required from banks, with consequent effects on its ability to launch a rights issue. The shares touched a year's low of FFr31.60 before closing down FFr2.05 at FFr32.90. After end of business the group said that it had secured Pounds 600m from its banks and expected to close books on the debt next week. EuroDisney moved in the opposite direction, up FFr33.70, as creditor banks finally agreed the refinancing package. ZURICH was helped higher by transactions linked to the expiry on index futures and options. The SMI index rose 6.9 to 2,732 for a 1.9 per cent rise on the week. A study by Bank Vontobel concluded that small Swiss companies would outperform their medium and large size counterparts over the period to the year 2000. Mr Beat Philipp said that the study of 62 companies, representing 90 per cent of Swiss market capitalisation, pointed to 12 per cent average annual earnings growth, with banks, mechanical engineers and light electronics companies outperforming while insurers, building suppliers, industrial holdings, the power industry and brewers underperformed. UBS continued to make headway, adding SFr9 to SFr1,174, taking the rise over the week to SFr60. However, analysts noted that the stock fell by 30 per cent from its high for the year on February 4 to the low on May 9, as switching was seen into German banks. Roche certificates were steady at SFr6,635 after their bumpy ride earlier in the week. Natwest Securities said that it had upgraded its forecasts for the group as a result of the good first quarter results and the expectation that the Syntex acquisition would enhance earnings from 1995. FRANKFURT kept its attention directed towards the banking sector as disappointment over Deutsche Bank results on Thursday continued to ripple through the market. Activity was dampened by the fact the the market will be closed on Monday. The Dax index ended up 1.89 at 2,249.65, little changed on the week. Turnover was DM7.2bn. Deutsche Bank finished down a further DM2.70 at DM763.30, while Dresdner, which reported yesterday that operating profits over the first four months of the year had been 'satisfactory', went in the opposite direction, up DM3 at DM408. Lufthansa, up DM4.50 to DM199.50, benefited from a positive note from Hoare Govett yesterday. This said that with more cost savings to come and an agreement with United Airlines of the US a significant improvement in earnings could be expected. MILAN remained under pressure for the second straight day as foreigners continued to take profits and local investors showed a reluctance to make fresh purchases. The Comit index lost 18.05 or 2.3 per cent to 776.45, taking the fall over the week to 4 per cent. Fiat was again under pressure after its recent strong performance, losing L121 to L6,853, and Olivetti dipped L27 to L2,866. Against the trend, Ciga, the hotels group, surged L64 or 5.5 per cent to L1,228 in heavy volume of 22.9m shares, provoking renewed speculation about stake building. A L29 advance to L2,889 in Pirelli was attributed to its steeper than average falls in recent sessions. AMSTERDAM slipped back on options expiry and the Aex index ended down 2.76 at 412.77, little changed on the week. Royal Dutch, which went ex dividend, ended the session down Fl 5.60 at Fl 201.00.

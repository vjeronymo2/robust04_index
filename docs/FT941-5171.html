			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Swiss toll system could resolve lorry ban objections Sir, Anyone who has hiked in the Alps will share the Swiss and Austrians' environmental and aesthetic concerns about the growing volume of lorry traffic through their valleys. The approach chosen in the recent Swiss referendum, however, raises important questions as to how the problem should be remedied. Much editorial space has already been given to the political costs of antagonising Switzerland's European Union neighbours as well as Austria by closing Swiss roads to lorries by 2004. There has been less debate over the economic costs. It is a well-known fact that quotas introduce unnecessary distortions by failing to separate users at the margin from the rest. A system of toll points at the borders and within the country, with fares linked to distance travelled, weight per axle and emission, presents several clear advantages: By reflecting the marginal costs of environmental and road-damage, the fares would push marginal freight transit towards alternative forms of transport (eg: rail); Revenue raised from the tolls could be used in financing the development and expansion of trans-Alpine rail networks, thus capturing a greater proportion of actual lorry cargo (and demonstrating the applicability of the system to Austria); Although the scheme would involve imposing fares on domestic traffic (removing one of the major sticking points with Switzerland's over the present discriminatory proposal), it may nevertheless be acceptable to Swiss voters, in view of fare structure described above which would primarily hit long-haul international traffic; From a practical point of view, the region, by nature of its geography, will not suffer from the diversion of lorry traffic onto minor roads, as is the case in France; A toll system might be more acceptable than a quota system to the EU with respect to existing transport agreements and within the framework of potential EU membership by the Swiss. By installing a toll system, the Swiss could not only limit political objections and solve their environmental problem, they could also set the example and the pace for their immediate neighbours with the same concerns, as well as for those nations toying with the idea of road-pricing as a means of reducing congestion.

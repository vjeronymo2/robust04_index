			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CABLE SYSTEM LETS PAIR OF FILM BUFFS REVIEW THE CLASSICS  </P> <P> Two local film buffs are bidding to become the Siskel and Ebert of the Tustin  scene, reviewing movie classics that appear on the basic cable package offered  by American Cablesystems.  </P> <P> William Gray and Bruce Potter, who have regular jobs outside the entertainment  business, have begun a twice-monthly show on Cablesystems' public-access  Channel 33 in Tustin. The system has 8,500 subscribers, the company said.  </P> <P> The half-hour shows are repeated at 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday for 2  weeks. Each segment reviews six movie classics scheduled to appear on the  system's basic services, along with promotional clips from each one. Another  six upcoming films are mentioned briefly.  </P> <P> A "movie map," displaying where and when the movies are shown, is also  provided. This enables viewers to set their videocassette recorders to tape  such movies as "King Kong," "Mutiny on the Bounty" and "On the Waterfront."  </P> <P> The main problem, Gray said, is that "there are lots of great films that we  can't find enough time to talk about."  </P> <P> Gray, who has reviewed movies on a campus PBS television outlet in Utah, said  he hopes that the program will be picked up by other systems owned by American  Cablesystems, which is a subsidiary of Continental Cablevision, the  third-largest operator in the country.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is make it generic" by identifying movies according to  the cable network rather than the channel numbers assigned on the Tustin  system, Gray said.

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Banks take interest in credit cards - Moves in a fight to keep lucrative business US financial institutions, fearful of losing ground in one of their most lucrative businesses, are pulling every lever they can find to keep their credit card holders and affiliated retailers happy. American Express took the unprecedented step this week of cutting its commission on food and drink bills charged to its green and gold cards. It was responding to a threatened boycott by recession-hit restaurants in Boston. It will reduce the fee on a sliding scale, with large restaurants getting a half-percentage point drop to 2.75 per cent. Citibank, by far the country's biggest credit card issuer, recently launched a service which guarantees that its card-holders pay the lowest prices available on the goods they buy. The bank says it has received claims numbering 'in the hundreds' since the promotion began three weeks ago. Some banks are also bringing down the interest rates they charge on outstanding card balances. First Wachovia, the Atlanta-based super-regional bank, this week offered the lowest rate of any leading issuer - a floating rate of prime plus 2.9 percentage points, which at present translates to 11.9 per cent. The Dollars 39 annual fee is higher however, than most other cards. Chemical Bank, the 20th biggest issuer, is also introducing a floating rate on its Visa and MasterCard, though at considerably higher rates than First Wachovia. Financial institutions are loathe to lose card-holders at a time when many other parts of their business are under pressure. First Chicago, whose 6.6m accounts make it the country's third biggest card issuer, raised Dollars 91.5m in credit card fees in the first three months of this year, equal to 34 per cent of its total non-interest revenue, and up from 26 per cent last year. Furthermore, the banks are realising that in a mature market it is cheaper to hang on to an existing customer than to pull in a new one. Mr Jerry Craft, executive vice-president at First Wachovia Card Services, says the bank hopes that its new low interest rate will enable it to reduce marketing and customer-retention costs. The banks are facing severe competition for card business not among themselves but from a growing number of other issuers, the most aggressive of which is American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the telephone company. By forging links with small banks, AT&amp;T last year gained Visa and MasterCard franchises for its Universal card. It then marketed the card vigorously by waiving the annual fee and offering lower interest rates than the 19.8 per cent quoted by most money-centre banks. The Nilson Report, a California-based publication which tracks the credit card business, estimates that AT&amp;T had by last December vaulted into sixth position among card issuers, with 4.5m holders. Sears, the Chicago-based retailing and financial services group, is now trying to get a Visa franchise through its purchase of a failed savings and loan institution. Its Discover card is already the third most popular card. Despite the recession, the credit card business continues to grow. The number of cards in circulation in the US grew by 9.1 per cent last year to 293.4m, and billings jumped by 15.4 per cent. But the fruits of this growth are by no means being spread around evenly. Visa's market share, now at 43 per cent, is growing. MasterCard at 26 per cent and American Express at 24 per cent are losing ground. American Express set aside Dollars 50m in the first quarter for credit write-offs on its cards. It ascribed the modest 2.2 per cent rise in the number of its US cards in the first three months of this year to stricter screening of applications and 'an intentional tightening' of its marketing efforts. But many American Express competitors show no sign of easing up on their promotion campaigns. While the biggest banks are generally loathe to succumb to public pressure for lower interest charges, their packages of 'services and benefits' to card holders keep expanding. Citibank, for example, has left its interest rate on its Visa and MasterCard unchanged since 1981. But it now offers, among other things, extended warranties on purchases made with its cards, discounts on long-distance phone calls, plus the latest price guarantee scheme. Five years ago, the 25 biggest Visa and MasterCard issuers accounted for about 47 per cent of the market. That slice has now grown to 60 per cent. Mr David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, predicts that the intensifying rivalry will inevitably lead to the biggest issuers getting even bigger, at the expense of their smaller rivals.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Tandem Computers TANDEM Computers' third-quarter results will be below plan as well as below analysts' estimates, and will reveal an operating loss for the period, Reuter reports from Cupertino. The company also said it would announce details of a restructuring designed to reduce costs when it releases quarterly results on July 28. Tandem attributed its disappointing third-quarter results in part to a slowdown in orders due to customers waiting for a major product announcement from the company in the next few weeks. 'With this new product announcement, Tandem will become the price performance leader in high availability online transaction processing systems and servers,' the company said.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> VALLEY ROLLS TO FOURTH STATE TOURNAMENT BID IN ROW  </P> <P> Some basketball programs devise unique little slogans during the season to  inspire the team to achieve a goal.  </P> <P> The Valley College women's basketball team doesn't have a slogan, a mascot, or  even a huge following, but the Lady Monarchs continue to fulfill their highest  goal.  </P> <P> That goal is the junior college state tournament. For the fourth consecutive  year Valley (29-5) will represent one of four Southern California teams in the  tournament, thanks to a 76-52 win Saturday night over visiting Mt. San Antonio  College in a Southern regional qualifying game.  </P> <P> Both teams had trouble getting their offense going in a foul-plagued first half  that saw 36 fouls called.  </P> <P> The Mounties committed 20 turnovers and Valley took a 36-25 intermission lead  by winning a free-throw contest (16 for 27).  </P> <P> The referees let the teams play in the second half and the No. 2-seeded Valley  went on an 11-0 run during a three-minute span midway in the half to put the  game away.  </P> <P> "The game involved a game of depth," Valley coach Doug Michelson said. "We have  unmatched depth on our bench through all 14 players. It has helped us all  season long but it really surfaced in tonight's game."  </P> <P> Depth, indeed. Eleven of 13 Lady Monarchs who played in the game scored, with  sophomore guard Christine Rumfola leading the way with a team-high 20 points  and forward Sandrine Rocher adding 10.  </P> <P> Valley also dominated the boards, outrebounding Mt. SAC, 57-38, and took  advantage of 33 Mountie turnovers.  </P> <P> Mt. San Antonio (21-10) was led by 6-2 center Kim Hansen, who had a game-high  25 points in the Mounties' first-ever appearance in the Southern California  Regional.  </P> <P> The state tournament which begins Thursday at College of the Sequoias in  Visalia will pit Valley, last year's state runner-up, and three other Southern  California Regional winners from Saturday night's action against four teams  from the northern qualifying region for the state championship.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Small companies thrown a lifeline A Pounds 1BN SWITCH of resources over two years to help ease the burden of the much-criticised uniform business rate was a central part of the chancellor's attempt to revive business and rekindle political support among traditional sympathisers. In what the Confederation of British Industry described as a 'prudent and positive' Budget, Mr Norman Lamont directed much of his help towards small companies. Within the small-business community, there was a welcome for changes to the uniform business rate (UBR) and for plans to take most family companies out of the reach of inheritance tax. The Federation of Small Businesses described the plans as 'life-boat' measures. Some of Britain's largest companies also welcomed the package, saying that aid for smaller businesses would filter through to assist their own prospects. Mr Lamont rejected further reductions in corporation tax and resisted calls from industry for an improvement in capital allowances to boost investment. The cost of higher allowances, he said, would be much higher than the resulting level of new investment. Apart from specific assistance for the hard-pressed motor industry, Mr Lamont concentrated on measures intended to help as many businesses as possible. Industry welcomed the decision that no business properties will face an increase in the UBR, above the 4.1 per cent rise due next month, although there was disappointment that the chancellor had rejected calls for a total freeze.</p>

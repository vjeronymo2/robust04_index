			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cochabamba, 24 Feb -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada, commenting on the "rapprochement" with Chile, stated  here today that "diplomatic relations are not resumed based on  conditions; conditions are not established for this."    He added: "It is when one sees that the Chilean people, the  Bolivian people, have experienced a true change in mentality  that there is true acceptance, that there is hope for  negotiations. Many people in Bolivia maintain that we must not  resume relations until we establish conditions, but this leads  nowhere. What one has to see is the moment in which the Chilean  people, the Bolivian people, are willing to start true talks,  negotiations, and thus work toward a first meeting."    Sanchez de Lozada said that "things are changing rapidly,"  as  are the countries, and therefore this is "a subject that  requires, as I have stated before, audacity and prudence."    The chief of state insisted that the subject must be handled  "seriously" because "domestic policy is one thing, and  international policy another." "There was a feeling that if I  attended this presidential inauguration [Chilean President-elect  Eduardo Frei's inauguration on 11 March] it would be a sort of  acknowledgement, a tacit resumption of diplomatic relations. I  think there are chances that this will happen at some point, but  I still do not have a deadline nor a date set for restoring  relations. We will see what happens with time, but we thought  this was not the appropriate moment. But neither was it a  matter of turning the invitation down, so we thought the best  solution would be to send someone close to me who at the same  time did not belong to the government, and I think we have come  up with an imaginative solution."    However, consulted about the significance to Bolivia of the  landlocked subject, he said: "Well, the sea problem has existed  for more than 100 years, and we are not going to solve it with  my wife's visit, but it represents a rapprochement. It is very  hard to hold a dialogue with someone with whom you have no  relations. You must talk to reach an understanding. We believe  this was the adequate solution, and a step forward."    Sanchez de Lozada referred to the invitation extended to him  by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, which he termed  "important." The president ended by stating: "This is how one  starts a rapprochement, trying to find the right moment for this  rapprochement process so it can result in something concrete and  to the benefit of the Bolivian people."</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Observer: Community service Roger Levitt, famously bankrupt financial adviser, didn't have such a bad weekend after all. On Friday he avoided a jail sentence despite pleading guilty to fraudulent trading. Then on Saturday he watched Arsenal Football Club win a close-fought battle - two goals to one - against Newcastle United at Arsenal's London home turf, Highbury. At the match Levitt occupied a familiar spot, a private box. In his glory days, when Pounds 34m losses were but a distant speck on the horizon, he had a box of his own. Now Levitt must make do with one belonging to his friend Panos Eliades, an accountant and financial backer of heavyweight boxer Lennox Lewis - another interest they share, since Lewis was promoted by Levitt before he ran into his sticky patch. The lack of his own box did not perturb Levitt. Chomping on a foot-long cigar, he remarked: 'Arsenal haven't played better for months,' an assessment no doubt bolstered by his own easier breathing. Still, however chuffed, Levitt chose not to sport his own rather special Arsenal shirt. When his cash was in greater supply he is thought to have paid Pounds 4,000 for the Gunners' shirt worn by Michael Thomas when Thomas scored the winning championship goal against Liverpool for Arsenal four years ago. Arsenal's detractors, peeved at the club's success, refer to it as Lucky Arsenal; but where would we all be but for a bit of luck?</p>

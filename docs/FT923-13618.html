			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (14): Growing awareness - Foreign aid and charities JAPANESE private contributions to Third World charities are on the increase in what is regarded as one sign of the country's growing public awareness of global problems. Although critics may contend that the response of the Japanese public is long overdue, there are several historical reasons for the reluctance of the individual Japanese to become involved in charitable enterprises abroad. The Japanese traditionally have relied on the government to solve most social problems outside the individual's own environment. Although charitable giving is strong in Japan, it is normally confined to those in one's family, company or neighbourhood. This reflects the Confucian tradition, which promotes reliance on the group. The Japanese government's role as one of the world's largest aid donors to the developing world has discouraged private aid. The country's foreign aid amounted to Dollars 11bn last year. Buddhist Japan also lacks a strong overseas missionary tradition similar to that of western countries, while its post-war quest to catch up with the west led it to ignore less developed countries. The refugee crisis of the Indochinese 'boat people' in the late 1970s, however, was the first event that pierced the public's post-war isolationalist attitude to the problems of the Third World. Several Japanese student groups sent volunteers to the refugee camps in Thailand. This activity created the foundation for the growth of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) engaged in international development co-operation. There are now an estimated 270 Japanese non-profit organisations dealing with Third World issues, although this constitutes only 1.3 per cent of the total number of private foundations in Japan. Many have been established by former student activists who believe that the government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme does not devote enough resources to grass-root development projects. Critics argue that ODA aid is mainly used to promote industrial projects that will benefit Japanese companies. A shortage of both funding and volunteers, however, still presents serious problems for the Third World NGOs despite growing public support in recent years. Although private contributions to Third World charities are approaching Y15bn, a third of that amount is designated for the Japan chapter of Unicef and the Foster Parent Plan. More than 100 organisations must compete for the rest. 'The average budget of a NGO is quite small, about Y20m,' according to Mr Hiroyuki Yumoto, deputy director of the Japanese NGO Centre for International Co-operation, which represents 35 groups in the Tokyo region. The financing problem has been eased somewhat by the creation, three years ago, of the Voluntary Deposit for International Aid, a postal deposit system to help Third World nations. Under the system, Japanese can donate 20 per cent of the interest from their postal savings accounts for Third World projects. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) distributes the money to selected NGOs. More than 5m Japanese participate in the fund and will give an estimated Y2.4bn this year. The MPT has become the biggest government financial source for the NGOs, exceeding the small amount of money given by the Foreign Ministry. Some of the funds are used to attract personnel for NGO projects in the Third World. 'Although we rely on volunteers to carry out much of the administration, we need to find skilled people to operate the programs in the Third World,' said Mr Hisashi Shibata, senior programme officer for the Japan International Volunteer Centre. 'They need to be paid because they often have their own families to support,' he explains. 'It is growing difficult to find skilled technicians, especially when there is a labour shortage in Japan.' Nevertheless, a spirit of optimism prevails among the Japanese NGOs. 'I believe that the country's prosperity is convincing the Japanese that they have a responsibility to areas of the world that are less fortunate,' said Mr Yumoto. 'It is my hope that the NGOs have reached the turning point where they find wide acceptance and support in Japan.'</p>

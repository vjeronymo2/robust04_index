The thieves, who fired their weapons at Carabineros officers as  they fled, seized 15 million pesos.    Eight Lautaro Group members tried to simultaneously hold up  two banks on the corner of Suecia and 11 September Streets.  However, they only managed to hold up the Santander Bank. The  presence of Carabineros on the corner prompted the group  planning to hold up the Citibank branch a few meters away to  flee.    As they fled, the delinquents fired their weapons at a group  of policemen travelling in a patrol van. Once again a woman was  seen firing a machine gun. [passage omitted]</p>

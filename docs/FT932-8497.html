			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Bank move puts Mexico on new path: Making economic reforms stick IN A country where few if any institutions limit the power of the president, the decision this week to grant Mexico's central bank autonomy over monetary policy is a historic break with tradition. For the first time in memory, a Mexican president is willingly ceding control over a key instrument of economic policy, not just for himself, but, barring more changes, for his successors. The immensity of the change has itself bred scepticism, with many doubting that the central bank could withstand presidential pressure in a conflict of wills. But if the bank buckles, it will not be for want of legal backing. The constitutional amendment granting independence, and subsequent regulations governing the constitution, will make the bank as independent as the German Bundesbank or the US Federal Reserve, government ministers say. The amendment gives the central bank full autonomy over its credit, meaning that the government cannot borrow from the bank to finance its deficits. It gives the bank a governing body that cannot be easily removed, since board members' terms of office will be staggered, and long (probably six to eight years). The bank will be legally bound to pursue monetary policy congruent with price stability. In the short term at least the constitutional amendment does not imply significant changes in monetary policy - the administration of President Carlos Salinas has never borrowed money from the central bank. Interest rates are set in the market, by investor demand for government paper, supply of paper in the primary market by the finance ministry, and central bank intervention in the secondary market. Since the federal government is now running a budget surplus, if it does not like the market interest rate for its debt, it need not offer the paper. But were the government having to finance a budget deficit, it would either have to accept the market interest rate on its debt or instruct the central bank to buy through the market government paper at below market rates. This latter move will now be unconstitutional. In short, the constitutional change will ensure that in the future monetary policy will be independent of fiscal policy - in contrast to the 1970s and 1980s when fiscal indiscipline provoked monetary expansion and inflation. If the government wants to issue debt it will have to pay the rate the market demands. Monetary policy will thus be geared to price stability and short-term liquidity needs. A problem might arise when the government's exchange rate target conflicts with the central bank's commitment to price stability. A government official says that, as in Germany, exchange rate policy would remain the prerogative of the finance ministry, but a regulatory law would be drawn up to decide who had authority over policy areas of common interest to the government and central bank, such as banking supervision. Nevertheless, if conflicts arose between the central bank and the president, some analysts doubt that the bank could prevail. Many supposedly autonomous Mexican institutions, such as the Federal Electoral Institute, or the Supreme Court, have rarely exercised independence. The government says it has chosen to push through the reform now to consolidate the macroeconomic reforms of the past decade and institutionalise the commitment to low inflation, believing central bank independence has to happen after, not before, stabilisation. Inflation has responded to tight monetary policy and fiscal surpluses, falling from nearly 160 per cent when President Salinas came to power in December 1988 to 10.4 per cent in the year to April. But concerns over the vulnerable state of the economy will have played their part. Uncertainties over both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the race to succeed President Salinas could yet unsettle financial markets and provoke a run on the peso. The autonomy of the central bank is one way of re-assuring such markets that economic policy is not going to change. President Salinas will also have the luxury, at the outset, of choosing the head of the central bank and all the other board members - the figure five has been mentioned. There is speculation that Mr Miguel Mancera, who has been head of the central bank since 1982 and who recently turned 60, may soon retire, safe in the knowledge that his long ambition of central bank independence has been obtained.</p>

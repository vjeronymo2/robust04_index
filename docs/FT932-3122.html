			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Abiola claims Nigerian win NIGERIANS waited anxiously yesterday for official confirmation that business baron Mr Moshood Abiola had won the country's presidential election, Reuter reports from Lagos. The National Electoral Commission said it was carefully checking results from Nigeria's 30 states before announcing the winner of Saturday's poll. Leading newspapers were in no doubt, reflecting victory claims by Mr Abiola and his Social Democratic party. 'Abiola surges ahead,' said the Daily Times, Nigeria's biggest-selling newspaper. It said he was set for victory over the only other candidate, fellow-Moslem millionaire Mr Bashir Tofa. Mr Tofa and his National Republican Convention members started moves to try to get Mr Abiola disqualified on a technicality.</p>

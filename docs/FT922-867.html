			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Northern Ireland talks stalled A FRESH delay to the 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland's political future looks set to prevent formal discussions taking place this week, Ralph Atkins writes. British and Irish ministers have failed to agree a date for a bilateral meeting, with local parties attending as observers, which had been assumed to be the next stage of the talks. Although a meeting today or tomorrow cannot be ruled out, Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, is expected to be at the European Community summit in Lisbon, almost certainly preventing a meeting before early next week. A deadline of the end of July has been set for the completion of all talks.</p>

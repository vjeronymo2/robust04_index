			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Businessman Gabriel Lewis Galindo confirmed to RPC  Television this afternoon that he has accepted Ernesto Perez  Balladares' offer to hold the post of foreign minister beginning  on 1 September. Gabriel Lewis Galindo was Panamanian ambassador  to Washington in the last months of negotiations on the canal  treaties and during the entire process of the ratification of  the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. His actions were crucial to the  ratification of the treaties. The Panamanian industrialist's  business relations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, as well as  his diplomatic maneuvering ability, will be exploited by the  Perez Balladares administration in its efforts to strengthen  diplomatic and trade ties with all countries.    Lewis Galindo's acceptance of the Foreign Ministry post is  the first confirmation of the formation of the multiparty  cabinet promised by Dr. Perez Balladares during his presidential  campaign.</p>

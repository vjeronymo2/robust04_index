			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Austrian carrier sees losses more than double AUSTRIAN Airlines' losses more than doubled to Sch251.7m (Dollars 23.6m) in the first half in spite of a sharp increase in traffic volume. But Mr Anton Heschgl, president of the majority state-owned carrier, forecast that it would make a profit in the full year and pay 'a reasonable dividend'. The airline blamed the sluggish economic performance in its main markets plus 'the tariff situation' for the loss, which compares with a loss of ASch107.1m in the same period of last year. The company decided to draw down Sch125.6m from valuation reserves, thus reducing the loss to Sch126.1m.</p>

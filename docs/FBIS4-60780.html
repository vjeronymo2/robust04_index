			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 29, BNS -- The Lithuanian Supreme  Court on Friday [29 April] sentenced eight former Soviet  activists to varying jail terms for participation in a failed  coup attempt in January 1991.    The trial started last December. The eight were first  charged with anti-state activities but the accusations were  changed to milder ones as the trial proceeded.    The court sentenced Valeri Ivanov, former leader of the pro-  Soviet Yedinstvo (Unity) movement, to 3 1/2 years in jail. The  court said Ivanov helped Soviet troops to guard the Lithuanian  radio and TV building that was seized Jan. 13, 1991. On that  day, 13 civilians were killed and hundreds more injured  defending the TV tower and state institutions from Soviet tanks.    The court failed to come up with evidence proving that the  defendants organized assaults on radio and TV buildings.    Ivanov will have to spend only 5 months in jail because the  time since his arrest was included in the punishment and the  amnesty law was applied. Some of his accomplices, who were  sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail, will be imprisoned for less  than a month.    Two out of eight former activists were fined 1,500 lits and  one was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in jail.    Aleksandr Smotkin, who set off two grenades near a  Lithuanian  border post in November 1991, was sentenced to an eight-year  jail term. The state prosecutor said the explosions endangered  the lives of four Lithuanian officials, who escaped death only  by mere chance. The amnesty law was not applied in Smotkin's  case, but the time since his arrest was included in the  punishment.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (21): Travelling hopefully rather than arriving - There was a brief flurry of enthusiasm when the Conservatives won the general election, but thereafter corporate Britain found it difficult to find the path to recovery / United Kingdom FOR THE top British companies, 1992 will be remembered as the year when recovery did not arrive. Not only did the domestic economy remain stubbornly dormant, notwithstanding early sightings of recovery's green shoots, but there was also a growing realisation within corporate Britain that recovery when it did come would be slow and undramatic. After a brief flurry of enthusiasm once the Conservative government had secured another term in office in April, companies were again travelling hopefully rather than arriving at the start of the recovery path. By the time sterling left the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System on 'Black Wednesday' - two weeks before the end of September cut-off date for the FT 500 table - the FT-SE 100 index had drifted 10 per cent to a little above 2350, close to an 18-month low. Even with the benefit of the post-Black Wednesday recovery, September ended with the FT-SE 100 down 2.7 per cent. Against this gloomy backdrop, it was not surprising that UK-based property and construction companies, two of the hardest hit sectors in 1991, were again some of the worst performers within the FT500. Trafalgar House, the hotels, shipping, construction and engineering group, had the most dramatic fall, tumbling out of the list from its position in the top 200, after the company's profits evaporated and the previous year's profits had to be restated as a loss. The shares regained some of the lost ground after Hongkong Land made a tender offer in October. Other companies in the sector fared little better; Hammerson Property, Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey, were hit to varying degrees by what is turning out to be one of the longest recessions in that sector. All of these companies, committed the sin of cutting their dividend - a sin, that is, in the eyes of investors even if the surgery was essential for the patients' health. Similar dividend reductions by Sedgwick, the insurance broker, Pilkington, the glass makers, and British Petroleum, received similarly rough treatment by investors and they all lost ground in the table over the year. Departing the list following sharp changes in sentiment, were Body Shop, the cosmetics group, and Albert Fisher, the food retailer, two 1980s companies which demonstrated that what goes up quickly can fall just as quickly. Also in the down-but-not-out category was BET, the business services group that has been a victim of over-zealous expansion in the 1980s. With the dividend in doubt and the core companies still in some unexciting service areas, the shares fell in spite of a balance sheet largely refurbished through a rights issue. Lonrho, the international trading group headed by Mr Tiny Rowland, was another to fall from grace, as profits ran out of steam and investors started to see concentration of power as a liability and not an asset. While growth remained elusive, stocks with limited recovery potential but which are considered resilient to recession were again in demand. Glaxo, the pharmaceutical giant that has in its stable the hugely successful anti-ulcer drug Zantac, consolidated its 1991 rise by jumping over BT to become the UK's largest company and the second largest in Europe. Also a beneficiary of enthusiasm for pharmaceutical stocks was Smithkline Beecham which leapt ahead of BP, British Gas, Hanson, ICI and BAT Industries. On the other hand, Fisons, the pharmaceuticals group, slid to number 215 (80), as it ran into registration difficulties in the US - partially resolved since the year-end. The marked contrast with the fortunes of Glaxo demonstrate perhaps that in the search for new drugs, there is room only for the extremely large. While corporate merger and acquisition activity was limited in 1992, the year's most successful takeover saw the departure of one of the oldest names in British banking - Midland. After a battle with rival Lloyds Bank, HSBC (the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp) swallowed Midland. Fuelled by the euphoria in the Hong Kong market - at least until Governor Chris Patten unsettled things by picking a fight with the authorities in Beijing - HSBC entered the FT500 chart at number 19 and immediately bounded further ahead to become the FT-SE 100's strongest performer of the year. Other newcomers to the FT500 made less spectacular entrances. But MFI Furniture Group, which had laboured for years under a mountain of debt that financed its management buy-out, made it to the market in the early summer. Like many of the other post-election flotations, MFI suffered from the public's lack of interest in the new issues and its shares fell following flotation before perking up after Black Wednesday. Bouncing back after losing their way in the late 1980s were two former forces in high street retailing - Burton Group and Storehouse. The latter which owns the Mothercare and BHS (formerly British Home Stores) chains, was another group reversing the move towards creation of conglomerates. Storehouse began a robust recovery, and announced it was selling its Habitat stores and Conran's Habitat in the US and the Richards fashion shops in the UK to focus on its core. Food retailers, the other great force in the high street and a sector that has traditionally done well in recession, had a mixed year. J Sainsbury edged higher in the table, as did Argyll, owner of the Safeway chain, which began to close the gap between its rating and that of its larger rival. Tesco, on the other hand, slipped under pressure from Sainsbury which appeared to be tightening its grip on the number one slot in the sector. The real winners in the sector were Kwik Save, the budget retailer where a budget shopping formula struck a chord with consumers; and Iceland Frozen Foods Holdings which made its debut in the FT500. Perhaps the most interesting changes in the FT500 this year will be among the conglomerates, which had mixed fortunes in the year to September. BTR edged ahead in the table, but has outperformed since the September cut-off date after a rapid and apparently trouble-free integration of Hawker Siddeley, the aerospace company. Hanson, on the other hand, slipped and is now seen to be under some pressure to do a deal. Tomkins was one of the sector's largest risers. Its purchase of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling and baking company after a head-to-head contest with Hanson, should continue that momentum.</p>

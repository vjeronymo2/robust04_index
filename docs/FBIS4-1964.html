			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 5 (AFP)--Chinese honored their dead  Tuesday [5 April], as police kept a close eye on families of  pro-democracy demonstrators killed five years ago in the  Tiananmen massacre. Crowds gathered at the large Baboashan  cemetery west of the capital to celebrate Qing Ming, the  festival of the dead.    Hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents went there to  honour the memory of the deceased, in turn attracting hoards of  flower and wreath sellers and funeral workers, who plied a  lucrative trade. There were also a number of police, both  uniformed and in plain clothes, armed with still and video  cameras, and portable telephones.    Access to Babaoshan, as with other major cemeteries in the  capital, was banned to foreigners, who were challenged before  they could even step foot inside the graveyard by hordes of  police demanding to know who they were. Since the bloody  crackdown on the pro-democracy movement on June 4, 1989, Qing  Ming in Beijing has been a date dreaded by the authorities.    Families have been forbidden from the simple act of of  burning incense for their dead relatives because of official  fears that the accompanying laments might degenerate into slogan  chanting against the communist party and the government. This  year, five years after students began their protest on April 15  for greater democracy and an end to corruption, the situation is  even more tense.    Since the start of the year, the authorities have been  unsettled by increasingly acute social problems and an uncertain  political situation as paramount leader Deng Xiaoping approaches  his 90th birthday in August.    The authorities have also been confronted by increasingly  active dissent, prompting a new wave of repression.    As evidence of their worries, Tiananmen Square has been  ringed day and night by police since Monday. "I haven't been  able to go out for Qing Ming because there are too many police,"  said the father of one 19-year-old youth killed in 1989, whose  urn is in Wanan cemetery at the foot of the Fragrant Hills.    "It's not that I'm afraid, just that I don't want trouble,  and the mood is too tense," he said, adding that some parents of  the Tiananmen dead still went to the graves. The families of  those who died on June 4 are close to each other and take turns  to go the cemeteries. Over Qing Ming, they meet and telephone  each other.    Ding Zilin, a philosophy teacher, goes often to Babaoshan  and  Wanan to tend the urns of the young people massacred by the army.    She lost her only son, Jiang Jielian, a 17-year-old high  school student. But her child does not rest in the cemetery.    Ding, who recently signed an open letter to the authorities  demanding democracy and the release of all imprisoned  dissidents, keeps his ashes at home. The urn sits on a small  altar near photos of the teenager.    "For me, Qing Ming is everyday," she said.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Books: Tales from the Raj - The heyday of the ICS ANGLO-INDIAN ATTITUDES: THE MIND OF THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE by Clive Dewey Hambledon Press Pounds 25, 292 pages This brilliantly written book evokes the Raj but does not glorify it. I would have thought that whatever had to be said about the Indian Civil Service (ICS) had been said by Philip Mason in two authoritative books, The Founders and The Guardians. Not so. The Mason books to a large extent dealt with events and achievements of the Raj seen through the lives of the civilians who ran the Raj machine. These books, it now seems, paid less attention to 'intellectual history and the influence of ideas'. Clive Dewey successfully breaks new ground and attempts an intellectualised treatment of the ICS through the lives and work of two middle-level civil servants, both allotted to the great province of the Punjab. Both were Cambridge men. Their response to India was as different as chalk from cheese. Frank Brayne (1882-1952) came to the ICS believing in the 'Gospel of uplift'; for Malcolm Darling (1880-1969) it was 'the Cult of Friendship'. Brayne was an Evangelist; Darling a Forsterian Humanist. Frank Brayne's hobbies were pig-sticking, riding and walking; Darling's were reading, writing, travelling and friendship. These two men were almost exact contemporaries and each spent 35 years in India. Such was the spell and romance of the Raj that young men out of Oxbridge went to India with a spring in their step and quickly learnt to come to terms with discomfort, disease and an alien environment. Some attempted to appreciate and understand the complex and ancient civilisation that they encountered and a few 'went native.' But a majority remained what Forster called 'a disagreeable lot.' The memsahibs, with few exceptions were more deadly than the sahibs. When Brayne and Darling arrived in the opening years of this century, the Raj appeared imperishable and the ICS, called the 'heaven born service', had kept the Raj machine well-oiled since 1858. By the time the two officials reached the midway point of their careers, Gandhi had made sure that the twilight of the Raj had begun. April 1919 was a turning point - General Dyer shot dead hundreds of peaceful and unarmed Indians in the Jallian Walsh Bagh in Amritsar and the Raj never really recovered from this self-inflicted blow. After the first world war the best and the brightest from Britain no longer opted for the ICS and the Indian component increased considerably, producing brown sahibs whom Nehru later described as the 'hollow men'. The author's view is that while most ICS men were 'eclectics', Brayne and Darling were 'doctrinaires', preaching and promoting their pet theories. It is an interesting approach and Dewey has made out a plausible case. If I have got him right, he would rather choose Darling for a companion than Brayne. So would I. Darling liked Indians; Brayne did not. Brayne wrote books about village India with pompous titles, while Darling quoted Tagore in his masterly studies of Indian village life. Brayne was an assertive propagandist, Darling was self-effacing. Brayne made a lot of noise about his village uplift scheme in Gurgaon near Delhi, which certainly attracted attention, but left no lasting impact. Mahatma Gandhi disapproved of Brayne's enthusiasms and said so. The civil servants knew each other well but were not friends. Darling was sympathetic to India's freedom movement while Brayne thought Indians lazy and unreliable. An assistant commissioner is quoted as saying. 'Today has been a most futile day, Mr. FL Brayne has arrived. He is quite widely recognised as a bore, and today he lived up to his reputation'. No one ever wrote such remarks about Darling. Darling befriended Indians and even tried to put some sense into his erstwhile ward, the erratic Maharaja of Devas, whom EM Forster immortalised in The Hill of Devil (dedicated to Malcolm Darling). Brayne and Darling were two sides of the Raj coin and Dewey has delineated their characters with a sureness of touch in a sparkling book which suggests that it was the cult of friendship, rather than the gospel of uplift, which survived the end of the Raj.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Resisting the bait of equity ownership: A look at the lack of a share culture in Germany For deep-seated social, psychological, legal and political reasons Germans have a problem with shares. They don't like buying or dealing in them, they don't like shares in their companies traded on the stock market, and they often can't talk about shares except in an emotional and illogical way, complains Mr Rolf Breuer. The chairman of the German Stock Exchange and a member of the board of managing directors at Deutsche Bank laments the absence of an 'equity culture' in Germany. Only 6 per cent of German households own shares, compared with more than 20 per cent in the UK or the US; there are only about 665 quoted companies in Germany compared with more than 2,000 in the UK; and the market capitalisation of the German stock market amounts to 25 per cent of GDP - against 75 per cent in Japan and the US and 127 per cent in the UK. 'This (lack of an equity culture) is a big and growing disadvantage for Germany at a time of increasing competition between the world's financial markets,' says Mr Breuer. 'Capital flows to wherever it finds the most attractive home - that is true both for multinational companies seeking to raise funds and for international investors looking for somewhere to put their money.' By these criteria, Germany's underdeveloped equity market is in the international 'second division', Mr Breuer complains, with the risk that big German companies will seek to raise finance in markets outside Germany and international investors will divert funds elsewhere. The evidence of this is low liquidity by international standards, an absence of domestic institutional investors, a hostility to financial innovation, an unthinking preference on the part of German savers for government bonds, and an unhelpful tax regime, according to the head of Deutsche Bank's securities operations. Such a litany of weaknesses raises the question: what is to be done to strengthen the German financial markets so that they enjoy a role commensurate with Germany's position as Europe's leading industrial power? Help is on the way from the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz - the Financial Markets Promotion Act due to take effect on August 1 - which will introduce international standards of regulation for the German financial markets. The law, first mooted in January 1992 and passed by parliament this month, introduces measures to bolster the Finanzplatz - Germany as a financial centre. The new law will: make insider dealing a criminal offence; create a regulatory body for the German securities markets, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur den Wertpapierhandel. This will evolve into a version of the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), policing financial markets; require quoted companies to publish details of shareholdings in other companies when they reach 5 per cent, rather than 25 per cent at present. Other rules will require prompt publication of price-sensitive information; allow the reduction of the nominal value of shares from DM50 to DM5, helping to enhance the attractiveness of equities by reducing the top-heavy share prices of some big German companies; facilitate the introduction of money market funds, a form of short-term investment vehicle which is popular in the US and France, but hitherto banned in Germany because of the Bundesbank's worries about the impact on monetary policy. However, the provisions are not enough to rectify the weaknesses in the German markets overnight, Mr Breuer concedes, although he says the insider dealing law will help to enhance the image of Germany as a financial centre. He accepts that it has long been anomalous for insider dealing to be permitted in Germany, but is adamant that insider dealing in Germany has been on a small scale compared with Anglo-American excesses. 'There is not and never has been much insider dealing in Germany,' he contends. 'But foreign investors have always had the impression that Germany is a wild west.' Mr Breuer also thinks the new disclosure rules will encourage greater transparency in the German equity market, and welcomes the creation of the German SEC. However, he admits that the structure of the new institution - which will introduce three levels of supervision of German stock markets - is not ideal, adding that it will take until 'the middle of next year' for the new body to be up and running. More must be done if Germany is to develop an equity culture, Mr Breuer says. His agenda for action falls into two categories. First, he would like to strengthen the legal infrastructure further with the introduction of rules for takeovers in Germany, preferably modelled on the UK's non-statutory Takeover Code. The main purpose of such a code would be to give rights to minority shareholders, whose interests are often neglected. 'If we are to have an equity culture in Germany the small investor has to participate.' Mr Breuer says a draft code will be presented to the Bonn Finance Ministry later this year. Second, he wants to introduce further reforms to the German Stock Exchange 'with the aim of ensuring that anyone who wants to do business in D-Mark denominated securities does it via the German market and not in London. 'Ten per cent of turnover in blue-chip German shares is done in London, and that is 10 per cent too much]' Part of the problem is that liquidity in share trading is still divided between seven separate stock exchanges in Germany, Mr Breuer says. But the creation of the Deutsche Borse - the German Stock Exchange - at the beginning of last year was a big step forward. 'Everything connected with securities dealing is now under one roof, from dealing and settlement to software development and clearing,' he says. 'To have it all together like this gives us a tremendous competitive advantage. We can streamline investments, pool our resources and develop technology much more effectively than our rivals.' Mr Breuer says the focus of development in the next few years will be investment in new technology to expand on the Ibis dealing system (which captured 30 per cent of the market in German blue-chip stocks last year) - and an attempt to forge closer co-operation between Frankfurt, the biggest exchange in Germany, and its six regional rivals. These efforts alone will not lead to the sudden development of an 'equity culture' in Germany, Mr Breuer concedes. The biggest obstacle lies in people's attitudes. 'When it comes to shares we have a mental problem on the side of both investors and entrepreneurs.' Those attitudes are changing and the Financial Markets Promotion Act is likely to accelerate that change.</p>

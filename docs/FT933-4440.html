			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / The Marseillais out of tune ONE PIECE of graffiti scrawled on a wall outside the Olympic Marseilles football stadium sums up the mood of the city - 'Seuls contre tous', or 'Alone against everyone'. Marseilles, one of France's most depressed cities, is already painfully accustomed to the loneliness of economic decline and political isolation. The Marseillais now feel more abandoned than ever after this week's decision by the European football authority, Uefa, to exclude Marseilles from this season's European Cup because of allegations of bribery by the club's officials. Anger will have turned to resentment when it was announced yesterday that rich rivals Monaco, from along the Mediterranean coast, had accepted the French Football Federation's invitation to replace Marseilles in the tournament. 'The French Football Federation could have done something,' said Mr Jean-Claude Boisson, a taxi driver who, like most in Marseilles, is a lifelong supporter of the local club. 'But they did nothing to help us - nothing. They're jealous of O-M's success, jealous of Bernard Tapie (the club's chairman) and they don't give a shit about Marseilles.' Mr Boisson's anger is typical of the reaction in Marseilles to the Uefa ban. Marseilles, like Liverpool and Naples, conforms perfectly to the cliche of an economically depressed city that has salvaged its civic pride through the triumphs of its football team. Marseilles, which once prospered as the main trading post between France and its North African colonies, has been in decline since the empire disintegrated. These problems have been aggravated by its political position. Marseilles, a socialist stronghold, was shunned by the Gaullist governments of the 1970s and by the socialist administration in the 1980s because Mr Robert Vigouroux, the present mayor, is an independent who clashed with the party establishment. The city's population has dwindled by 100,000 to 800,000 in the past decade. The level of unemployment is almost twice the national average at 20 per cent and reaches 30 per cent in the slums. But in recent years the Marseillais have had the consolation of watching their football team become France's most successful. 'It's the only thing we've got,' said Mr Mario Prossero, a fan. The Marseilles club owes its success to Mr Tapie, an entrepreneur who took over the club in 1986 after making a fortune by rescuing bankrupt businesses. He has since invested an estimated FFr130m (Pounds 14.8m) in the team. His generosity was almost certainly linked to his political ambitions. Mr Tapie has since 1989 been member of parliament for a nearby Bouches-du-Rhone constituency and was briefly urban minister in the last socialist cabinet. However, the football club has flourished, culminating in last season's triumph when it became the first French team to win the European Cup. The fans are now pinning their hopes on Mr Tapie, who hopes to stand as a future mayor of Marseilles. He will today hold meetings in the city with local officials and bankers, and then address the club's supporters at the stadium. 'He's helped us before and he'll help us again,' said Mr Philippe Marcaini, another fan.</p>

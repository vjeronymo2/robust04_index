			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / ABF held to Pounds 181m by fall in gilt market A Pounds 28m drop in investment income at Associated British Foods to Pounds 17m following the fall in the gilt-edged market held interim pre-tax profits growth to Pounds 5m, up to Pounds 181m, at the bread, flour, biscuits and sugar group. Interest charges fell from Pounds 15m to Pounds 13m. The pre-tax profit included a Pounds 29m gain on the group's investment in Berisford International, which compared with a Pounds 15m gain in 1993. Without that gain profits would have been Pounds 9m lower and the share price fell 15p to 583p. Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said the group's cash pile should be transferred into 'something capable of long-term returns greater than from gilts'. AB Foods last week announced a Pounds 35m acquisition of J Bibby &amp; Sons' agricultural business and Mr Weston said there could be more such deals. He said it was the sort of acquisition which 'pays off quickly' whereas a number of food companies on offer were expensive. Capital expenditure was Pounds 90m, while depreciation was Pounds 79m, and would exceed Pounds 200m for the year, he said. Even so, without a large acquisition in the second half, cash should be higher at the year end than the Pounds 501m in last September's balance sheet, he said. At the half-year end net cash stood at Pounds 356m, against Pounds 283m at the same time in 1993. During the first half AB Foods runs down its cash as it builds up sugar and wheat stocks after harvest. Operating profits in the 24 weeks to March 5 were 13.1 per cent ahead at Pounds 147m, up from Pounds 130m, on sales only 1 per cent higher at Pounds 2.06bn. Much of the gain came from higher productivity and greater efficiencies, Mr Weston said, including 1,200 job losses in the bakery division. Pressure from retailers was fierce with supermarket customers getting 'a little bit more bad-tempered', he said. Discounts on bread prices had increased by 3 1/2 per cent over the year, on a business with sales of Pounds 700m. Operating profits from manufacturing rose from Pounds 117m to Pounds 125m, including a Pounds 2m rise at British Sugar to Pounds 77m. British Sugar continued heavy investment. The Kings Lynn plant is closing while that at Wissington is doubling in size. Milling and baking profits together were ahead, and higher exports increased profits from biscuits and Twinings tea. Profits from Australia and New Zealand fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 16m as fierce bread price wars raged there. Retailing, largely in Ireland, improved profits from Pounds 13m to Pounds 22m as the price wars of the first half of 1993 had abated. Earnings per share were 4.8 per cent higher at 28.5p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 8.5p, and Mr Weston said any increase for the year would be reflected in the second payment. Lex, Page 22</p>

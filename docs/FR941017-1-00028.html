			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. The French DGAC advises that a Model A300&hyph;600 series airplane was recently involved in an accident during which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition. Investigation into the cause of this out-of-trim condition revealed that the flight crew may have attempted to override the autopilot while it was engaged in the COMMAND mode. If the airplane is in pitch axis, and the autopilot is overridden for prolonged periods by the flight crew via manual input from the control column, and if the autopilot is subsequently disengaged, the resultant out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator could reduce controllability of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further investigation indicates that the design of Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes does not provide for disengagement of the autopilot in a manner that would allow for manual input from the control column without adversely affecting controllability of the airplane. The design of Model A310 series airplanes is identical in this respect to Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The French DGAC issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;185&hyph;165(B), dated August 17, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. The French AD requires modification of FCC's having part numbers (P/N) B216ABM6, B350AAM1, B350AAM2, B350AAM3, and B470ABM1 (for Model A310 series airplanes); and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, B297AAM5, and B470AAM1 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The French AD references Airbus Service Bulletins A310&hyph;22&hyph;2036, dated December 14, 1993 (for Model A310 series airplanes), and A300&hyph;22&hyph;6021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes), as the appropriate sources of service information to accomplish the modification of the FCC's. However, Airbus Service Bulletin A310&hyph;22&hyph;2036, dated December 14, 1993, describes procedures for modification of only one of the FCC's, P/N B470ABM1, which is installed on Model A310 series airplanes; while Airbus Service Bulletin A300&hyph;22&hyph;6021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993, describes procedures for modification of only one of the FCC's, P/N B470AAM1, which is installed on Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. Upon accomplishment of this software modification, the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode above 400 feet radio altitude and whenever the pilot attempts to override the autopilot by exerting a certain amount of manual force on the control column.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the French DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the French DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of FCC's having P/N's B216ABM6, B350AAM1, B350AAM2, and B350AAM3 (for Model A310 series airplanes); and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, and B297AAM5 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes). Since the manufacturer has not yet developed a modification for these FCC's, these modifications are to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hanson indicates the next chairman Hanson's annual report has spelt out for the first time that Mr Derek Bonham is expected to succeed Lord Hanson as chairman. In his statement, Lord Hanson said 'the appointment of Derek Bonham as deputy chairman indicates the board's succession plans'. Mr Bonham, chief executive since April 1992, was made deputy chairman last month, and the stock market had taken this to mean that he would succeed Lord Hanson, who is 71 and due to retire in 1997. Mr Bonham is 50. Lord Hanson received a modest pay increase, from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds 1.36m, after suffering a cut from Pounds 1.38m in 1992. The group also referred to a 'tentative agreement' between the mineworkers union and the coal producers in the US, reached on December 7. It said, 'hopefully this will lead to an end to the US coal strike'. The strike, which began in February, cost Hanson Pounds 125m in the year to end-September. The accounts show Hanson made provisions of Pounds 481m on acquisitions, most relating to Quantum Chemical Corporation which was bought on the last day of the financial year. This was a much lower level of provisions than was made for the acquisition of Beazer in 1992 and Peabody in 1990, which required substantial provisions for environmental and health related benefits. In 1992 provisions on acquisitions totalled Pounds 1.69bn and in 1990 they were Pounds 2.1bn. There was a rise of Pounds 956m in provisions to Pounds 5.82bn, with exchange rate movements alone adding Pounds 823m to the total. Provisions utilised totalled Pounds 530m, partly offset by Pounds 199m of provisions set up during the year, most of which related to pensions and employee obligations. Hanson maintained its Pounds 100,000 contribution to the Conservative party and Pounds 15,000 to the Centre for Policy Studies. It gave Pounds 3.3m to charity around the world.</p>

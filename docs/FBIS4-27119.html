			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea made a speech at the banquet he hosted today  at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall in honour of His Majesty King of  Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk and participants in the roundtable  conference for peace and national reconciliation of Cambodia.    Saying he was very pleased to sit together with his Majesty  King Norodom Sihanouk and high-ranking leaders of Cambodia  participating in the roundtable, President Kim Il-song stated:    Your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk and esteemed  high-ranking leaders of Cambodia: I am very pleased to be with  your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk and high-ranking  leaders of Cambodia who have participated in the roundtable  conference for peace and national reconciliation of Cambodia  held in our country.    Your majesty esteemed king, your excellency Prince Chea Sim,  your royal highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh, your excellency  Prince Hun Sen and your excellency Khieu Samphan are all our  close friends. You are participants in the roundtable conference  of Cambodia as well as distinguished guests of our people.    I would like to bid a hearty welcome to you, our intimate  friends, and also sincerely congratulate you on your success in  the roundtable conference for peace and national reconciliation  in Cambodia which has been held under the guidance of your  majesty King Norodom Sihanouk.    I believe the fact that the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia  have held the roundtable conference in Pyongyang this time is an  expression of your friendship towards us and your trust in us.    The roundtable conference has been held by the direct  proposal and effort of your majesty esteemed King Norodom  Sihanouk, an outstanding patriot of Cambodia and father of the  Khmer nation.    Your majesty, with intense love for your country and a  strong  will, has devoted everything to the cause of the country's  independence and national dignity with unshakable confidence in  spite of the many tortuous events you have undergone from early  years. Today you are working energetically for national  reunification and unity and peace in your country.    Celebrating your traditional new year with the Cambodian  people since your return home from the visit to our country last  April, your majesty esteemed king has inspired them with great  confidence and courage and, in spite of ill health, has been  making unremitting efforts to deal with complex political  affairs. In particular, you have put forward a reasonable  proposal for achieving national reconciliation and restoring  peace in your country and have made various arrangements to put  it into practice. We speak highly of your majesty's noble  patriotism and outstanding statecraft.    Realizing national reconciliation and restoring peace in  Cambodia is an important matter which affects the country's  destiny.    Displaying a high degree of patriotism at the roundtable  conference, the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia have brought  about good results to meet the expectations of the Cambodian  people and the progressive people of the world, and thus made a  historic contribution to realizing national reconciliation and  restoring peace in Cambodia.    Cambodian people are a talented and diligent people who have  a long history and have created a splendid culture. We believe  that the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia and her people will  successfully build an independent, peaceful and prosperous new  Cambodia, in support of the noble will of your majesty esteemed  King Norodom Sihanouk. Your Majesty esteemed King:    The Korean and Cambodian peoples have established strong  ties  of friendship on the road of independence from early days and  closely supported and cooperated with each other. Our people  who value the relations of friendship and cooperation with the  Cambodian people will, in the future, too, work hard to expand  and develop the friendship with the Cambodian people and  actively support your majesty's stand for peace and national  reconciliation in Cambodia.    Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, I propose a  toast to the friendship and unity between the Korean people and  the Cambodian people; to the prosperity and thriving of the  Kingdom of Cambodia; to the good health and long life of your  majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk; to the good health of  your majesty Queen Norodom (Moniniet) Sihanouk; to the good  health of your excellency esteemed Prince Chea Sim; to the good  health of your royal highness esteemed Norodom Ranariddh and of  your excellency esteemed Prince Hun Sen; to the good health of  your excellency esteemed Khieu Samphan; to the good health of  various friends and comrades of Cambodia present here.</p>

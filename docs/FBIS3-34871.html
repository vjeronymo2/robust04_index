			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of </F> the Islamic Arab People's Congress, by Yusuf Khazim in Khartoum;  date not given]    [Excerpts] [Khazim] What is the status of the National  Islamic Front [NIF] in Sudan? Could it be described as the  government's party or is it indeed the government itself? If  not, what is its relationship with the regime?    [Al-Turabi] Observers of the dominant aspects of general  political life in Sudan should talk about the Islamic trend  because that trend is growing and developing in the fields of  education and all walks of civilized life, including the  cultural, economic, technical, and other aspects. That trend  has assumed several names but not as a traditional party  inheriting the same positions within the same structures. The  NIF did not only end when it was officially dissolved along with  all the Sudanese parties, but its own people also put an end to  it because after every political development in Sudan they  usually finished their political movement even when it took the  form of a party or a movement with a different name and  structure, fully different in its regional, class, and social  structure from the previous movement.    Truly, the NIF does not exist publicly or secretly, but the  majority of the trend which used to be the NIF supports the  current regime. But there are many waves of the Islamic trend  which the salvation government upholds, and many trends from  other parties which had a religious base have transformed their  traditional sectarian and partisan religious character into a  religious character that is now called fundamentalism abroad.    [Khazim] Is there a constituent framework embodying that  trend?    [Al-Turabi] The current political system does not represent  one political party. The NIF never believed in a one-party  government because that would not be in line with Islamic  principles. The political system consists of frameworks, not  parties. They are frameworks for consultation and free public  opinion. But if you look at the structure of the regime you  would find frameworks from known parties which, although they  were in disagreement in the past, are all Islamists in their  general outlook, with the exception of the Christians. Even the  Christians are aware of this general trend and they react to it.    The truth is that the NIF does not exist but political  observers always try to see a secret plot behind the apparent  signs and try to attribute that to one or several individuals.  A large number of the NIF leaders now play no part in the  general policy. The government and the new political regime are  endeavoring to present themselves as a general national Islamic  trend, a trend that is more comprehensive for the south and the  north than any former party. [passage omitted]    [Khazim] You were the NIF's leader and now you are  emphasizing that it does not exist in Sudan. How do we identify  you now?    [Al-Turabi] I am the secretary general of the Islamic Arab  People's Congress [IAPC] but I am also known worldwide as a  representative, in the general Islamic ideology, of a certain  trend in all the world and not just in Sudan. I respond to the  Islamic trend in Central and Southern Asia, Africa, and the Arab  world and I prefer to be associated with that trend  historically. [passage omitted]    [Khazim] Does the IAPC seek to bring all the Islamic  trends together within a particular constituent framework?    [Al-Turabi] We do not want to bring them together within an  organizational leadership-linked framework because every Islamic  reality has its own history and its own particular and different  issues, but the general Islamic trend also has a common cause  with trends in other cultures now upheld in the West, for  instance. There are now very close worldwide links. A human  being now is not confined to a certain nationality or region.  The various parts of the world are now open to one another in  their media, economies, alliances, security, and other  relations. That is why I want this trend to focus its vision,  which is derived from Islamic values, on the world challenges  and to address all the world and all its perceived historical  realities. [passage omitted]    We want to lay the foundation as to how this trend, as one  nation, should deal with other trends, hold a dialogue with  rational moderate Christianity, answer the sometimes fanatical  crusade campaigns which sometimes attack Islam without knowing  much about it, protect against the many tragedies Muslims are  currently suffering in all continents, and defend the Muslims in  these places in the media or supply them with the means of jihad  in defense of their rights. We want this Islamic trend to  provide defense against human injustice and address humanitarian  issues in general. The trend is now developing from its old  structure into these wider horizons.    [Khazim] In that context does the IAPC seek to change any  particular political situations?    [Al-Turabi] In its endeavor to reach all Islamic peoples,  the IAPC does not intend to attack any particular governments  because it does not want tense relations (with these  governments) that would put a barrier between it and the Islamic  peoples. Often governments isolate their people and do not  really represent their people. We want the Islamic peoples to  be open to one another but at the same time we do not want the  IAPC to have any tense relations because we do not want it to  represent an opposition to any particular regime. [passage  omitted]    [Khazim] How does the IAPC view the recourse to violence by  some Islamic groups in Egypt and other countries as a way of  changing the regimes in these countries?    [Al-Turabi] I do not wish to talk about any country in  particular, but I know that the current Islamic awakening is  throughout the Islamic world, certainly in the Arab world  because the Arabs have led the Islamic movement historically and  they are closer to the origins of Islam than non-Arab Muslims.  That is what I notice in North Africa generally and also in  other countries.    The new phenomena in the course of historical change might  be  acceptable to some old regimes and might be given freedom, in  which case they come cleanly and gradually contribute to the  positive evolution of realities, and perhaps resort to dialogue  about, say, the negative aspects of their views. But if they  collide with advocates of old realities seeking to maintain  their domination, concepts, and economic interests, pressures  might push them underground into secret and private activity  that would erupt in a form of jihad or something else, for a  government's violence and pressure is met with counterviolence  and pressure. I regret to say that most signs of mutual  pressures and conflicts were started by old ruling regimes  seeking to maintain their power. World events were all like  that, in France, Russia, China, America, and Britain.  Sometimes, however, the new movements hastily resort to  violence to the advantage of nobody or are forced to use  violence for lack of other means. That is a mistake. [passage  omitted]    [Khazim] Does the IAPC advocate dialogue in this connection?    [Al-Turabi] One of the IAPC's important characteristics is  that it has mostly advocated dialogue and recommended dialogue  between the various Islamic countries and between various forces  within Islamic countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen, and also  between regimes and groups seeking change, as in Algeria. It  recommended dialogue and tolerence. [passage omitted]    [Khazim] Isayas Afewerki, head of the Eritrean provisional  government, has accused you as NIF leader of forming the  Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement and has accused you of trying to  destabilize his country. He held Sudan responsible for the  infiltration of foreign gunmen across the borders to carry out  military operations against his forces. What is your reply to  these charges?    [Al-Turabi] First, Afewerki only left Sudan a few years  ago. Perhaps he was talking about the past when Sudan had  parties and the NIF and before that. The Islamic trends  supported the Eritrean liberation movement for dozens of years.  Afewerki himself used to visit it (the NIF) and get media  coverage from it.    True, the NIF tried to bring together the various (Eritrean)  Islamic trends and in fact did so in the Eritrean Islamic Jihad  Movement at a time when the Eritreans were forming movements for  the liberation of their country.    [Khazim] Why does he accuse you?    [Al-Turabi] Because he was talking about Sudan's old  history. The NIF hadsdone him very great services, which he  knows very well. I visited him in his home town after he  achieved independence and he visited me more than once in my  home after becoming president. Perhaps he got angry with the  Jihad Movement and judged it on the basis of what he knew about  Sudan. Now the Sudanese Government bans all activities of all  the Eritrean movements and fronts except the ruling "Popular  Front." [passage omitted]</p>

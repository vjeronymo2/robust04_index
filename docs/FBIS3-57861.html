			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of German Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party), the recent  threats by the Russian nationalist, Zhirinovskiy, do not  constitute a threat to economic relations between Germany and  Russia. In an interview with the Berlin-based national  newspaper DIE WELT (Wednesday [5 January] edition), Rexrodt said  Russian-German economic relations have "a sound basis" which  have developed out of "mutual interest." Their strength was  also proven in the difficult Cold War period.    Rexrodt stressed that "Yeltsin and the Russian Government  continue to consider the further expansion of economic ties with  the West as their top priority." It is clear to Moscow that the  industrialized states and the international financial  institutions play an important part in the reform process.</p>

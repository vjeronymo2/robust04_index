			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cambodia has reiterated its readiness for the  formation of a Thai-Cambodian parliamentary club as proposed by  house speaker Marut Bunnak. The issue was raised for discussion  early this week when Cambodian National Assembly chairman Chea  Sim met Mr. Marut at Parliament. He is visiting Thailand at the  invitation of the house speaker.    Mr. Marut says the formation of the Thai-Cambodian  parliamentary club will be raised for discussion at the upcoming  joint meeting of Thai, Lao, Cambodian, and Vietnamese  parliamentarians to be held from 27 to 29 March in Bangkok. He  says the setting up of the club will create a better  understanding between the Thai and Cambodian peoples. It is  also expected to help solve border and trade problems that may  arise between them.    Mr. Marut says Thai parliamentarians have given good  cooperation in the project. Thailand has already set up similar  clubs with the (?circles) of other countries.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / FT Conferences: Flood cover for London 'set to end' Insurance bought by many companies against London flood damage may be withdrawn as part of a trend by insurance companies toward limiting exposure to some large hazards, a risk specialist said yesterday. Mr Clive Pracy, head of risk management at London Transport, said that because of the withdrawal of cover for some risks, the setting of limits on policies and increasing premiums, buyers of insurance - not the providers - were taking over the role of risk-taker. London Transport is worried that a rising water table will increase the cost of keeping water out of the Underground. 'I less than cheerfully predict - particularly in my business - that flood risk in London will soon disappear as an insurable item,' Mr Pracy told a Financial Times conference on corporate risk management and the international insurance industry. He said that companies had yet to market insurance policies to fill the gap created by the ending of unlimited employers' liability cover in the UK from January 1 next year. Unless companies make special arrangements, most policies will be capped at Pounds 10m or less of cover. Mr Herbert Harrell, chairman of Harrell Associates, a US consultancy, told the conference that 'relationships between corporate buyers and sellers in the insurance industry are very poor, to the detriment of both sides'. But he said that part of the fault lay with companies buying insurance policies. Insurers were not seen as strategic partners in the same way as investment bankers. 'Risk is seen by senior general management simply as a cost factor, not as a potential source of competitive advantage,' Mr Harrell said. He said that, as well as controlling costs, companies should be concerned to obtain insurance cover that was denied to competitors, a fast response from their insurance companies and expert advice in judging and lessening risks. Mr Walter Kielholz, executive board member at Swiss Reinsurance, said that the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products was not cost-efficient. He said he was 'amazed at the portion of premium that gets lost on its way from the original risk to the ultimate risk carrier'. The obvious conclusion was that the 'risk carrier has to get closer to the risk'.</p>

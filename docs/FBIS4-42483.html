			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ariane rocket which was expected to place three  satellites into orbit at 0700 GMT today did not launch as  scheduled from the Kourou base in Guyana. Bruno Rougier reports.    [Rougier] Ariane was not launched because the arm which was  supposed to feed the rocket with hydrogen did not open. The  rocket is held by two arms that open five seconds before launch.  Unlike the hydrogen arm, the oxygen arm opened. The reason is  still unknown, but there is one key thing I must emphasize: the  launcher is not in danger at the moment.    Technicians are now busy cleaning the two tanks. The  hydrogen tank will normally be emptied by the attached tube. As  for the oxygen tank, a purification system will likely be used;  this should take several hours. Following this technician  should know why the arm failed to open. In addition, the  launching system will be examined to replace some spare parts  and repair some connections. Ariane Space management has refused  to say when a new launch will take place. According to experts  I met this morning, the delay could take a week.</p>

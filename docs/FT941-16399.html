			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / HK seeks extra cash for airport The Hong Kong government is to ask local lawmakers to approve an extra HKDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 148m) to sustain the colony's airport project in the absence of a comprehensive financial agreement with China. The money is needed to push ahead with building necessary works for the airport on Chek Lap Kok, an island off the northern shore of Lantau. Officials indicated yesterday they will ask the Legislative Council's finance committee to approve the awarding of contracts worth HKDollars 1.29bn to build the airport's foundations, baggage handling facilities and an underground 'people mover'. The government is also seeking an additional HKDollars 377m for head office expenses for the Provisional Airport Authority. Talks between Britain and China about the airport are stalled. The decision last month by Governor Chris Patten to push ahead with his democracy legislation without Beijing's agreement has given the Chinese added cause for delay. A suggestion made by Britain last week for more talks received no response from Beijing.</p>

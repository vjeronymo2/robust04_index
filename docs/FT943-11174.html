			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rwanda tragedy could have been averted Sir, I was delighted, for the most part, with Edward Mortimer's article, 'High price of dallying' (July 27). Mortimer hits the nail on the head when he says it is futile for member states to blame the United Nations for not acting quickly enough in situations of crisis when they themselves do not provide the organisation with the tools to do so. I do not think this is the time to apportion blame; the 'international community' is finally rushing to the aid of the desperate people of Rwanda. But could not much of this tragedy have been averted had the member states of the United Nations heeded the repeated appeals of the secretary-general to help that bleeding nation back in May? Indeed, if fully equipped forces had been earmarked in various national armies around the world, as suggested by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his Agenda for Peace two years ago, then the UN could have moved more effectively to stop the carnage in Rwanda. By warning the Security Council last week that the UN might be forced to withdraw its personnel from Bosnia-Herzegovina if the peace proposals presented by the 'contact group' were accepted or rejected by the parties, the secretary-general was merely being realistic. If the proposals were accepted, enforcing them would require 60,000 troops, far beyond the means or political will of the member states, as recent experience has shown us. If they were rejected and 'disincentives' imposed, that would once again endanger the lives of the peace-keepers. Member states need to decide what they want their UN organisations to be - a relic of the cold war, a toothless tiger, or an effective, credible defender of world peace? The only point in the article which I object to is the author's suggestion that the UN's Department of Public Information be closed down because it spends its money on journalists' tours of the Middle East rather than broadcasts in places such as Rwanda. In fact, it is difficult to get the member states to approve funds for UN radio facilities; the effective station in Cambodia was approved only mid-way in the mission, and a request for funds for a radio facility in the former Yugoslavia is still encountering difficulties. In contrast, journalists' tours of the Middle East are funded and specifically mandated by the General Assembly. To suggest that the department should be closed down is as if I were to suggest closing the FT because of one article I did not like.

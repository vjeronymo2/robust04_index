			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. OFFICIAL COULD FORCE HUGE TRACT TO SHRINK;  </P> <P> AHMANSON RANCH: PLANNERS SAY COUNCILWOMAN JOY PICUS' EFFORT TO BLOCK THE  EXTENSION OF VICTORY BOULEVARD INTO THE COUNTY COULD HAMPER THE PROJECT.  </P> <P> Developers of the proposed Ahmanson Ranch project could be forced to reduce the  size of the huge Ventura County development if Los Angeles City Councilwoman  Joy Picus succeeds in blocking the extension of Victory Boulevard, a planning  official said Thursday.  </P> <P> Picus elaborated Thursday on plans to block a proposal by the Ahmanson Land Co.  to extend the western end of Victory Boulevard into southeast Ventura County,  where the 3,000-house development would be located on nearly 2,000 acres.  </P> <P> The extension is a crucial element of the company's plans, which also include  building 3 million square feet of commercial development, two golf courses and  two hotels, said Dennis Hawkins, senior Ventura County planner in charge of the  environmental impact report for the project.  </P> <P> "It is possible they'd have to downsize the project" because the other four  main access roads to the project probably could not handle the 70,000 trips per  day the project is expected to generate, Hawkins said.  </P> <P> An Ahmanson Land Co. executive refused Thursday to speculate on the possible  effect of Picus' action but acknowledged that a Victory Boulevard connection is  very important to the project.  </P> <P> Extending Victory Boulevard into the project "would provide us with the easiest  and most logical access" to the west San Fernando Valley and offer 10,000  motorists per day an east-west alternative route to the Ventura Freeway,  Ahmanson Senior Project Manager  </P> <P> Guy Gniadek said.  </P> <P> But Gniadek said the effect of Picus' plan could not immediately be determined.  "It has never been analyzed," he said.  </P> <P> Gniadek also said he hoped that Picus would meet with Ahmanson officials to get  a firsthand look at their plans for the project. "Her input on the project  would be invaluable," he said.  </P> <P> Picus' opposition adds to the obstacles facing Ahmanson Ranch. The election  last spring of a slow-growth candidate also leaves the project facing a  possible hostile majority on the five-member Ventura County Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> Under the development proposal, Victory would link up with Las Virgenes Road,  Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Crummer Canyon Road. Those three roads would loop  northward into the Ahmanson Ranch project. Victory now dead-ends just west of  Valley Circle Boulevard.  </P> <P> At the very least, if Picus can block the Victory Boulevard extension, a  1,000-page, $500,000 environmental study of the Ahmanson Ranch project -- which  had been set for completion by early next month -- would have to be revised,  Hawkins said.  </P> <P> Picus' strategy depends upon a 1-by-100-foot strip of land known as a "one-foot  blocker," which resembles a narrow crosswalk near the end of the road. The  blocker is a device by which the city retains control when developers want to  link their projects to city streets.  </P> <P> Until that ribbon of land, lying near the county line, is designated as a  public street, Ahmanson can not link its roadway system to Victory Boulevard,  Picus and city officials contend.  </P> <P> "We could put up a barrier there if they tried" to build the road without city  permission, said Linda Arnold, a Los Angeles city Bureau of Engineering  analyst.  </P> <P> The strip of land was reserved for use by the city in 1983 when the adjacent  subdivision was approved by the City Council, said Stan Sysak, a senior Bureau  of Engineering official.  </P> <P> It is up to Ahmanson Land Co. to initiate the request that the land be  designated as a public street. Assistant City Atty. Ed C. Dygert said Ahmanson  could prompt the City Council to vote on its request. "But there's no way they  can compel the city to accept the land as a public street," he said.  </P> <P> But Gniadek said Ahmanson's attorneys believe that their client already has  authority under a deed to the land "to connect a road from Ahmanson Ranch to  Victory Boulevard," Gniadek said.  </P> <P> "I call it 'limbo land,' " Picus said of the 100-foot-long-by-1-foot-wide  section of Victory Boulevard at a news conference Thursday at which, flanked by  about 20 local homeowners, she made a second announcement of her plan. "I do  not want this project to be a defeat for Victory Boulevard," the councilwoman  said.  </P> <P> "Not only will there be a tremendous amount of traffic, it will increase smog  around here until it's like a freeway," said Angela Herschel, a resident of  West Hills, a neighborhood traversed by Victory Boulevard. "We'll work closely  with Joy on this -- she's our only hope."  </P> <P> With all the hurdles facing it, "there's no guarantee the project would be  approved anyway," regardless of the outcome of Picus' efforts, Hawkins said.  </P> <P> Under current plans, about 3,000 acres of the 5,477-acre Ahmanson property  would be dedicated to the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area. The remainder  is now zoned as open space, a designation the developer is proposing to change  through a General Plan amendment that would eventually come before the Ventura  County Board of Supervisors. Advocates of slow growth will hold a majority on  the board in January when Maria VanderKolk takes office. Voters narrowly  elected the environmental activist in June.  </P></p>

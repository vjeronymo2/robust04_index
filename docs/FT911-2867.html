			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Far East closures from Lloyds Bank LLOYDS BANK, the smallest of the 'Big Four' UK clearing banks, is to close its commercial banking and treasury operations in Hong Kong and Singapore, along with its representative offices in Indonesia and the Shenzen Economic Zone of China. The closure is the latest in a series of withdrawals from overseas operations by Lloyds Bank to concentrate on more profitable retail banking activities in the UK. The Hong Kong branch employed 100 people and made post-tax profits of Pounds 2.7m last year. Lloyds said yesterday that it hoped that a fair number of its employees would be given new jobs in its Hong Kong private banking operations which are not affected by the closure. The Singapore branch employed 47 people with profits of Pounds 1.2m. All the operations being closed had been on the market for several months but suitable buyers had failed to appear. Lloyds commercial and treasury activities in Korea and Taiwan are also up for sale. The bank, however, said yesterday that negotiations with possible buyers were under way. Lloyds says it has no intention of withdrawing from corporate and treasury activities in Japan. The operations being closed had combined net assets of Pounds 20.2m at the end of last year. 'This restructuring is consistent with our policy of concentrating our resources on activities which can make a significant contribution to our total business results.' said Mr Frank Jones, director of international banking at Lloyds.</p>

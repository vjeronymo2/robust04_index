			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Big boost for UK government bonds - At a Glance In spite of a slight set-back in late trading yesterday, UK government bonds made strong gains this week as a more positive mood returned to European government bond markets. The yield on the 10-year benchmark gilt fell back by about  1/2 percentage point as prices rose by about three points. During the week, the weakness of the US dollar encouraged some investors to shift out of US Treasuries into European bonds. Gilts were also bolstered by data pointing to steady UK economic growth with low inflation. The Bank of England's successful sale of three new tranches of existing gilts helped market confidence. Its next auction, on July 19, will be of medium- to long-dated conventional gilts.</p>

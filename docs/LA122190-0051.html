			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFUGEES;  </P> <P> TIDE OF 'BOAT PEOPLE' IS EBBING;  </P> <P> BUT HARSH CONDITIONS AT HOME STILL DRIVE MANY VIETNAMESE TO LEAVE, ONLY TO FIND  DOORS CLOSING TO THEM ABROAD.  </P> <P> More than 30,000 people fled Vietnam in 1990 as "boat people," washing up as  far away as the islands of Indonesia. Despite the huge size of the continuing  exodus, the overall number of asylum-seekers was actually down compared to the  previous two years.  </P> <P> The decline in the number of refugees has many explanations: a virtual halt to  asylum-seekers who are leaving Vietnam and a flood of propaganda about the  hardships awaiting emigrants. In many parts of Asia, the door is simply  slamming shut to them.  </P> <P> Vietnam's economic situation continues to deteriorate, with large-scale  unemployment. This year's refugee departures, although fewer than in 1989 and  1988, are still higher than in any year since 1982. As time passes, it is  harder for applicants to make a good case that they have suffered because of  their association with the old South Vietnamese regime.  </P> <P> Hong Kong is a good example of the new trend. Last year, a flood of 34,622  Indochinese refugees swept into the colony, overwhelming its facilities. Nearly  all the new arrivals were from just four districts of northern Vietnam near  Haiphong.  </P> <P> This year, only 6,000 asylum-seekers have turned up, with only 500 coming from  northern Vietnam. Of the remainder, mostly ethnic Chinese, a few hundred now  travel by land routes through China, earning them the mocking Hong Kong  sobriquet of "bus people." But they are a tiny minority.  </P> <P> According to refugee officials and aid workers, the people of northern Vietnam,  at least, have finally gotten the message that escape from Vietnam now means  confinement in a detention camp rather than resettlement in California. That  alone appears to have deterred thousands from leaving Vietnam this year.  </P> <P> Despite the decline in arrivals, the population of Hong Kong's detention  centers has swollen to 52,953, with the increase in population (6,034 new  arrivals and 2,500 births) hardly offset by the 5,700 camp inmates who  volunteered to go home rather than face more time in confinement.  </P> <P> "We are desperately trying to maintain temporary asylum in a region which is  fed up with it," said Hong Kong's refugee coordinator, Clinton Leeks.  </P> <P> That frustration is evident in such Southeast Asian nations as Malaysia, which  since June has regularly towed boatloads of Vietnamese out to sea and handed  them maps to Indonesia, and the Philippines. In July, however, the Philippines  unofficially stopped accepting refugees plucked from the sea by passing ships.  </P> <P> In addition to Malaysia and the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan are no longer  accepting sea-rescue cases. With Indonesia's refugee camp at Galang bulging  with more than 19,000 asylum-seekers, Western aid officials worry that the  Jakarta government may be the next to stop offering shelter.  </P> <P> The problem is largely a dispute between the Asian nations and the United  States over a passage in the 1989 Comprehensive Plan of Action that was adopted  to deal with the growing tide of would-be emigrants. The plan provides for  screening arrivals to determine if they are genuine political refugees or  merely economic migrants looking for a better life.  </P> <P> Everyone agrees that the genuine refugees should be resettled, but the rejected  refugees are at the heart of the dispute. Hong Kong, Malaysia and other  countries want to send them back home. The United States and, ironically,  Vietnam vehemently oppose forced repatriation as inhumane.  </P> <P> In September, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reached  agreement with Hong Kong, Britain and Vietnam to try a new tactic: to send home  asylum-seekers who did not volunteer but who also did not object to being sent  back.  </P> <P> Refugee officials from around the region closely watched the Hong Kong  experiment. If it worked, the plan would be implemented elsewhere. So far, it  has flopped. Only 23 people were sent back in the first group of  "non-objectors" despite promises of equal treatment with volunteers. Back in  Hanoi, they were horrified to hear Vietnamese officials threatening terms in  re-education camps to non-objectors who step out of line.  </P> <P> Perhaps most daunting of all, Hong Kong's program of screening prospective  refugees is being tested in a court case that could wind up invalidating many  of the 16,000 screenings which have already taken place.  </P></p>

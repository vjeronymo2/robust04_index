			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oil Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun by </F> Shafiq al-Asadi in Abu Dhabi on 11 May]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Asadi] The northerners  say they have captured al-'Anad base and reached the approaches  to Aden.    [Bin-Husaynun] Al-'Anad has not been captured, nor have  northern forces reached Dar Sa'd, as 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, and  Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said. Maybe they  do not know what is happening on the battlefield. It can be  said that their claim is absolutely baseless. They must know  that it is very difficult to reach Aden, perhaps not in their  time, nor will it be by force. [passage omitted]    [Al-Asadi] What is your opinion of the decision to dismiss  you from the cabinet?    [Bin-Husaynun] I do not recognize a decision of that kind,  because those who made it do not enjoy legitimacy. The  legitimacy collapsed on 27 April after the declaration of war on  the Yemeni people. Anyone who declares war on his own people  does not deserve or have any legitimacy.    [Al-Asadi] Do you believe there has been Arab interference  in current events in Yemen?    [Bin-Husaynun] I believe that some elements from some Arab  states are participating alongside northern forces in the  fighting. It has been stated that there are some Iraqis and  Sudanese elements on the battlefield.    [Al-Asadi] Aden reports said today (Wednesday) that northern  aircraft are using Sudanese airports to bombard targets in the  south....    [Bin-Husaynun] The relationship between Khartoum and Sanaa  and between President 'Umar al-Bashir and 'Abd 'Abdallah Salih  shows Sudan's support for the northern forces which have  declared war on the Yemeni people. We regret these matters and  hope that Arab brothers will not become a party to this  conflict. If they cannot contribute to resolving the crisis and  securing a cease-fire, they should stay neutral.    [Al-Asadi] What is your interpretation of the north's offer  of an immediate cease-fire, provided Aden accepts the legitimacy?    [Bin-Husaynun] That is up to them. Sometimes they accept  and other times they do not. But conditions are not conducive  to a cease-fire. Some say that a cease-fire should be announced  first, and then a dialogue at the negotiating table should  begin. For our part, we have decided to accept a cease-fire and  responded to the appeal made by some brothers. This is because  of the Socialist Party leadership's keenness to spare Yemeni  blood, not as a result of weakness.    [Al-Asadi] So do you accept the intervention of Arab forces  to disengage the warring forces?    [Bin-Husaynun] Any initiative or effort to stop the  fighting, return to dialogue, and implement the Pledge and  Accord Document is acceptable.    [Al-Asadi] Including the dispatch of Arab forces to Yemen?    [Bin-Husaynun] We are talking about any effort, including  the intervention of Arab forces. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Kostin, chairman of the PRP NVAER Trade Union </F> Committee: "If No Money Is Paid For Work, Then For Whom Are  These Reforms Intended?"]    [Text] Dear Editorial Board of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA! Our  appeal addressed to the president and government of the Russian  Federation and the response thereto were published in your  newspaper on 22 February and 22 March 1994. The course of events  forces us to once again speak out in this newspaper and quite  possibly not for the last time. Only the president of the  "Rosenergoatom" Concern commented upon our appeal in the  newspaper. The remaining elements remained silent.    Truly, we were provided with "systematic assistance" in the  form of a one-time credit in the amount of 30 million rubles, an  amount which constituted one fifth of the monthly wage fund.  This assistance was to be returned within a period of three  months.    Thus, there have been no changes for the better since the  appeal was published on 22 February 1994. To the contrary, the  situation has deteriorated and social tension has increased --  indeed, the last salary received by the collective was for  November 1993. At the same time, lacking the funds for paying  wages and thus not issuing them, the enterprise is obligated to  transfer income tax (from wages not received) and to make  assignments to the pension and other funds, with extra charges  for late payments.    Are we really speaking in a language not understood by the  officials? We are not asking for nitpicking interference or for  charity and we are not praying to the Almighty. No, we are  asking the chief debtor, namely the state, to ensure  reimbursement for the obligation in the form of dearly earned  money.    As a mark of protest against that which took place  illegally,  we participated in sanctioned picketing of the White House.  There has been no response to our appeal and workers attached to  the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" Production Repair Enterprise,  for the fifth month now, since December 1993, have not received  their wages and have been subsisting on bread and potatoes.    Gentlemen, rulers! Your discussions regarding improvements  in  the people's standard of living and lowering inflation  (inflation has declined, since half of Russia is not receiving  wages) -- are nothing more than fantasies being substituted for  reality. Thanks to your "talented" leadership, the approved  program for the market is failing before our very eyes. The  destruction of atomic power engineering, now in progress, is  tantamount to the destruction of Russia.    Gentlemen! Devote more thought to this matter.</p>

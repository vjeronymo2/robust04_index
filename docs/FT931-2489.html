			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / People: Goold quits Whitecroft after 24 years After 24 years with the company, the last two as executive chairman, Peter Goold is to leave the board of Whitecroft, the mini-conglomerate, next Monday. Since 1990 profits, the share price, dividends and payrolls have tumbled as the Wilmslow-based group restructured to survive the recession, after being caught badly exposed in property markets. David Kendall, chairman of Bunzl, will succeed Goold in a non-executive capacity. Mike Derbyshire - a former Norcros senior manager brought in by Goold as managing director a year ago - will step up to chief executive. Martyn Ellis joined as finance director a few weeks ago. Goold, 49, became chairman in 1990, with property prices tumbling and Whitecroft overgeared. In the 1980s, the group had developed medium-sized or smaller complexes of shops and offices, mainly in the Thames Valley, and had gone into house building. But it has since disengaged from property, house-building, double-glazing, conservatories and engineering. The workforce has been cut from more than 3,000 when Goold became chairman to about 1,930 now, and Whitecroft is down to four sound or promising businesses - lighting for factories and offices, medical cotton fibre, specialised textiles and fire-resistant doors. Goold developed a strategy of warning the City of bad news a week or so in advance to minimise impact. When Wriddinghitecroft finally fell into loss - on its interims to last September - this was mitigated by being slightly less than he had led investors to fear. The share price, however, has been sliding for some time - tumbling last year from 131p to 72p in a few days. It closed 1 1/2 p higher yesterday at 38p.</p>

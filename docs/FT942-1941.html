			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Goalkeepers caught by high-tech ball Already, World Cup goalkeepers are winning - and losing - matches. Michel Preud'homme of Belgium, Romania's Bogdan Stelea and Ireland's Packie Bonner starred in their sides' opening games. But when it comes to Colombia's Oscar Cordoba or Carlos Trucco of Bolivia - don't ask. However, Preud'homme has criticised the World Cup's new Questra ball, from adidas. While it helps the forwards, the lighter, swifter Questra ball makes goalkeeping even trickier. Referring to Georghe Hagi's second goal for Romania in their 3-1 win against Colombia, Preud'homme said: 'The ball curls early on and suddenly it stops.' 'If it starts that way, it has to continue that way,' he said, complaining of inexplicable deviations in the ball's flight. Cordoba concurred. 'The flight of the ball fooled me,' he said, refusing to take full blame for Colombia's loss. 'I don't think I can be considered (solely) responsible. The team has always celebrated success together. Why not defeat?' The authorities wanted to encourage goal-scoring, so the new ball has a glossier surface that cuts air resistance, allowing it to travel up to 15 per cent faster. It is made of five separate materials, including a new polyethelene foam; when combined, says adidas, they 'provide high energy-return properties, strength, durability and control.' The Questra was developed at adidas ball-research facilities in France, and field-tested in France and Germany.</p>

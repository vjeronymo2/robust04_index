			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 9 May, BNS -- Paying little attention to  publicity rather than political failure is the reason behind Pro  Patria's declining approval figures in opinion polls, says Tiit  Sinissaar, the chairman of the ruling coalition's senior party  faction in the Estonian parliament.    According to the outcome of the latest poll by the EMOR  agency, Pro Patria's support among voters has fallen under the  critical 5 percent.    "Pro Patria has been attacked and accused from all  directions  and our biggest mistake is that we haven't had time beside other  things to make publicity for our actions," Sinissaar told BNS.    He also said it was natural that the political party that is  in power would lose popularity among voters. When the standard  of living increased last fall, also the people's expectations  began to be higher than what was actually possible, he said.    "Pro Patria has conducted a thorough analysis of these  factors," Sinissaar said. "Our forecast is that the economic  situation, and, arising from this, also the social situation  will start to improve in Estonia in the near future," he said.    He added that the party has learned its lesson from the  recent developments and is now set to better explain the  background and aims of its activity.    As a first example of this, Sinissaar and Prime Minister  Mart  Laar wrote an article that was published in today's edition of  the HOMMIKULEHT daily newspaper.    Sinissaar said he believes that the party's approval ratings  will be on the increase soon, because "everything that the  coalition has done in the past year and a half starts to give  tangible results namely now."</p>

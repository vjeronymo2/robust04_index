			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Sharper focus on careers advice in schools urged The lack of focus on careers education in the UK leaves many young British people worse off than their continental counterparts for making a successful transition to the world of work, a report published today says. The report, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, compares school vocational guidance in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Careers guidance on the Continent tends to starts earlier, is taught by careers specialists in separate lessons devoted to the topic and is geared to providing young people with detailed information on careers and ensuring that courses taken at school are relevant. In Britain careers advice is not part of the national curriculum and teachers are frequently untrained in careers guidance. The report comes when big changes are being made to the delivery of careers' advice to young people. The government has taken it out of local authority control and is seeking tenders from new providers, which may include local authorities. The need for good quality advice has never been greater because of the development of training credits, with young people able to seek out prospective employers with whom they invest their credits in return for training. The report's recommendations include an earlier start to work experience, the reinstatement of classes in vocational guidance, greater targeting of relevant information through a detailed syllabus, more emphasis on vocational guidance in teacher training and the greater involvement of parents.

Ye said that the CPPCC Eighth National Committee, based on  the work experience of the previous national committees, has  probed new ways to engage in political consultations and  exercise democratic supervision. It has tried to make CPPCC, a  unique form of democratic politics in China, meet the  requirements of the country's socialist modernization since its  first session last March, he said.    Ye made the remarks when delivering the work report of the  Standing Committee of the CPPCC Eighth National Committee at the  opening of its second session.    In the past year, Ye said, the National Committee held five  standing committee meetings and discussed a wide range of issues  including the national economic situation, measures to solve  economic problems, the international situation, establishment of  a socialist market economy in China, measures to ensure a clean  government and the fight against corruption.    Zhu Rongji and other leaders of the Communist Party of China  (CPC) delivered reports to the Standing Committee.    The Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee put  forward many good opinions and suggestions on the issues,  according to Ye. For instance, the economic sub-committee of  the National Committee raised suggestions on strengthening  macro-economic controls and keeping inflation at bay, which were  adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the central government.  The sub-committee has therefore contributed to strengthened  macroeconomic controls and a continuous, fast and healthy  development of the national economy.    Last year, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee, successfully visited Nepal, India and Pakistan. It  was the first visit to foreign countries by a chairman of the  CPPCC National Committee and has important significance in  CPPCC's international exchanges.    The national committee organized 15 delegations for visits  to  more than 20 countries and established ties with organizations  and parliaments of 14 host countries. So far, the CPPCC  National Committee has established friendly relations with 46  organizations and parliaments in 36 countries.    Subcommittees of the CPPCC National Committee also made  surveys on some important issues and put forward 24 reports.  They attracted attention from the CPC Central Committee, the  State Council, government departments and local authorities.  Many suggestions contained in the reports have been adopted.    In addition, the national committee has also made new  progress in expanding domestic and overseas friendship ties,  promoting the reunification of the motherland, participating in  the anti- corruption campaign, helping state organs build clean  government, improving inspection work of its members, raising  suggestions for reform and development, improving the handling  of proposals raised by CPPCC members, and revising the  constitution of CPPCC.    On this year's work, Ye Xuanping said that the CPPCC  National  Committee will uphold the banner of patriotism and socialism,  focus on the central work of CPC and the state, actively engage  in political consultations and exercise democratic supervision,  improve its work efficiency, seize favorable development  opportunities, and make further contributions to the country's  economic reform, open policy implementation, economic  development and social stability.    Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee in the New Year will  make systematic and in-depth investigations on issues concerning  economic development, reform, the open policy and people's life,  put forward policy proposals and report them to the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. CPPCC, Ye said, will make  better use of itself as a pool of talented people, its extensive  information sources and its wide contacts.    In the New Year, Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee will  continue to develop friendly exchanges with parliaments and  non-governmental organizations of foreign countries, promote the  reunification of the motherland, urge direct and two-way  exchanges of mail, air and shipping services as well as trade  between the mainland and Taiwan, devote itself to maintaining  the stability and long-term prosperity of Hong Kong, and work  for a smooth hand-over and transition of the sovereignty of  Macao in accordance with the basic law of the territory.</p>

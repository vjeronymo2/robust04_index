			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Gardening: A garden to visit - A Sussex woodland paradise / Arthur Hellyer is entranced by a visit to an English valley LEONARDSLEE is one of the most beautiful woodland gardens in England. It was laid out by Sir Edmund Loder after he bought the estate in 1889 and has been continued by his heirs, right down to Robin Loder who took over in December 1981. The garden is at Lower Beeding, near Horsham in West Sussex, and covers 200 acres of a steep-sided valley running north to south with a string of hammer ponds in the bottom. It is about the finest site you could imagine for a woodland garden, since the soil is moderately acid and each side of the valley gets an equal amount of sunlight. There are two houses, both at the top of the valley on the west side. They are more or less in the middle of the garden and have magnificent views over it. Leonardslee is particularly famous for its rhododendrons (many raised there), azaleas, camellias, magnolias and coniferous trees. But it grows an immense variety of trees and shrubs, including hardy palms which were planted by a previous owner. Nearly everything flourished and the garden has sometimes been used for filming stories requiring a sub-tropical setting. But this very luxuriance threatened to destroy it, and Loder says it was saved by the great gale of October 1987. Loder estimates that a garden like Leonardslee needs to have at least 300 trees removed each year after a half-century of growth. But that was never attempted there; in any case, there was also the problem of getting felling permission for supposedly valuable trees. As a result, the garden became choked. The outer areas were abandoned as being too dense and the original 200 acres was whittled down to 100. Matters probably would have continued like this had it not been for the gale. It toppled thousands of trees and, in order to get them out, many more were removed. The clearance is now completed, replanting (where necessary) is well under way, and Leonardslee is a transformed place. Most of the plants are responding by growing and flowering more freely than before. It is, of course, the extra light and the reduced competition for water and food that have made the difference, and there are lessons in this for every gardener. Naturally, there are immediate problems of daily maintenance, since there is a greater growth of grass plus brambles and other weeds. But Leonardslee has the answers - wallabies and deer. Wallabies were introduced more than 100 years ago and are naturalised completely. They are particularly fond of brambles. The deer used to be kept out of Leonardslee by its fences; but when these had to be replaced after the great gale, it was decided to change policy and bring in herds of sika and fallow deer to help the wallabies in controlling grass and weeds. The results have been highly successful and the cost savings significant. In addition, the animals are proving a great attraction to the 50,000 people who visit Leonardslee each year. But there is plenty of new planting to attract them, too, including rhododendrons. Many of these are yakushimanum hybrids, which are dwarf and of particular interest to owners of small gardens. And there is a new bank of hydrangeas which flower in the summer and will link up with the autumn foliage for which Leonardslee is famous. A year ago, Loder persuaded the Sussex Bonsai Group to bring a large demonstration of its art to Leonardslee on permanent loan, and this is now installed near the restaurant and cafeteria. Nearby, a big greenhouse has been turned into an alpine house containing rock plants arranged in their natural families. There are also a new visitors' centre and gift shop. For the first time, Leonardslee is to be open continuously from April until October 31. In April and June, the hours are 10-6 daily; in May, 10-8 daily. From July to October, the garden is open 2-6 Monday to Friday, and 10-6 Saturday and Sunday. There is to be a special demonstration of bonsai on May 9 and 10.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southern proposes to acquire, and Development proposes to issue and sell, common stock and notes up to $275 million from time to time through December 31, 1998, with maturities no later than December 31, 2003. Such loans will bear an interest rate equal to a rate not to exceed the prime rate in effect on the date of the loan at a bank designated by Southern. In addition, Development proposes to convert the notes to capital contributions (through Southern's forgiveness of the debt evidenced thereby). Alternatively, Southern proposes to make up to $275 in cash capital contributions to Development from time to time through December 31, 1998. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development proposes to issue and sell to third parties, and Southern proposes to guarantee, up to $275 million in notes or other recourse liabilities from time to time through December 31, 1998, the maturities of which will not extend past December 31, 2003. The loans evidenced by such notes will be made with an interest rate not to exceed 3% over the lender bank's prime rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development proposes to acquire promissory notes evidencing the debt of customers in connection with financing energy management and efficiency equipment. Further, Development may assign evidences of customer indebtedness to Southern in consideration of a reduction in the amount of outstanding notes, in which case the aggregate amount of outstanding customer indebtedness held by Southern would be added to the aggregate amount of outstanding notes issued by Development and held by Southern for purposes of the proposed $50 million limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern proposes to provide performance guarantees and to undertake other contractual obligations with respect to the performance and other obligations of Development under contracts and bids with third parties. Southern proposes to provide guarantees in an aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $200 million through December 31, 2003; provided, that any guarantees or indemnifications outstanding at December 31, 2003 shall continue until expiration or termination in accordance with their terms. For purposes of computing the above limitation, neither Southern's agreements to provide guarantees or indemnifications of sureties of Development which have not actually been issued, nor Development's joint venture partner's respective shares of any joint venture obligations or indemnification of sureties of the joint venture, shall be counted. In addition, Southern and Development request that they have the flexibility to negotiate specific guarantees and similar provisions and arrangements with third parties, and indemnifications of sureties, as the need to do so arises, without further Commission authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development proposes to enter into new service agreements with Southern Company Services, Inc. (``Services'') and each of the operating electric utility companies (each an ``Operating Company'', collectively, ``Operating Companies'') that will be substantially identical to the existing agreements between Development and Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development proposes to undertake activities, including advertising and marketing studies, additional pilot tests, testing of various manufacturers' equipment, and purchases of equipment and software enhancements, among other activities, with a view to commercializing POWERcall and related customer services <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  throughout Alabama and Georgia and in the Gulf region of Mississippi and Florida. Development also requests authority to enter into agreements with utilities that are interconnected with Southern System companies pursuant to which Development would offer POWERcall and related services to the customers of such non-affiliated utilities. Development proposes to invest up to $10 million in connection with these activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> POWERcall is described as a utility customer service involving the installation of a device at a customer's premises which would monitor and automatically report power outages to a utility's operations center. Development states that it is investigating the additional capabilities of the monitoring device and its related software to determine the commercial feasibility of providing certain monitoring services in addition to POWERcall. Such additional services would include both energy-related services, such as automated meter reading and temperature monitoring, and other services, such as fire, intrusion and health alarm services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Development also requests authority to develop, purchase, construct, own and operate a prototype energy management communications network <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  at various locations within the Southern System. Development requests authority to invest up to $175 million in equity investments in such prototype systems, which would cover design and marketing costs and the costs of building, purchasing, or leasing fiber and coaxial cable lines and related equipment, facilities and properties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Development states that, by utilizing his network, it proposes to offer to customers power usage and outage monitoring services (including POWERcall), two way customer/utility communications, automated billing, energy and conservation information, including ``Good Cents'' messages and information, and communications-based programs, such as ``distance learning,'' that may be offered in conjunction with a utility's industrial development activities, among other potential utility and utility-related interactive communications services. Development states that the network may also be used for internal system communication of voice and data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Development proposes to make available the balance of the bandwidth capacity to other communications providers of voice, data, and video services, such as cable television companies, local and long distance telephone companies, computer networks, commercial merchants ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , home shopping networks), or large private users, such as banks, pursuant to leases, network sharing agreements or licensing transactions negotiated at arms' length for varying terms at market values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development proposes to provide the necessary system operations and maintenance services in connection with its energy management communications network and will charge third party communications providers the fair market value of such services based on their level of use of the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

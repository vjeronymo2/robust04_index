For a  self-proclaimed island republic that has been isolated in the  international community as a result of China's increasing  influence on the world stage, Mr. Li's `holiday' diplomacy  appears to have worked.    Despite vocal protests from Peking even before he left  Taipei, the Taiwanese president managed to secure informal  meetings with Indonesian President Suharto and Philippine  President Fidel Ramos. Although he did not meet Thai Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai as earlier expected, Mr. Li sought and  was granted a symbolically significant private audience with His  Majesty the King in Bangkok.    The diplomatic controversy kicked up by Mr. Li's Thai visit  did not come as a surprise -- treating Taiwan like a renegade  province within the jurisdiction of its empire as it does,  Peking would have been remiss of its responsibility if it had  not protested against the Thai government. Likewise, the  ensuing debates between senior Thai officials and opposition  politicians over the pros and cons of Mr. Li's `vacation' were  also expected.    Critics who warned of negative diplomatic and economic  ramifications from lncurring the wrath of China might have a  valid point in drawing the distinction between the Dalai Lama's  visit here last year and Mr. Li's trip. Whereas Thailand scored  some plus points among Western nations from hosting the Dalai  Lama, there was virtually no diplomatic asset from hosting Mr.  Li this time, not to mention the bruised feelings between  Bangkok and Peking.    But taking the pessimistic view -- as senior Opposition  Leader and Former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan did -- that  China might withdraw from (its participation in) the  often-trumpeted Economic Quadrangle out of resentment over Mr.  Li's visit has come across as being too farfetched. The  Quadrangle scheme envisages bringing development -- a  combination of trade, tourism, and investments -- to otherwise  backward and land-locked areas of southern China, parts of  Burma, Laos, and northern Thailand. If China chooses to deny its  own territory of such development, then it is too bad. [passage  omitted]    The potential negative repercussions aside, it was  understandable why the Thai authorities had unofficially  welcomed Mr. Li. Since Thailand broke off diplomatic relations  with Taipei and switched to recognise Peking nearly 20 years  ago, this country had not only kept up but also expanded its  bilateral economic ties with Taiwan. [passage omitted]    The favourable assimilation between ethnic Chinese and Thais  here is definitely more conducive to further growth in Taiwanese  investments than certain other ASEAN countries where racial  differences run deep. This is not to mention the prospect of  legitimising the estimated 50,000 Thai workers in Taiwan and  sending more workers there.    On balance, the immediate gains for Thailand from hosting  Mr.  Li appears to outweigh the potential adverse repercussions from  upsetting Peking. And in retrospect, our conduct of an  independent foreign policy would have been cast in a poor light  if we had kowtowed to Chinese pressures in denying Mr. Li's  visit.    This does not mean to say that the policy of unofficially  accommodating Taiwan should remain static. Bilateral  Thai-Chinese interests could well develop to such a dominant  extent in the future that warrants pushing Taiwan to the  sideline. In the meantime, it is the Foreign Ministry's  responsibility to minimise whatever damage caused with China.  [passage omitted]</p>

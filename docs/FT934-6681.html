			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Growth dive adds to political jitters in Venezuela: Stagnation in one of the world's fastest-growing economies - and in an election year Venezuela's economy, which between 1990 and 1992 posted one of the world's highest growth rates, has gone into a steep decline in this, an election, year. A combination of weak international oil prices, political upheaval and the uncertainties posed by national elections on December 5 slowed real gross domestic product growth during the first half of the year to a negative 2.3 per cent compared with the first half of 1992. Some government officials are predicting full-year 1993 growth of about 1 per cent - compared with 7.3 per cent in 1992 and 10.4 per cent in 1991. This is well below official estimates of 2-4 per cent growth made a few months ago, and 5 per cent at the beginning of the year. Even this may be optimistic. Many businessmen in Venezuela are expecting worse results. 'To be sincere, I don't think we'll see any positive growth this year at all,' said Mr Rafael Alfonzo Hernandez, executive director of Alfonzo Rivas, a large processed food company, and a spokesman for an important industrial association. 'Investors are on stand-by,' commented Mr Alejandro Szilagyi, a Venezuelan business consultant who works with domestic and international companies. 'At best, we're stagnating this year, and we could have negative growth.' Part of this is because petroleum exports, which account for most of Venezuela's foreign income, have been hurt by weak international oil prices. Political turmoil during the year - including the removal of an elected president, a wave of unexplained bombings and concern over a possible military uprising - has damaged investor confidence in many sectors. On the positive side, Venezuela has been able to maintain strong international reserves as the central bank kept interest rates high. Reserves at the end of October were Dollars 12.6bn, down 2.9 per cent from year-end 1992 and equivalent to just over a year of imports. Unemployment has also fallen this year - to 6.9 per cent at end-June from 8.4 per cent a year earlier, but that is likely to worsen next year as many companies - including the state oil company PDVSA - reduce personnel. Inflation though could rise to 40 per cent or more this year, in part because of a 10 per cent value added tax that came into effect on October 1 as part of the government's effort to close its fiscal deficit. Even before the tax took effect, many retailers raised prices sharply. The government has little room for manoeuvre. Lower oil prices have cut tax remittances by PDVSA and the central government is so low on funds that it is postponing tens of millions of dollars in payments to local suppliers until 1994. Meanwhile less than two weeks before the presidential, congressional and state elections, it is still far from clear who the next president will be or what economic policies he will advance. 'There is considerable willingness among Venezuelans and foreigners to invest,' Mr Szilagyi said. 'A lot of projects are waiting for the elections to provide some clear policies for the future.' While private investment remains active in some economic sectors, especially among foreign telecommunications companies, it is generally down from 1992. The four leading presidential candidates have said they would deal with key problems such as the government's fiscal deficit, inflation, high real interest rates, external debt, failing public services and demands for higher wages by public sector employees. So far they have been short on specific policies. Former president Rafael Caldera, 77, leads the pack of 18 candidates in virtually all public opinion polls. He has expressed strong opposition to free-market reforms initiated nearly five years ago. However, in meetings with international investors outside Venezuela, the ex-president's advisers have suggested that a Caldera government might maintain some reforms and would encourage private investment. The other main candidates, in order of public support reflected in the polls, are Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, 50, a former state governor who is standing for the Christian Democrat Copei party; Mr Andres Velasquez, 40, a labour leader and state governor who represents the leftist Radical Cause party; and Mr Claudio Fermin, 43, a former mayor of Caracas who is the candidate for the Democratic Action party. Both Mr Alvarez and Mr Fermin argue that market reforms, among others, must be continued in Venezuela. Mr Velasquez offers a mix of pro- and anti-reform policies. Pollsters say that a large number of potential voters (perhaps as many as 35-40 per cent) are still undecided or are 'soft', that is, they could change their preference by election day. The last days of the campaign have been complicated by renewed rumours of a coup d'etat, and by a military investigation of the secretary general of Radical Cause. The military have accused Mr Pablo Medina, a member of Congress and long-time leader of the party, of receiving a cache of automatic weapons stolen from a Venezuelan army base last year, and want to court martial him as an accessory to military rebellion. Mr Medina and his party deny the charges, saying the armed forces and others are trying to damage his party's image soon before the election. Radical Cause, whose members include former Marxists, is expected to obtain a significant share of protest votes next month and to win an important block of congressional seats. In Venezuela's confused political atmosphere, it is not clear whether the charges will hurt the party or pull in more votes.</p>

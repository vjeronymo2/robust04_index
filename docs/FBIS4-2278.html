			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li  Peng held talks with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in  the Great Hall of the People this afternoon.    Li Peng emphatically pointed out that China has always  treasured Sino-French relations. Balladur said that his current  China visit is aimed at promoting the development of  French-Chinese relations.    The talks proceeded in a sincere and friendly [cheng zhi you  hao 6134 2304 0645 1170] atmosphere.    Li Peng warmly welcomed the visit to China by Balladur and  his party. He said: "China and France reached an understanding  on the restoration of their traditional friendly cooperation  through their joint efforts. The governments of the two  countries issued a joint communique on 12 January, thereby  enabling Sino-French relations to return to the track of normal  development."    Li Peng pointed out: Both China and France are great  nations. They are permanent members of the UN Security Council.  Although tremendous changes have taken place in the  international situation in recent years, the importance of their  cooperation has not been reduced but rather has increased. They  have many points in common in safeguarding world peace and  promoting economic development. Economically, there is a very  strong possibility for China and France to complement each  other, and the potential for development [in this area] is very  great. He emphatically pointed out: "China is willing to  develop long-term, stable, and friendly cooperation with France  according to the principle of seeking common ground while  reserving differences; of mutual respect, noninterference in  each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit.  Prime Minister Balladur and the current French Government have  made positive efforts to restore and improve bilateral  relations. We would like to express our appreciation for this.  We should have an eye on the 21st century and treat and handle  Sino-French relations strategically to make them enjoy further  healthy development."    Touching on bilateral economic relations and trade, Li Peng  said: There are practical and good prospects for China and  France to carry out trade and economic cooperation. This is  because, first, China's economy has entered a track of  sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian  kang di fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4104 4099 1455] at  present. This provides tremendous possibilities for China to  expand economic relations and trade with every other country of  the world, including France. Second, transportation, energy, and  telecommunications and other infrastructural industries are the  sectors receiving priority for development in China's economy,  whereas these fields are French enterprises' strong points.  China welcomes French enterprises to participate in competition  on an equal basis in China. Third, the Chinese Government  adopts a positive attitude on developing mutually beneficial  trade and economic cooperation with France. Quite a number of  French enterprises have conducted cooperation with China for a  long time. They remained dedicated to mutually beneficial  cooperation even when Sino-French relations hit a snag.    Li Peng expressed his hope that French enterprises would  enhance their competitiveness in the Chinese market so as to be  conducive to further developing and expanding Sino-French trade  and economic cooperation.    Prime Minister Balladur spoke highly of the importance of  French-Chinese relations. He noted he believed that the  potential for cooperation between the two countries is very  great. He said: Minister of Industry, Post, Telecommunications,  and Foreign Trade Longuet will soon lead French entrepreneurs in  visiting China to promote trade and economic cooperation between  France and China. The French side also welcomes the visit to  France to be made soon by Minister of Power Industry Shi Dazhen.    The two premiers also discussed the possibilities of  cooperation in important projects and the prospects for the  grain trade. They agreed that both sides will maintain the  momentum of mutual visits by high-level officials, strengthen  political consultations, and confirm the understanding on  holding regular meetings and consultations between the two  countries' foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers which  was reached this January when Vice Premier Qian Qichen made an  official visit to France.    Touching on the issue of China's "reentry into the GATT,"  Balladur said that France supports China in resuming its status  as a signatory state to the GATT and thus becoming a founding  member of the World Trade Organization. Li Peng expressed his  thanks for France's support.    Li Peng also briefed his guests on U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher's recent China visit, and he explained China's  principled stand on the human rights issue. Balladur briefed  his host on France's stand on the human rights issue, saying  that France has no intention of interfering in other nations'  internal affairs and that it is willing to discuss the issue  with other countries on the basis of equality.    At the request of his guests, Li Peng briefed them on  China's  independent, peaceful foreign policy and its relations with  neighboring countries. The two premiers also exchanged in-depth  views on wide-ranging international and regional issues of  common concern, and they noted that the stands of both sides  have a lot in common. Both sides unanimously expressed their  belief that China and France are influential nations in  international affairs and that maintaining good relations  between them accords with their fundamental interests and is  conducive to world peace and stability.    Among those present at the talks were Qian Qichen, State  Council vice premier and concurrently foreign minister; Shi  Dazhen, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee  and minister of power industry; French Foreign Minister Juppe;  and French Minister of Industry, Post, Telecommunications, and  Foreign Trade Longuet.    Prior to the talks, Li Peng presided over a welcoming  ceremony for Balladur. In the evening, Li Peng hosted a banquet  in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Balladur and their party.    This afternoon, Zhou Jue, vice chairman of the National  People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, held working talks  with Gilles de Robien and Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, vice presidents  of the French National Assembly, in the Great Hall of the People.    Balladur arrived in Beijing this morning at the invitation  of  Li Peng to begin a four-day official visit to China.</p>

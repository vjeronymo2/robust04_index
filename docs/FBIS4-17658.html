			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program: Video report by </F> Viktor Tkachenko, identified by caption; figures in brackets  denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Excerpts] [124158] [Tkachenko over aerial view of Mirnyy  and missile transporters on a road] Many details pertaining to  the history of the strategic missile forces have been kept  secret. To this day, Arkhangelsk Oblast's Mirnyy city, which  has a population of 40,000, does not feature on any maps. There  is an explanation for this. Since 1957 missiles systems have  been tested and satellites have been launched here at the  Plesetsk test range.    Our country had to pay a high price for the acquisition of  its nuclear missile shield during the Cold War years. Accidents  occurred during delivery vehicle launches in 1973 and 1980.  More than 50 people died.

[N. Moroz, identified by caption] When it became known that  the Soviet Union had 12 missiles which could reach the United  States, this had a very sobering influence on politicians.    [Tkachenko over video of computer center] Now the  international climate has changed. Since January 1992 missile  test experts have a new mission -- monitoring Russian and U.S.  implementation of treaty obligations on the exchange of  information about test launches undertaken by the former  potential enemies. This equipment was installed at the secret  Plesetsk computer center by Americans. And Russian specialists  have installed similar equipment in the United States. Thus no  strategic missile test launch in either Russia or across the  ocean is a secret any longer. But equally it is no secret that  both the Russian and the American missile experts are keeping  their powder dry and already thinking about the missiles of the  21st century.

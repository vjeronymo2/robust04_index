Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When NSCC was formed, the number of directors on the board was sixteen. To provide a greater representation of the participants in the management of NSCC, the number of directors on the board was increased to seventeen in 1984 and to eighteen in 1990. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  NSCC's participant base has expanded significantly since 1990. Therefore, NSCC believes that it is in the participants' interest that the number of directors again be increased. NSCC's by-laws permit the number of directors to be increased from time to time. The rule change consists of an amendment to the by-laws increasing the number of directors on the board from eighteen to nineteen. Pursuant to NSCC's shareholders agreement, the board of directors is made up as follows: One director representing each shareholder ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and National Association of Securities Dealers), one director representing NSCC's management ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC's president and chief executive officer), and the remaining directors are selected from NSCC's participants. The additional participant director will further the opportunity for participants to be represented on the board and to participate in the administration of NSCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27984 (May 2, 1990), 55 FR 19400 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;90&hyph;02] (order approving proposed rule change). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

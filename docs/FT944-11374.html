			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Electronic tax return spells end for dreaded form: The launch of a computer link between accountants and the Inland Revenue For almost as long as tax has been paid it has been accompanied by the dreaded tax form. That link may be broken from today with the introduction by the Inland Revenue of its Electronic Lodgement System (ELS). The system will link the computer systems of taxpayers' agents, normally accountants, with those of the Revenue. The savings in the long-term should be huge. Mr Ian Barlow, tax partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, estimates that it costs Pounds 15 merely to store an average tax file in a filing cabinet for a year. The likely savings potential at the Revenue, which dealt last year with 30m returns from individuals and companies, could also be huge. Few doubt the long-term logic of electronic tax returns and most admire the speed with which the Revenue has got to grips with the technology. But the first phase of the system illustrates some potential problems. Paper is proving resilient to change. Until later this month, when changes are expected to be announced in the Budget, a duplicate paper tax process must run in tandem with the new system. Later that may go - but the need for a signed authorisation from the taxpayer may persist. Joining the system is also proving expensive. While the Revenue is paying for most of the transmission costs, the Big Six accountancy firms are aware that while the capital costs of starting up may be small the investment in time is considerable. For smaller firms the expense rises proportionately. One smaller firm, HW Fisher, has been included in the pilot scheme to help judge the issues. The Revenue estimates the first year cost as Pounds 750, but this presumes that the smaller firm has a relatively expensive personal computer facility already in place. Given that the system is voluntary, there seems to be little reason for smaller agents take part. Accountants are not the only agents with doubts. The personal tax sub-committee of the British Bankers' Association believes its members will join an ELS to carry its existing tax return business. But it sees no future for a high-volume business based on high-street banks. Mr John Whiting, tax partner with Price Waterhouse and chairman of the business forum for ELS, is well aware that the business argument has yet to be won. He believes greater incentives need to be found to get accountants and the public to file electronically. In New Zealand, where electronic lodgement operates, 80 per cent of taxpayers get refunds within 14 days when using the electronic system. Paper returns earn refunds in two to three months. The UK system will not contain the same rewards. 'We do need to incentivise our system,' said Mr Whiting. The forum is putting together a 'shopping list' of possible options to make it worthwhile for accountants to enter a fully fledged system. But the Big Six are taking part in the pilot scheme, providing some proof that the long-term benefits of moving to the system outweigh the short-term costs. Negotiation may be needed in the next year but the outcome seems certain. Accountants do not see the system as a threat to their jobs - quite the reverse. Proficiency in filing in a tax form on-screen, once a year, will not come easily and accountants, working with volume, are well placed to pick up the business. The revenue envisages that some taxpayers may one day file their returns from home but others will transfer the information to a disk and take it to an agent - or even to a central 'tax shop' or service point in a Post Office. But for the Revenue, and therefore the taxpayer, the great prize is likely to be increased accuracy in tax returns and a big cut in the time spent correcting errors on hand-written forms.</p>

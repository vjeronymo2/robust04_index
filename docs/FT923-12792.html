			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Brussels brings competition to Barcelona Olympics THE European Commission yesterday claimed it had instilled the true spirit of competition into the Barcelona games by persuading the Barcelona Olympics committee to change its ticket distribution policy just 10 days before the opening ceremony, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Sir Leon Brittan - the EC's competition commissioner and now, apparently, champion of the Olympics spectator - is also looking at ways of opening television coverage of the games to greater competition. The committee has modified its ticketing arrangements to allow the sought-after tickets to move freely across Community frontiers. Usually, the Olympic committees appoint an exclusive ticket distributor in each country. Once the national quota of tickets is used up, individuals or travel agents who want to buy tickets are forbidden from buying tickets from alternative sources in other countries. Now the rules have been amended, EC sports fans will be able to buy tickets direct from the Olympic committee or from agents in other member states. With less than 10 days to go until the Barcelona games start, it is not clear how many tickets remain unsold anywhere in the Community. But as cynical Brussels observers quickly pointed out, the move has awarded the Commission - which has also co-ordinated EC sponsorship of the Olympics - a welcome propaganda prize. Sir Leon may have more of a struggle when it comes to opening up television coverage of the games. The rights to broadcast the Olympics have been bought by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which groups Europe's public service broadcasters. The Commission wants the EBU - and Eurosport, a channel backed by a group of EBU members - to give Screensport, a rival European satellite sports channel, fair access to Olympics coverage.</p>

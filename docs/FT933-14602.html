			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Non-confirmation of Markham as chairman seen as reason for resignation A DECISION not to confirm Mr Richard Markham, heir apparent at Merck &amp; Co, to the position of chairman was yesterday seen as the most likely reason for his unexpected resignation, writes Richard Waters in New York. Since he was appointed to the number-two job of president and chief operation officer last December, he had installed his own appointees at senior management level. The speed of change and a reputedly aggressive management style are understood to have caused disquiet. Merck said yesterday that 'Mr Markham was a leading candidate' for the chairmanship, 'but he was never the named successor'. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>   [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- The Cuban National Assembly's  current extraordinary session constitutes a peculiar and  unprecedented meeting, but an analysis of financial improvements  will not end the debate, National Assembly President Ricardo  Alarcon said today.    In statements for PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon pointed out that  the  final resolution will serve as a foundation for State Council  legislation. There is a consensus among the 551 assembly  members, he said, regarding the contents of that document, which  will outline the general guidelines and policy to be followed  with regard to the measures that are undertaken.    The consultation process initiated four months ago with the  participation of approximately 3 million workers, students, and  peasants will not end, he said, adding that at the end of this  month rank-and-file meetings will be initiated in the  neighborhoods during which regional delegates will reflect on  these complex economic issues with the people. Thus, the  measures adopted and those about to be executed will continue to  be debated in what Alarcon characterized as Cuban society's  uninterrupted process of parliamentarism.    Alarcon added that the labor unions will soon initiate a  series of assemblies at all the work centers, thereby  reestablishing the examination of economic efficiency, increased  production, and profitability. He said the Assembly members are  more prepared now than they were in December, when the Assembly  initiated the debate on financial reorganization.    I, especially, participated in over 50 meetings throughout  the country and all the National Assembly members accompanied me  and participated in the national debate, he said.    Alarcon described as very positive the results of the first  day of sessions, at which over 30 deputies spoke outlining the  paths that should be followed and the measures that should be  implemented to resolve such a complex problem as Cuba's current  financial imbalance.    According to figures provided by Jose Luis Rodriquez,  minister of finance and prices, at present, there is a working  capital surplus estimated at approximately 11.3 billion pesos  (equivalent to dollars at the government exchange rate).    Cuba is also burdened with a budget deficit of approximately  4.2 billion pesos, which we are trying to counteract by  eliminating subsidies because of the losses suffered by  unprofitable businesses, the selective increase of prices and  rates, and a new tax system.</p>

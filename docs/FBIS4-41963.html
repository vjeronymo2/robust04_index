			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 25/6/1994 -- The third plenary  session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Black Sea Basin  Countries, recently held in Bucharest, focused on concrete  aspects of economic collaboration between member states, stated  to BASA Fiodor Angheli, deputy chairman of the Moldovan  Parliamentary Commission for Foreign Policy. Angheli declared  that the elaboration of the regulations concerning the favored  commercial status in the relations between the Parliamentary  Assembly member-states is of primary importance. It is also  vital to elaborate mutually advantageous import-export tariffs  and to modify the system of license granting. He also mentioned  that establishing inter bank collaboration relations and  creating a common bank of the Black Sea Basin countries would  stimulate trade between them. Angheli considers that the  transit of goods from Greece and Turkey to Russia and the  Ukraine would be substantially facilitated by the creation of  some high-standard services at the Giurgiulesti-Galati frontier  point. "By participating in the Parliamentary Assembly, Moldova  has a chance to establish large trade programs through both  multilateral and bilateral agreements," declared Angheli.</p>

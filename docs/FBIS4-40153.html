			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Solton from the "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] The Korean Foreign Ministry stated that Pyongyang  would withdraw immediately from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA]. Station commentator Solton writes on it as  follows:    The decision Pyongyang adopted means in fact that it would  withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. The  Foreign Ministry statement said that Korea will realize the  nuclear plan independently from now on and that it will not  allow the international inspectors to enter the nuclear  facilities.    This is a dangerous decision that would bring about the  gravest consequences. By closing the door to the international  inspection team, Korea supports the suspicion that it either  already has a nuclear weapon or intends to develop one.    The Korean leaders claim that their nuclear development is  peaceful in nature. Then why does Pyongyang avoid international  inspection and intimidate the world community? Why does  Pyongyang warn that sanctions would mean merciless war, while  daring to subject itself to sanctions?    This could be interpreted to be designed for internal  purposes. At any rate, the situation on the Korean peninsula is  aggravating, and this is causing serious worries for neighboring  countries, including Russia.    The presidents of Russia and the United States discussed the  issue over the telephone yesterday. President Yeltsin and  President Clinton exchanged views about the resolution being  prepared by the UN Security Council. Both the possible  sanctions and the plan to call international meetings should be  equally reflected in the resolution to ensure the security of  the North and the South and to ensure the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula.    There is still enough time to overcome the dangerous  situation ensuing from Pyongyang's decision to withdraw from the  IAEA by sheer political means rather than by resorting to  sanctions. However, unless Pyongyang shows a good-intentioned,  sincere attitude for the solution of the problem, it will be  impossible to solve the problem without resorting to sanctions.</p>

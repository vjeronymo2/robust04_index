			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Higher interest charges restrict Boddington profits to Pounds 20.3m BODDINGTON, the pubs and drinks wholesaling group, reported a marginal increase, from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 20.3m, in annual pre-tax profits as sharply higher interest charges offset a strong trading performance. The cost of carrying its 20.4 per cent stake in JA Devenish, after last year's unsuccessful bid, accounted for Pounds 1.3m of the Pounds 3.55m increase in interest. Dividend payments from Devenish amounted to Pounds 140,000. A further Pounds 3.27m of bid costs were taken below the line. Mr Hubert Reid, managing director, said that the net cost of the Devenish stake this year was expected to be about Pounds 1.8m. 'We regard this as a strategic investment,' he added, 'and we are keeping all our options open.' Trading profit for the year to December 28 1991, rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 25.7m (Pounds 22m) as turnover from continuing activities jumped 34 per cent to Pounds 185m (Pounds 138.5m). The group's 478 pubs, most of them now refurbished in an investment programme which last year cost Pounds 6.2m, raised trading profits from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 18.4m on turnover ahead 8.8 per cent. Further pub acquisitions are being sought. Drinks wholesaling, expanded by two acquisitions last autumn, more than doubled trading profit from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 4.29m and turnover is expected to rise from Pounds 75m to more than Pounds 100m this year. Profits of the health care division advanced 61 per cent to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 1.4m) as occupancy levels rose to an average 80 per cent in the 16 nursing homes. Hotels and restaurants increased profits by 7.3 per cent, from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds 2.62m. Henrys Table restaurants, with sales 19 per cent ahead in the last quarter, led strong end-of-year performances which had continued through the first quarter of 1992, Mr Reid said. Borrowings totalled Pounds 98.7m, including Pounds 22.3m for the Devenish stake, with gearing at 45 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 13.4p to 13.6p. and a final dividend of 4.25p makes a total for the year of 6.6p.</p>

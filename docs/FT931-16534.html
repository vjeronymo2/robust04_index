			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Franc exchanges The battle for the French franc is getting tough. Yesterday's Franco-German declaration of determination to defend the existing parity and the 2 percentage point rise in overnight French interest rates were a pre-emptive strike against the speculators. The measures display a sophistication - and admittedly a level of international collaboration - which was conspicuously absent during the UK's vain attempt to defend sterling last September. Yet the stakes have also been raised, perhaps rashly when the Bundesbank is still deeply reluctant to cut official lending rates. Together with talk of independence for the Banque de France and a closer bilateral monetary relationship, yesterday's moves have bought a little more time. The two sides will have to continue pulling such tricks out of the hat for several weeks, though, until domestic German conditions warrant a cut in rates. Ultimately that may prove impossible. The Bundesbank would then have to decide whether to cut rates anyway or risk seeing the ERM collapse. Its decision would be easier if Bonn were to act on the budget. This may become a focus of political pressure from European partners anxious for lower rates but aware of the futility of leaning on the Bundesbank directly. The French equity market was curiously unperturbed by yesterday's rate rise. It may be signalling an expectation that lower French rates will be the outcome whatever happens to the currency. Either the Bundesbank or the franc will soon have to give way. The UK's position above the fray helped sterling rise above DM2.50. That has its negative side. The Treasury has no appetite for lower base rates, but a stronger pound is eroding the monetary relaxation on which 1993 recovery hopes are predicated.</p>

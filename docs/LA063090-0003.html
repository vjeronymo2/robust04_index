			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE AMMO FOR GUN EDUCATION;  </P> <P> A 13-YEAR-OLD DIES IN LA PALMA; GUN BILL DIES IN SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> This week in La Palma, a 13-year-old boy was accidently shot by a 12-year-old  friend he was visiting, and later died. Police said there had been a rule in  the house that the handgun must be kept unloaded. But as one officer observed,  "Somebody loaded it. It didn't load itself."  </P> <P> How an unloaded gun gets loaded and into the hands of an adolescent is a bitter  mystery in a long-running national tragedy. If all the allegedly "disarmed" and  "safely stored" guns were as advertised, the world would be a safer place for  youngsters like Adam LaFortune, the victim.  </P> <P> But despite the need for basic education on the safe storage and handling of  firearms, a sensible effort to require new handgun owners to complete a safety  training course faltered last month when Gov. George Deukmejian sent a puzzling  veto message to the Legislature. For the evident benefit of gun-control people,  the governor noted in his veto message that, " . . . if you pay $17 and sit in  a class without paying any attention or learning anything, you are still given  a certificate . . . ." And he worried that the lack of a nearby course might  somehow prove inconvenient, and "a barrier to the purchase of a handgun."  </P> <P> The vetoed legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos),  would not by any means have been a cure-all.  </P> <P> There is no course in the world that can give people the minimum common sense  needed to keep a handgun unloaded. No Ph.D is required to understand that guns  must be kept totally out of the reach of children.  </P> <P> But at least the proposed law could have ensured that there was some safety  training for purchasers of handguns. For a gun, like an automobile, is a  potential killer; the state has the right to require education and licensing.  Now the fate of passage awaits a new administration -- perhaps one not inclined  to veto it. Yet so far neither gubernatorial candidate has declared his or her  position on this bill.  </P></p>

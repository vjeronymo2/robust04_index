The  offensive by the Khmer People's National Liberation Front was launched less  than a week after Vietnam proclaimed the complete withdrawal of its troops from  Cambodia. Military sources at the Thai-Cambodian border said the fighting,  along a 30-mile stretch from 12 miles to 25 inside Cambodia, had forced the  closure of all border trading points.  </P></p>

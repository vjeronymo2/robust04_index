			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Suspension of Allied Group shares in HK may be lifted THE Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has withdrawn a request that the HK stock exchange suspend trading in Mr Lee Ming Tee's flagship Allied Group and nine other companies, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. An SFC statement said resumption of trading of the shares, all suspended on Wed-nesday at the SFC's request, was a matter for the companies to arrange with the exchange. It also gave reasons for its request that a government inspector be appointed to investigate Allied Group and four other companies, citing concerns about a rights issue from Wai Yick, a property investment group. Earlier, the government said it had appointed Mr Nicholas Allen, of accountants Coopers and Lybrand, as an inspector to investigate these companies. The SFC said it had investigated possible breaches of the Takeovers Code and the Securities (Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance. 'These investigations were triggered by concerns about a rights issue proposed by Wai Yick in January 1992 for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties from Allied Properties (HK),' said the SFC. It said it also investigated un-usual share price movements around the time of proposals to merge Allied Properties (HK), Allied Industries International and Asia Securities International with Allied Group.</p>

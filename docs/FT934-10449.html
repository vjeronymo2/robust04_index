			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Right wing leads backbench race MR BOB DUNN, MP for Dartford, is being tipped to win the election for the vice-chairmanship of the backbench 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs - a move that would dash government hopes of diluting rightwing influence on the influential body. Mr Dunn is one of 13 candidates from the right or centre-right of the party who will be supported by the rightwing 92 group in elections to the 1922's executive. These will almost certainly take place on November 25.</p>

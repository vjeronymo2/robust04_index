			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Ministers rapped over union policy THE GOVERNMENT has been criticised by the International Labour Organisation in Geneva for its lack of consultation with trade unions over employment policy. In a report which will be submitted to the organisation's annual conference in June, its committee of experts says it 'remains deeply concerned at the serious difficulties in establishing the tripartite consultations on employment policy measures' required by the ILO convention ratified by Britain in 1966. The claims are contained in a report which will be submitted to the annual ILO conference in June. The committee insists that although 'the results of the consultations are not binding on the government', it is 'obliged to ensure that tripartite consultations are effective'. The report also requests the government to consider amending the 1988 Employment Act that prevents unions from disciplining members who refuse to take part in lawful strikes and other industrial action, or who seek to persuade fellow members to refuse such action. The committee says it considers that these provisions remove the right of unions to express their dissatisfaction with such members. On the contentious issue of the banning of unions at the government's GCHQ communications centre in 1984, the report says it 'firmly hopes high-level talks will lead to a positive outcome'. So far, meetings have been held between the government and civil service union leaders in October last year and in January.</p>

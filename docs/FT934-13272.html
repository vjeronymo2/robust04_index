			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Charge cards also cost dear Sir, Your report, 'Paying with cash costs UK consumers Pounds 800m a year' (October 18), should have read 'paying with cash costs UK banking sector (not UK consumers) dearly'. Any notion of cost is the difference between two alternatives, here being the use of cards instead of cash. Paying with cards would be beneficial to the banks by increasing annual membership income, charging retailers 4 per cent or more on sales revenues (ultimately paid by consumers), and tempting consumers to spend more by getting into debt. Perhaps there ought to be a study of how much charge cards cost UK consumers every year. Bimal Prodhan, fellow, Templeton College, Oxford OX1 5NY</p>

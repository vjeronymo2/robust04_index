			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: POITIER, LANCASTER TEAM UP FOR ABC MINISERIES  </P> <P> SIDNEY POITIER and Burt Lancaster, two great Oscar-winning movie stars, will  join forces and appear together for the first time on television in ABC's  miniseries "Separate but Equal."  </P> <P> Poitier portrays Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Lancaster appears as  John W. Davis, Marshall's chief opponent in the historic civil rights case  known as Brown vs. the Board of Education. Marshall was counsel for the NAACP  Legal Defense Fund and led the fight to end school segregation in the United  States.  </P> <P> So who persuaded these two super-actors to pool their talents for this  small-screen blockbuster? George Stevens Jr., that's who. Stevens, a talented  man, is to television what his father was to movies. He will direct and produce  "Separate but Equal."  </P> <P> Shooting on the ambitious project began early this week in South Carolina.  </P> <P> DON'T MISS the Aug. 12 issue of Parade magazine and writer Ed Klein's incisive,  candid interview with former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> In this piece, Reagan defends his oft-criticized wife Nancy: "Our marriage is  the kind of thing that an adolescent believes marriage should be. . . . I don't  think either one of us thinks of making a big decision without the other."  Reagan says that even he was shocked by the controversial $2-million fee he  received for a speaking engagement in Japan but insists he was not "cashing in  on the presidency. . . . If I'd been of a nature to cash in, I would have  returned to the industry that I left."  </P> <P> Reagan readily admits to having enjoyed being President, though he often felt  trapped and confined because of all the security measures, "like a bird in a  gilded cage." Still, if Reagan could have had his way, he would have lingered a  while longer in that cage. He wanted very much to run again in 1988.  </P> <P> The 22nd Amendment, limiting a President to two terms in office, ended his  reign. The 40th President of the United States declares emphatically: "That  amendment is an infringement on the democratic right of the people. The people  have a right to vote for whomever they want and for as many times as they  want!"  </P> <P> NOW HERE is a bit of amusing movie trivia. All you "Casablanca" fanatics out  there already know that young actor Reagan was once briefly considered to play  the bitter cafe owner Rick in that famous film. But were you aware that Dooley  Wilson was not the first choice as Rick's piano player?  </P> <P> No, originally, the producer, Hal Wallis, considered either Hazel Scott or Lena  Horne for the part. When the legend that is Lena was recently told about this,  she laughed and said, "Well, I guess they would have had to change that line to  'Play it again, Mandy.' "  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "What Did Erbakan Really Try to </F> Say?"]    [Text] On Wednesday [20 April] pro-Islamic Welfare Party  (RP) Chairman Professor Necmettin Erbakan made some "historical"  statements which could well be quoted by future generations as a  pretext for a military intervention in Turkey.    Even his own party people did not understand why the veteran  politician suddenly went off the track and described the  incidents in Ankara and Istanbul over the weekend as an Islamic  "uprising," nor his threat that sooner or later his party would  come to power to establish a "just order" in Turkey and that  people should either accept the transition from the current  system to the "just order" peacefully or through blood. There  was a wide range of speculations on why Erbakan, also known as  the "hodja" [Muslim teacher], decided to make such remarks.  Some well-respected Islamic intellectuals felt Erbakan's  statements were a blatant provocation and that the RP chairman  was serving certain Western interests who are trying to belittle  the cause of Islam in Turkey.    Erbakan had said: "If you do not accept the election results  (the fact that the Welfare had won the municipal polls) then  people will rise up as we saw during the weekend." It seems the  hodja misses the point that while his party won 19.5 percent of  the votes, 80.5 percent of the voters did not vote for the  Welfare and thus rejected his program. That means a great  majority of the people are not in favor of these pro-Islamic  policies.    If his so-called uprising means the minority wants to rule  the majority then Erbakan will be in for a great surprise. We  do not think Turkey experienced an uprising at the weekend.  What started as a government approved protest by  ultranationalists in Bosnia-Herzegovina got out of hand in  Ankara and Istanbul as some radical Islam activists infiltrated  the ranks of the demonstrators and tried to exploit the  situation. Actually they were successful to a certain extent  and the security forces were caught off guard.    Erbakan has attracted the fury of everyone, both among the  pro-Islamic supporters in Turkey, the moderates and even the  radicals.    We feel the Welfare should not get carried away with its  success at the municipal elections. As we mentioned before,  this is not a grand victory but a relative achievement for a  religiously orientated party. If they feel they can capitalize  on the boost they received at the elections by taking to the  streets as a show of force they will soon see how mistaken they  are.    What Erbakan and his colleagues should be doing now is to  reconcile their differences with the masses in Turkey and prove  they are an integral part of the Republican order. That way  they can put an end to the dangerous polarization of the  "believers" and the "nonbelievers" and create an atmosphere of  brotherhood in Turkey. Talking of blood and uprisings is not the  way to do this because then the silent masses, who are believers  but who are also secularist, will feel obliged to deal a heavy  blow to the fanatics who think they can turn Turkey into a  Muslim fundamentalist state.</p>

He had been working for  six years at Agno airport near Lugano. The man admitted his  crimes, according to the Lugano public ministry and the canton  police.    Living in Barbengo in the southern suburbs of Lugano, the 40  year-old police corporal had been under surveillance for several  weeks. The man was arrested on his return from a trip to Mexico.    Immediately questioned by Ticino Prosecutor Jacques Ducry,  the policeman made confessions. He had been involved, since  February 1991, in international cocaine trafficking in South  America, Switzerland, and Italy. A casual cocaine user, the  Ticino corporal had imported and delivered 150 kg of cocaine,  making 70,000 Swiss francs.    The Ticino authorities stated that the police corporal had  been in contact with the world of drug traffickers in the course  of his duties at Lugano airport. The canton's police force  asked the State Council to suspend the man immediately. The  corporal was imprisoned at the end of his period in custody.  The Ticino authorities stressed: "The inquiry is being made at  an international level and therfore we cannot reveal any more  information."</p>

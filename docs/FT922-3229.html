			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Osborne slips to Pounds 855,000 OSBORNE &amp; LITTLE, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics group, reported pre-tax profits down by Pounds 37,000 to Pounds 855,000 in the year to March 31. Sir Peter Osborne, chairman, said turnover was slightly up at Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 18.6m), with an increase in the second six months eliminating the decrease in the first half. However, the net operating profit margin had been affected by higher distribution costs and an increase in royalties payable due to the continuing growth in sales of the Nina Campbell brand. Interest charges fell by Pounds 135,000 to Pounds 525,000. Gearing was reduced from 153 per cent to 118 per cent. Sir Peter said costs continued to be rigorously monitored and this had resulted in lower stock levels. Sir Peter said turnover for the first two months of the current year was level with last year, and the group could only wait patiently for signs of recovery. Earnings per share came out at 7.83p (7.9p). The final dividend is maintained at 2.35p for a same-again total of 4.35p.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: In the footsteps of Berenson - Susan Moore pays tribute to the late, great connoisseur Philip Pouncey Philip Pouncey's feats of connoisseurship have become legendary. Possessing an encyclopaedic knowledge of both Italian Renaissance painting and drawing, and blessed with an unfailing visual memory, he was able to make discoveries in field that eluded fellow experts. Over almost 60 years of study, he correctly identified some 1,000 anonymous or mis-catalogued drawings in collections around the world. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Louvre and the Uffizi have all staged handsome exhibitions in homage to Pouncey, who died in 1990. Now it is the turn of the British Museum, where Pouncey was Assistant Keeper of Prints and Drawings from 1945-66. While the previous shows celebrated his brilliant attributions with choice selections of Italian drawings, the BM also attempts to demonstrate the working methods of a connoisseur. In so doing it defends the validity of this now unfashionable approach to art history. Like his great precursors Bernard Berenson, Crowe and Cavalcaselle, Pouncey understood the fundamental importance of reconstructing an artist's oeuvre, of defining an individual style and being able to distinguish it from another. As almost no Renaissance drawings are signed or documented, identifying the draughtsman's hand is rarely easy. An eye for quality is also essential to distinguish copy from original. Pouncey's rare capacity to empathise with particular artistic personalities is most vividly witnessed by a crouching male nude by Bastianino, an obscure Ferrarese imitator of Michelangelo by whom no drawings were known to survive. 'If Bastianino had made drawings,' declared Pouncey, 'this is exactly the sort of drawing one would have expected from him.' Sure enough, he later discovered the figure - a devil about to seize his victim - in Bastianino's altarpiece of the Last Judgment in Rovello Porro. He attributed another sheet to the 16th century Veronese artist Domenico Brusasorci, and added that it looked like a study for a painting on slate. The related picture was located in Hungary. Its support was, of course, slate. Such inspired insights, although sometimes the work of a moment, were the result of the devotion of a lifetime. Notebooks dating from Pouncey's first trip to Italy in 1932-3 show him copying figures and drawing plans of fresco cycles as a means of fixing them in his memory. Then came annotating reference books and meticulously cross-referenced notebooks, index-cards, correspondence and files. The passion for exhaustive list-making even extended to the cellar-book where the carefully chosen and lovingly cherished claret was as scrupulously indexed as any minor masterpiece. This unusual show is an affectionate tribute to a remarkable scholar. Few artists have had the opportunity - or the ability - to determine posterity's vision of their age. In his celebrated studies of the court of Henry VIII, Hans Holbein the Younger gave us a totally convincing cast of characters and sense of the sober mood of Reformation England. It was the Swiss artist's good fortune to come to a court of a king who had broken with Rome and had no need of altarpieces and Madonnas. For Holbein's gift was for portraiture. His meticulously wrought and sensitive likenesses in black and coloured chalks preserved in the royal collection - of the family of the saintly Sir Thomas More, the poets Surrey and Wyatt, and the likes of the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Warham and the odious Southwell - make their final stop on a national tour at the NPG in London. * Finally, a rare instance of a work of art of national interest repatriated to a British public collection. The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford has acquired from a French private collector Rubens' fine portrait of the Earl of Arundel, one of the earliest and greatest of all English antiquaries and collectors. Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox negotiated the purchase and the Pounds 900,000 was provided by grants from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art-Collections Fund, the MGC/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund, the Michael Marks Charitable Trust and the Friends of the Ashmolean. Rubens probably made the chalk and pen drawing from the life while on a diplomatic mission to Charles I in 1629-30 and took it back to Antwerp to serve as a likeness for a number of painted portraits of the Earl. As the Ashmolean holds most of Arundel's collection of classical sculpture, the Musee du Louvre raised no objection to the export of the drawing. The Study of Italian Drawings: The Contribution of Philip Pouncey; British Museum until April 24. Holbein and the Court of Henry VIII, sponsored by Capital House: National Portrait Gallery until April 17. Director's Choice: Dutch and Flemish drawings; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, until March 27</p>

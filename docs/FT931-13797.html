			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Improved coal, gold sales help lift MIM MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a 45 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 51.1m (USDollars 36.5m) for the six months to December 13, in spite of a weak second quarter. Net profit rose to ADollars 76.8m including an abnormal profit of ADollars 25.7m from the sale of a 28 per cent interest in the McArthur River zinc mining project. Sales increased by 3.6 per cent to ADollars 871m. MIM said the improved result was caused by a fall in the value of the Australian dollar, higher domestic gold sales, higher coal sales from the Oakey Creek mines, and a higher zinc price. Gold operations at Porgera, the Papua New Guinea mining operation which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, a 65 per cent subsidiary of MIM, produced 'good' results, the group said. Second-quarter net profit before abnormals was ADollars 16.6m, a significant increase on the ADollars 12.5m profit in the comparable period of the previous year, but substantially lower than the ADollars 34.5m profit achieved in the first quarter of the current year. MIM said the subdued second-quarter result was influenced by a significant downturn in prices for copper, lead, silver and zinc. Sales volumes were also lower, particularly for zinc. Mr Norm Fussell, chief executive, said the group had achieved its target of cutting costs at the Mount Isa mine in Queensland by ADollars 100m a year. MIM said last month that output of zinc/lead ore at Mount Isa would be cut by 15 per cent in response to low prices. The directors declared an unfranked interim dividend of 2.5 cents, compared with 2 cents in the first half of the previous year. MIM shares closed 3cents higher at ADollars 2.32 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

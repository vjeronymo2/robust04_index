			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Explosions cause heavy casualties in Sarajevo A chain of explosions sowed terror and caused heavy casualties in central Sarajevo yesterday in an attempt by rebel Serbs to force Bosnia's Moslem leaders into peace negotiations, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. People fled to safety as mortars fell on streets outside the presidency building, parliament and city-centre shops in the worst daylight attacks for several weeks in the Bosnian capital. The fighting forced UN peacekeepers to close Sarajevo airport to relief flights for the besieged city's 380,000 inhabitants and caused a visible change of mood. The attack closed the airport just as General Lewis MacKenzie, the outgoing commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo, was about to take off, Croatian radio said.</p>

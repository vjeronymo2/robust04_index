			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> WASTE CENTER MAY REOPEN  </P> <P> City officials hope to reopen next week a household hazardous-waste program  that was closed for nearly five months.  </P> <P> Craig Perkins, administrative and environmental services manager for the city's  general services department, said storage and labeling problems identified by  the state Department of Health Services forced the closure in April.  </P> <P> The problems have been corrected, he said.  </P> <P> State officials are scheduled to inspect the facility this week for  recertification. Perkins said that if the city passes the inspection, the  center will open Wednesday through Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to noon beginning  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The center, at the city yard at 2500 Michigan Ave., will accept household  hazardous waste such as paint, paint thinner, motor oil, pesticides and bleach.  The facility is open only to Santa Monica residents, and disposals are limited  to a maximum of five containers of five gallons each.  </P></p>

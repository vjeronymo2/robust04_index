			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Trade" rubric: </F> "`Rosvooruzheniye' Is the Best Friend of the Military-Industrial  Sector. But One Should Not Expect To Earn $20 Billion"]    [Text] Last week, the INTERFAX news agency reported:  "Viktor Samoylov, general director of the state-owned  "Rosvooruzheniye" company, believes that Russia could  potentially sell $20 billion worth of arms and military hardware  in 1994." General Samoylov has said in an interview for  SEGODNYA, however, that "he was quoted not quite accurately."  In 1993, arms exports amounted to around $2 billion, so a  drastic ten-fold increase in exports is impossible in  principle." "The signing of a military-technical export  contract usually requires a few years of preparatory work,  whereas our company has just been set up."    In 1994, the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company expects to  achieve better results than it had in 1993, but not to increase  exports "ten-fold." Gen. Samoylov also stressed that "Russia is  by no means going to violate UN sanctions against Iraq, Libya,  and Yugoslavia. Any such statements, whoever might make them,  will only undermine faith in Russia as a trade partner."    A drastic reduction in state military orders has been  prompting defense industry managers to demand that they be given  a free hand in foreign trade. Many arms manufacturers have been  conducting talks with various foreign middlemen for a number of  years already, but not a single large contract has reached the  signing stage.    Gen. Samoylov said that "`Rosvooruzheniye' has perfect  relations with all the main arms manufacturers. As for the  claims that the state company is a monster that may stifle the  military-industrial sector, they come from those whom the  presidential edict on setting up the `Rosvooruzheniye' state  company has prevented from carrying out their effectively  semi-criminal activity -- attempts to export state-of-the-art  weapons in small consignments or in single pieces."</p>

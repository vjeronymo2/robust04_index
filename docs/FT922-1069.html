			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Race is on to win 'national institution': At least nine runners line up for the spoils as MGN rides out Maxwell legacy The race is on, Mr Charles Wilson, editor-in-chief of The Sporting Life and editorial director of Mirror Group Newspapers, declared yesterday. The race, which could turn out to be long and tortuous, is for the ownership of the UK's leading left-of-centre newspaper group now essentially controlled by a group of banks following the collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's publishing empire. The riders are likely to include Sir Peter Parker, former chairman of British Rail (representing a management buy-out team), Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of US food group J Heinz and of Independent Newspapers in Dublin, and Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph. At least nine groups are believed to have lodged an interest in MGN with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the Maxwell private interests. The start of the race was marked yesterday by the directors of MGN making a resolute public display of sweeping up the mess left behind by Mr Robert Maxwell, the man who once loved appearing in the pages of the Daily Mirror and fine-tuning its editorials. As Sir Robert Clark, the new chairman of the newspaper group, said with a touch of understatement: 'Recent months have been extremely difficult and unsettling for the MGN group and without precedent.' The publication of a circular to shareholders and pro forma accounts for 1991 set out in 96-pages the enormous contrast between the Maxwell 'unusual transactions that almost brought the company to its knees and a newspaper group that is trading strongly and increasing its market share'. After months of headlines, the 'unprecedented' difficulties yesterday turned into precise numbers. The extraordinary provisions totalled no less than Pounds 491.7m - Pounds 421.5m after deferred tax is deducted. They cover everything from an estimated pension fund deficit of Pounds 193m to a Pounds 122.4m provision for losses on transactions with other Maxwell companies and the repaying of a Pounds 50m MGN loan from Bankers Trust which never reached the Mirror headquarters but, by a circuitous route, was apparently used to pay off another Maxwell debt - with Bankers Trust. The extraordinary items include refinancing and advisory costs of Pounds 20.5m, including payments of some Pounds 3m to accountants. In contrast to the extraordinary items, Sir Robert said trading level profits of MGN in 1991 had risen 11.9 per cent to Pounds 91m and margins were approaching 20 per cent. 'Despite the terrible blows which were inflicted on the group and despite the major disruptions we have had a very encouraging trading performance,' he said. The main MGN titles include the Daily and Sunday Mirror, The People, the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail apart from The Sporting Life. Pre-tax profits fell by 39 per cent to Pounds 51m because of the costs associated with closing The Racing Times in the US, lower income from Donohue, a Canadian associate in the paper and pulp business, and the non-recurrance of the previous year's Pounds 15.5m pension surplus. Publication of the accounts came a day after the announcement that a consortium of seven banks led by National Westminster and Midland had agreed a Pounds 260m financial package and the continuation of Pounds 180m in existing leasing finance. The two-year deal includes Pounds 70m for the installation of colour presses at the Scottish Daily Record. The next step is to seek the relisting of the MGN shares - suspended at 125p in December - after the company's annual meeting on July 16. Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, will not commit himself about when the 54 per cent MGN stake under his control will be sold. It is unlikely to happen quickly because the administrators say they believe 'it would be beneficial if some of the residual uncertainty surrounding the company was removed prior to a disposal taking place'. Shareholders' funds at the start of the year on a pro forma basis were Pounds 841.9m and had dropped to Pounds 436.3m by the year-end. Balance sheet gearing increased from 91.3 per cent at the year-end to 96.2 per cent on May 15. The fixed assets - the value of the newspaper titles - have not been changed from the Pounds 625m figure set by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the consultancy firm, in 1990 and a figure used in the flotation. The board has endorsed the existing strategy that MGN's five main titles form the core of the business and are interdependent. After the announcements of the profit and the extraordinary losses Sir Robert said MGN was not just a product but a national institution with a belief in editorial integrity. 'We also intend that the group will maintain its traditional political stance. On this basis we have a successful newspaper group,' he said. The survival of MGN's traditional political stance will depend on who wins the race and why they decide to join it.

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A TOAST TO SCIENTIST'S TENACITY;  </P> <P> UCI FETES JAPAN PRIZE WINNER  </P> <P> F. Sherwood Rowland, the UC Irvine chemistry professor who was awarded the  prestigious Japan Prize on Wednesday, was late for a campus reception in his  honor. He was teaching his morning atmospheric chemistry class.  </P> <P> Rowland, a tenacious researcher who discovered that substances found in aerosol  sprays, air-conditioning systems and cleaning solvents are destroying the  Earth's ozone shield, explained that it was "class as usual."  </P> <P> Chancellor Jack Peltason was considerably more effusive. The award, which  recognizes scientific and technological achievements that contribute to world  peace, is accompanied by a cash prize of 50 million yen -- about $387,600 at  current exchange rates.  </P> <P> "The whole world is cheering him," Peltason said in a champagne toast  Wednesday. "He didn't just do the work in the laboratory, but he realized the  consequences of his discovery and at great personal risk . . . spread the word  to Congress and around the world."  </P> <P> The world recognition is long-awaited vindication for the 62-year-old scientist  who was derided as a crackpot and a publicity hound for years after his 1974  discovery with postdoctoral researcher Mario Molina. Rowland's research and  warnings resulted in a 1978 U.S. congressional ban on chlorofluorocarbons, or  CFCs, in aerosol sprays and the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international plan  to control the compounds.  </P> <P> The ozone layer is a band of gas that protects animals and plants from the  sun's ultraviolet rays. Depletion of the ozone is expected to lead to higher  skin cancer rates and potentially disastrous climatic changes.  </P> <P> The extent of damage from existing CFCs won't be known until the next century,  but Rowland said there has been significant progress to find chemical  substitutes for CFCs. Japan's largest manufacturer of CFCs, the Asahi Chemical  Co., announced earlier this week that it has developed a replacement compound,  Rowland said. The firm contends that the new compound will do much less damage  to the ozone.  </P> <P> "The problem on a global basis now has a life of its own," he said. "Solutions  are being sought by many governments and the United Nations, and changes are  being made. . . . The direction in which things are looking is (toward) a  (worldwide) ban within 15 years."  </P> <P> Harold Moore, UCI's dean of physical sciences and a longtime friend, described  Rowland as an extraordinary and committed scientist for whom "it would have  been out of character" not to persevere despite opposition to his findings.  </P> <P> "Sherry's contribution to environmental sciences is unparalleled. There hasn't  been anything else that has touched everything and everyone so profoundly,"  Moore said Wednesday. He ranked the Japan Prize, the Nobel Prize and the Welch  Award, presented by the Welch Foundation in Texas, as the top three honors in  science.  </P> <P> The challenge of the future, Moore said, will be preventing new ozone damage  around the world.  </P> <P> "Clearly it's a proud moment for the university and for Sherry," Moore said of  Rowland at the reception. "It's also a sad moment for all the rest of us,  because what Sherry is being recognized for is the depletion of the ozone  layer. It is time for the world to wake up and recognize the significance of  what it has done."  </P> <P> The Science and Technology Foundation of Japan, which awards two Japan Prizes  each year, also honored Harvard University professor E.J. Corey for his work in  the field of medicine. Corey was named a recipient of the Japan Award for his  40 years of research in organic chemistry, particularly in human cellular  immune functions. He also receives a prize of 50 million yen.  </P></p>

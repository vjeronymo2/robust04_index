			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODESTO'S MAIL-IN BALLOT MAY MARK A MODEL VOTE  </P> <P> Political consultants believe that they have seen the future of California  elections, and it is in Modesto.  </P> <P> An unprecedented use of absentee ballots has focused statewide attention on an  otherwise obscure special election today for an Assembly seat representing this  northern San Joaquin Valley city and surrounding communities.  </P> <P> With both the Democratic and Republican candidates spurring voters to use the  absentee system, about half the expected voters already have cast their  ballots. Barring an unexpectedly large turnout at the polls, the percentage of  absentee votes in the race will easily set a record for California, according  to the secretary of state.  </P> <P> And in the process, the 27th Assembly District contest will become a possible  model for how California elections will be waged in the future.  </P> <P> Political consultants view voting by mail in advance of elections as an  effective campaign tool because these are votes the candidate can bank on,  votes that can't be swayed by final-hour appeals from the opposition. Also, by  studying which neighborhoods are returning absentee ballots, campaign managers  can study apparent voting trends and adjust their strategy accordingly. And  after years of declining voter turnout, the widespread use of absentee ballots  could significantly increase the number of voters.  </P> <P> "The absentee ballot is going to change how politics is played in California in  the years to come," said Bernd Schwieren, a political consultant who is the  campaign manager for Richard Lang, the Republican candidate in the 27th  District race.  </P> <P> The pursuit of absentee votes in the contest became so competitive that the  state Republican Party created a campaign controversy by hiring Kelly Services  and other temporary workers to walk precincts and collect absentee ballot  applications. In addition to their hourly salary, the workers were paid $1 for  each absentee ballot application they collected.  </P> <P> Today's special election was called to fill the vacancy left when former  Assemblyman Gary Condit, a Democrat, won election to Congress last fall. Condit  replaced Democrat Tony Coelho, who resigned his seat amid controversy over his  personal finances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Break With Tradition  </P> <P> Traditionally, absentee ballots were only used by people unable to make it to  the polls on Election Day, either because they were out of town or ill. But in  the late 1970s, during the Administration of Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown  Jr., legislation passed that enabled California's registered voters to use  absentee ballots for any reason, including simple convenience.  </P> <P> In 1982, this legislation played a key role in a major election for the first  time when Republican George Deukmejian defeated Democrat Tom Bradley in an  extremely tight gubernatorial race. Bradley received the most votes among those  who went to the polls on Election Day, but because Republican campaign  strategists sent hundreds of thousands of absentee ballot applications to  voters throughout the state, Deukmejian won the race.  </P> <P> Since then, extensive use of absentee ballots figured sporadically in state  elections, but it was not a major factor again until Condit's victory in the  special congressional election in the San Joaquin Valley four months ago.  </P> <P> Condit's aggressive solicitation of absentee ballots was a strategy devised by  San Francisco political consultant Clinton Reilly. Said John Whitehurst,  Condit's campaign manager: "In special elections, the turnout is low and more  Republicans than Democrats traditionally vote. . . . We were looking for a way  to compete. We went after the absentee ballots as a way to get more Democrats  to vote."  </P> <P> Whitehurst added, "Because we had such a lead in the mail vote in the Condit  campaign, I knew a week before Election Day that we'd won."  </P> <P> In December, the absentee-ballot strategy again helped a Democrat. Former  Assemblywoman Lucy Killea of San Diego lost among Election Day voters in a  state Senate race, but because she locked up enough absentee votes, she won the  contest.  </P> <P> The abortion issue received most of the attention in the campaign because Roman  Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher barred Killea, a Catholic, from receiving  Communion because of her pro-choice stand. But in terms of pure tactics, her  pursuit of absentee voters was critical to her victory, political consultants  said.  </P> <P> Republicans learned from their two 1989 losses and vowed to fight for the  absentee vote in future state elections, said James Dignan, vice chairman of  the California Republican Party.  </P> <P> "We realized that if we were going to be successful in the 1990s, we were going  to have to improve our techniques in getting the absentee ballot," Dignan said.  </P> <P> In the 27th District race, Democratic candidate Sal Cannella criticized the  state GOP for its use of temporary workers in collecting absentee ballots,  calling the tactic "a desperate attempt . . . to try to buy this election."  </P> <P> Dignan defended hiring temporary workers, saying they have been used in other  political campaigns, and "they were well worth the money."  </P> <P> After the primary election for the Assembly seat on Dec. 5, both Lang, the  Republican, and Cannella began the campaign for the mail vote. They identified  voters using computerized data banks and sent out absentee ballot applications  to party members. The applications, which included campaign pitches from other  politicians, were already filled out with the voter's name and address. All  voters had to do was sign the application and mail it to receive their absentee  ballot. The Republicans even provided free postage.  </P> <P> The campaign staffs followed up with phone calls and door-to-door visits to  ensure that the targeted voters sent in their applications and then their  ballots.  </P> <P> "In a state where many people are commuting long distances, voting by mail is  definitely the coming thing," said Barry Wyatt, chief of staff for Assemblyman  Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos). "I commute to Sacramento every day and I'm up at  6:30 in the morning and home at 8 at night, and it's darn hard to vote.  Punching out the ballot at home, at my leisure, makes a lot more sense."  </P></p>

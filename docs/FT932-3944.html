			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Ferruzzi gives debt details under watchdog pressure SHARES in Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group fell further yesterday amid growing concern about the rescue deal being thrashed out with its main bankers and controversy over the size of its borrowings. The falls came as a ministerial committee in Rome postponed until today discussion of a proposal by the Bank of Italy to allow commercial banks to take stakes in industrial companies. A debt-for-equity swap is one of the possibilities being discussed by Ferruzzi with a five-bank creditors' committee. The controversy over Ferruzzi's indebtedness came to a head on Wednesday night, when the group issued a detailed balance sheet ahead of its general meeting later this month. The figures confirmed net indebtedness of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company at L15,123bn (Pounds 6.71bn). However, the figures also indirectly confirmed press claims this week that the group's total debts approached L31,500bn. The higher figure, strongly denied by Ferruzzi on Wednesday, comprises Ferfin's gross debts of L25,346bn in Ferfin, the gross indebtedness of the commodity trading activities at L3,913bn and an estimated L900bn in gross debts at Serafino Ferruzzi, the family holding company. Ferruzzi said the borrowings of its commodity trading business had not traditionally been consolidated in the group total, as they were subject to sharp fluctuations and backed by physical commodities or futures contracts. The company declined to comment on the indebtedness of Serafino Ferruzzi. The group produced the more comprehensive figures after the Milan stock exchange's ruling council asked Italy's Consob stock exchange watchdog to take action, which could have involved suspending trading in the shares. Consob continues to monitor the situation closely. Yesterday it summoned Mr Carlo Sama, Ferfin's managing director, and creditor banks. After the meeting, Mr Sama said Ferruzzi had no intention of seeking a suspension. Lex, Page 14; World stock markets, Page 32</p>

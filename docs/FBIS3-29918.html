The demonstrators watched two actors perform a parody of the  U.S.-South Korean "alliance," wearing cartoon masks of Uncle Sam  and the traitor Kim Yong-sam.    They attacked the "alliance" as an obstacle to Korean  reunification, sang "Yankee Go Home" and chanted "Don't import  weapons" and "No to Team Spirit."</p>

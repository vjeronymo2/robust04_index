In 1994, the number  of key projects in the province is preliminary fixed at 40 or  more and the amount of planned investment is fixed at 10 billion  yuan, an increase of 40 percent over that in 1993. In addition  to the 20-odd projects, including the continued projects of the  Shandong section of Beijing-Jiulong Railway, Yantai Port, Rizhao  Port, and Dezhou, Weifang, Weihai, and Zouxian Power Plants, the  expansion of Laizhou Iron and Steel Plant, and the projects of  harnessing Huai He and Hai He, the province will also choose  through screening some key projects from newly started large  projects, such as the Shandong section of Jinan-Handan Railway,  Jinan-Liaocheng Highway, Jinan- Dezhou Highway, Qingdao and  Longkou Power Plants, Taian Chemical Industrial General Plant,  Yantai Electronics [words indistinct] Plant, and [words  indistinct].    To ensure that the funds needed by the above projects will  be  put in place in full amount and in a timely manner, the province  will reform investment and money-lending systems. After the  reform, construction projects will be divided into three major  categories, namely, basic projects, technological projects, and  competitive projects. Most of key projects belong to the scale  of using the investment of a policy nature. The government will  provide necessary manpower and material resources to make  investment in these projects through economic entities and  extensively absorb direct investment from foreign firms.  Through [words indistinct] banks, the province will give  preferential treatment and support to these projects in the  fields of providing loans and issuing bonds. After the reform,  the province will make a clear distinction between the  investment rights of the provincial authorities and the  governments in various cities, prefectures, and counties.  Beginning from this year, the provincial authorities will  primarily assume responsibility for the projects that have a  bearing on the overall situation of the provincial economic  development and the key projects that span several regions and  spheres. The source of funds is primarily arranged by the state  and the province, and a certain proportion of investment will be  absorbed from various cities, prefectures, and counties. The  funds arranged by cities and prefectures must be put in place on  time. Otherwise, the province will arrange for new projects.  The investment in basic projects of prefectures, cities, and  counties should be arranged by the localities where the projects  are located in line with the principle that whoever makes  investment should be benefited. As for the less developed  localities, in addition to gaining the state investment of a  policy nature, the province will give an appropriate amount of  subsidies. From now on, the government should gradually  increase the investment in the competitive projects.</p>

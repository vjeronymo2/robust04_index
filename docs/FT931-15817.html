			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Guinness adviser in court today THE criminal proceedings arising from the Guinness affair enter their last lap today with the start of the trial of Mr Thomas Ward, the US attorney who advised the company during the 1986 takeover battle for Distillers. Mr Ward faces three charges related to the fee paid to him by Guinness for his services. He is accused of the theft of Pounds 5.2m, false accounting concerning the fee and procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. Mr Ward denies all thecharges against him. The trial will take place at the Old Bailey and is expected to last three months. Mr Ward was arrested in June 1991 after returning voluntarily to the UK following the commencement of extradition proceedings by the British authorities in 1989. His trial is the third to take place over the Guinness affair. After the first trial, Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman; Mr Gerald Ronson, the Heron group chairman; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, and Sir Jack Lyons, a financier, were convicted between them on 28 charges of conspiracy, theft and false accounting. The second trial collapsed after the deterioration of the mental health of one of the defendants, Mr Roger Seelig, the former Morgan Grenfell corporate financier, while conducting his own defence. A nolle prosequi, a decision not to prosecute, was entered against him. The charges against his co-defendant, Lord Spens, were initially left to lie on the file but he was finally acquitted last November. Mr David Mayhew, a partner with brokers Cazenove, was due to appear alongside Mr Seelig in a third trial, but charges against him were dropped before the case came to court.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Commonwealth plans to assist in South Africa poll COMMONWEALTH leaders will today finalise a plan to send up to 70 representatives to assist South Africa prepare next April's general election and help monitor the poll itself, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's secretary general, said last night. It will be the largest such exercise in the Commonwealth's history. Mr Thabo Mbeki, a senior African National Congress official attending the conference as an observer, has raised the prospect of a longer-term Commonwealth role, inviting the body to act as a human rights 'watchdog' to help protect minority rights after a new government is installed. South Africa, out of the Commonwealth since 1961, is expected to be readmitted after the elections. Together with further discussions on world trade and debt, South Africa was one of the main items on the agenda during the heads of government retreat over the weekend at the historic centre of Paphos. Mr Mbeki's suggestion will be welcomed by many Commonwealth leaders keen to ensure that the association's principles are put into practice. British officials have always been cautious about such proposals, however, aware that British policy in Northern Ireland would come under scrutiny. Leaders were also preparing the conference communique, to be issued when the five-day summit ends this evening. It will confirm that the membership application from the west African state of Cameroon will be provisionally accepted, subject to implementation of political and human rights reforms by the time the summit reconvenes in New Zealand in 1995. One of the most difficult sections being drafted for the communique is the reference to Commonwealth policy towards Cyprus itself. A Cypriot government spokesman last night described as 'premature' speculation that President Glafcos Clerides, who is pressing a more forthright denunciation of Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus and renewed international efforts to resolve the dispute, had failed to win the backing of Mr John Major, the British prime minister.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Credit Foncier launches Ecu750m 12-year issue CREDIT Foncier, the French public-sector housing finance agency, yesterday launched a Ecu750m 12-year issue in the international bond market despite nervous conditions. Outstanding Ecu bonds weakened as dealers and investors anticipated heavy supply of new issues. Denmark is planning a Ecu1bn domestic bond issue before the end of this month. Spain and the European Community are considering large issues in the international market. Yesterday's deal, lead managed by Paribas Capital Markets, creates a benchmark at the 12-year maturity. This attracted institutional investors wanting to buy longer-dated Ecu paper. In addition, firms in the management group have the option of increasing their allotments by one third if demand is strong, so the deal may be increased to Ecu1bn next week, further improving liquidity. Against this, demand for Ecu bonds remained sluggish and participants commented that bonds offered a fair, but not generous, yield. The paper carries a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent and will be priced today to yield 7 basis points more than French government Ecu bonds at the 10-year maturity. Elsewhere, KFW, the German state project finance agency, launched a CDollars 250m five-year deal, lead managed by IBJ International. With a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent, the bonds were priced to yield 34 basis points more than comparable Canadian government paper, again considered ungenerous by participants, given poor market conditions. Canadian dollar bond prices have fallen sharply this month following a strong performance for most of last year. Government bond yields at the five-year maturity have risen from 7.25 to nearly 8 per cent since the start of this year. While there are pockets of demand for new bonds, many investors remain nervous. From a fixed-reoffered price of 99.80, the bonds traded down to 99.70 bid by the close. A retail targeted CDollars 100m five-year deal was launched by Credit Lyonnais, lead managed by Hambros. The 8 1/2 per cent bonds were priced to yield 10 or 11 basis points more than the KFW issue, reflecting the issuer's lower credit quality. There was no fixed re-offer, but the bonds were bid 1.85 points below issue price by the close, just inside full fees of 1.875 per cent. Stet, the Italian state telecommunications agency yesterday fixed the exercise price of warrants on SIP Savings shares at L1550. The warrants were part of Stet's L400bn equity-linked bond issue launched last month.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> STANFORD'S SURPRISE STARTER IS TOO TOUGH FOR GEORGIA  </P> <P> Things looked very familiar at the start for Stanford freshman Brian Sackinsky  against Georgia on Wednesday night. But the ending couldn't have been any  different or better for him.  </P> <P> A surprise starter for injured All-American Stan Spencer, Sackinsky, a 6-foot-4  right-hander from South Park High in Library, Pa., overcame a shaky start to  pitch his first complete game, a 4-2 victory over the Bulldogs that kept the  top-seeded Cardinal alive in the College World Series.  </P> <P> The victory means Stanford will face Georgia (50-19) again Friday in the  double-elimination tournament. Georgia handed Stanford its only loss, 16-2. The  winner advances to Saturday's championship game against either Oklahoma State  or Louisiana State.  </P> <P> Sackinsky (10-1) was hit hard in Sunday's loss to the Bulldogs. He lasted only  one-third of an inning in relief, yielding four hits and five runs.  </P> <P> This time, Georgia scored two runs in the first on two hits, but that was all  Sackinsky gave them as he finished with a six-hitter and a career-high 10  strikeouts.  </P> <P> Jeff Hammonds put the Cardinal (59-11) ahead for good in the seventh with a  two-run single.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "GATT Re-Entry"] </F>   [Text] A Chinese delegation left for Morocco yesterday to  attend a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT). Along with other participants, it will sign the Final  Act of the Uruguay Round negotiations and the Agreement on the  Establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO).    This means that China, which has taken part in the Uruguay  Round world trade negotiations, undertakes to fulfill all the  obligations stipulated in the Uruguay Round package and further  open its markets to its trade partners. These steps will help  to strengthen the world's multilateral trading system as  represented by the WTO, coming into being next year.    China has long sought to resume its status as a contracting  party of GATT. Moreover, the relevant talks must be concluded  successfully before WTO is formally established so that China  can be a founding member of the international trade body.  China's application to re-enter the organization has received  the backing of most of GATT's members.    But the talks have continued for eight years and regrettably  with no conclusive result so far.    In order to speed up the talks, China has displayed great  sincerity and complied with the agreements of the Uruguay Round  negotiations.    Meanwhile, China has taken steps to integrate its trade and  economy with those of the rest of the world. One example is the  market-based pricing system being instituted in China, one of  the principal demands of GATT. And China has promised to  further perform its duties in boosting an open market even after  it re- enters GATT.    However, China is a developing country. Our government is  quite right to reject the demand made by certain nations, that  China undertake the same commitments in Gatt as a developed  country. For that is far above the actual level of China's  economic development.    From an all-round perspective, now China is basically  qualified to resume its status in GATT and become a founder  member of WTO.    Pursuing a policy of opening to the rest of the world, China  has witnessed the rapid growth of its trade and economy in  recent years. It deserves a due place in the world multilateral  trading system. Without the participation of China, a nation  with one fifth of world's population and a dynamic growth rate,  the WTO cannot claim universal membership.    GATT members should remember that delaying China's re-entry  into GATT will be in no one's interest. If this happens, China  will provide market access on a reciprocal basis.    It is our hope that under the principle of an exchange based  on equality and mutual benefit, most of GATT's signatories will  take measures to enable China to re-enter GATT at an early date  and to become a founder member of the WTO.</p>

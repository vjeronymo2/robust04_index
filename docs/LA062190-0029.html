			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: MUMM ON NAME CHANGE  </P> <P> Domaine Mumm, the Napa Valley winery that is a joint venture between Seagram  and G.H. Mumm of France, has quietly changed its name to Mumm Napa Valley.  </P> <P> A spokesman said the change was made because of the multitude of wineries in  the Napa Valley that begin with the word domaine and "the fact that so few  people realize that the word domaine simply means a house.  </P> <P> We are not related to any of the other domaines around here."  </P> <P> Penfolds Wines Pty. Ltd. of Australia has acquired another Australian wine  company, the prestigious Lindemans Ltd. The sale price was not announced.  </P> <P> "This opens up a whole new vista for Lindemans," said Hugh Matthews, U.S.  general manager for the company. "Penfolds is a specialist red wine maker, and  this can only help Lindemans make greater reds than they already have made."  </P> <P> Matthews said nearly 100,000 cases of Lindemans wines are marketed in the  United States, including an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon, designated St.  George, and a wine called Limestone Ridge, a Shiraz/Cabernet blend. Both sell  for about $22 a bottle and have received good reviews.  </P></p>

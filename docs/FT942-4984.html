			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / BPC pulls float after pricing doubts The London stock market retreat claimed another corporate victim yesterday when the planned flotation of British Printing Company, the UK's largest commercial printer, was postponed. BPC's board said it had 'decided to delay its approach to the market until a time when the market environment is considered to be more predictable'. It was now unlikely to seek a listing before the end of the year. The postponement is the latest sign of trouble in the new issue market. One merchant banker said that there could be other highly leveraged companies, mostly buy-outs, which must now be looking at refinancing debt rather than relying on a flotation to repay lenders. However, there was no sign yesterday of other significant forthcoming issues being pulled. New issue experts believe there is still good demand for shares in well managed companies of a significant size, if they are correctly priced. Advisers to Eurodollar, Pillar Properties, Chesterton International, 3i and Exco, for instance, said they had no plans to delay issues due before the summer break. However, they were watching the market carefully and still had time to postpone if necessary. BPC announced its plans for a summer stock market debut - expected to value the group at around Pounds 250m - early last month. The funds raised would have been used to repay debt associated with the management buy-out of the business from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire in January 1989, thereby eliminating about Pounds 25m a year in interest costs. The group's high level of debt meant that a relatively small reduction in the prospective issue price had a disproportionately large effect on the value of the equity. It is thought that Mezzanine Management, which led a second refinancing in mid 1992, had particularly objected to cutting the issue price. BPC's decision follows the delay of flotations for three cable companies and of the issue for London Capital Holdings, which was to have valued the property investment group at Pounds 150m. Other recent issues have been scaled down as vendors were dissatisfied with prices available, such as Amey Holdings, the construction materials group, and UPF Group, a vehicle chassis maker, late last week. New issue specialists put the recent delays down more to disappointments on pricing following the recent fall in the stock market than to the indigestion which the market had already been suffering because of a surfeit of new issues, especially of smaller companies. One merchant banker said of BPC, 'they could have got it away but the price would have been soggy compared with original indications'. Mr John Holloran, BPC's chief executive, said he was determined that BPC should come to market 'with its chest puffed out' rather than 'limp on to the stage'. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Other ways to connect N American economies Sir, Your editorial on the results of the state and local elections in the US ('Democrats in retreat', November 4) included the assertion that 'there is no doubt that the US economy would benefit from Nafta'. There are many members of Congress, as well as citizens in Canada, Mexico and the US who would disagree with you and would favour a different sort of economic integration. Nafta, they have discovered, is not simply a 'free trade' agreement integrating the economies of North America. It is also a programme to entrench the conservative practices of the Reagan-Bush era. By tying restrictions on government regulations and services to an international trade deal, Nafta makes the implementation of new public services and environmental protection much more difficult. If Congress does pass Nafta, environmental regulations, health and safety standards, educational policy and labour law will all be affected. Social policy will be taken outside of the democratic process, restricted by an international agreement and regulated by unelected trade bureaucrats. Under Nafta, any US laws that restrict the sales of goods because of the way they are produced - either by environmentally-destructive processes or unfair labour practices - would be subject to challenge by Mexican or Canadian companies. Even more important, social gains in one country would often be difficult to maintain. Why should a company comply with costly labour or environmental laws in the US when it could avoid them by moving to Mexico? There are alternative ways to connect our economies. A new Nafta could, for example, include a social charter that would protect environmental and labour laws and provide funds for raising incomes in poorer regions. We could enjoy the advantages of international trade without enshrining the 'free market' as an unlimited mechanism for organising economic life. Greenpeace does not oppose international economic integration, but on social and economic grounds we oppose the sort of integration that this agreement would provide.

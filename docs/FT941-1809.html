			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Guerrilla rockets land in Israel Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel yesterday, one day after Israeli shelling killed two schoolchildren and a man, Reuter reports from Tyre. Security officials said 'three or four' Katyusha rockets were fired from near Qlayleh village in the south. At least two rockets hit western Galilee, the others fell in the border area. The rockets caused no casualties. No group claimed responsibility, but security officials said the attack seemed to be in reprisal for the Israeli shelling.</p>

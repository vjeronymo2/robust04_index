			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Beer town left flat after Pirelli move northwards: The reasons for the tyre maker's decision to transfer operations from Burton on Trent Much of the fizz has gone out of the economy of Burton on Trent. But it has nothing to do with the beer for which the Staffordshire town is renowned. In spite of the breweries which dot Burton's skyline, Pirelli, the Italian tyremaker, was for decades the town's biggest employer - until last year, when 700 jobs went almost at a stroke with the end of car tyre-making. Now truck tyre-making has gone, with another 300 jobs. Mr Carlo Mazzantini, the UK chairman and managing director, heads an administrative staff at Pirelli's UK headquarters, still on the town's Derby Road. SMC and Central Tyres, Pirelli's fast-fit and tyre retailing chains, have moved in with their warehousing operations. But research and development has been moved out and soon some vestigial production operations such as compounding and fabrication will also go, leaving fewer than 300 people working for the group. Burton's car-tyre production has been transferred to a more modern plant at Carlisle, 150 miles to the north-west. Its location, far from any car plants, is the legacy of past regional aid policies. Pirelli has committed itself to investing Pounds 20m in upgrading and expanding its Carlisle facilities to double its production from 10,000 tyres a day before the transfer. The Carlisle plant, which employs 875 people, is also being given a new design and development role in a Europe-wide restructuring of Pirelli's tyre production capacity. The restructuring has started to return the Italian group to profit, after a string of heavy losses. Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, group chief executive, in London for this month's Pirelli calendar launch, made clear that the restructuring envisaged a stand-alone future for Pirelli after its costly and abortive attempt to take over its rival tyremaker, Continental of Germany. The UK upheavals are part of a European consolidation in which more than 20 plants have closed and resources have been moved to some of the remaining 80. Nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost worldwide, leaving fewer than 40,000. Mr Mazzantini said: 'In January 1993 we were producing 5,000 car tyres a day at Burton with a production workforce of 700, and 10,000 at Carlisle with nearly 1,000. Now, with 800 fewer people, Carlisle is already producing 13,000 to 14,000 tyres a day. And that is with a higher level of quality and without major investments.' A mid-term target is 15,000 a day with half the total UK production workforce of January 1993, rising to 20,000 as the full benefits of investment in new plant and equipment are realised. Truck tyre production has almost certainly left the UK for good, however, prompted partly by the worst slump in continental Europe's commercial vehicle markets since the second world war. Mr Mazzantini said: 'Europe's truck market collapse could not be overcome. No one was to blame. We need strategic production units and at 7,000 to 8,000 truck tyres a day Burton was too small.' The Carlisle facility is being pushed into the unfamiliar role of developing premium tyres for some of Europe's more up-market carmakers. One early result is a sole-supplier contract with Jaguar for its new XJ saloon range. Purpose-designed tyres are also on the stocks for Saab and Volvo, Rover Group and Toyota's and Honda's UK 'transplant' car factories - for which the Carlisle plant will also be the supply source. Mr Mazzantini said: 'Everyone wants tailor-made products now.' That means flexibility in tyre development and manufacturing processes to a degree that the tyre industry could not have contemplated a few years ago - batches of fewer than 400 of a type are now regarded as viable. Much of the planned investment centres on more flexible, high-quality processes. Carlisle will concentrate on premium sector tyres, where prospects for profits are brightest. Such profits do not, however, come from original equipment supplies to vehicle makers. Margins here are almost non-existent. The attraction is in replacement sales. Mr Mazzantini said: 'When it comes to high-performance and prestige cars like Jaguars the pull-through is very strong. If the car has been fitted originally with Pirellis it is certain that the driver will replace them with the same tyres.' It was not surprising, he added, that this was the market sector in which Pirelli mainly wanted to be. The UK tyre market has 107 brands jostling for sales, of which 99 are in the 'commodity' sector - sold almost entirely on price rather than performance. Korean and east European tyremakers have been targeting this sector. 'Countries like Poland and the Czechs are looking mainly for hard currency, so they don't care what price they sell at,' Mr Mazzantini said.</p>

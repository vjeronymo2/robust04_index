			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Technology: Raising a glass to computerised gin - London's first new white spirit distillery for 84 years opens today When it comes to judging the quality of neutral white spirit - used in making premium gin and vodka - no technology can yet entirely replace a sensitive nostril. So London's first new white spirit distillery for 84 years, which comes into production today , will have its output monitored by four men with highly-tuned noses as well as by such analytical aids as gas chromatography. 'We have tried to produce a scientific 'fingerprint' of the perfect distillation but without success,' says John Reagan, distillery manager. 'The nose, and particularly the customer's nose, is still the final arbiter of quality. It can sometimes pick up things which more scientific analysis does not detect.' The Pounds 10m joint venture at Greenwich between Invergordon Distillers, the Scotch whisky company, and Tunnel Refineries, a member of the Tate &amp; Lyle group, will be capable of producing 10m litres of grain spirit a year. Invergordon has been producing white spirit at its distillery on the Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, since 1979. Sales last year amounted to about 5 per cent of the company's Pounds 92.4m turnover. 'The location of the Greenwich distillery, close to the major markets in London and south-east England, and in continental Europe, should see us well placed to expand sales,' says Chris Greig, Invergordon's managing director. Britain's gin and vodka makers use about 58m litres of potable spirit a year. Total European Community demand amounts to more than 400m litres. The Greenwich venture marries the skills of the two companies. Tunnel's expertise is in grain processing. It produces glucose syrups and starches for the food, soft drinks and brewing industries. Invergordon has more than 30 years' experience in distilling. It is the fifth largest Scotch whisky producer, supplying several multiple retailers in the UK and continental Europe with own-label brands. Though the basic distillation process has not changed for centuries, the Greenwich distillery incorporates the most up-to-date technology to ensure low-cost quality production. The distillery employs only 13 men. Two technicians per shift control the round-the-clock operation with the help of a Texas Programmable Login Control system. The computerised system allows continuous monitoring and on-line control of the process and operating costs. Liquid wheat starch is supplied from Tunnel's adjacent processing plant. It is cooked and converted into a syrup before transfer to six 180-tonne fermenters, each with an automatic cleaning-in-place system to maintain sterility. A traditional yeast is added to the fermenters to convert the syrup into alcohol. The wash produced at the end of his process is fed into a six-column distillation plant into which Invergordon's own engineers have designed a number of heat recovery techniques to reduce energy consumption. Separate columns remove fusel oils, methyl alcohol and other impurities to produce a high-grade neutral spirit.</p>

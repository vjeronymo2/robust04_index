Having discussed the organization's  election platform, participants in the congress came to the  conclusion that regional organizations should independently  determine the strategy of their electoral campaign, in light of  local conditions and following guidelines drafted by the forum.    The Civil Congress is a leftist-centrist organization ready  to cooperate with political forces fighting against nationalist  extremism and advocating Ukraine's equal membership in an  economic union with other former republics of the USSR. The  delegates adopted a political declaration urging the formation  of a close economic, diplomatic, military, and humanitarian  union on the basis of the CIS; a resolution on the religious  situation in Ukraine, and a statement regarding celebrations of  the 340th anniversary of Ukraine's unification with Russia on 8  January 1994.</p>

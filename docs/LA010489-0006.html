			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A New Jersey teen-ager was in critical condition after eating cyanide-laced  Breyer's yogurt, and the Acme Supermarkets chain that sold the tainted  container pulled the company's yogurt from 166 stores in three states,  officials said. Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield in Camden County, became ill  after eating the yogurt and was taken to West Jersey Hospital Eastern Division  in Voorhees, officials said. The yogurt, Breyer's brand black cherry, bearing  the code FEB 9, 1989, was tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,  which confirmed the presence of cyanide. Law enforcement agencies are  investigating the incident as a case of a suspected tampering, officials said.  No cyanide was found in the 131 yogurt containers removed from Acme stores in  Camden County, officials said.  </P></p>

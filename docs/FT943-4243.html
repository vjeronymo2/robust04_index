			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox flat at FFr510m in first half CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group, yesterday reported flat post-tax profits of FFr510m (Dollars 96m) for the first half of this year, up FFr1m on the same period last year. However, Mr Jurgen Hintz, president, said: 'We should be able to produce some bottom-line progress for 1994 as a whole.' Turnover rose 4 per cent to FFr12.3bn and operating profits by 7 per cent to FFr1.04bn as a result of cost containment, job cuts and improved manufacturing performances. Net profits barely shifted from the FFr509m in the first half of 1993, largely because a large part of a capital gain made from the sale of a Singapore factory site went to minority shareholders, leaving the group with smaller exceptional financial gains of FFr96m against FFr121m. CMB's metal packaging business, in its Eurosteel division which accounted for 54 per cent of total turnover, increased 1 per cent in the first half because of weak demand from the food sector. Turnover in health and beauty containers fell 3 per cent and in plastics by 5 per cent, but rose 22 per cent in drink containers because of the good summer in Europe, where the group did 79 per cent of its total business. 'Whatever you may have heard about recovery in Europe from other sectors, it clearly did not feed through into consumer products in the first half of this year,' Mr Hintz said. For CMB, there already was a two-speed Europe, with demand in the UK, Italy and Spain - accounting for nearly 40 per cent of turnover - rising by up to 10 per cent. But Germany and the Benelux region only increased 1 per cent with France falling 7 per cent, he said. Mr Hintz predicted internal productivity increases and innovations would more than offset raw material price rises and price pressure from customers, and would produce a profit increase by end-1994. He said the group would continue to expand in Europe and Asia, and in the US perfumes and pharmaceuticals sectors through the new joint venture with Wheaton. We will be the first to offer customers such as L'Oreal a global presence', Mr Hintz claimed.</p>

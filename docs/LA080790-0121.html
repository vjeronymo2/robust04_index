			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FINANCING THE 'NEXT PICTURE SHOW';  </P> <P> WHEN MAJOR STUDIOS BALKED, TINY CINE-SOURCE PUT ITSELF ON THE LINE  </P> <P> In the acclaimed 1971 film "The Last Picture Show," director Peter Bogdanovich  created a bleak portrait of a small Texas town in the 1950s. Now, 19 years  later, Bogdanovich, whose up-and-down career has careened downward in recent  years, is attempting a comeback with the sequel to "Picture Show" called  "Texasville," which is due out next month.  </P> <P> None of the major studios would touch Bogdanovich's latest project -- possibly  because the film might not appeal to mass audiences or because of Bogdanovich's  reputation for disputing studio dictates -- even though he lined up original  "Picture Show" cast members Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid.  </P> <P> So the director turned to an obscure, 2-year-old Universal City company,  Cine-Source Inc., to arrange the financing for "Texasville." Tiny Cine-Source  is hoping that "Texasville" -- based on a novel by Larry McMurtry, also the  author of "The Last Picture Show" -- will put it on the Hollywood map.  </P> <P> "How it will do critically and how it will do at the box office, no one can  guess," said Cine-Source President Robert Whitmore. "But it's a great motion  picture and we have every reason to believe it's going to be an enormous  success."  </P> <P> Bogdanovich said a few other companies, including Carolco Pictures, had  expressed interest in "Texasville." But, he said, "There certainly was some  reluctance in this town about this project. I don't know that it was  specifically me, but it was a difficult project."  </P> <P> Though Bogdanovich's career seems to be on the upswing again -- he now has a  Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder movie in development at Tri-Star -- he said he'd work  with Cine-Source again. "They put themselves on the line," he said.  </P> <P> As did a lot of other people. Cine-Source spread the film's risk among a  variety of investors including foreign investors, and through the sale of cable  and home video rights. By lining up financing for the film's $24 million in  production, promotion and advertising costs from these parties, Cine-Source  limits its risk and avoids having to give away a bigger chunk of the picture's  gross revenue to obtain the backing of a major studio, Whitmore said.  </P> <P> Cine-Source will reap 25.5% of the gross of "Texasville" after distribution  fees and certain other costs are deducted, Whitmore said.  </P> <P> But even though it's limiting its risk, Cine-Source is still taking a chance  with Bogdanovich's latest film.  </P> <P> After "Picture Show," Bogdanovich was glowingly compared to Orson Welles, and  he scored subsequent successes with "Paper Moon" and "What's Up, Doc?" But he  also had some celebrated flops such as "At Long Last Love" and "Daisy Miller."  </P> <P> Bogdanovich became known for pushing the careers of his girlfriends, such as  Shepherd, at the expense of his films. The director sealed his reputation as a  troublemaker after a bitter dispute with Universal Pictures over the music in  his last film, "Mask," in 1985.  </P> <P> Bogdanovich's personal life has also had an arguably negative impact on his  career. After the 1980 murder of his then-girlfriend, Playboy playmate Dorothy  Stratten, Bogdanovich publicly clashed with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Last  year, the director's marriage to Stratten's 20-year-old sister raised eyebrows  even in freewheeling Hollywood.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Whitmore steadfastly defended Bogdanovich: "It's not easy for a  director to always be a rational man in the throes of the creative process."  But, he said, there were no problems on the set of "Texasville," and the film  came in on time and on budget.  </P> <P> Whitmore and his long-time partner, Cine-Source Chairman Henry Weinstein, were  first approached with "Texasville" in February, 1989, by agent Martin Baum at  Creative Artists Agency. Nelson Entertainment entered as the other production  entity and, through an existing distribution agreement, arranged to have the  film distributed through Columbia Pictures.  </P> <P> A victory at the box office would not only make money for Cine-Source and its  investors, it would also give the company the cachet it needs to continue  making films. "If you've got a track record, then the big boys will compete for  you and they'll distribute your product," said Peter Appert, director of  research at the New York investment firm C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.  </P> <P> But, Appert warned, "The odds are really stacked against the independent  producer."  </P> <P> That's partly because many independents don't have the financial wherewithal to  wait out the time it takes to start recouping money from the movie's being  shown in foreign markets, and on cable and home video. "The cash return on a  theatrical film can often require the funding sources to wait two to four years  to see their cash back," said Jeffrey Logsdon, senior vice president of the Los  Angeles investment firm Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.  </P> <P> Several independent production companies, including De Laurentiis Entertainment  Group, Cannon Films and Vestron, have collapsed in the past few years after  producing movies with studio-sized budgets and disappointing box-office  receipts.  </P> <P> But some investors are betting that Cine-Source will beat the odds. The  company's stock trades on the over-the-counter market at about 38 cents a  share, giving the company a market value of about $2.24 million. Not bad for a  company that took in just $96,000 in revenue -- from producer's fees -- and  lost $304,077 from its start-up date in July, 1988, to Jan. 31 of this year.  </P> <P> Cine-Source also recently raised $1.5 million -- netting about $1.25 million  after expenses -- from a public offering of 200,000 units. Each unit consists  of two shares of preferred stock, which are convertible into six shares of  common stock, and two warrants to buy additional stock.  </P> <P> Jay Lutsky, a Denver investor who was one of the first investors in  Cine-Source, called the company "a little diamond in the rough."  </P> <P> Lutsky was particularly impressed with Weinstein's background. Weinstein once  headed production at Cannon Pictures, worked on films at MGM and 20th Century  Fox, and -- with Whitmore -- executive-produced the critically praised 1985  film "Runaway Train."  </P> <P> Whitmore insists that Cine-Source will avoid the fate of unsuccessful  independents by staying small and lean. The company has just seven employees  and plans to do no more than three films a year.  </P> <P> "We have no illusions of grandeur," said Whitmore. "We're not trying to be a  major studio. We don't have our own art department. We don't have our own  production coordinators. We don't have an in-house promotion guy." The typical  Cine-Source film will have a production budget of about $10 million, he said.  </P> <P> Gary Matus, senior vice president in charge of Bank of America's entertainment  and media group, said this type of strategy represents a new era among  independent production companies -- in which the survivors are avoiding the  excesses of the past. "Those that remain appear to be very conservatively run  companies," he said.  </P> <P> Cine-Source is also working on four other films: "Black Orpheus," a remake of  the 1959 Oscar winner for best foreign film that will begin shooting in Brazil  in February; "Five-O," a Brooklyn-based drama starring rap musician Kool Moe  Dee; "Three Part Harmony," with Irene Cara; and "Louise," based on the life of  Wells Fargo heiress Louise Hellman.  </P> <P> Cine-Source also recently set up a subsidiary designed to exploit the musical  soundtracks of its films -- a potential source of profits and a means to  promote its films, Whitmore said.  </P> <P> At first glance, the boyish, 42-year-old Whitmore, an attorney who once ran his  own music management firm, and the rotund Weinstein, 66, seem an unlikely pair.  But they say the partnership strikes a balance between Whitmore's business  acumen and Weinstein's production skills.  </P> <P> The pair met in New York in the late-1970s and later formed a production  company, Skyfield Productions, that worked mostly on TV movies. After "Runaway  Train," which received three Academy Award nominations, Weinstein went to  Cannon. But he and Whitmore soon talked about teaming up again. In 1988, they  formed Cine-Source, which then merged with Starwood Ventures, a publicly traded  shell company, in a stock swap.  </P> <P> Whether or not "Texasville" is a hit at the box office, Whitmore says  Cine-Source will keep making movies. "There's always a market for an  intelligently done motion picture," he said.  </P> <P> But he added that "Texasville" will show that his and Weinstein's instincts  were correct and that "we were right to work with Peter."  </P></p>

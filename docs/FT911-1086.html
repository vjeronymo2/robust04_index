			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Beckett pledges no increase in two taxes - Finance Bill AN INCOMING Labour Government would not increase corporation tax or capital gains tax, the Commons was told last night. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, denied any intention to increase corporation tax,and Mr Nicholas Brown, another Labour front bench spokesman, said there were no plans to increase the capital gains tax. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, clashed repeatedly with Mrs Beckett and her colleagues when he argued that Labour's public expenditure commitments would inevitably involve higher taxation. The exchanges dominated the start of the committee stage of the Finance Bill, which gives legal effect to the March Budget. Mr Mellor emphasised that in the run-up to the general election, ministers would make known the results of a detailed analysis of the likely cost of Labour's programme. He argued that the closing off of areas like corporation tax provided pointers to where increases would be imposed. With support from the government benches, Mr Mellor contended that the number of taxes which Labour was undertaking not to increase suggested that 'the poor old chap on the standard rate of income tax' would bear the main brunt of the extra burden arising from its proposals for increasing public expenditure. Mr Brown held to his statement that there were no plans to increase the capital gains tax when it was pointed out from the government side that keeping the existing 40 per cent rate meant that it would not be aligned with the 50 per cent rate of income tax Labour intended to impose on the 'top slice' of earnings. Mr Mellor forecast that the coming to power of a Labour government and the introduction of measures such as the abolition of the present Pounds 20,280 ceiling on national insurance contributions would result in the return of the 'brain drain' as professional and skilled workers decided to leave Britain. Mr Chris Smith, another Labour front bench spokesman, highlighted the fact that that when Labour left office in 1979, only 34 per cent of the gross national product was taken in taxation by the Treasury compared with the current 37 1/2 per cent. A Labour amendment designed to 'target' proposed reductions in corporation tax on the manufacturing sector instead of applying them to all sections of business and commerce was defeated by a government majority of 95 (264-169). The committee stage will be resumed later today.</p>

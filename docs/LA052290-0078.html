			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 20TH-CENTURY SOVIET PROGRAM IN AYS SEASON FINALE  </P> <P> If Mehli Mehta had ended the 25th anniversary season of his American Youth  Symphony on less than an invigorating, powerful and heartfelt note, he would  have surprised a few of the faithful.  </P> <P> Predictably, the 81-year-old conductor didn't do either Sunday at Royce Hall,  UCLA.  </P> <P> Nor was that likely with a program of 20th-Century Soviets -- big-boned music  of Prokofiev, Khachaturian and Shostakovich, the kind this orchestra trainer  regularly gives his young charges with great success.  </P> <P> What's more, he had the estimable solo talents of Armen Guzelimian for the  piano concerto of the late Aram Khachaturian.  </P> <P> And in an agenda that invited thoughts about the strife of people and nations  responsible for great art, it was hard not to think of the Armenians' present  struggle while hearing Guzelimian's soul-wrenching performance.  </P> <P> Beyond his technical command of this full-fisted score, with fleetness and  clarity principal virtues, the pianist was able to curtail bombast in favor of  refinement -- without diminishing the full effect.  </P> <P> He mined the Eastern motifs for all their distantly sad ruminations and found a  percussive urgency free of clangor, a forward compulsion infected with  emotional heat.  </P> <P> Mehta and the orchestra were one with him. Earlier, they brought a skittering  buoyancy to Prokofiev's "Classical" Symphony. And after intermission they  turned to Shostakovich's mighty Fifth Symphony, detailing the epic sorrow and  bitterness into which we now read the horrors of the Stalinist purges.  </P> <P> Everything -- from an insinuating waltz to the pathos of the Largo to the  furious, galvanizing energy of the finale -- was there. Mehta doesn't send his  players or audiences home half-fed. DONNA PERLMUTTER  </P></p>

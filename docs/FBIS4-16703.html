			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's joint stock company Gazprom cut gas supply  to Moldova by one third because of that republic's debt totaling  131 billion rubles by April 1, 1994. This was reported to  Interfax by a well-placed Gazprom source. The company's current  gas supply to Moldova amounts to 5.7 million cubic meters a day.    This year Moldova has not paid a single ruble to Gazprom,  compensating for Russian gas partly in food supplies.    A Russo-Moldovan agreement signed at the end of 1993 commits  Moldova to supplying to Gazprom $145 million worth in food  stuffs and consumer goods in partial payment for the delivery of  up to 3.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas.    Moldova now pays $80 for 1000 cubic meters of gas. To  transport Russian gas across Moldova into Romania costs $1.5 per  1000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers of pipeline.    Meanwhile, the talks between a Belarusian Government  delegation and Gazprom officials, scheduled for mid-April, have  been put off indefinitely because of the signing of a monetary  integration accord. During the negotiations the sides were to  look over the fulfillment of a Russo-Belarusian protocol on  paying off the debt for Russian gas. This accord was signed on  March 15, 1994.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Signet frees itself of Salisburys in Pounds 3m deal Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, is selling its lossmaking Salisburys luggage and handbag chain for Pounds 3.18m to Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, former chairman of James Wilkes and Lynx Holdings. Signet is receiving Pounds 2.75m immediately in cash and Pounds 430,000 later relating to inter-company debt. The jewellery group made a Pounds 87.1m provision in its full-year results in May to cover the proposed disposal of the 174-store chain, including a Pounds 10.8m write-down of the value of its assets to Pounds 3m. Mr James McAdam, Signet chairman, said that despite efforts to turn it around, Salisburys had incurred a Pounds 5.3m loss on sales of Pounds 54.4m. Signet will keep an interest in a warehouse in Crawley, West Sussex, which will require a provision of up to Pounds 1.5m to cover carrying and disposal costs. Mr Hinchliffe is funding the purchase himself and has formed a new company, Salisburys Stores, to run the outlets. 'We can return to profits a lot faster than people imagine,' he said. 'There is nothing wrong with the fabric of the business'. Mr Hinchliffe has successfully restored a retailing business to profitability before. In 1987 he joined a management buy-out at Wades department stores from Associated Dairies, and later sold the company to Waring &amp; Gillow.</p>

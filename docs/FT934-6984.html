			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / The Markets: World's eyes on US interest rates - Global Investor Thanksgiving week in the US promises to add fresh uncertainty to the question preoccupying the world's financial markets: what is the outlook for US long-term interest rates? The New York markets will start winding down from Wednesday lunchtime in preparation for Thursday's holiday; many people will stay at home on Friday, too. So the active trading week will only be two days - yet into it, the government plans to cram two bond auctions, for two-year notes and five-year notes. That means that anyone buying these issues may well be stuck with them until next week - potentially a worry in a market that demonstrated its volatility yet again on Friday. Despite this, the auctions will probably go well; they usually do. The broader issue remains. Has the US bond market moved - as Mr Robert Brusca, of Nikko Securities in New York puts it - from a bear phase of a bull market into a true bear market? That matters to investors regardless of where they live. A sustained move upwards in long-term US rates would indicate that bond investors fear the return of inflation, suggesting that in the not-too-distant future the Federal Reserve would get the message, too. The realisation that both short and long-term interest rates were decisively headed upwards in the US would dawn, unpleasantly, around the world. In the US equity markets, shares would be damaged by appearing less attractive than bonds or cash. Overseas, equity and fixed-income markets would lose the psychological prop of a worldwide outlook of falling interest rates and low inflation. Though the economic climate would still indicate lower interest rates to come in Europe, investors would glance nervously at the US. Flows of US retail investors' cash - out of deposit accounts and money funds, into equities at home and abroad - would dry up, as Americans rediscovered the joys of interest. An end to the flows, perhaps their reversal, would be bad news for shares worldwide. Much hangs, therefore, on the outlook for the US bond market. After Friday's further slide in the market, the next few days could be tense. In Thanksgiving week, no-one wants to be the turkey. Those expressing their gratitude on Thursday will include the heads of big American companies, for whom the fourth quarter is looking happy. One of the biggest and best diversified US corporations recently held a meeting for its divisional bosses. Without exception, said someone present, they reeled off tales of double-digit revenue growth in September. Fourth-quarter results will reflect this underlying business strength. A shaky bond market may hurt the valuation of the stock market; but it will do little in the short run to damage the improvement in earnings. Rapid, self-sustaining growth in Asia/Pacific's industrialising economies is one of the investing community's new articles of faith. The television pictures of President Clinton at the Apec economic summit merely confirm the worldwide enthusiasm for equities anywhere in Asia - except Japan. There's no doubt that this region will be the manufacturing heartland of the world in the coming century. There's also no doubt that the addition of a billion people to the global market economy will have profoundly beneficial results. Don't expect the process to be a smooth one, though. In some respects, the global economy in the early 21st century will look a lot like it did in the late 19th century: bumpy. A large, rapidly growing, aggressively export-oriented region will make the world grow faster, true - but it will also provide a lot more shocks. Look at the description last week, from Courtaulds, the UK chemicals company, of how the Chinese credit squeeze had hit revenues. 'Production of acrylics and acetate tow that were previously going to China have been diverted to Europe,' said Mr Sipko Huismans, Courtaulds' chief executive. Prices in Europe had suffered; and the viscose market in the US would soon be hurt, too. China's trend growth will be rapid, but it is unlikely to be stable. Periods of slower growth will leave markets awash with unsold product destined for China; and above-trend growth will push up worldwide prices, once the global economy recovers. The growing Asian economies are still a relatively small part of world gnp. But their rapid growth and vast populations will make them the world's marginal consumer. And in economics, it's at the margins that things happen. The flood of money into the developing markets of the Asia/Pacific regions is only partly driven by economics, of course. It's also driven by one of the great self-reinforcing phenomena of current investing: the concept of a 'normal' weighting. Global investors look at the world through the prism of one of the worldwide equity indices, such as the FT-Actuaries World Index. If a market starts to rise rapidly against the rest of the world, its weighting in such indices will rise, because they are weighted by market capitalisation. Global investors will discover themselves to be suddenly underweight in that market. It wouldn't look good at year-end to be underweight in a market that is performing strongly; perhaps it is time to move back into line? Thus, a rally once begun is self-reinforcing, until some event occurs to reverse its course. The smaller the market, the thinner its trading and the further away it is, the more powerful this cycle. Western fund managers look down on those who still place their faith in a stock's 'momentum'. Retail investors and the nave markets of the Asia/Pacific rim might use this technique, they say, but no-one with the merest smattering of modern portfolio theory takes it seriously. Yet they have institutionalised such a concept in the name of prudence. Most recently it has led them, with splendid irony, to pour money into the pockets of Pacific rim investors. Did somebody say nave? The new weekly table alongside caters to the increasing interest in the 'total return' of asset classes round the world. Total return captures both the capital appreciation of a security and its income stream (dividends or interest). It thus allows you to compare the return in holding your money in the money market, with that available in bonds of different maturities or equities. The table shows the total return in local currency terms on four asset classes in five countries over the past week, the past month and the year to date. The growing interest in total returns is partly a result of the worldwide trend towards convergence of tax rates on income and capital gains. Investors are increasingly indifferent as to whether they get their profit from a stock's appreciation or its income stream, and want a measure which captures both. Total returns are also in fashion because cheap computing power has made them easier to calculate. Not that easy, though: a great deal of expertise is required, for which we are grateful to Mr Chris Golden of Lehman Brothers in London, for the cash and bond figures, and Mr Symon Bradford of NatWest Markets in Edinburgh, for the data on equities. Two events in Belgium next week - a series of demonstrations against government austerity planned by labour unions and the meeting of the European Commission to review its draft white paper on employment and competitiveness - underline a worldwide trend pointed out recently by Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley. People are tiring of corporate restructuring and retrenchment, as witness the Canadian election, the Air France protests, recent labour unrest in Italy and Germany, and the anti-Nafta campaign in the US. One way in which this unhappiness could manifest itself is a general swing back towards protectionism, subsidies, and government interference, potentially damaging for corporate earnings. The phrasing of the white paper will be one indicator of the way the debate is going; so will progress in the Gatt talks. The way politicians discuss this issue will indicate how seriously they take the new public mood.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  TOTAL RETURNS IN LOCAL CURRENCY TERMS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      US    Japan    Germany   France    Italy      UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week             0.07     0.05     0.12      0.13     0.17     0.11   Month            0.27     0.21     0.56      0.59     0.74     0.50   Year             4.06     3.56     7.94      8.75    13.19     6.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week             0.24    -0.28     0.48      0.54     0.10     0.68   Month           -0.83     1.36     1.23      0.89    -0.12     1.11   Year             8.82     9.34    14.21     15.95    30.43    16.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week             0.59    -0.04     0.75      0.73     0.59     1.00   Month           -1.80     1.89     0.79      0.08    -1.39     0.93   Year            13.42    12.18    16.88     22.89    40.76    21.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week              0.2      1.3      2.8       2.7      0.2      0.9   Month            -1.0     -4.4      2.9       1.1     -8.8     -0.1   Year             12.2     24.1     37.2      30.0     27.2     12.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            TEN BEST STOCKS FROM FT-ACTUARIES WORLD INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        % change                                Week       Month       Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Wilson Neil (NZ)               20.0       -7.7       140.0 Iscor (SAF)                    19.5       46.2       175.4 First Natl.

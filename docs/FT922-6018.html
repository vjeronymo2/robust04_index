			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Kelsey holds 8p in face of interim loss Kelsey Industries incurred a loss of Pounds 119,000 in the six months to March 31 but expects to be profitable in the second half. However, it is certain the year will not match the Pounds 1.44m pre-tax made in 1990-91, warned Mr Brian Arbib, chairman. The interim dividend is held at 8p - the halfway profit was Pounds 1.11m last time - but the rate of the final (18p) will be decided at the appropriate time. The group, a maker of roofing materials, audio and video accessories, and solder, saw signs that the business climate, both in the UK and North America, was changing slightly for the better.</p>

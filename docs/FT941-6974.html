			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - High-Income PEPs (9): Can complexity defeat risk? - Some of the plans that have been devised to provide income as high as 10 per cent, at a time when base rates are much lower, have been viewed with caution.  Scheherazade Daneshkhu examines them 'The desire of many investors for a high income has prompted financial services groups to launch products to satisfy that need. There are plenty of 'high income' Peps offering around 5 per cent income, but few that can go as high as 10 per cent. It does not come as a complete surprise, then, that one of the most successful Peps to be launched should be Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan, which has managed to raise almost Pounds 500m since February 1993 on the promise of a 10 per cent income after charges, paid monthly. With base rates at only 6 per cent at the time of launch and promising to fall further, investors have been happy to pour money into the new Pep, even though the offer sounds too good to be true. A higher return usually means higher risk, but Hypo F&amp;C believes it has used a structure which, though complicated, explains how it can provide the higher yield. Around half the portfolio is invested in blue-chip shares, which provide a modest income; but the extra income, which pushes the return on the Pep above most alternative plans, comes from options. An option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a given price over a given period. In return, the buyer pays a premium to the option seller. A 'call' option gives the purchaser the right to buy a commodity, and a 'put' option gives the right to sell. The Hypo F&amp;C unit trust writes both call and put options against the shares it owns. The premiums it earns by writing the options boost the yield on the trust up to 10 per cent (after charges), which is tax-free for those who hold it in Pep form. The trust also buys a put option on the FT-SE 100 index, to give it protection against a sharp fall in the stock market. Morgan Grenfell followed Hypo F&amp;C's lead, and in October launched its High Income Trust which also pays 10 per cent a year, tax-free in a Pep with income paid quarterly. There is also a 7 per cent option. What are the risks? In December, Save &amp; Prosper, which had been working on a similar product, suddenly decided to withdraw it because it said that its models showed a significant risk of capital erosion. Both Hypo F&amp;C and Morgan Grenfell outlined the risks in a subsequent statement: 'These funds should not be confused with guaranteed funds; the two funds are actively managed according to market conditions. Neither the income, nor the level of capital, is guaranteed.' John Spiers, of BESt Pep, says: 'My main worry about these Peps is that they are fine in a rising market, but what about a falling market?' Since the funds give other investors the right to buy their shares, these options are unlikely to be exercised if the stock market goes down. There is the protection against a sharp fall in the market, but in a lengthy decline the funds' incomes from premiums will fall, leading to the risk that capital and income cannot be maintained. In a fast-rising market, the funds will underperform their rivals, since, by selling options on their shares, they are giving up capital gain. The funds are likely to do best in a slowly rising stock market. Charges on both these unit trusts are 5 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually, with no extra charge for the Pep. The minimum deposit is Pounds 2,500, but is lower for those choosing the 7 per cent option on the Morgan Grenfell plan, at Pounds 2,000. This year, there has been a new twist to the high-income tale with the revival of unit trust withdrawal plans in Pep form, allowing investors to make regular withdrawals to supplement their income. Newton's Distributor Fund is a recently launched unit trust, investing in equities and bonds. There is a Pep facility at no extra cost beyond the 6 per cent initial charge and 1.5 per cent annual fee which allows investors to select a regular 'distribution' of up to 9 per cent, paid quarterly. Newton says that it believes it can, over a three-year rolling period, replace the value, in real terms, of the capital which is distributed. Investors who are worried about capital erosion can opt for lower distributions at 3, 5 and 7 per cent. The minimum Pep investment is Pounds 3,000. James Capel's Generator Pep is attached to its UK Tracker fund, which attempts to match the performance of the FT-SE A All-Share index. It has capped the payout at 7.5 per cent, and investors can choose lower payout levels. Charges are an initial 5.25 per cent initial with an annual fee of 1 per cent, which is higher than the 0.5 per cent annual charge on a direct investment in the underlying fund. The minimum lump sum investment in both Peps is Pounds 3,000. The advantage of these funds is that the investor is theoretically in control, so that if the stock market falls, they can stop taking income in order to minimise capital erosion. However, in practice, many people may find they cannot afford to do this because they have become dependent on the income stream. John Spiers says: 'I'm not keen on distribution unit trusts, because the person wanting income needs to know that it is sustainable. Also Newton's annual charge of 1.5 per cent on a fund which is 30 per cent invested in bonds is ridiculously high.' Other high-yielding investments are the income shares of split-capital investment trusts. Exeter High Income unit trust invests in these shares, and is available in a Pep run by Guinness Flight under the name Investment Trust Selector Income Pep. The yield has fallen from about 11 per cent in early 1993 but is still high at about 8 per cent currently. However, you cannot also expect substantial capital growth. Exeter High Income is in the UK Equity income sector, and was ranked 53 out of 94 funds in the five years to February 1, and 101 out of 104 funds over three years (offer to bid, income reinvested, source: HSW). The percentage growth over those years is 62.4 per cent and 38.4 per cent respectively. The initial charge is 5.5 per cent, and the annual management fee is 1.5 per cent. The minimum lump-sum investment is Pounds 3,000 and payouts are quarterly. Other Peps with high yields include those investing in bonds or high yielding equities, such as Cazenove's utility and bond fund. See also: combined bond/equity Peps, on page 22 of this Guide</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Caribbean nations seek Nafta links The Caribbean Community (Caricom) and its two largest members have asked to be listed as eligible for membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement, while they continue seeking arrangements for special access which will protect their US and Canadian markets against competition from Mexico exports, writes Canute James in Kingston. Caribbean trade officials have said, however, that it is unlikely that the three Nafta signatories will show any early interest in Caricom's desire, and that of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, to be considered a part of the free trade area. More immediate attention will be on the larger markets in Latin America, the trade officials said. Trinidad and Tobago has already satisfied some conditions for Nafta entry, having already implemented wide economic reforms, said Mr Ken Valley, the country's trade and industry minister.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal also permits spread orders in the FCO market to consist of a different number of contracts provided the number of contracts differ by a permissible ratio. This will permit ratio orders to become eligible for spread priority pursuant to Rule 1033(d). The Commission recognizes the predominance of institutional investors and the prevalence of spread-type ratio orders in the FCO markets. Accordingly, the Commission believes the ability to utilize ratio orders will facilitate opportunities for risk hedging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Phlx has restated the above changes to the definitions and priority principles applicable to FCOs in OFPA F&hyph;16 for easy reference by floor persons. Therefore, the Commission does not believe these changes raise any new or unique regulatory issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, OFPA D&hyph;2 has been amended to provide for the inclusion of synthetic options. Because synthetic orders consist of two separate transactions which may be quoted at a net debit/credit, the Commission notes there will be instances where floor members will be unable to fill both components of the order at the net price. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is proper to include synthetic orders within OFPA D&hyph;2 so as not to subject floor members to liability for failure to fill an order at a specified price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1 permits synthetic orders to be quoted at a net debit/credit, and also removes synthetic options from the definition of hedge order. The ability to quote in net prices will permit market participants to price these orders more precisely, which should result in greater efficiency and improved liquidity in their execution, and better prices for investors. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the exclusion of synthetic orders from the definition of hedge order will have the effect of not extending the spread priority rules to synthetic orders. The Commission believes this will prevent the excessive loss of priority to public customers on the limit order book. Additionally, the Amendment requires the stock portion of synthetic options and conversions and reversals to be executed prior to the execution of the option portion of the transaction. The Commission believes this change is consistent with previous instances where the Commission has required related transactions to be effected prior to the execution of the options order, in order to prevent stock prices from being influenced by the options leg of the transaction. The definitions of hedge order in Rule 1066(f) and multi-spread transaction in Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 in Amendment No. 2 have also been amended to include the requirement that all legs of the transaction(s) be for the same account. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes these changes will prevent the unbundling of orders for the purpose of taking advantage of the benefits of the spread priority rules. Amendment No. 2 also creates a new paragraph (d) in OFPA F&hyph;14 for synthetic option orders. This change simply restates for the benefit of floor personnel the procedures involved in executing synthetic orders and, therefore, raises no new or unique regulatory issues. Finally, in Amendment No. 2, the Phlx inserted the clause ``in accordance with Rule 1014'' to paragraph (e) of Rule 1033. The Commission notes that this change clarifies that synthetic orders are not eligible for special priority rules and that they must instead be executed in accordance to the Phlx's normal order priority principles, which are referenced in Rule 1014 (g) and (h). Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1 clarifies the definition of hedge order while Amendment No. 2 relates to multi-spread transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

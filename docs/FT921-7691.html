			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Deng tries to relight the torch of economic reform: Why China's paramount leader appears to be seeking to end three years of 'retrenchment' DENG Xiaoping, the 87-year-old who has commanded the heights of policy-making in China since the late 1970s, once said: 'I will only speak at significant moments.' If reports from Beijing are to be believed he has been talking quite a lot lately. His views on future economic reform, reinforced by a recent tour of south China, are now said to be circulating within the national bureaucracy after being read out to an enlarged Communist Party Politburo meeting two weeks ago by party Secretary-General Jiang Zemin. It is far from clear whether this latest outburst by Deng will presage fresh radical change in China. Sceptics point to a similar flurry of pro-reform reports this time last year. But a number of factors suggest something significant is afoot. There is a growing realisation that economic reform, on the backburner forthree years, needs to be re-started. The party faces its five-yearly congress later this year and must sort out its policy 'line' for the next five years and pressure is growing for it to appoint key personnel to carry that policy forward. Deng's apparent purpose is to set the agendas for economic reform and personnel changes. Underlying his analysis is the fear that, without change the party's grip on power might prove as impermanent as communism's hold in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 'To keep stability we must boost the economy,' said Deng as he called for 'new thinking'. He criticised some in the party for droning on and on about 'peaceful evolution' and not getting down to work. 'We have not even reached a state of modest comfort, so there is nothing to brag about,' Deng is reported as saying. 'One should carry out one's work modestly - do more work and talk less. We rely on real effort and experience, not on the churning out of articles.' But if the reasons for Deng speaking out are plain the options for economic reform are not. The problems China faces - from state finances, through agriculture and industry - are as large and diverse as the country itself. Economic reform has been stalled since the end of 1988 when, in response to runaway inflation, a widening current account deficit, and widespread official corruption, the government embarked upon a policy of 'rectification and retrenchment'. This was a policy designed to cool an overheated economy and put a break on the past policy of decentralisation of decision making. At a national level the authorities succeeded in cooling the economy but the greatest economic strides continued to be made in those regions which successfully resisted recentralisation, such as southern China and in particular Guangdong province and its special economic zones of Shenzhen and Zhuhai. Towards the end of last year the government said that the policy of rectification and retrenchment had succeeded. Though this is debatable - there are signs that inflation is beginning to accelerate again - the stage now seems set for further reforms. The problems are daunting: in agriculture the authorities are unable to turn the clock back to collectivisation. The liberalisation of farming brought about by leasing land and negotiating output levels, has produced higher agricultural yields and peasant incomes. China is currently self-sufficient in grains. But the array of new incentives has meant that peasants have responded to the higher gains to be made from meat and poultry production by giving over cultivatable land to these uses. Yet, as the World Bank has pointed out 5kg of grain must be sacrificed to produce 1kg of meat. Peking may be forced to raise official prices for grains if they are to encourage the peasants to produce more wheat and rice. Either way this will cause problems in the cities. The reforms have also spawned industrial growth in rural areas, creating around 80m new jobs in the past decade. These industries have been outlets for the entrepreneurial skills of the Chinese peasant, but some economists believe their level of technological sophistication is low and their scale of operation uneconomic. The fact that they can make money from these industries is a poor reflection of the state sector with which they compete. There is a pressing need to rethink the operation of China's huge state-owned companies - perhaps the country's greatest problem. Today1-2 per cent of all the nation's companies produce 45-50 per cent of its output - the result of a Stalinist quest for 'giantism' in the 1950s and 1960s. These companies - which make producer, rather than consumer, goods - also absorb around 35 per cent of annual capital investment, well above the target rate of 25% set ten years ago. Zhu Rongji, the man in charge of sorting out the problem, has made noises about change. He talks of ending the 'job for life' entitlement of workers and managers in industry - known to the Chinese as the 'iron rice bowl' - but the language is still reminiscent of 10 years ago when talk about the problem surfaced. Reform in any sector of the Chinese economy is likely to have economic (and political) consequences elsewhere. This is no more true than in the case of price reform. The price of many goods is set less by supply and demand than by political requirements or outmoded concepts of Marxian economics. The result is a pervasive irrationality about prices which makes assessing the profitability and efficiency of companies virtually impossible. Needless to say the state sector is highly inefficient, often producing goods few really want, and generally imposing a dead hand on what many believe could be a dynamic economy. Half-hearted attempts at radical price reform were made in 1988, only to fail. If the country is to meet Deng's call for an economy better suited to satisfying the economic needs of the Chinese people, then the nettle of price reform will have to be more firmly grasped.</p>

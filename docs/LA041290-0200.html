			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE WILL CHILDREN PLAY?  </P> <P> I have noticed in my area a great number of apartment buildings under  construction. It is obvious that the city is facing an overpopulation problem.  </P> <P> But, as I look at these huge apartment buildings, I ask myself a question. Are  children going to live here? If so, where are they going to play? What kind of  an environment will these apartments have to offer growing children?  </P> <P> I think the building regulators are missing a very important factor in the  building of so many apartments. As it is mandatory to have adequate parking  spaces for each apartment, it should be mandatory that each building have an  adequate playground according to its size or occupancy limit.  </P> <P> My concern is that the future leaders of our country will not have the  appropriate facilities to develop their motor skills. Consequently, this could  raise a series of problems related to lack of space in which to move around,  not enough exercise and lack of social contact.  </P> <P> I definitely wouldn't like my grandchildren to grow up under these conditions.  </P> <P> MARGARITA LOPEZ, Los Angeles  </P></p>

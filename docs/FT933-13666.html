			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: BES seeks Pounds 20m A HANDFUL of new business expansion schemes was launched this week. Nationwide building society has brought out a contracted exit scheme which aims to raise Pounds 20m to buy 400 repossessed Nationwide properties which will be let under assured tenancies. Nationwide Aegis is sponsored jointly by Nationwide Fund Management and Matrix Securities. The exit price is 117.5p for every 100p invested, which equates to an annualised return of 13.52 per cent for a higher rate taxpayer and 9.07 per cent to a lower-rate taxpayer after five years. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and the scheme is backed by cash deposits with Nationwide. Sponsor Neill Clerk has released two cash-backed contracted exit schemes. Leeds Metropolitan Halls aims to raise up to Pounds 10m for new student accommodation at Leeds Metropolitan University, formerly Leeds Polytechnic. The exit price is 123p for every 100p invested, which is the equivalent to a return of 14 per cent a year for a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.8 per cent for a lower rate-payer. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Southampton Student Halls plans to raise Pounds 7m for accommodation for Southampton University. The exit price is 122p for every 100p invested, equivalent to 13.8 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.6 per cent for a lower rate-payer. Both Neill Clerk schemes are cash-backed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor suggested Thursday [3 February] trade sanctions  may be unavoidable if a compromise cannot be reached with Japan  over establishing numerical targets in bilateral trade relations.    Kantor asked leaders of the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) for their understanding in the trade framework  negotiations, saying that without numerical targets in the  automotive, insurance and other fields, the U.S. choices of  action would be limited.    Kantor met LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and Ryutaro  Hashimoto, a former finance minister and now chairman of the  LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council.    Mori, in response, explained Japan's efforts to open its  markets but added the idea of numerical targets would have a  negative effect on international free trade.    The LDP leaders expressed support for the government's  direction in the trade negotiations.</p>

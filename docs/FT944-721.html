			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Hochtief to build Greek airport Greece's Socialist government said yesterday that it had picked Germany's Hochtief to build a Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) airport for the capital. Hochtief, a consortium that includes Flughafen Frankfurt/Main, will have a 45 per cent stake in the airport. The state will retain the other 55 per cent for 30 years, after which it will buy out Hochtief and take full control. The new airport will be built at Athens's eastern suburb of Spata and is expected to take 4 1/2 years to build. It will initially be able to handle 16m passengers per year. The Socialists defeated a conservative government last year and scrapped an agreement giving Hochtief 60 per cent control of the new airport for 50 years and exclusive rights to exploit a large area of nearby state land.</p>

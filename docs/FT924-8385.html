			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Warburg well below expectations - The bank says poor results were predictable AS HE announced SG Warburg's pre-tax profits of Pounds 51.2m for the first half, well below market expectations of about Pounds 75m, Lord Cairns, chief executive, said: 'It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep the market informed.' The stock market promptly wiped some 8.5 per cent off the UK merchant bank's share price. Increased public concerns about insider trading had meant that the bank now felt less able to guide analysts about what profits it would report, said Lord Cairns. However, he added that recent poor results from other other investment banks, such as Salomon and Barings, should have given stock market analysts a warning of what was to come. Most of the bad news the market had to digest yesterday came from two directions. Warburg's fixed income division turned in a loss of about Pounds 10m, while the German subsidiary of its Pallas Leasing group had been closed at a cost of Pounds 11.6m. Together, these helped to pull down profits in the group's investment banking operations to Pounds 20.4m, compared with Pounds 65.2m in the same period in 1991. Other investment banking activities presented a mixed picture. Corporate finance had been generally busy during a quiet period for the industry as a whole, with Warburg advising on the Hongkong Bank merger with Midland, the Wellcome share flotation and ICI's planned demerger. Equities experienced a strong first quarter to the financial year as trading volumes jumped after the general election, but suffered along with other houses from a fall-off in activity in the second quarter. Warburg said it had begun to restructure its loss-making Japanese equities business with the loss of a small number of jobs, and had restricted the range of Japanese equities it researched. However, 'results in the main UK, US and Japanese markets did not meet our expectations.' Warburg announced an unchanged interim dividend of 5.25p, despite a fall in earnings per share from 27.6p in the first half of 1991 to 11.9p (or 17.4p on continuing businesses). Mercury Asset Management bolstered the group's position with pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.5m, up from Pounds 34m in the same period of 1991. This was despite the decision to write off the remainder of MAM's investment in Isosceles, representing a charge of Pounds 4m. Mr Peter Stormonth Darling, chairman, said he remained confident that at least part of this investment could be recovered. MAM's improved performance came from a reduction in its costs from Pounds 49.2m to Pounds 45.8m. Turnover was up less than Pounds 200,000, at Pounds 76.3m. Mr Stormonth Darling said the company had not lost any clients following the departure of Mr Leonard Licht, vice-chairman, this summer, and that its funds under management had grown by Pounds 1bn to Pounds 42bn. MAM's investment performance, while disappointing in 1991, was likely to be stronger in 1992, putting it back among the leading managers on results, said Mr Stormonth Darling.</p>

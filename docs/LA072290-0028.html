			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?  </P> <P> Ho hum . . so Times pop critic Robert Hilburn suggests that rock is dead or  dying (July 15 cover story, "Is Rock Running on Empty?").  </P> <P> Haven't we heard that before? Critics have been periodically writing rock's  obituary since 1959 -- despite that rock has continued to grow in popularity  and today has its largest worldwide following ever.  </P> <P> Hilburn tends to overlook that from a creative standpoint rock is cyclic and at  the present we are going through a stagnant period. Don't worry, Bobby, they'll  write your obituary decades before they'll write rock's (and I am assuming  you'll live to at least 100).  </P> <P> JAY CHARLES JOHNSON  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

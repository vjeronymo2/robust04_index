			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Books: Madonna or whore, spy or victim? THE FATAL LOVER: MATA HARI AND THE MYTH OF WOMEN IN ESPIONAGE by Julia Wheelwright Collins &amp; Brown Pounds 16.99, 186 pages IN THE spring of 1917 war-weariness was provoking mutinies among French troops and strikes among Parisian workers. Official propaganda blamed the crisis of morale on subversion by enemy agents. At that moment Mata Hari, the celebrated dancer-courtesan, returned to Paris from Madrid. She was arrested and charged with espionage. On the morning of October 15 1917 she was taken from the condemned cell in the Chateau Vincennes; in the courtyard she requested that her eyes be left unblindfolded and her hands untied. As the 12 soldiers of the Zouave Regiment raised their rifles, she blew them a kiss. In that instant a legend was born. Mata Hari became the archetype of the seductress-spy whose erotic treachery can betray whole nations. Her memory was execrated, and she herself feared; rumour whispered that she had escaped the firing-squad and was still at work. Years later sightings of her were reported, on trains or abroad. Was Mata Hari spy or victim? In this absorbing book Julie Wheelwright proposes an answer. In one sense her conclusion is predictable: Mata Hari was a victim, and moreover a victim of predictable kinds of male fears and attitudes. When women are either Madonnas or whores - when they are either symbols of patriotism, like Edith Cavell, or seductive betrayers - there is little mercy for any who break the conventions, as Mata Hari did, and use their sexuality to gain independence. Mata Hari - Eye of the Dawn in Javanese - made her name as an erotic dancer. In her most celebrated act she was a Javanese maid who, whipped by priests for disobedience, escapes from an Indian temple and throws herself naked before a Hindu idol. In the early years of the century such headiness was much in vogue. It was the age of the Salome craze, Oriental mysteries, the Grecian frieze style of movement, nudity and sex tricked out as art. In an age still avowing although not practising the proprieties, such stuff was dynamite. It was after a failed marriage to a Dutch officer called Rudolph Macleod that Amsterdam-born Margarethe Zelle went to Paris and became Mata Hari. Macleod had taken her to the East Indies, and one of their two children died there. The marriage lasted nine years, during which Margarethe suffered at the hands of her much older husband. Later she claimed that he had been violent, even to the extent of biting off both her nipples. Her career was not smooth. In spite of a succession of lovers and occasional triumphs on stage she was often in need of money. By 1914 her career both as dancer and courtesan was approaching its natural term, and debts were mounting. Perhaps this explains much about the events which followed. In Wheelwright's view, Mata Hari did not spy for Germany. She came under suspicion because had a predilection for older, influential men, especially Army officers. Before the war she had an affair with a German officer, and in the summer of 1914 she did so again while living in Berlin, hoping for work there. She also had affairs with senior French officers, and a Russian one. Accordingly, Georges Ladoux, the French intelligence chief, suspected her of spying, and resolved to make her a double-agent. Between them they concocted a bizarre scheme to seduce the Kaiser's son. Perhaps the French authorities really believed Mata Hari was a German spy. Or perhaps they knew she was merely a fantasist and self-publicist, but elected to use her as a public sacrifice to the hysteria gripping war-ravaged France. She was the perfect target: independent, sexual, threatening, easily characterised as a whore despite her artistic pretensions - a woman both accusable and disposable. Such is Wheelwright's view, and she makes a good case. But it remains possible that Mata Hari's story is more complicated. The evidence in Wheelwright's book fascinatingly prompts as many questions as it answers. For in its pages we also meet, by chance, Marthe Richard, another Ladoux recruit and exponent of 'erotic espionage'. In comparing her own fate with Mata Hari's, Richard said, 'I got the Legion of Honour and (she) got the firing squad'. Could this be another case of war's ironic fortunes?</p>

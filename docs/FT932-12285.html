			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Halifax seeks sales breakthrough by loosening its ties: An unexpected application to the Personal Investment Authority THE DESIRE of the Halifax, by far Britain's largest building society, to join the proposed Personal Investment Authority could be a breakthrough. It is the first building society to say it wants to join the proposed umbrella regulatory body overseeing the sale of retail financial products, and it cites its commercial interest in doing so. The pay-off for the society is a chance to lobby for a change to the polarisation rule, part of the Financial Services Act, which requires sales agents either to be tied - selling the products of a single supplier - or to be independent - selling the best product of a range of suppliers. Chief executive Mr Jim Birrell said: 'The Halifax thinks of itself as a retailer.' He added that he would like to emulate Marks and Spencer. 'If you're a retailer, you should deal with a number of suppliers - more than one for each mainline product.' Apart from deposit-based products the Halifax sells no retail financial services of its own. It is a 'tied agent' of Standard Life, one of Britain's largest life insurers. After a brief flirtation with independent status the Halifax opted to be tied Life because 'the remuneration is better as a tied agent', Mr Birrell said. For the Halifax the tie brought in Pounds 177m in commissions, contributing handsomely to the group's total profit of Pounds 680m for 1992. And while Standard Life will not say how much of its business comes through the Halifax, industry estimates are that it accounts for about a quarter of all new policies sold. But what if Standard Life does not offer a product which Halifax customers want? Or if the product it does offer is not as good as others in the market? Mr Birrell says he has no desire to change his relationship with Standard Life but 'there are other sectors of the financial services market where Standard Life is not the best provider'. He hopes membership of the new self-regulatory body will expand his range of options. The body is to be formed by merging Lautro, the life insurance industry regulatory body, and Fimbra, the body for independent financial advisers, as well as the large independent financial adviser members of Imro, the self-regulatory body for fund managers. The life insurers have said they will not join, however, unless the retail financial services arms of banks and building societies become members as well. As a tied agent Halifax does not need to be a member of a self-regulatory body. It is regulated indirectly by Lautro, which oversees the sales activities of Standard Life. If a Halifax-based sales agent breaks the rules it is Standard Life which has to compensate clients. But Mr Birrell says he wants to see the new body get off the ground. 'We feel encouraged with the way it is shaping up and we thought it worthwhile to say so,' he said. Last December Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, told the new body's formation committee that he would not approve it as a self-regulatory body unless it significantly improved investor protection and incorporated certain specific rules. He has also proposed rules that could force the most marginal independent financial advisers out of business, and limit claims on the Investors' Compensation Scheme. That tough stance, and signs that the new body's board is taking it seriously, has encouraged Mr Birrell. But he admits to his other agenda - to change the regulatory structure to allow the Halifax and other building societies to expand the range of retail products that they can sell. The issue is unnerving several of Britain's largest life insurance companies, most of which have invested heavily in developing a building society tie. Industry sources said the Halifax had sought membership of the new body by approaching its formation committee, only to be rebuffed by the life insurance members. Mr Birrell says that because the banks and building societies failed to inject themselves sufficiently into the debate over the shape of regulation in the years leading up to the passage of the Financial Services Act in 1987 and did not join the self-regulatory bodies thereafter, they limited their ability to influence regulation. 'We have been disadvantaged in the initial discussions. We would like a seat at the table and the ability to influence events,' he said. 'We are a significant part of the life insurance industry and we haven't been able to influence regulation.'</p>

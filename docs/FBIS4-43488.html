			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpts of speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth </F> Clarke at Mansion House in London on 15 Jun]    [Text] This time last year, there were widespread doubts  about the sustainability of the recovery. The forecasts then  were for growth of just over 1 per cent and inflation of about 4  per cent at the end of 1993. That was not the worst that  forecasters have ever achieved. To be fair, they got the  nominal growth of output right, but the inflation-output split  wrong. But it has reinforced the intention I already had, to  treat forecasts with considerable caution and not to become too  mesmerised by them.    We have actually seen in the past 12 months a strong  recovery, with a better split between real growth and inflation  and an earlier fall in unemployment than would have been  expected, based on British experiences in earlier recessions.    I do realise there are still concerns in some quarters that  we in Britain will throw away all these hard-fought gains again  and that yet another recovery will not be sustained. I can  assure you that as far as the Government is concerned, we will  do no such thing. We have not created the conditions for the  strongest recovery in Europe in order to throw it away by  creating yet another boom followed by a bust.    I believe our economy is now strong enough to sustain the  growth rates that everyone knows I would like to see. But the  concerns are only too understandable, given our economic history  since the war. I believe that we can avoid these problems of the  past.    Tonight I would like to explain why I am confident history  will not repeat itself and why I see the prospect of recovery  being sustained.    The threats are all too clear. In my opinion, three major  problems have derailed recoveries in the past: unsustainable  public borrowing, which eventually required a sharp tightening  of fiscal policy, a failure to keep inflation under control and  prevent recovery turning into boom, with much the same result;  problems on the supply side, reflected in bottlenecks, shortages  of capacity and skilled labour, and burgeoning current account  deficits.    If I am right and if history need not repeat itself, we have  to face and to avoid all these risks in the present upturn.    First, public finance. The public finances were put on a  sustainable footing in the 1993 budgets. The issue now is to  stick to that prospectus and, above all, to maintain tight  control of public expenditure. I set out the limits for the  "new control totals" in my Budget. Those totals are ceilings,  and my medium-term aim is to see general Government expenditure  falling below 40 per cent of GDP once again.    The new control total approach allows us to keep much better  control of public expenditure than we used to as the economy  recovers. Low expenditure is the key to lower taxes. We will  cut taxes again, but only when we can afford to do so and not  before. The public are usually more sensible than politicians or  the press. They will not put their confidence in a government  that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under control.    I am also determined that my second spectre of inflation  does  not return to haunt us. Three times in our recent history a  burst in inflation has destroyed a recovery and taken us back to  deep recession. The effects of inflation are insidious and  affect us all. We should not lose sight of them.    Inflation breeds uncertainty. And uncertainty distorts  business decisions, discourages investment and unsettles savers.  That means a less efficient economy, less investment and less  prosperity. Inflation is a silent thief that robs the elderly  and cheats the saver. Low inflation is not an optional extra.  It is the necessary condition for the steady and sustained  growth that I want to see in the 1990s and beyond.    I often hear, sometimes from people in the City, the fear  that politicians might still secretly hanker after a little  inflation. After all, a little inflation leads to higher  interest rates for savers, higher wages for workers and higher  house prices for home- owners. What a temptation to ministers  who need a "feel good" factor to go with the recovery. Speaking  as a politician, I say that would be very bad politics.    A little more inflation is simply not an option for this  Government. A little more inflation will not make savers,  workers or home-owners feel good for long. A fraudulent  inflationary "feel good" would soon turn to "feel very bad" as  the bust followed the boom. As I have already said, our  masters, the public, are usually more sensible than their  politicians or the press. They feel good when they have  recovery that is going to last, with low inflation.    I shall continue to set monetary policy to keep underlying  inflation within the 1-4 per cent range, and to reduce it to the  lower half of that band by the end of the present Parliament.    I decided that my prospects of success in achieving that  target could only be enhanced by a properly informed, open  debate about the causes of inflation, and the policy measures  required to control it. In my opinion, the most important  decision I have made in monetary policy so far has not been  either of my interest-rate moves, but the decision to publish  the minutes of my monthly meetings with Eddie George, the Bank  Governor. You will see it every month, with only a short lag to  allow the Bank time to carry out any operations I decide on.    On top of the Bank's quarterly inflation report, and the  point- by-point explanations of interest-rate changes that we  have also introduced in the past couple of years, that will add  to the credibility of our monetary policy. I have deliberately  created a system of decision-taking about interest rates in this  country that is one of the most open and transparent in the  world. I have given todays politicians and tomorrows  politicians no choice but to pursue the path of low inflation to  which we are so clearly publicly committed.    My Lord Mayor, long-term bond yields have been rising all  around the world this year, but they have risen by more in the  UK than in most countries. But, the markets seem to be  schizophrenic. They appear to believe I am going to put up  interest rates, but they also believe that inflation will rise  out of its target range regardless.    The traders and investors who are demanding these high  yields  seem to be paying no attention to the analysts in the next  office, most of whom are forecasting inflation to stay on  target. I think it is the analysts who are right. And I am  determined to prove that to the traders, and to others such as  wage bargainers whose suspicions of higher inflation might  themselves add to inflationary pressures.    I do not pretend that the increase in credibility will  happen  instantly. It will require proof that I can justify any  decision I make on objective economic grounds alone. But the  changes I have made to the conduct of monetary policy will help  to ensure that nobody will be able to sell out our strong  anti-inflation strategy.    But though low inflation and sound public finances are  necessary, they are not sufficient conditions to achieve what we  really want to see. My aim is a long period of healthy,  balanced growth, which creates jobs and sees gradually higher  living standards for all. Our ability to sustain satisfactory  growth rates will depend on supply-side considerations. We have  to ensure that increases in demand are translated into more  growth, not more inflation. That means tackling our third  historic failure and eliminating the skills shortages and  bottlenecks that have blocked progress in the past.    It Is now a commonplace that the world is becoming an ever  more competitive place. Given the pace of change in technology  and business organisation, none of us can predict, with any  confidence, the new industries of the future, nor where the new  jobs will come from, nor what skills will be required to fill  them. The most successful economies will be those that respond  quickest and most wholeheartedly to new markets and new  competition. Within economies, the most competitive companies,  and the most successful individuals, will be the most flexible  and adaptable. I believe this recovery will last because we are  adding to the measures that created a modern dynamic economy in  the 1980s, and are creating an ever more adaptable, better, real  economy for the 1990s.    My Lord Mayor, this Government believes in the need for  ongoing improvements to the supply side of the economy. This is  why we place so much importance on the recent White Paper on  competitiveness. One area that I believe is particularly  important to the future strength of our economy is education and  training. The UK entered this recovery with a workforce that is  being far better educated than in the recent past.    Thanks to the supply-side reforms, Britain is also well  placed to see growth this time balanced between consumer demand,  investment, and exports.    There has already been strong growth in consumer demand and  retail sales are at record levels. But there are now an  increasing number of signs that this pick-up in consumer  spending is being supported by exports and investment. Export  growth is proving resilient to recession in continental Europe.  And exports to non-EC countries are on a firm upward trend.    Investment activity has also picked up, with the modest  recovery seen in the second half of last year being sustained  this year. Forward-looking surveys show that this upturn in  investment looks set to continue.    But the volume of investment is not of itself the key  indicator. Structural policy must aim to create the conditions  for profitable investment, and I would like to see the  improvements in capital productivity seen in the 1980s built  upon in the 1990s. More effective use of capital and labour  will help us unplug the blockages that have resulted in high  inflation and balance of payments problems, and ultimately  derailed the economic recovery.    My Lord Mayor, in some ways, the most heartening feature of  this year is that businesses have recovered their  self-confidence. The ingredients and policies are in place for  lasting success. That lasting success means our firms  outcompeting and outfighting those of our friends and trading  partners in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RISKY BUSINESS  </P> <P> It is curious that no ophthalmologists or ear, nose and throat surgeons were  quoted, even though many of these well-trained surgeons perform cosmetic  surgery competently and with excellent results. What we really have here is a  turf war, with the plastic surgeons attempting to create a monopoly for  themselves by legislating away their competitors.  </P> <P> As an internist, I have no ax to grind with either group, but I do want  patients to be free to choose whichever type of cosmetic surgeon meets their  needs.  </P> <P> ROBERT H.

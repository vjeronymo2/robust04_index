			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LME BASE METAL prices again fell across the board as the wave of bearish sentiment prompted renewed liquidation. Some prices edged away from their lows in late kerb trading, but with economic fundamentals depressed and further warehouse stock increases expected today, dealers expect the downside to remain under threat. COPPER prices edged away from 4 1/2 -month lows struck earlier, with the market regaining the Dollars 2,250 a tonne level but still ending below Friday's close. The apparent turnaround by China, previously a buyer of metals, has also undermined fragile confidence. Chinese liquidation of ZINC pushed prices to eight-month lows and sales of ALUMINIUM pushed that market to nine-month lows. NICKEL continued to skirt its lowest levels since February 1990 as the market awaited further production cuts. London COCOA made early gains of around Pounds 10 on sterling weakness, but it failed to inspire buying from continental manufacturers. Compiled from Reuters</p>

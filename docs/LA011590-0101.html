			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> NEA Commission Members Named: Four more members of the 12-person commission  that will study possible changes in the structures of the National Endowment  for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities were named Friday by  Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine). The four new members include  former Los Angeles City Councilman Rosalind Wyman; Kay Goodwin, a West Virginia  arts advocate; Marcia Golden, a member of the Kansas state arts council; and  Peter Kyros, a Washington area attorney well known in Democratic Party circles.  </P> <P> Four other members were already selected for commission service last year by  House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). President Bush will pick the  additional four members and the White House said those appointments are  undergoing clearance procedures by the FBI. The commission will examine the way  the two endowments operate and recommend changes in the aftermath of the  jarring censorship controversy that rocked the NEA last year.

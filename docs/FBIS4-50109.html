			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren said here today that China attaches importance to its  friendly relations and cooperation with the Council for the Arab  States of the Gulf and its member nations.    During a meeting with the council's secretary-general Shaykh  Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi and his party here this morning, Rong  said that since reform and opening was initiated over a decade  ago, China's economy has developed fastly and vigorously.    He said that China has a vast market potential and good  conditions for investment, so economic and trade cooperation  between China and the council have broad prospects.    Rong noted that China welcomes business people from the Gulf  countries, hoping that they come either for visits or for  on-the- spot investigations.    Rong said that China is willing to further cooperate with  the  council and its member nations on the basis of mutual benefit  and respect so as to learn from each other and progress together.    Al-Qasimi said that he and his delegation are satisfied with  the results of their visit, adding that they, as developing  countries, also feel proud of China's economic development.

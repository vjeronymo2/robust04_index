			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Macedonian Defense Minister: `Greece </F> Will Not Declare War on Albania -- Tensions on Macedonian-Serb  Border'"]    [Text] "Greece is not planning to declare war on Albania,  which would intensify the relations in the region to an even  greater extent," the Macedonian Defense Minister Vlado Popovski  told the MIC today on the occasion of the latest Albanian-Greek  dispute and the announcement made by Greek Prime Minister  Papandreou that his government is prepared to undertake other  measures if the diplomatic action fails.    As it is known, Greece is accusing Albania of waging a new  campaign of persecution of the Greek minority in this country,  whose numbers are estimated at 400,000 by Athens, while the  Albanian authorities estimate this figure at 60,000.    The defense minister of the Republic of Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], which borders  with Greece and Albania, and which is following the latest  development of events between the two neighboring countries with  rapt interest, says: "A Greek demonstration of power can be  expected, however, not an armed action, which would not be just  an ordinary war. In that event, Macedonia can expect increased  activities of the Greek military on its borders, which will add  to the already existing tensions on the border between Macedonia  and Greece."    Popovski also stated that particularly strong tensions were  felt in the last two months between the border organs of the  Republic of Macedonia and the FRY, which can be characterized as  a form of military pressure. "There were nine border incidents  in the last two months, which, according to our opinion, were on  Macedonian territory, while the FRY border organs believe they  took place on their territory. From our aspect, there was a  violation of the border of up to 300 meters, and on one  occasion, even up to 4 km inside our territory. We are  witnesses of untypical activities in the border region which  cannot be characterized only as refresher activities of the  reserve contingent of this neighboring state. We also do not  have any information as to when these activities will end, as  they do not talk to us, and such information was also not  received by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander for  Macedonia Brigadier General Tellefsen during his recent visit to  Nis."    The defense minister also said that the Macedonia border  organs received an ultimatum from the FRY, that the Macedonian  border watchtower Gasince was on Serbian territory. In  addition, the observation post 40 of the UNPROFOR Nordic  Battalion on the Macedonian-Serb border was issued a warning by  the Yugoslav army on May 24 to leave this place within two weeks.    "This way a mechanism is created, which raises tensions that  can lead to an incident, and later on even to an escalation,  which can be used as a scenario for maintaining high tensions.  There are still no announcements by Serbia and Greece of an  intention to recognize the statehood of the Republic of  Macedonia," Popovski says. "This only stimulates the extremisms  in both neighboring countries. The state border between the two  countries is called "administrative" by the military organs of  the FRY, as if it was not a border between two countries. The  Macedonian-Serbian border, according to the Constitution of the  former SFRY, is a state border between two republics.</p>

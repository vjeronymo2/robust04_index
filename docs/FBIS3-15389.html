In his words, "last year these rates  reduced by 65-70 percent compared with 1991."    As Tushinsky asserts, due to an uncontrolled growth of  prices  for raw materials and fuel and energy, growth of salary, and  other factors, cost value of production has increased. As many  as 24,800 highly qualified experts (12.9 percent) discharged  from defense enterprises, 8200 people -- from military research  institutes and design bureaus, he reported. As he said, "there  has occurred decrease of traditional markets to sell this  products due to their high price and reduction of demand for  military products and military orders."    According to the first deputy minister, these circumstances  "have forced many enterprises to stop or cut down production and  compensate the losses producing civil products at the expense of  irrational reorientation of industrial capacity. In 1988-92 14  industrial enterprises have entirely stopped production of  special products," pointed out Tushinsky.</p>

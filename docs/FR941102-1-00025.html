			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> MSHA regulations require some form of approval, certification, or qualification for a variety of activities. At coal mines, certification requirements apply to underground coal mine foremen, assistant foremen, and preshift examiners who, among other things, must be able to check for evidence of methane gas and identify other safety hazards. Individuals who collect respirable dust samples, maintain and calibrate dust sampling equipment, test noise levels, or examine surface coal mine work areas for hazardous conditions must also be certified by MSHA. Regulations for coal mines also require the qualification of persons who perform electrical work, examine impoundment structures, test methane and oxygen levels, operate hoists, or use explosives. Finally, MSHA approves instructors to provide training to coal, metal and nonmetal miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Depending upon the type of approval, certification or qualification sought, an individual can become certified or qualified through an MSHA-administered program, or a State-administered program recognized by MSHA. Six activities require an approval, certification or qualification issued solely by MSHA: Respirable dust sampling; maintenance and calibration of respirable dust sampling equipment; noise level testing; examination of impoundments; electrical work (several States have electrical qualification programs approved by MSHA); and the training and retraining of miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA certifies and qualifies individuals to perform work in the remaining job categories, but also recognizes State certifications for the following: blasters; foremen; assistant foremen; preshift examiners; persons who conduct surface examinations; gas testers, and hoist operators. Because MSHA accepts State certifications for these job categories, the agency does not require an MSHA-issued certification except where there is no State certification program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification and qualification procedures require an individual to show the necessary competency in the appropriate areas. In general, an individual obtains an MSHA certification or qualification by attending an MSHA-sponsored or approved training program; by demonstrating the ability to perform the activities and duties stated in the regulations; or by successfully passing an examination. MSHA currently administers examinations for certification or qualification for dust sampling, noise level testing, maintenance and calibration of dust sampling equipment, electrical work, and examination of impoundments. In order to remain qualified to perform electrical work, the qualified person must satisfactorily complete an MSHA-approved coal mine electrical retraining program annually. All other certifications or qualifications have an indefinite duration requiring no recertification, except for those persons referred to in &sect;75.100(c)(2) and 77.100(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most State certifications are conditional upon minimum age and years of mining experience, undergoing required training, and passing a relevant examination. In many instances, States also require refresher training at specified intervals. The following coal-producing States have one or more certification programs: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. These States do not all maintain the same number and types of certification programs, nor does MSHA recognize all State certifications. For instance, all of these States, with the exception of Alaska, maintain programs for the certification of responsible individuals. MSHA recognizes all of these types of certifications. On the other hand, although Arkansas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania have electrical certification programs, MSHA does not recognize their State electrical certifications for compliance with Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, 30 CFR part 48 specifies procedures for revocation of the approval of part 48 training instructors. Under 30 CFR 48.3(i) and 48.23(i), a person's approval to conduct training under part 48 can be revoked for good cause which may include failure to instruct a course within a 24-month period. It may also include failure to follow the approved training plan, inadequate teaching skills, or lack of subject matter knowledge. This proposed rule would revise and expand part 48 procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would also for the first time establish formal procedures for the revocation of the certifications or qualifications of individuals as well as the termination of MSHA's acceptance of an individual's State certification or qualification. Although an individual may continue to hold a State certification, MSHA could discontinue its recognition or acceptance of the State certification by following the procedures in this part. Revisions to the applicable sections of 30 CFR parts 70, 71, 75, 77 and 90 are included within the proposed rule. MSHA anticipates extensive coordination with the States regarding pursuit of decertification actions within those States whose certifications MSHA recognizes. MSHA will be cognizant of any State decertification actions, initiated independently of those actions specifically referred or sought by MSHA, prior to the initiation of decertification actions by MSHA under this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA has reviewed the existing certification and qualification programs (and their attendant policies and procedures) administered by MSHA and the States. MSHA has concluded that decertification procedures are necessary to assure that specific activities are conducted only by persons who do so in compliance with the applicable regulations, or who are competently fulfilling their work responsibilities. The agency has previously taken decertification action against certain individuals on a limited basis. MSHA has determined that formalizing the process and standardizing the procedures would assure that adequate notice is provided and sufficient due process is afforded to affected individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA has also re-examined the proposed decertification process specifically applied to qualified diesel mechanics and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 4, 1989, (54 FR 40996) as part of its comprehensive proposal for the approval and use of diesel equipment in underground coal mines. Because of the generic nature of the procedures published and proposed today, the agency does not believe that it is necessary to have a separate procedure for qualified diesel mechanics. This procedure was published under proposed &sect;75.1916(h) (54 FR 40996). Consequently, today's proposal also contains a new paragraph to amend proposed &sect;75.1915 which will serve to apply today's proposed part 42 to any qualification requirements for diesel mechanics which become a final rule. It is MSHA's intent to delete any reference to the decertification procedures referred to in proposed &sect;75.1916(h) when that regulation becomes final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the assessment of civil penalties and the initiation of criminal action against operators or agents under 110 of the Mine Act do serve as effective enforcement measures, they may not, in all instances, induce necessary compliance with regulations. MSHA believes that the emphasis in the certification and qualification programs should be on maintaining the integrity of the certifications and the qualifications that are granted by ensuring that only those individuals who adequately discharge the obligations which a certification requires continue to hold such certification. The status of being certified or qualified is a privilege, not a right, and only those who carry out the responsibilities that are inherent in these credentials should be permitted to hold them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAYING ON TOP OF THE SHAKE-UP;  </P> <P> MOTHER NATURE'S RUMBLINGS PUNCTUATE SOUTHLAND SHOWS  </P> <P> The whole lotta shakin' did little to interfere with the whole lotta shakin' on  the local rock concert scene. In West Hollywood, Curt Kirkwood of the  Phoenix-based Meat Puppets was resting in the Roxy dressing room between the  band's two shows Wednesday and hardly noticed the temblor.  </P> <P> "(Opening band) Pygmy Love Circus had just done its sound check," Kirkwood said  Thursday. "Then someone said, 'Did you feel that?' I said I just thought it was  the kick drum. . . . I always think I feel earthquakes (in Los Angeles)  though."  </P> <P> But Wally Ross, publicist for the band's label, SST Records, had a different  suggestion: "It was the Meat Puppets that caused the earthquake."  </P></p>

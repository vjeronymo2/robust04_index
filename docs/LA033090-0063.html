			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DANCING FOR MR. B' CELEBRATES BALANCHINE ON PBS  </P> <P> Rich in anecdote, emotion and insight, "Dancing for Mr. B.: Six Balanchine  Ballerinas" illuminates the careers and personal lives of major artists to get  at something larger -- the creation of American masterpieces and a company to  perform them.  </P> <P> Directed by Anne Belle, the 90-minute PBS "Dance in America" telecast is  scheduled tonight at 9 on Channels 15 and 24, at 9:30 on Channel 28, Sunday at  9 p.m. on Channel 50.  </P> <P> Interviews with Mary Ellen Moylan, Maria Tallchief, Melissa Hayden, Allegra  Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler trace a 40-year history of American  dance from before the founding of New York City Ballet to the present,  post-Balanchine era.  </P> <P> But there's more: intimate details about working (and living) with Balanchine,  plus discussions -- often illustrated with vintage films -- that help isolate  the components of Balanchine's style.  </P> <P> Tallchief calls Moylan "the first great Balanchine dancer" and, indeed,  Moylan's memories of the 1940s -- "pioneering days for the ballets of  Balanchine across the United States" -- convey a sense of wondrous discovery.  </P> <P> Beyond recalling her marriage to Balanchine, Tallchief speaks candidly about  how he reshaped her as a dancer to suit his choreographic needs. Hayden talks  of the evolution of a New York City Ballet physical type ("elongated, like a  racehorse") and both women are very eloquent when remembering how Balanchine's  interest turned away from them to younger dancers.  </P> <P> Kent's unsparing self-appraisals are even more intense ("At times, I was too  out of this world"), dramatizing the conflict between a private life and a  dance career that Tallchief also cites.  </P> <P> Ashley celebrates Balanchine the teacher, emphasizing the elements of  "exaggeration and repetition" in his classes. And she summarizes his creativity  in the most direct terms: "He just took everything that he saw and used it to  his advantage to get more from us."  </P> <P> Kistler proves especially valuable when describing Balanchine as coach ("What  he ended up doing was always giving me myself"). Each of these women highlights  a facet of Balanchine's genius that helps us see even his most familiar ballets  more clearly.  </P> <P> Not merely recommended, but indispensable: enlightening for dancers and  audiences alike.

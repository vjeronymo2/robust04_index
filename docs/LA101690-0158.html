			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: DURBAN;  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVE LAST STAND?  </P> <P> South Africa's Conservative Party will be reviewing its strategy for derailing  the country's reform program during a national congress on the Indian Ocean  coast today and tomorrow.  </P> <P> The party, which believes that President Frederik W. de Klerk is selling out  the country's whites, plans a series of provocative resolutions, including one  rejecting what it calls "the doomed reform measures," another praising the Zulu  nation for resisting the "oppression" of the African National Congress and  South African Communist Party, and another linking AIDS to blood transfusions  in multiracial hospitals.  </P> <P> The Conservatives, who constitute the official opposition in the South African  Parliament, oppose government talks with the ANC and the promised abolition of  apartheid legislation.  </P></p>

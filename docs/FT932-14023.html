			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / PowerGen chief adds to fears over pits' future THE CHIEF executive of electricity generator PowerGen yesterday set the tone for talks which will be crucial for British Coal's 12 reprieved pits when he said his company would need a 'very attractive offer' to buy extra coal. Mr Ed Wallis's comments will add to the gloom surrounding the 10,000-plus miners employed at the dozen pits. British Coal executives believe they will have difficulty in keeping the mines open for more than a year even if they can sell 10m tonnes annually to PowerGen and National Power, the other big generator, in addition to contracts already agreed. Executives at the generators have indicated privately that the figure of 10m tonnes may be optimistic. Mr Wallis said at an Institute of Energy conference in London yesterday that with 16m tonnes already sitting in PowerGen's stockyards, additional tonnages 'would effectively preclude me from reducing those stockpiles to economic levels'. He added: 'In fact they would probably rise, incurring significant further financial penalties in stocking costs and capital. So if British Coal would prefer us to burn their coal rather than our stocks we will need to see a very attractive offer.' Mr Wallis also indicated a strong reluctance to ease back on the use of orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel, which he said was the cheapest suitable fuel and 'other than its sulphur content, the cleanest'. He said: 'I can assure you that we will do our utmost within the constraints determined by the Department of the Environment during licence discussions to convert orimulsion from being a development fuel to a strategic one.' Neither PowerGen nor National Power has started serious discussions with British Coal on additional coal tonnages since the government's white paper on the coal industry. Negotiations depend on the level of subsidies that the government is prepared to provide. Regulation of utility companies in the UK is working as intended to deal with the problems of monopoly, and is not in a state of crisis, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, said. Prof Littlechild was responding to an article in the Financial Times by Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, in which he said the regulatory framework 'is in crisis and in urgent need of reform'. British Gas has changed its interruptible supply contracts to try to encourage competition in the market. The company says interruptible customers - which have access to cheap supplies of gas in return for being cut off at short notice during periods of peak demand - will be able to switch suppliers with seven days' notice.

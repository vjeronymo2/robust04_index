			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 37m loss at Brown &amp; Tawse SHARES IN Brown &amp; Tawse fell 19p to 44p yesterday as the steel and pipes distributor revealed pre-tax losses greater than had been forecast in the profits warning in March when the group announced a recovery plan involving a management shake-up, the disposal of peripheral businesses and widescale restructuring of the core. Losses of Pounds 19.8m had then been anticipated after provisions - in the event they were increased firstly by a charge of Pounds 14.8m struck under FRS 3 for goodwill and provisions for disposals and secondly by further provisions relating to 'additional computer costs, stock obsolescence and poor purchase ledger controls' in Brown &amp; Tawse Ltd, the main subsidiary. In total, losses for the year to March 28 emerged at Pounds 36.5m pre-tax. The board's last links with the past were erased yesterday when Mr Ian Harding replaced Mr Phillip Ashworth as finance director. Mr Richard Wilson, brought in from GKN as chief executive in September, said that when a company had been 'badly managed or non-managed for as many years as B&amp;T had been, it takes time to clear it up . . . but everyone has done as thorough a job as could have been done in the situation'. Jay Fasteners, which had profits of Pounds 73,000, sales of Pounds 6.9m and net assets of Pounds 1.6m, has been sold to Lilleshall for Pounds 2.9m. Mr Wilson hopes to sell Pipe &amp; Tube Group (sales of Pounds 12m and net assets of Pounds 4.5m) and Stauff Group (Pounds 9m and Pounds 3m) soon. He said that the adoption of FRS 3 stemmed from the decision the board had made to sell those companies. Above the line there was a Pounds 5.64m exceptional write-off of the 'disastrous' information systems computer, and Pounds 6.06m reorganisation costs. Turnover came to Pounds 119m (Pounds 139.4m) and operating losses were Pounds 7.46m (profits Pounds 1.82m). Losses per share leapt to 111.2p (2.7p) and there is no dividend (4.7p total last year).</p>

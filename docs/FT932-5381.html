			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Ukraine call to become nuclear state UKRAINIAN Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said yesterday that Ukraine should, at least temporarily, become a nuclear power, according to MPs who listened to his speech at a closed session of parliament. Mr Kuchma, former director of the world's largest missile factory, urged parliament to ratify the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, which covers 130 of the 146 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles on Ukrainian territory, but to postpone accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. 'Ukraine must confirm itself temporarily as a nuclear state,' one MP quoted Mr Kuchma as saying. The 46 ICBMs Mr Kuchma suggests Ukraine should temporarily keep were built at his factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk. According to MPs, Mr Kuchma also said that Ukraine has the technical capacity to develop operational control over the 46 SS-24s on its territory. Currently, all the ICBMs stationed in Ukraine are under Russian control, but Mr Kuchma's statement suggests that Ukrainian leaders may be seeking to develop independent nuclear capacity. Mr Kuchma's speech is the first time a Ukrainian government official has openly called for Ukraine to become a nuclear power, even temporarily. His position, which earned him tumultuous applause from the legislature, could be the harbinger of a major toughening of the Ukrainian policy on nuclear weapons. While asking for security guarantees and financial compensation, in the past the Ukrainian government has categorically asserted that it would ratify both Start 1 and the NPT. But Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, said that now Ukraine would hold out for air-tight security guarantees before giving up all of its nuclear missiles. 'We can consider accession to the NPT, but only when we have an air-tight treaty on security guarantees,' Mr Pavlychko said. 'The west will not want to give us such guarantees and it will take a long time before they come around. 'We want to drag out the disarmament process,' he said. 'Not just for seven years (the period specified by Start 1) but for much longer.' It is unclear whether Mr Kuchma's assertion is a reflection of his own perspective as a former maker of missiles, or signals a wider change in government policy. Just a few hours earlier, the Foreign Minister Anatoli Zlenko had urged MPs to ratify both Start 1 and NPT, warning that failure to do so could carry serious international repercussions. Mr Kuchma's break with the official government line lends credence to the concerns recently expressed by US officials that Ukraine could be seeking independent control over its nuclear arsenal. The prime minister's statement, which came on the eve of a visit to Kiev by the Russian foreign minister and a few days before US defence secretary Les Aspin is due to come to Kiev, is likely to exacerbate Ukraine's already strained relations with both the US and Russia.</p>

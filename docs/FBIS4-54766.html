			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- Over 800,000 members of  5,691 trade union locals nationwide took part in the warning  strike called by the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions  in Bulgaria (KNSB) today, KNSB Vice President Zhelyazko Khristov  told a news briefing. He said that 641,392 people were on  effective strike, suspending work for an hour. On April 14 KNSB  staged another nationwide protest, a rally in Sofia. Members of  the other major trade union, the Podkrepa Labour Confederation,  as well as of the Association of Independent Trade Unions and  the National Trade Union also joined in the protest, KNSB leader  Krustyu Petkov said at a news briefing this morning. The  leadership of the Podkrepa Labour Confederation supports KNSB's  demands but advised its members not to take part in the strike.  None of the political forces generally sympathizes with the  KNSB, but they have not spoken openly against the  confederation's demands and the means of protest it has chosen,  either, Prof. Petkov said in an interview with the PARI daily  which was published yesterday. Of the parliamentary political  forces, the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) sticks to a  position of neutrality, while the Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP) supports the strike provided that it is not politicized.  Several political parties and public organizations voiced  support for the KNSB.    According to Prof. Petkov, the strike has been well  organized. Teachers, civil servants, employees in transport,  trade, services and some branches of industry are the most  widely represented. A one-hour warning strike took place in  over 4,000 schools, nursery schools and kindergartens with staff  running up to 190,000, said a representative of the Teachers  Trade Union with the KNSB. The bridge over the River Danube on  the Bulgarian-Romanian border was blocked for an hour this  morning, said Prof. Petkov. Two checkpoints at the border with  Turkey, Kapitan Andreevo and Svilengrad-Ormenion, also suspended  operation for an hour. Protest rallies and processions are  being held. Strikers present their demands in declarations to  parliament and the government. A rally of doctors and teachers  in Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria) failed to take place because it  was banned by city authorities.    Today's warning strike is part of the preparations for the  general strike scheduled to take place on May 17. The KNSB  insists for incomes compensation. According to Prof. Petkov,  80 percent of the population is now below the subsistence level  owing to the steep rise of the U.S. dollar against the lev in  the recent months, the introduction of VAT [value-added tax] as  of April 1 and the inertness of the government. The KNSB also  demands that a government programme for the stabilization of the  finance market be developed, and that the cabinet take a clear  stand on the means to defend Bulgarian producers. Another  demand is transparency as to Bulgaria's commitments to  international institutions. At a rally in Pernik (western  Bulgaria) today Prof. Petkov said that the KNSB demands that an  industry-wide collective agreement be signed for 1994. The  agreement is ready and only the part concerning wages is yet to  be agreed, he explained. [passage omitted]    Yesterday Prime Minister Lyuben Berov notified Prof. Petkov  that he was ready to start negotiations on May 11 and would  personally head the government's delegation (as demanded by the  KNSB). The start of negotiations, however, does not yet mean  giving up the strike, said Prof. Petkov. As he told PARI, the  prime minister would go to considerable compromise to get an  agreement. However, the stands of the prime minister and the  KNSB as to the protection of the population's savings and of  local producers are completely opposite, he said. If the  demands of the KNSB are to be met, that would require actions by  parliament, too, Prof. Petkov pointed out repeatedly. During  the period between May 4 and May 17, there will be regional  protests as well as protests in different branches and  enterprises, indefinite strikes included.    The KNSB press centre reported that the police in Burgas  (southern Bulgaria, on the Black Sea) and Dupnitsa (western  Bulgaria, 60 km from Sofia) arrested seven trade union  activists, including the Confederation's Executive Secretary  Doncho Donchev. [passage omitted]    KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov met with Interior Minister Viktor  Mikhaylov and the Chief Secretary of the Interior Ministry Kosta  Bogatsevski. According to Mr. Mikhaylov and Mr. Bogatsevski,  the trade union leaders had not been arrested. They were only  taken to the police station for questioning and statements were  drawn up. Tomorrow morning and the day after tomorrow Prof.  Petkov and General Kosta Bogatsevski will go to Dupnitsa and  Nesebur to sort things out on the spot.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Thais halt UN flights from Bangkok THAILAND has cancelled an arrangement for United Nations flights to and from Cambodia, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) said yesterday. The Thai move will inconvenience rather than cripple the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) operation to bring peace to Cambodia, but it underlines Thailand's extreme reluctance to impose economic sanctions against the Khmer Rouge. In its latest resolution on Cambodia, the UN Security Council on Monday banned the sale of fuel to the Khmer Rouge, which gets its supplies from across the border in Thailand, because the Khmer Rouge has refused to abide by the Cambodian peace accords signed in Paris last year. The resolution also endorses a ban on Cambodian timber exports from next year and threatens further measures against the Khmer Rouge. 'We cannot in effect fly any of our aircraft to and from Bangkok,' said Mr Eric Falt, the Untac spokesman in Phnom Penh, adding that emergency medical flights would still be allowed free passage by the Thais. UN officials believe that the Thai armed forces, which have close links with the Khmer Rouge, are behind the move. The arrangement cancelled by Thailand allowed Untac, which operated about three return flights a week between Bangkok and Phnom Penh for passengers and cargo, to present the Thais with a monthly flight schedule. The December schedule was approved, but subsequently the approval was withdrawn. Thailand has done nothing to disguise its distaste for sanctions against the Khmer Rouge, an organisation long regarded as a useful buffer against the influence of Vietnam and the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh.</p>

Due to the grim economic situation, some plans for  financial reform, such as changing state-run specialized banks  into commercial banks, have had to be postponed.    According to informed sources in Beijing, the reform to  unify  the yuan exchange rate announced by the central government this  year has caused the yuan to depreciate by 50 percent in a hidden  form, and the negative effect of this measure is that it has  greatly stimulated inflation, which was already very serious in  China. As a result, persons in economic circles in China have  drastically changed their views on China's economic situation  this year; among these, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's think tank  also generally holds that inflation in China is the most  important problem at this time.    Zhu Rongji pointed out at an internal meeting last month  that, in light of this situation, this year, China must strictly  control the volume of currency issued; he also demanded that  various localities strictly control the scale of credit within  their plans and should refrain from exceeding them by a single  cent.    Due to the grim economic situation, some reform measures  have  had to be postponed. Zhu Rongji pointed out that financial  reform must be slowed down, and while the People's Bank of China  can still change to the status and function of a central bank  according to schedule, changing state-run specialized banks into  commercial banks must be slowed down, and he pointed out that  this was a long-term task.    According to information, this decision by Zhu Rongji is  mainly based on two reasons: first, due to the high inflation  rate, China must control the volume of currency issued; however,  other regulatory and control measures are very limited at this  time, so China can only tighten the money supply through  controlling bank credit. Therefore, for a long period to come,  controls over the scale of credit issuance by China's banks  cannot change, while the commercialization of specialized banks  can hardly be promoted.    In addition, state-owned enterprises have been slow in  changing their operational mechanisms, nor can they really take  sole responsibility for profits and losses. Therefore,  specialized banks, which are there to provide funds to  state-owned enterprises, cannot handle their deposits and loans  for purely commercial reasons; as a result, if reform of  state-owned enterprises cannot provide specialized banks with an  appropriate environment, specialized banks cannot really change  into commercial banks.    According to information, one of the most important measures  to support the unification of the yuan exchange rate -- work to  build an exchange rate transaction system among the banks -- has  not been smoothly prepared. An informed source pointed out that  because various departments are still arguing on the concrete  plan for an interbank transaction system, it is not optimistic  that the original plan can be implemented on 1 April this year.    In addition, a relevant person disclosed that, at present,  "debt chains" among state-run enterprises throughout the country  have already swollen rapidly to nearly 100 billion yuan, and  some persons hold that these debt chains are largely the result  of the tightening of the money supply which began last July when  the central government carried out macroregulation and control.</p>

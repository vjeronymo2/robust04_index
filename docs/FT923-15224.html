			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / People: Maples takes on Saatchi role It sometimes pays to be on the winning side, even if you are a loser, as Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman who lost Bath in the UK's April general election learnt. He quickly became governor of Hong Kong. Now another Tory loser, John Maples, formerly economic secretary to the Treasury and loser of the seat at Lewisham West, has also quickly picked up another job. He has been appointed chairman of yet another new Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising subsidiary, this one to be called Saatchi &amp; Saatchi government communications worldwide, or SSGCW. Few can forget the heroic role played by the Saatchi's in the Conservative party's regular election victories. Three executives have been seconded to assist Maples in his new role, which apparently will be to 'deal with communications between governments and their people and people and their governments'. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 58.4m for its last financial 12 months, and chief executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus is struggling hard to persuade those 300 group executives annually earning Pounds 150,000 and above to take cuts. Michael Herson, formerly sales and marketing director of Greater London Supplies, and Richard Miles, marketing and development director of the branded restaurants division of Allied Breweries, have been appointed director of commercial development and director of operations, respectively, of PITMAN EDUCATION &amp; TRAINING. ***** Michael Irvine has been appointed deputy md of REDIFFUSION SIMULATION; he joins from Electro-Optical and Data Systems Group of the parent company Hughes Aircraft Company. ***** Michael Churn has been appointed director, fuels marketing for MOBIL OIL; John Banfield, director lubes and commercial marketing, is to be appointed president designate of Mobil Oil bv based in Rotterdam. ***** Julian Agnew has been appointed chairman of AGNEW's on the retirement of Evelyn Joll, who remains a director.</p>

The MKO headquarters inside the country sent the following  first brief report of this series of victorious operations all  over Iran:    1. The arteries of the oil installations of the filthy  clerical regime at the pumping station of Musiyan, which was the  site of 33 explosions in nine oil pipelines, have been cut off.    2. Five oil transporting pipelines were the scene of 23  explosions in the Bayat oil region south of Dehloran, which  began at 0500 on Friday morning 18 March. The massive flames  that are reaching the skies are a small sample of the repressed  fury of the Iranian people seething against the filthy clerics  who in the 15 years of their rule pillaged more than $200  billion of the oil income and filled their own pockets. At the  time this report was received, the rising flames of the people's  resistance were still reaching the skies and could be seen from  a distance on the horizon by the deprived people of the region  whose natural and human resources have been plundered by the  clerics' government.    3. The heroes of the MKO have attacked the Kharrazi support  base for the 14th Division of the Khomeyni Revolution Guards  Corps north of Khorramshahr at 0130 on Friday 18 March with  mortars and destroyed it.

In this valiant attack, more than 150  Revolution Guards of destruction and darkness were killed and  wounded and dozens of armed vehicles of various kinds were  destroyed.

We have been battered."    4. Infiltration and extensive epic-making attacks on the  tactical base of the 21st anti-imam Reza Brigade, the separate  brigade of the anti-popular Guards Corps, in the vicinity of the  Hoseyniyeh station on the Ahvaz-Khorramshahr road took place at  0100 on Friday morning, 18 March.

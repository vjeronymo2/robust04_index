			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Craig Doonan] </F>   [Text] Empangeni April 5 SAPA -- More than 20,000 Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] supporters marched through Empangeni on  Tuesday, many carrying traditional weapons in defiance of  emergency regulations, and were told by leaders elections would  not be held in the province until the IFP's consitutional  demands had been met. "We'll make sure the state of emergency  does not work in Natal/kwaZulu as long as we live," IFP Youth  Brigade publicity secretary Zenzele Phakathi told the crowd  before delivering a memorandum to an Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] official.    IFP regional secretary and kwaZulu legislative assembly  member Blessed Gwala warned the IEC the people of the region  would not allow polling booths to be set up before their demands  were met. "If the IEC makes it possible to force the  installation of polling booths in our areas before our demands  are met, I am afraid people will use even their teeth to tear  them down.    "We are prepared to pay even the highest price with our  lives  if need be, for the sake of our children and the next  generations."    Mr Gwala warned that if the IFP's demands for federalism  were  not ad?ressed "then there is no election on April 27, 1994".    In apparent reference to the state of emergency in Natal, he  said: "We will do everything in our power to destroy any attempt  by any state organ used by the African National Congress which  is bent on dividing the zulu nation by encouraging certain  elements in kwazulu to rebel against the king".    Earlier, Mr Phakathi, reading from the IFP memo, warned the  IEC it would find it very difficult to maintain peace and  stability which would allow free and fair elections in the  country "unless this constitution is corrected in accordance  with the minimum demands of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance".    He said the IEC was a product of the ANC-dominated  Transitional Executive Council, an enemy of the IFP and kwaZulu,  and said IEC decisions were proscribed by the ANC. "The IEC like  the Goldstone Commission is a political weapon of the  ANC/communist party/government alliance which is to be used as  an instrument which will lead kwaZulu into final destruction."    Earlier, large groups of the crowd who assembled at an open  field at the start of the march refused to lay down their  traditional weapons in defiance of the emergency regulations  proclaimed in Natal/kwaZulu last Thursday.    Police legal adviser Maj Margaret Kruger told reporters  police did not want to provoke the marchers and would negotiate  with leaders on the issue of weapons. She said, however, that  those carrying sticks and spears were contravening the emergency  regulations.    IFP leaders, including Women's Brigade National Chairman  Faith Gaza, angrily told reporters the emergency regulations  discriminated against the IFP. "The state of emergency is biased  against us. It allows the ANC to train its people, but it strips  us of our traditional weapons," Mrs Gaza said.    While many IFP supporters heeded calls to hand in weapons,  others refused to do so. And while many marchers carried sticks,  spears were also visible.    Police and soldiers lined most of the route and no incidents  had been reported by the end of the procession.</p>

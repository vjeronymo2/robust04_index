			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will ask China to abolish its import  regulations in connection with a working group meeting on GATT  membership which is scheduled to be held in Geneva on 27 June.  Japan has already submitted a list of items to China on which it  has requested tariffs should be lowered. It will also start  full- fledged negotiations in the non-tariff field.    China has adopted an import quota system for wide-ranging  products, including automobiles, home electrical appliances, and  textile goods. In bilateral negotiations which are to be held  to coincide with the working group meeting, Japan will urge  China to abolish this system, saying it is questionable under  GATT rules. Regarding non-tariff barriers, the government will  call for market opening in such fields as the trading business  in which Japan is very interested. Japan submitted a 3,300-item  list to China in March requesting tariff cuts, and received a  reply in May. However, since the reply was insufficient, Japan  intends to ask to China to take further measures to lower  tariffs by submitting the additional 300-item list.</p>

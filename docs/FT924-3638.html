			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Seoul conducts election probe into Hyundai SOUTH Korea's government was yesterday investigating alleged electoral malpractices by Hyundai, the industrial conglomerate, as the presidential bid by its founder, Mr Chung Ju-yung, appeared to be rapidly gaining strength less than two weeks before the elections. The government's attempt to crack down on Hyundai could blunt the momentum of Mr Chung, whose campaign may determine the outcome of the December 18 elections. He is taking votes from the candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal party, Mr Kim Young-sam, potentially tipping the balance towards the main opposition candidate, Mr Kim Dae-jung. The inquiry by police, the prosecutor's office, and tax and banking authorities is examining allegations that Hyundai is illegally diverting funds into Mr Chung's campaign and forcing Hyundai employees to canvass for him. Police yesterday arrested four Hyundai executives, including the president of Hyundai Wood Materials, on charges of illegally campaigning for the group's founder. The police had sought the arrests after a junior accounting clerk of Hyundai Heavy Industries, a subsidiary of the group, told a press conference that Won32bn (Pounds 27m) was secretly transferred from a Hyundai subsidiary to Mr Chung's United People's party (UPP). Hyundai and the party deny the allegation. Mr Chung acknowledges that Hyundai employees are working in his campaign but says their involvement is voluntary. He says his campaign is funded by sales of his own holdings in Hyundai group companies. Mr Chung's campaign has gained ground according to private polls conducted by all three parties - public opinion polls are banned during the campaign. All polls agree that Mr Kim Young-sam is the front-runner but the opposition parties say his lead is narrowing as Mr Chung cuts into his middle-class conservative support. Mr Chung's populist platform, which includes promises of a trebling in per capita income within five years and deep cuts in apartment rents, is striking a chord with an electorate concerned about Korea's slowing economic growth. He is attracting protest votes reflecting dissatisfaction with the political establishment as represented by the Kims, who both stood unsuccessfully in the last presidential election in 1987. UPP officials say the Hyundai investigation is a deliberate attempt by the government to undermine Mr Chung and reduce the threat he poses to Mr Kim Young-sam. All the parties have been under investigation throughout the campaign for alleged vote-buying but the probe of links between the UPP and Hyundai has been the most public.

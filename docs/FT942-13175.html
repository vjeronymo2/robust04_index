			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Sappi omits payout after fall in profit Sappi, South Africa's biggest pulp and paper company, has announced a decline in after-tax profits to R142.2m (Dollars 29.3m) in the year to February from R360.1m. Largely as expected, the company has been forced to pass its final dividend. Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, blamed the drop on a weak domestic economy and depressed world pulp and paper prices. Turnover increased by 19 per cent to R5.54bn from R4.67bn, due mainly to the first inclusion of consolidated results from Hannover Papier, the German manufacturer of coated products acquired by Sappi in 1992. But operating income dropped to R165.5m from R443.7m a year ago. This was partly offset by net non-trading income of R26.9m raised from the sale of non-core assets in Germany and residential property in South Africa. Net finance costs dropped from R65m to R45m, due to lower interest rates and a R500m investment from the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation which will be either repaid or re-acquired by the company at a future date. The overall debt/equity ratio has been reduced from 0.47 to 0.41. Mr van As said despite cost-cutting and the depreciation of the rand, which helped boost exports from South Africa, the continued weakness in European markets had depressed earnings. However, the new Brussels-based marketing operation had been successful, increasing exports from the group's British and German interests by almost 24 per cent. The company also announced that its R1bn expansion to Saiccor, the world's largest dissolving pulp supplier, would be commissioned on time and below budget in 1995. Mr van As said he was confident the situation would improve as the international pulp market continued to recover and the domestic political situation stabilised, helping boost local demand.</p>

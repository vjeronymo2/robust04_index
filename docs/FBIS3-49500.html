			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 8 (CTK) -- Former Deputy Director of  the Czechoslovak Intelligence Services Jaroslav Basta said that  his organization had actively worked against Bill Clinton during  the 1992 presidential election campaign in the United States,  according to today's MLADA FRONT DNES.    According to Basta, the Czechoslovak intelligence services  provided incumbent President George Bush's election staff with  information about Clinton's stay in Prague in 1970 and  interviewed his acquaintances in Prague looking for information  to discredit him.    A former employee of the Federal Security and Information  Service (FBIS) [FSIS], who was not named, told the paper that  the FBIS has worked for George Bush's staff during the election  campaign. He said that information was to be recorded for  Bush's staff not only regarding the fact that Clinton had  visited Moscow shortly after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia  by Warsaw Pact troops, but also regarding details about  Clinton's hosts in Prague.    At the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970, Clinton  travelled through Scandinavia to Moscow and from there through  Czechoslovakia to Great Britain, where he was studying at  Oxford. He stayed in Prague for about six days with the family  of Jan Kopold, a fellow student at Oxford and grandson of Jan  Sverma, a pre-World War II communist leader who was killed in  the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis at the end of the  war.    Kopold's father Bedrich allegedly worked for one of the  security sections of the communist regime and his mother Jirina  was registered as an agent of the Secret Police under the code  name Jirka, the paper writes.    The former FBIS employee said that the intelligence services  were to hand over the information about Clinton in the fall of  1992 to members of Bush's campaign staff, who were to come to  Prague. Another version, however, alleges that the information  was to appear first in the Czech media and be taken by Bush's  staff from there. Basta did not rule out the possibility that  both methods were used.    The paper writes that Bush's staff apparently also obtained  information on Clinton in the Soviet Union and Great Britain.    Interior Ministry Spokesman Jan Subrt told MLADA FRONTA DNES  that Interior Minister Jan Ruml had no comment on the matter, as  the FBIS had already been an independent organization at the  time of the alleged activities.    Premier Vaclav Klaus's spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova said  that he had "never heard anything of the sort, so he would not  comment on it."    Petr Cermak, who was federal interior minister at the time,  said that he did not know anything about the alleged activities.  "It seems absurd to me. I do not rule out the possibility that  it could have happened, however," he said.</p>

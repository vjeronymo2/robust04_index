			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Bearish sentiment SENTIMENT IN the sterling money markets remained bearish yesterday after the June figure for Germany's M3 money supply growth came in at 8.7 per cent, well above the Bundesbank's target. Dealers fear that monetary growth will force the German central bank to raise the Lombard rate when it meets again next month. There was light relief in the market after the Bundesbank decided to inject DM7.7bn into the banking system, in what was seen as an attempt to push German call money rates away from the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. But there is still an outside chance of another monetary tightening. The market was also unnerved by the Bank of Spain's decision to drain overnight funds from the interbank market at 12.75 per cent, compared to 12.45 per cent previously. The move was interpreted as signalling monetary rigour. Both the German and Spanish developments are certain to put pressure on sterling in the European Monetary System, and the pound again looked weak yesterday, closing a pfennig down on the day. One clearing bank dealer said the UK June trade figures, which showed a widening of the visible trade deficit to Pounds 0.9bn, had little effect on the money market. 'Sentiment now is driven by Germany and the EMS issue, and little else,' he added. Cash rates ended mostly unchanged, with everything from two-month money out to one-year at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side. The flat yield curve indicated how bearish dealers are about the chance of a base rate cut, even in the long term. Futures trading was more exciting. The September short sterling contract opened at 89.73 and ranged up to 89.78 in the morning on technical trading. The German M3 news quickly pushed it down, as did rumours that the Bank of Italy will devalue at the weekend. The front-month contract closed at its low of 89.67. The Bank of England's operations were straight-forward after the authorities forecast a shortage of Pounds 550m. The Bank purchased Pounds 403m of Band 1 bank bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 146m of Band 2 bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent.</p>

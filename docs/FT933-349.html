			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Marzotto slides to L5.2bn shortfall MARZOTTO, one of Italy's biggest textiles and clothing groups, reported a first-half loss of L5.2bn (Dollars 3.3m) after tax and minority interests against a profit of L9.3bn last year. The group, which controls Hugo Boss of Germany, said its results were severely affected by the recession and the impact of tighter margins and lower demand, especially in the highly-competitive Italian clothing sector. However, it forecast a cut in net borrowings and a return to profit in the second half. Group sales, adjusted for disposals, rose 1.7 per cent to L959.5bn. By the end of August, turnover was virtually unchanged at L1,288bn compared with the previous year. Although Marzotto's first-half turnover in Italy slumped 13.9 per cent, the lower value of the lira inflated the group's foreign sales, notably from Hugo Boss. This meant that foreign turnover rose 13.3 per cent. Foreign sales accounted for 60.8 per cent of turnover in the first half, compared with 54.1 per cent at the same time last year. Danieli, the heavy industrial group best known for its steel mini-mills, reported a sharp fall in group net profits for the 1992-93 financial year, ending June 30. Net earnings declined to L28bn from L45bn, while group sales fell to L650bn from L760bn in 1991-92. For the second year running the group is cutting its dividend, with a L30-a-share reduction to L150 for ordinary shares and L170 for non-voting savings stock.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 19 Jun (PL) -- Another three illegal  occupants of the residence of the Belgian ambassador in this  capital voluntarily left the building this morning.    Police sources have confirmed this information. Now the  number of people who have changed their mind and left the  building in recent hours has climbed to 11. Seven persons have  left in the past few days. According to local observers, this  indicates that the idea that violent actions are useless is  beginning to take hold among the group that forcefully entered  the building on 28 May.    The Cuban Foreign Ministry today confirmed that whoever uses  force to enter a diplomatic or consular installation in the  country will lose the right to secure a visa to leave the  country, even if they later leave the occupied diplomatic  installation.</p>

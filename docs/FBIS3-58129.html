			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt (DPA) -- To prevent Europe from splitting  once again, Russia has proposed a new "strategy of partnership"  to the West and other European states. In a signed article for  the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU (Saturday's [8 January] edition),  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warns against  "fragmentation tendencies" in Europe.    If NATO expands towards the east "over-hastily," a dangerous  situation will arise in Europe -- like the one that arose from  the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Kozyrev said that  admitting Poland or other Central and East European states to  NATO would mean shifting the "guardhouse on the Rhine" to the  "banks of the Bug."    The core of the Russian proposal was the idea of taking all  steps towards a "new European architecture" on a joint, equal  basis. Regional organizations such as the EU [European Union],  NATO, or the WEU [Western European Union] had to be open to all  democratic countries. Even Russia did not rule out a priori  that it could apply for admission to NATO at some stage in the  future, Kozyrev announced.    Kozyrev says that the "guarantee of the same security level  for all European states" and the "exclusion of territorial  claims" were among the principles of the partnership strategy  proposed by him. The Russian Government's specific proposal was  that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, in which all NATO  and former Warsaw Pact countries are represented, should be made  into a central organization for military cooperation.</p>

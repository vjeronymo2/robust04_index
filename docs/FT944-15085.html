			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Where Haiti's rulers are made or broken: If Aristide is to stay in power, he will have to win the devastated countryside If Haiti's newly reinstated President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is going to stay in office, the politics of his survival will have to be played out largely in the country's devastated rural areas. Seventy-five per cent of Haiti's population live in the countryside, where successive governments have used their control of land tenure, especially in the rice-producing Artibonite valley where nearly all the country's irrigated land is located, to enrich their supporters. President Aristide is expected to nurture his constituency there too, but his still sketchy agricultural policy and the skewed rural economic patterns caused by military rule and the international economic embargo will make it difficult. The military government, which held power for the past three years, virtually abandoned the valley, preferring to make money from controlling both legal and contraband rice imports. Before the military, Francois 'Papa Doc' and later his son Jean Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier siphoned off the spoils of the valley into their paramilitary force, the Tontons Macoutes and set off a migration of peasants into the shantytowns of the capital, Port-au-Prince. There they formed the backbone of the popular organisations that spearheaded Baby Doc's downfall in 1986. Although Baby Doc had initiated a World Bank-designed economic reform package in 1982, import permits were still needed for rice and other grains and were difficult to obtain. However, the government that replaced him, led by General Henry Namphy, under pressure to be recognised by the US and maintain the flow of foreign lending, opened the country to rice imports, setting off a guerrilla rice war of roadblocks and shootouts. By the time of Father Aristide's election in 1990 rice imports from the US were worth Dollars 39m (Pounds 24.6m) annually and satisfied a quarter of domestic demand. The peasant groups involved in this rice war were the main supporters of the lavalas (flash flood) movement that swept Fr Aristide to power. According to some of his rural supporters, President Aristide lacked a coherent agricultural policy and therefore the country remained open to rice imports, hurting lavalas's ability to transform itself into a workable governing coalition. 'The Artibonite is where you make or break a government in Haiti,' says Mr Anil Juste, an agronomist and historian of the valley. 'If you can control the production and distribution of rice you can control the country.' But President Aristide will find controlling the valley an awesome task. Land disputes are ongoing and violent, as no one knows who has the right to farm what plots and there is no working system of land titles. The government owns most of the land but has in the past rent it for nominal sums to powerful allies who in turn rented tracts to local peasant sharecroppers. Some plots changed hands as many as three times a year and planting an area did not guarantee the right to harvest it. 'The first thing people will do when the embargo is lifted and the price of cement falls is build walls around land they control but do not necessarily own.' says an agricultural official. 'Aristide may try to help the peasants through credits and such but land reform is out of the question. How do you know what land to give away if you don't know what land you have?' Annual rice production has fallen from 125m tonnes during Fr Aristide's year in office to less than 80m tonnes since the embargo was imposed. The emergency food aid that flooded the cities during the embargo have meant that much of the rice produced in the valley had no market, according to officials at the World Food Programme. In an effort to jump-start production, the Inter-American Development Bank has earmarked more than Dollars 17m for rehabilitation of the irrigation system in the Artibonite, while the World Bank has a long-term project to map the area to settle land disputes. In return, international lending agencies are expecting that President Aristide, as he has publicly pledged to do, will keep the country open to food and other imports. Tariffs on legally imported rice will be cut in half 'for a transitory period' until being eliminated altogether, according to the Aristide economic plan approved by lending agencies. There is a consensus among agricultural economists that even as Haiti increases its rice production it will need to maintain rice imports to feed its population. 'There is a vacuum of agricultural policy that will be filled quickly by the World Bank and the IADB,' says Mr Juste. He says the productive programmes of the multilateral institutions can help construct democracy in Haiti only if they put a premium on helping small producers while breaking the grip of landholders who have become accustomed to making money off rents and political power rather than from producing food.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. It is represented that the Bank has maintained CIFs in which the Plans have invested in accordance with Regulation 9 promulgated by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service. The Bank has decided to terminate certain CIFs and to offer to the Plans participating in such CIFs appropriate interests in certain Funds as alternative investments. Because interests in CIFs generally must be liquidated or withdrawn to effect distributions, the Bank believes that the interests of the Plans invested in CIFs would be better served by investment in shares of the Funds which can be distributed in-kind. Also, the Bank believes that the Funds offer the Plans numerous advantages as pooled investment vehicles. In this regard, the Plans, as shareholders of a Fund, have the opportunity to exercise voting and other shareholder rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plans, as shareholders of the Funds, as mandated by the SEC, periodically receive certain disclosures concerning the Funds: (1) a copy of the prospectus which is updated annually; (2) an annual report containing audited financial statements of the Funds and information regarding such Funds performance (unless such performance information is included in the prospectus of such Funds); (3) a semi-annual report containing unaudited financial statements; and (4) at the option of the Funds other pertinent information. With respect to the Plans, the Bank reports all transactions in shares of the Funds in periodic account statements provided the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans. Further, the Bank maintains that the investment performance of the portfolios of the Funds can be monitored daily from information available in newspapers of general circulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to avoid the potentially large brokerage expenses that would otherwise be incurred, the Bank proposes that from time to time assets of the CIFs be transferred in-kind to corresponding portfolios of the Funds in exchange for shares of such Funds. In this regard, some Funds may, as in the case of HighMark, be in existence and operating at the time of the in-kind transfer of such assets. Some Funds may be created to assume the assets of the terminating CIF. Similarly, the Bank proposes that from time to time it may be appropriate for an individual Plan for which the Bank serves as fiduciary to transfer all or a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of its assets in-kind to any of the Funds in exchange for shares of such Funds. In this regard, for example, in the case of an in-kind exchange between an individual Plan whose portfolio consists of common stock, money market securities, and real estate, and a Fund that, under its investment policy, invests only in common stock and money market securities, the exchange would involve all or a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of the common stock and money market securities held by the Plan, if such stock and securities are eligible for purchase by the Fund, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  and would not involve the transfer or exchange of the real estate holdings of such Plan. No brokerage commission or other fees or expenses (other than customary transfer charges paid to parties other than the Bank or its affiliates) have been or will be charged to the Plans or the CIFs in connection with the in-kind transfers of assets into the Funds and the acquisition of shares of the Funds by the Plans or the CIFs. Thus, in addition to retroactive relief, the Bank has requested prospective relief for transactions which would involve: (1) the in-kind transfer by the CIFs of all or a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of the assets of any of the Plans held in such CIFs to the Funds in exchange for shares of the Fund which subsequently are distributed to the Plans; or (2) the in-kind transfer of all or a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of the assets of any of the Plans held by the Bank in any capacity as fiduciary on behalf of such Plans to the Funds in exchange for shares of such Funds; provided that conditions described in section I above are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is represented that a Fund's eligible investments are described under ``Investment Policies and Fund Portfolio'' of its prospectus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Bank maintains that the transfers in-kind of assets in exchange for shares of the Funds are ministerial transactions performed in accordance with pre-established objective procedures which are approved by the board of trustees of each Fund. Such procedures require that assets transferred to a Fund: (1) are consistent with the investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the corresponding portfolios of such Fund, (2) satisfy the applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Code, (3) have a readily ascertainable market, (4) are liquid, and (5) are not subject to restrictions on resale. It is represented that assets which do not meet these requirements will be sold in the open market through an unaffiliated brokerage firm prior to any transfer in-kind. Further, as described in section I, prior to entering into an in-kind transfer each affected Plan receives certain disclosures from the Bank and approves such transaction in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank represents that valuation of assets transferred in-kind to the Funds will be established by reference to independent sources. In this regard, for purposes of the transaction, it is represented that all assets transferred in-kind are valued in accordance with the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a-7(b) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement. Further, the Bank represents that within thirty (30) days of the completion of a transfer in-kind, it will provide to Plans written confirmation of the identity of each security valued under Rule 17a-7(b)(4), the price of each security, and the identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of the assets transferred. The securities subject to valuation under Rule 17(a)-7(b)(4) include all securities other than ``reported securities,'' as the term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), or those quoted on the NASDAQ system or for which the principal market is an exchange.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is represented that the value of the assets transferred in-kind will be equal to the aggregate value of the corresponding portfolios shares of the Fund at the close of business on the date of the transaction. In this regard, it is represented that for all conversion transactions that occur after the date of this proposed exemption, the Bank, no later than ninety (90) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets of the Plans or the CIFs in exchange for shares of the Funds, will mail to the Second Fiduciary a written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by each affected Plan immediately before the conversion (and the related per unit value or the aggregate dollar value of the units transferred), and the number of shares in the Funds that are held by each affected Plan following the conversion (and the related per share net asset value or the aggregate dollar value of the shares received).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Foodland merges unit with NZ chain FOODLAND Associated, the Australian grocery group, is to merge its New Zealand operations with those of Progressive Enterprises, one of the country's biggest supermarket chains. The proposal follows the purchase by Foodland of a 38.6 per cent, NZDollars 128.2m (USDollars 69.7m) stake in Progressive, formerly held by fellow Australian group Coles Myer. Progressive will pay NZDollars 101m for Foodland's New Zealand retail and wholesale assets by issuing 54.6m shares at NZDollars 1.85 each. The deal will make Progressive a subsidiary of Foodland, raising the latter's shareholding from 43 to 57 per cent. The combined group would account for about 34 per cent of New Zealand's supermarket sales. Davids Holdings, Australia's biggest food wholesaler, paid Dollars A37.8m (USDollars 25.5m) for a 19.9 per cent stake in its South Australian rival, Independent Holdings.</p>

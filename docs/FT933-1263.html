			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Argentina's DM1bn offer heavily oversubscribed THE Republic of Argentina's first D-Mark Eurobond issue since 1979 was given an enthusiastic reception by investors hungry for high-yielding paper. The DM1bn issue of five-year Eurobonds was so heavily oversubscribed that trading in the bonds opened at 99.75, well above the recommended re-offer price of 99.15. Joint lead managers CSFB and Deutsche Bank decided to launch Argentina's issue at a recommended rather than a fixed re-offer price because of the high interest from retail investors. The bonds rose as high as 100.20 for a short time but eased to around 99.40 in the late afternoon, in line with a fall in the German government bond market. At launch, the bonds were priced to yield 250 basis points over the Bobl series 107 of medium-term German government bonds, at the bottom end of the indicated range of 250 to 260 basis points. The spread on the bonds tightened to around 235 basis points by the end of trading. The spread on Argentina's bonds is expected to shrink further because of the persistent demand for high-yielding paper. This trend is already under way on the Republic of Venezuela's DM300m seven-year Eurobond offering, which was launched last week. Traders said the spread on Venezuela's bonds had fallen to around 270 basis points over underlying German government bonds from 290 basis points at the launch. Meanwhile, the World Bank is getting closer to launching its first D-Mark global bond issue. It is hosting a presentation for investors in Frankfurt on October 6 and plans to hold similar meetings in other financial centres. The offering is likely to be launched shortly after the completion of these meetings. The World Bank has not yet disclosed any details about the terms but the market expects the offering to raise between DM3bn to DM5bn and have a maturity of 10 years. There is also a belief that the World Bank could achieve a yield spread of less than 10 basis points over underlying German government bonds. Yesterday's other Eurobond offerings from Latin America were overshadowed by Argentina's issue. Corporacion Andina De Fomento (CAF), the supranational agency which finances economic development in the Andean region, priced its Dollars 100m issue of five-year Eurobonds at the tightest yield spread achieved by a Latin American borrower for debt with this maturity. CAF's bonds were priced to yield 185 basis points over underlying US Treasuries. Lead manager CSFB said the pricing reflected the fact that CAF is the only financial institution in Latin America to have received an investment grade credit rating. CAF is rated Baa3 by Moody's and BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's. Cia Suzano de Papel e Celulose, a Brazilian producer of eucalyptus pulp and paper, made its first appearance in the Eurobond market with a Dollars 80m issue of eight-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which were priced to yield 522 basis points over the interpolated eight-year US Treasury, has puts at the option of the investor at the end of the third and fifth years of the bonds' life.</p>

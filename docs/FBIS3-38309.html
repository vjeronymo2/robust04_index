			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed "j-ae": "Center Field Strongly for Rehn"] </F>   [Text] The expression of support by the Center Party  leadership for Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn seems to be well  anchored out among the party rank and file. The party's main  press organ, [Helsinki] SUOMENMAA, published on Friday [21  January] the results of its "Hot Line" comment survey on the  presidential race, and the replies clearly show that Center  supporters are to a very large extent prepared to vote for Rehn  in the second round of elections.    Of the almost 150 published comments, only a handful  expressed preference for SDP's [Social Democratic Party] Martti  Ahtisaari as the best candidate in the decisive round in the  presidential election. Without naming other preferences, a few  persons said that they did not intend to vote for Rehn.  Generally of equal insignificance was the opinion that Center  Party supporters should not vote at all in the second round.    The expressions of support for Rehn were of two quite  different types. At least half were either unqualified urging on  her behalf or replies that it has now come down to voting for  Rehn. The other responses were more or less reserved, with  arguments that made it clear that Rehn is to be considered as  something "less bad" than Ahtisaari. The most usual reasoning  was that the Center Party must not again contribute to the  country's getting a leftist president, that the election of  Athtisaari would increase the dominance of the SDP, and that  Rehn in the final analysis had firmly defended the government of  Esko Aho.    SUOMENMAA's readers otherwise strongly condemned both  [Center  Party dissident candidates] Keijo Korhonen and Eeva Kuuskoski  for having contributed to knocking Paavo Vayrynen out of the  second round. The much-discussed "media game" was also condemned  in many replies.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Ford loses Dollars 7.4bn after change in accounting FORD Motor, the US carmaker, yesterday reported a Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.9bn) loss for 1992, due largely to a Dollars 6.9bn non-cash charge for a change in accounting principles but also a Dollars 419m fourth-quarter charge for restructuring its European operations. The accounting change involves retirees' health benefits and affects all US companies. Ford's charge is one of the highest reported, but it will be dwarfed today by a Dollars 20.8bn charge due to be announced by General Motors. For the fourth quarter, Ford announced a loss of Dollars 840m, or Dollars 1.85 a share, after taking the Dollars 419m charge for restructuring in Europe, where it has been hit hard by recession and is cutting jobs extensively. The loss compared with red ink of Dollars 476m, or Dollars 1.03 a share last time, and was struck on sales of Dollars 25.4bn, up from Dollars 21.98bn. The group's full-year loss of Dollars 7.4bn, or Dollars 15.61 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 2.25bn, or Dollars 4.79 a share in 1991. Excluding accounting changes, it lost Dollars 502m in 1992. Ford's North American vehicle operations have been helped by a gradual recovery in the market and Ford has been gaining market share. It held 21.8 per cent of the car market in 1992, up 1.7 points from 1991, and its Taurus model overtook the Honda Accord to become the best-selling US car, helped by some hefty year-end financial incentives to buyers. Ford's US vehicle operations lost Dollars 405m in 1992, excluding accounting charges, an improvement of Dollars 1.8bn over 1991. However, outside the US losses rose from Dollars 970m to Dollars 1.1bn. Its financial services company, Ford Credit, had record earnings of Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 892m, excluding accounting changes, up from Dollars 749m in 1991. Mr Harold Poling, chairman, said the company was cautiously optimistic about 1993. It expected the US vehicle market to rise to around 13.5m cars and trucks from 13.1m in 1992, while Europe would drop to around 13.7m, against 14.9m. He said many problems of 1992 were continuing this year. However, cost reduction efforts and new products, with gradual economic recovery, 'provide the basis for continued improvement in operating results'. Ford of Europe results, Page 26</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Italy plans two-stage electricity sell-off The Italian government yesterday announced plans for a two-stage privatisation of Enel, the state-owned electricity company, beginning before June 1995. The sale would be Italy's biggest state sell-off yet. Responsibility for electricity generation will be passed to one or more new companies - 100 per cent controlled by the Enel holding company - before the sale of shares begins, the treasury, industry and budget ministers said yesterday. Enel's transmission and distribution activities will be formally merged into the company. The decision should end months of squabbling about whether to split up the company into regional operations or to maintain an integrated structure. Enel is responsible for 80 per cent of Italy's electricity production and it has a dominant position in distribution and transmission, making it one of the world's largest electricity companies. Within three years of flotation, Enel will have to sell off an unspecified share of its production capacity to reduce its dominant position. The group's 'dispatching' activities, regulating the transmission of domestically produced and imported electricity, will be split from the group and put under the control of a new public body. The management and accounting operations of the transmission and distribution activities will be kept separate, in line with EU rules on the liberalisation of the sector. Ministers said they had also agreed to preserve a single set of electricity tariffs for the whole of Italy. Sources indicated that the government was also set to reduce substantially the length of the concession granted to Enel, which the law currently sets at 99 years, in order to increase competition. Analysts estimate that Enel could be worth between L20,000bn (Pounds 7.9bn) and L30,000bn, although its value will depend on the extent to which it has to reduce its production capacity. A final decision on how much of Enel to sell off will not be taken until much nearer the date of the sale. Its shares are not yet listed on the stock exchange. Yesterday's decision does not have to be submitted for parliamentary approval. A decision will be taken later on the form of regulatory authority for the sector. Robert Graham adds from Rome: Italy's government yesterday called a parliamentary vote of confidence on measures in the 1995 budget giving an amnesty to property constructed without proper planning permission. The move came on the eve of a huge protest demonstration organised by Italy's powerful trades unions against the budget and measures to cut benefits. Up to 1m people are expected to gather in Rome today as a follow-up to last month's four-hour general strike. A government spokesman insisted the confidence motion in the chamber of deputies was intended to speed up discussion of the amnesty - an essential revenue raising measure in the budget. However, the rightwing coalition has a majority of 120 in the chamber of deputies and the confidence motion looked designed to unify the government at a moment when the populist Northern League is talking openly of its demise.</p>

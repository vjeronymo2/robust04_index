			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SUPREME COURT DEFERS HEARING ON CRIME INITIATIVE  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused, at least for now, to hear a broad  constitutional attack on Proposition 115, the far-reaching anti-crime  initiative approved by the voters June 5.  </P> <P> Instead, the justices, in a brief order, directed a state Court of Appeal in  Los Angeles to review a legal challenge brought by the Los Angeles County  public defender seeking to block implementation of the measure.  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication of when the appeals court would act on the  suit. But whichever way that court rules, the issue is all but certain to  return to the state high court for final resolution.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case now came as a disappointment to  Assistant Public Defender David Meyer, who noted that there are hundreds of  criminal cases in California -- their number growing by the day -- whose fate  awaits the outcome of the court challenge.  </P> <P> The initiative, known as the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act, amended the  state Constitution to limit the rights of criminal defendants to those required  by the U.S. Supreme Court under the federal Constitution. The measure also  called for a series of changes in state law aimed at reducing delay in criminal  proceedings.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, brought by Public Defender Wilbur F. Littlefield, sought a  high-court order preventing the initiative from taking effect and a ruling  declaring the measure unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The suit contended that the wide-ranging initiative violated a provision  limiting ballot measures to a "single subject." Also, the suit said, the  proposition was so sweeping in impact that it amounted to a "revision" of the  Constitution and thus could not be enacted by initiative.  </P> <P> Of more immediate concern was the suit's further contention that even if the  initiative were held constitutional, it still could not be applied to cases  pending at the time it was approved by the voters, but only to cases involving  crimes committed after the approval.  </P> <P> Littlefield's suit argued that such application is barred by the initiative's  own terms -- which make no mention of retroactive application -- as well as the  retroactivity prohibitions of the state and federal Constitutions.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yisra'el Tomer: "Investors? Russians? And in </F> Ari'el of All Places?"]    [Text] The skies darkened over Ari'el. The winter came down  on the hills all around. But the mayor of Ari'el, MK [member of  Knesset] Nahman Ran, is beaming. "There are," he says. "There  are foreign investors in Ari'el..."    While I wonder who is able already to invest these days in  Ari'el, whose fate is shrouded in mist, the energetic Nahman Ron  springs the second surprise: "The investors are Russian non-Jews  from the Urals..."    The truth is, that I didn't believe [him] in the first  moment. But MK Nahman Ron does not relent. "Come and get  acquainted with them," he says and pulls me to a table in the  Knesset dining room. Most of them around the table are Russian  speakers. Some of them are immigrants from the former Soviet  Union and two of them are representatives of Russian investors  from the city of Ekaterinburg, formerly Sverdlovsk, in the  Urals. One is Feminov Sergey, the manager of the "Layet"  company, which is registered under another name also in the  British Virgin Islands. The second one is Kokarkin Viktor.    So what? You want to invest in Israel?--I ask  without hiding my doubts.    "We have already invested," Mr. Feminov cuts in and pulls  out  an agreement that was signed with the "Tel-Basis" company of  Ari'el.    How much have you invested?    "Half a million dollars," replies Feminov.    Micha'el Zeldner, the director-general of "Tel-Basis"  company, joins the conversation: "The money has already been  deposited in a bank in Israel." Zeldner himself immigrated to  Israel from the Soviet Union 10 years ago. By profession he is  an engineer, who worked in Ta'as.    According to the agreement, a joint company was founded by  the Russian investors and the "Tel-Basis" company for producing  software for inspecting digital circuits. The software was  developed in Ari'el's technological incubator by a group of  immigrants from the Commonwealth of Peoples. [sentence as  published]    At the meeting there was also Naftali Raz, the  director-general for technological initiatives in Ari'el.  According to him, this is only a first project. In the pipeline  there are additional projects, whose development is based on  know-how from the former Soviet Union. Like, for example, the  manufacture of reinforced plastic pipes.    "Half a million dollars is a lot of money in Russia.  How did you raise this sum there?"    Feminov smiles: "Yes, among us that is a large sum. But  there  is money. How did we raise it? That is our commercial secret..."    Why in Israel of all places and not anywhere else in  the world?    The investors from the Urals explain: "First, it is a lot  easier to speak with people in Israel than elsewhere. Our  partners in Israel came from Russia, they know the language,  they are acquainted with the conditions. Aside from that, we  already worked with some of them in the Urals. In addition to  that, Israel has a developed technological infrastructure and  trained and superior manpower. Another reason: because of the  agreements and the contacts that Israel has with Western Europe  and with the U.S.A. it has become an economic bridge between the  West and the East, and we want to use it. Finally, there are now  chances for peace and stability in the Middle East."    We did not want to embarrass Nahman Ron and ask why in  Ari'el  of all places. But it turned out that the reason is quite  simple: in Ari'el there are some of the acquaintances with whom  the investors already worked in Russia.    "Among us," explains the entrepreneur from the Urals, "the  inventions and the developments are getting lost..."    MK Nahman Ron holds in his hand a memorandum that was  composed two months ago under the somewhat historical heading  "The Soviet Connection." The memorandum, which was composed by  Tamar Guy and Vladimir Aks, is an analysis of the tremendous  potential afforded by exploiting the know-how from R&amp;D in the  former Soviet Union.    The political and economic chaos in Russia caused, among  other things, the collapse of the entire government R&amp;D  system.  According to a rough estimate, about 4,000 Russian research  institutes, which employ about 600,000 scientists, were left  without government support. For that reason, there appeared the  phenomenon of Russian scientists who continue to work, in  theory, in these institutes, and try to sell privately the  know-how and the technologies that they developed. In Russia,  there are no legal limitations on such activity.    In Israel, there operate today 27 "technological  incubators,"  in which are employed hundreds of recent immigrants, who are  working on 300 different projects. Tens of projects are already  ripe, and they can be shifted to production. Such a  technological incubator also operates in Ari'el.    Among the new projects that are being offered to  investors--in addition to the software for inspecting digital  circuits and for manufacturing reinforced plastic pipes: a  sophisticated system for exact measurement of heat at  temperatures of 2,000 to 3,000 Celsius, a new kind of ink that  withstands high temperatures, and which costs half as much as  ordinary ink, and more.    They are now trying to shift from research and development  to  business initiatives, and the Russian investors are taking part  in this. Of course, while taking advantage of the system of  grants and incentives that the laws provide to foreign investors.    The mayor of Ari'el, MK Nahman Ron, is now planning to  travel  to the Urals.</p>

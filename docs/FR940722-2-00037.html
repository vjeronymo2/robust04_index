The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appeal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, 5/26/94, LFA&hyph;0368  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Akin Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld (Akin Gump) filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the FOI and Privacy Acts Branch, Reference and Information Management Division of the Department of Energy (DOE Headquarters) in response to a request from Akin Gump under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Akin Gump sought the U.S.Russia Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement signed by President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin (Purchase Agreement). In considering the Appeal, the Office of Hearings and Appeals found that DOE Headquarters performed an adequate search for the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Introductory Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Westinghouse Hanford Company, 5/26/94, LWZ-0031  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC) filed a Motion to Dismiss the underlying complaint and hearing request filed by Helen ``Gai'' Oglesbee under the Department of Energy's Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 C.F.R. Part 708. On August 24, 1992, Oglesbee filed a complaint under Part 708 with the DOE Richland Field Office (DOE/RL) which was forwarded to the Office of Contractor Employee Protection on October 2, 1992. In his Decision, the Hearing Officer found that: (1) the OCEP Director did not abuse her discretion in accepting Oglesbee's complaint as timely filed; (2) it was unnecessary to determine whether Oglesbee's complaint specifically met each of the criteria outlined in 10 C.F.R. &sect;708.6, since the decision to accept a complaint is clearly within the discretion of the OCEP; (3) WHC was not prejudiced by the OCEP's acceptance of the complaint. Accordingly, WHC's Motion was denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Implementation of Special Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> County Fuel Company, INC., 5/24/94, LEF&hyph;0015  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order implementing procedures for the distribution of $38,214.98, plus accrued interest, in alleged overcharges obtained from County Fuel Company, Inc. These funds were remitted to settle possible pricing violations in its sales of motor gasoline during portions of 1979 and 1980. The DOE determined that these funds will be distributed in accordance with the DOE Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA). Accordingly, Applications for Refund will be accepted from any party who purchased refined petroleum products during the specified periods, March 1, 1979 through March 18, 1980. The specific information to be included in Applications for Refund is included in the Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Refund Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 5/27/94, RF272&hyph;21241  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed on behalf of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in the crude oil overcharge special refund proceeding being conducted by the DOE under 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claim was meritorious and granted a refund of $535,554. The DOE denied the Objections filed by a group of States, finding that the econometric data submitted by the States did not rebut the presumption that the Applicant was injured by the crude oil overcharges. In addition, the DOE denied the Objections filed by a group of Utilities, Transporters, and Manufacturers, finding that (1) Even if Amtrak were a government authority, it would still be eligible for a refund for its own purchases of refined petroleum products and (2) because Amtrak was specifically excluded from the Settlement Agreement does not exclude it from the DOE's crude oil refund proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

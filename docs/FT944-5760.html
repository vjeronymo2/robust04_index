			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Russia urged to free detainees A UN investigator yesterday urged Russia to release 71,000 people awaiting trial in what he called inhuman and overcrowded conditions. Mr Nigel Rodley, UN special rapporteur on torture, said many of the detainees were young, first-time, non-violent offenders swept up in a 'law and order' campaign to clear the streets. Mr Rodley, who has visited 'infernal' detention centres in Moscow and St Petersburg, said that while the 160 remand centres in Russia had an official capacity of 167,000, about 238,000 were crammed into squalid, inhuman cells. 'The special rapporteur appeals to the government of the Russian Federation to remove from confinement in centres of detention on remand all 71,000 detained in excess of the officially proclaimed capacity of existing institutions,' he said in his his report to the UN Commission on Human Rights. Some detainees were petty criminals as young as 14, Mr Rodley said.</p>

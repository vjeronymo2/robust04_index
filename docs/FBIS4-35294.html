			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive report" by Fathi al-Qatta'] </F>   [Text] AL-DUSTUR has contacted Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani  in Sanaa. Al-Iryani is the minister of development and planning  and a former foreign minister. He is also close to Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and is sometimes called the  engineer of Yemeni policy.    During our telephone conversation, al-Iryani said that a  decision to enter the city of Aden by force, following the  two-week siege, would be a political and not a military  question. There are 400,000 citizens in Aden and the leadership  does not want to risk their lives.    Asked about the failure of the Democratic Republic of Yemen,  proclaimed on 21 May, to secure recognition, even from countries  that do not have any political weight -- which could have been a  victory for it that would open the door to further recognition  -- al-Iryani said there is no alternative to reversing the  secession. He said he expects the secessionists to go.    On the current moves, namely, the request made by Egypt, the  United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain,  to hold an urgent session of the Security Council to discuss the  situation in Yemen, al-Iryani said: The Security Council member  states have asserted to our mission in New York that they adhere  to Yemen's unity and democracy and respect its sovereignty and  independence. Any resolution adopted by the Council that  contradicts this reality will be rejected.    On the meeting scheduled to be held by the foreign ministers  of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Saudi Arabia during the  coming hours, al-Iryani said he had no comment, however, if this  meeting aims at interfering in Yemen's domestic affairs, then it  will be a serious precedent.    Regarding a statement issued by the Political Bureau of the  Socialist Party, carried by Aden radio yesterday, denying  al-Iryani's statements to the media about a secret dialogue  going on between those al-Iryani described as the unionists  within the Socialist Party and the leadership in Sanaa,  al-Iryani said: They are free to deny or confirm whatever they  want. The important thing is that we have received a signal  from a third party -- a senior Yemeni figure whom he declined to  name -- according to which the brothers in Aden say verbatim:  Let us first agree to a cease-fire and then everything is  negotiable. This came in reply to previous messages.    Regarding accusations propagated by some Arab media in their  comments on Yemen that the General People's Congress [GPC] and  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih himself, who is the GPC's  secretary general, have sought to divide the ranks of the  Socialist Party -- by trying to win over some of its influential  leaders, such as Salim Salih Muhammad, the assistant secretary  general of the Socialist Party and dismissed Presidential  Council member who was appointed with the separatist state; and  Haytham Qasim Tahir, member of the Political Bureau and the  dismissed defense minister -- Dr. al-Iryani said he can prove  that 'Ali Salim al-Bid is the one who proposed the question of  merger. Al-Bid cannot deny this.    Al-Iryani added that the separatists cannot talk about the  accord document when they talk about secession. Had the  document been implemented, it would have enhanced unity because  it was signed by all the political forces in Yemen. The first to  spurn this document was the Socialist Party. Al-Iryani denied  that Haytham Qasim Tahir, the former defense minister, was  killed recently.    Dr. al-Iryani said all Yemenis, young and old, value  Jordan's  true fraternal position in support of the Yemeni people.</p>

Tzou and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Geneva, March 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan has taken a step  forward in its bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), a Taiwan delegate said here Friday [25 March]  after wrapping up bilateral tariff reduction talks with six  countries.    Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign  Trade  told a group of Taiwan reporters that all the six countries --  Hungary, South Africa, Chile, Turkey, New Zealand and Australia  -- have reaffirmed their support for Taiwan's GATT entry during  the tariff reduction talks.    Huang, who arrived in Geneva March 20 at the head of a  14-member delegation for the first-round tariff talks with the  six countries in connection with Taiwan's GATT bid, said the  talks proceeded smoothly.    "Nevertheless, all of the six countries have asked US to  remove tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in accordance with  GATT requirements," Huang noted.    They were particularly concerned with Taiwan's quota and  area  restrictions on farm trade and some industrial products, such as  compact cars, Huang said.    "We must accelerate trade liberalization and adjust our  agricultural development strategies in order to facilitate our  GATT bid," Huang added.    Taiwan will hold further bilateral or multilateral tariff  talks with the six countries later this year. Taiwan already  held informal bilateral tariff reduction talks with the United  States, and more than 10 other countries have requested similar  talks with Taiwan.    Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and  is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.  Huang, who is leaving here for home Sunday, said he will return  to Geneva in May to attend a meeting of the GATT working party  screening Taiwan's GATT application.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Trafalgar warns on profits: Shares fall as rights issue is confirmed; More provisions likely THE SHARE price of Trafalgar House fell 11 1/2 p to close at 85p yesterday after the construction and engineering group announced plans to raise up to Pounds 400m in a rights issue and made a profits warning. Analysts had pencilled in a profit of about Pounds 50m before tax and provisions for the year to September 30. Profit estimates were reduced after yesterday's announcement and the provisions figure raised. Trafalgar House said it was getting independent valuations of its property. As a result, it expected to make further substantial provisions in addition to the Pounds 100m taken at the halfway stage. One of the properties likely to be written down is London's Ritz Hotel, currently valued at Pounds 85m, which the group has been trying to sell. Another is the Emerald oil rig. The convertible preference share issue will be the group's third cash call in two years. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said that the growing engineering and construction division required a stronger capital base. Hongkong Land, which has a 25 per cent stake, confirmed that it would subscribe for its full share of the issue, details of which will be announced in December with annual results. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said that net debt had fallen below Pounds 300m by the end of September, and the group should be ungeared after the rights issue. It confirmed that the final dividend would be 2p per ordinary share, to be paid from reserves. Mr Keswick said the rights issue would be made through preference shares because investors were entitled to feel confident they would get a return on their money. The board has also arranged new credit and bonding facilities with the HSBC Group. Mr Gormly said this would simplify the group's complex financial arrangements. He is stepping down as chief executive next August to become the chairman of Royal Insurance Holdings. He will remain on Trafalgar House's board as a non-executive director. His replacement will be Mr Nigel Rich, 47, managing director of Jardine Matheson Holdings, which controls Hongkong Land. Trafalgar also said that Mr John Olsen, chief executive of Cunard and managing director of the group's shipping and hotels division, had joined the board.</p>

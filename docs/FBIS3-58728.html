			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Good Day for NATO and Europe"] </F>   [Text] The NATO summit that ends today in Brussels has  already yielded two outstanding results. The first -- uncertain  though its fulfillment may be -- is the deal under which  Ukraine's leadership has agreed to destroy the country's nuclear  arsenal in exchange for $12 billion. The second is the much  more positive than expected tone adopted by NATO leaders towards  extending membership to former members of the Soviet bloc,  notably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.    The Ukrainian deal will be formally signed when Bill Clinton  visits Moscow later this week. It involves some 1,200 nuclear  warheads left on Ukrainian soil after the collapse of the Soviet  Union. The American commitment to underwrite the destruction of  this potential threat to world peace is welcome evidence of  President Clinton's readiness to involve the United States  directly in the affairs of East Europe. Not the least benefit  of the deal will be to end Russia's fears of a hostile nuclear  neighbour: the possibility, however remote, of a nuclear clash  between Ukraine and Russia must rank high on any list of  contemporary disaster scenarios.    The chief anxiety must now be that the agreement will be  repudiated by Ukraine's nationalistic and heavily pro-nuclear  parliament. At the very least, the deal will be hotly debated.  Elections due in March could produce a yet more obstructive  group of parliamentarians bent on retaining nuclear weapons as  symbols of Ukraine's sovereignty.    Even more significant for the long-term security of Europe,  if less tangible, was the nature of the language adopted towards  NATO's enlargement to embrace former Warsaw Pact members. True,  there is still no timetable for enlargement, no criteria and no  formal naming of potential new members. All that is being  offered is the halfway-house of the Partnership for Peace, an  offer of military co-operation that is being extended to all and  sundry, including Russia itself. But today's communique is  expected to say that NATO "expects and welcomes" new members,  the more positive of two alternative formulas; and British  officials have been suggesting that a timetable for the  accession of the most eligible countries -- Poland, Hungary and  the Czech Republic -- could emerge this year.    Vital though it is to give those countries the sense of  security that they need for the full flowering of democracy,  there is force in the argument that to act now would risk  inflaming nationalist sentiment in Russia -- hard on the  electoral success of the extreme nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and his so-called Liberal Democrats.    Only over the advisability of launching air strikes against  the Bosnian Serb forces shelling Sarajevo did the alliance show  its divisions. Those differences of opinion are understandable,  given the potential dangers posed to the ground forces of NATO  member states as well as to Bosnian civilians. Yet Western  failure to stop the slaughter in Bosnia continues to challenge  the logic of NATO's existence.</p>

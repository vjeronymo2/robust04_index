			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: MEPC MEPC's shareholders may think it odd that just as the UK property market starts racing away with itself their company decides to buy two shopping centres across the Atlantic. Yet, MEPC is chiefly funding the deal with paper. Thankfully, it is retaining most of the proceeds from its recent Pounds 222m rights issue to refurbish its UK portfolio and make selective acquisitions. Moreover, MEPC sees scope to lift the shopping centres' yield to more than 9 per cent, increasing their capital value. It suggests this can be achieved by raising leasing levels above 95 per cent and marketing the centres more effectively. Any pick up in California's dull economy would also help, given that rental payments are related to turnover. Yet many will doubt the ability of an overseas investor to make capital gains in the ferociously competitive US property market. The US has certainly proved a graveyard for many UK investors. But if MEPC's shopping centres do disappoint they are unlikely to inflict much harm. The share issue will represent less than 6 per cent of its enlarged equity base. Besides, MEPC's shares - like those of most other property companies - are currently so highly rated that it would be a challenge to buy anything that did not enhance earnings and assets per share. That raises the suspicion that similar deals may follow. But it will be difficult to find many pension funds willing to sell properties at a discount to net asset value in exchange for paper which trades at a premium.</p>

Brody had been determined to have  an inoperable brain tumor.  </P> <P> The family of Brody, who worked as an electronics engineer at Edwards Air Force  Base for three years, was angry over the government's refusal to fly Brody to  Norwood, Mass., where he grew up. Air Force officials said regulations  prohibited granting the request because he was a civilian.  </P></p>

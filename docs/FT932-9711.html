			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (8): Negligent neighbours - Environmental Issues As trucks carry goods back and forth across the international bridges, cities on both sides of the US-Mexican border suffer from the same smog, fed by the same idling traffic. Hazardous wastes dumped near the border by factories seep into the groundwater, contaminating goods sold in both countries. The Rio Grande is the main source of drinking water for Texans in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. But every day Mexicans use the river as a depository for raw sewage. Environmental negligence is linking the two neighbours ever more closely as each year passes and, as the American Medical Association recently noted, the unchecked pollution is 'seriously threatening health and future economic vitality on both sides of the border.' If the North American Free Trade Agreement fails to win approval by the US Congress, there is little hope that the hazards growing out of Mexico's industrialisation will be soon be addressed. Billions of dollars are needed for the clean-up and, on the Mexican side, for inspectors and their training. Both governments' budgets already are stretched. The Nafta is expected to accelerate foreign investment and Mexico's industrialisation. Much of this could be in 'dirty' industries. A 1991 World Bank report found that between 1981 and 1989 about one-tenth of Mexico's export earnings were derived from pollution-intensive products such as cement, chemicals, pulp, paper, and petroleum. Yet, supporters of the Nafta argue, only increased economic development will provide funds for the clean-up and enforcement of environmental standards. The debate over Nafta is dominated by suspicion and mistrust on both sides. Proponents of the pact believe that labour has taken up environmentalism because it is more intellectually respectable than protectionism. President Clinton's proposal to address the issue by creating a tri-national environmental commission in a side agreement has 'the potential to undo much of the good created by the Nafta,' says the conservative Heritage Foundation. Protectionists will seize on the side pacts 'as vehicles by which to reintroduce the trade restrictions Nafta is intended to eliminate.' Opponents of the Nafta portray it as a pact with the devil - an undemocratic government - made on behalf of heartless multinational corporations which have no other objectives but to exploit Mexican resources and workers. They say that is all very well to promise that Nafta will raise money for a clean-up, but that it is necessary to identify a fund-raising mechanism - such as a cross-border tax - to ensure that the money for a clean-up is there. Pro-Nafta groups are adamantly opposed to a border tax and the Clinton administration also does not like it much. Officials say it will raise only Dollars 300m a year and raise tariffs, which are scheduled to be cut to zero, by an average 40 per cent. What is lacking in Mexico is not strong environmental law but environmental enforcement. For example, a recent study by the US General Accounting Office found that none of six US majority-owed maquiladoras - manufacturing plants that assemble components imported tax-free for re-export - studied had prepared the environmental impact assessment required under Mexican law. In the supplemental agreement now being negotiated, the Clinton administration is trying to find an acceptable middle ground to improve enforcement. But much is being demanded by influential members of Congress who carefully tend their green credentials. And most of the business lobby would like nothing to emerge from the current talks with Mexico and Canada. The environmentalists want to establish a strong formal commission composed of the three countries' environmental ministers and an independent secretariat with environmental expertise. Its operations would be transparent and experts would play a strong role in the decisions. Each country would enforce its own environmental standards. Mexico would allow its citizens to go to court if enforcement lagged. Corporate polluters could be punished after a dispute settlement process or through trade sanctions. The environmentalists insist that nothing be allowed to weaken local, state or regional environmental standards. Countries must be allowed to restrict trade if it is produced through environmentally destructive processes such as the drift nets used to catch tuna, which also catch dolphin. Environmental measures would be judged as trade barriers only if the decision-making process and justification for a contested measure is 'arbitrary and capricious' and intended to discriminate against a foreign product. Thus far, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade Representative, has been reluctant on most of these points. He worries that a strong environmental panel would require the three governments to yield national sovereignty to a non-national body. This sovereignty argument was addressed by the Canadian-American Committee in a book of essays entitled Ties Beyond Trade.* It pointed out that all international agreements have binding commitments affecting sovereignty, but these intrusions have become acceptable over time. 'Plainly, setting tariffs is as much a sovereign act as specifying product standards or offering subsidies, and Gatt tariff bindings and disciplines on non-trade barriers are an intrusion into national sovereignty,' it says. 'Constraint on sovereign powers is the price that national governments have accepted in return for the economic benefits created by increased access to foreign markets and specialisation among countries.' However, there is no consensus view yet on the level of interference to be allowed in subverting domestic sovereignty over environmental laws. However, says Ties Beyond Trade, this debate is 'no more and no less an affront to Mexican sovereignty than Mexican efforts to seek constraints on US and Canadian application of dumping and other trade remedy laws would be an affront to US and Canadian sovereignty.' *Ties Beyond Trade, Labour and Environmental Issues under the Nafta.

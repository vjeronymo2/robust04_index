			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] (Main theses were presented and distributed  04-09-93 at a meeting of the Interbranch Commission on Problems  of Continuing Operation of the ChAES [Chernobyl AES]; the  Commission had been organized on assignment of the Cabinet of  Ukraine No. 15083/64 of 11-16-92).The ChAES administration  substantiates the possibility and feasibility of continuing the  operation of the ChAES based mainly on the following three  factors:1) economic inexpediency of decommissioning the ChAES;  2) a sufficient safety level; and 3) the human factor.Therefore  one must evaluate all pro and contra factors within the context  of these three categories.I. Economic  Considerations.In regards to economic arguments for  continuing the operation of ChAES one should note that when  providing economic justification of continuing the operation the  principle aspect is determining potential economic losses caused  by possible heavy accidents at the ChAES.Taking into account the  current economic conditions, liquidation of potential accident  effects of an even substantially lower scale compared to the  1986 accident will result in disproportionately large direct  economic losses. Under these circumstances it is hard even to  estimate the blow to the national economy.It is worth noting  that the absence of established in advance criteria of economic,  organizational and technological acceptability and the risk of  continuing the ChAES operation, which would provide an  appropriate gauge for a skilled analysis of the factors under  consideration, does not make possible an unambiguous assessment  of continuing the ChAES operation.II. Safety Level  ChAEs administration justifies sufficiency of the safety level  mainly by the large number of safety improving measures taken  after 1986. But in doing so the basic deficiencies of RBMK [the  type of ChAES reactors] have not been eliminated, namely:  the absence of a localization system for the upper  (steam water) section of reactor pipelines; as a result, in the  case of a certain accident (rupture of the PVK [expansion not  given], separator drum and/or steam lines to the GZZ [expansion  not given]) an indeterminate amount of radioactive heat transfer  agent can be released into the environment. In addition, such  accident leads to a loss of the heat transfer agent and can  result in drying the fuel core with all accompanying  consequences;) the reactor vulnerability to ruptures  of technological channels (according to calculations performed  by the Chief Designer the localization system was designed for  rupture of not more than two to three channels, and independent  experts surmise the possibility of the mechanism of a chain-like  increase of the number of TK [expansion not given] ruptures  after a rupture of one channel); such accident is analogous to  the 1986 accident; vulnerability of the steel  zirconium joints in technological channels to temperature  fluctuations and their uncertain behavior in the case of thermal  shocks (for instance, a false or prearranged operation of the  SAOR [expansion not given] system); low quality and  reliability of the equipment, especially of shutoff and control  valves and the ``SKALA'' computing control system (the service  life of the latter had been used up long ago); the  absence of protection of safety important equipment from  negative environmental factors (temperature, humidity and impact  loads), which makes this equipment vulnerable in accident  situations; the absence of physical separation of  power supply cables for standby equipment of safety and safety  important systems and separation of power and control cable  flows; inefficiency of the generator room  fire-fighting system and vulnerability of design solutions  related to placement of safety important systems in the  generator room; a large number if welded joints in  the first loop (KMPTs [expansion not given] and the absence of  state-of-the-art diagnostic systems.In addition, the  insufficient current safety level is substantially affected by  the following factors: unsatisfactory level of the  safety culture, which is indicated by a large number of  additional failures and defects detected during scheduled  simulated accident situations; miscalculations of the  existing system of providing corrective actions based on results  of investigation of incidents and accident situations; this was  noted by the IAEA expert ASSET mission based on results of  investigating the circumstances of the 1991 fire of the second  unit. Human FactorFrom the standpoint of social  factors and the problem of employment of highly skilled  personnel, continuing the operation to 1997 will not eliminate  the problem in principle it will only postpone it for some  time.Under these conditions and taking into account predominant  safety considerations when considering the problem of stopping  the CHAES operation, one should consider the availability of a  large number of skilled personnel within a different context,  namely, as a positive factor which can solve the problem of  manning new units of AES with VVER 1000 [reactor type] if a  substantiated decision is made to stop the moratorium on their  commissioning.Based on the above arguments, Minpryrody considers  the substantiation of the possibility of continuing the  operation of the Chernobyl AES insufficient and the Supreme  Soviet decision regarding decommissioning of the Chernobyl AES  inexpedient.``UKRAYINSKA GAZETA''. By publishing a  selection of documents related to continuing operation of the  Chernobyl AES we are hoping to inform our readers about the  Acting Prime Minister's response as to the position of both  sides, as well as to receive a clear Minpryrody answer as to  what to do with our AES and how to do it.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investor caution follows NZ polls shock - A suddenly listless equity market The New Zealand stock market is taking its time to recover from a severe blow received following this month's general elections. Inspired by opinion polls, it had been expecting the National Party to win handsomely on November 6. The polls had also been predicting a possible continuation of the Westminster style first past the post (FPP) voting system. Businessmen whose identities are still secret had invested millions in a massive advertising campaign which had warned everyone of the dangers of abandoning FPP. After the election, the initial reaction was that the business community had got the worst of all outcomes. Not only had voters overwhelmingly endorsed the German mixed member proportional (MMP) system, but it seemed as if a minority National government would have to rely on the left wing Alliance Party to govern, creating ongoing uncertainties. The NZSE-40 index, which had hit a four-year high of 2,203.09 three days before the election, dropped 7.6 per cent to 2,009.89 in the week following the poll, as interest rates soared and the exchange rate dipped. Ten days later a recount gave National a narrow, one-seat parliamentary majority, but the subsequent rebound in equities was then worn away, partly by weaker offshore markets and some selling by international investors. Yesterday the index staged a minor rally, rising 13.63 to 2,058.43. A key reason for the listless trading has been Prime Minister Jim Bolger's refusal to confirm whether the hard line reformist finance minister, Ms Ruth Richardson, would be reappointed, or whether her job will be given to the moderate, Mr Wyatt Creech, who is more acceptable to opposition parties in the perilously balanced parliament. The new cabinet is expected to be announced tomorrow, or on Monday. The business community is divided over how vital Ms Richardson's reappointment will be. It is believed that the new political situation may have removed any scope for further reforms. However, it is accepted that Ms Richardson is wanted as finance minister by overseas investors. Mr Nigel Hale, the Asian investment director of UK based Invesco, got headlines in the press yesterday by saying that his company would have 'to look at its investments in New Zealand' if Ms Richardson was not reappointed. He said that his fund was full of admiration for what had been achieved by the New Zealand reforms. The domestic and international uncertainties are tending to obscure positive economic news. Mr Bolger's recent series of meetings with US President Bill Clinton marked an important breakthrough in the eight-year rupture in relations between the two countries over New Zealand's anti-nuclear ships issue, and the meetings are seen as healing the political rift. Exporters say this will help trade with a key export partner. The latest trade figures, released yesterday, showed a further improvement; the inflation outlook remains low, business confidence is high and statistics show a growth in employment. GDP growth is running at its highest level since 1985. Most analysts are predicting that corporate profitability, which improved markedly this year, will continue to improve, helped by minimal growth in wages and inflation, and by rising confidence. Most export commodity prices are high, especially sheep meat and forestry. In the short term the market is expected to be wary of changing sentiment towards equities abroad, especially on Wall Street following substantial US investment in New Zealand shares in recent years. An estimated 35 per cent of the market is now held by US investors, and their attitude to New Zealand recovery is seen as crucial. Broadly there is confidence that the market is stable at current levels, given the Reserve Bank Act's removal of the setting of monetary policy from politicians, and the outlook for improving corporate profits. New Zealand would be a principal beneficiary from any resolution of the GATT round. Mr Kevyn Rendell of CS First Boston says that the market may mark time until early next year - when the next round of corporate results are expected to confirm the continuing improvement in business and economic fundamentals which is believed to be occurring.</p>

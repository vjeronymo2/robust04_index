Spero, U.S. under secretary  of state for economic and agricultural affairs, speaking on the  Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, said: "There are priority  areas such as government procurement, automobiles, and auto  parts. After enactment of the political reform bills, we would  like the Japanese Government to shift its attention and work on  these priorities." She made the request during a meeting with  Yukio Hatoyama, deputy chief cabinet secretary, at the prime  minister's official residence on the same day.    In response, Hatoyama, while maintaining that setting  numerical targets is unacceptable, said: "I feel that it is  possible for Japan and the United States to hold talks to work  out something that is acceptable to both sides."</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Argyll shows 15% advance to Pounds 205m - Plenty of rooom seen for growth in increasingly competitive market place ARGYLL GROUP, the Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost food retailer, raised interim pre-tax profits by 15 per cent from Pounds 178m to Pounds 205m - at the top end of analysts' expectations. The shares fell 8p to 365p as investors took profits. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said there was still a lot of growth left in the food retail sector, although it was an 'increasingly competitive marketplace.' The group expects 'another year of pleasing profit growth,' subject to satisfactory trading at Christmas. The interim dividend is increased to 3.55p (3.2p) on earnings per share of 13.3p (12.1p). Sales in the 28 weeks to October 10 rose 6 per cent to Pounds 2.84bn (Pounds 2.68bn), though the rise was about 8 per cent excluding businesses sold last year. Operating profits were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 183m (Pounds 162m), with the margin on sales excluding VAT rising from 6.4 to 6.9 per cent. Interest receivable rose by Pounds 6m to Pounds 22.3m. The pre-tax figure included a loss of Pounds 400,000 on property, compared to a profit of Pounds 2m. Safeway accounted for 79 per cent of sales and 85 per cent of operating profits. These proportions have grown from 37 and 39 per cent respectively since its acquisition in 1987. In the half year, Safeway sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn. Of this increase 7.3 percentage points came from new stores. In comparable stores 2.1 percentage points were accounted for by inflation and the other 1 point by added volume. Operating profits from Safeway rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 155m (Pounds 128m), and the margin from 6.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent. Selling area has increasing from 2m sq ft in 1987 to a projected 7m by next March. Eight new stores opened in the first half and a further 18 are due in the second half. Mr David Webster, deputy chairman, said Safeway stores under 20,000 sq ft achieved a margin of 6.6 per cent, while the larger ones achieved 7.9 per cent. The smaller stores were mainly older ones, and were thus making a good return on capital. Stores being built would cost an average of Pounds 13.3m each in the current year, although this would rise to Pounds 16.3m the following year. These investments are thought to be substantially lower than Safeway's main rivals. Sir Alistair said the aim was to build a few 'blockbuster' stores each year, costing substantially more than the average. Argyll is paying an average of Pounds 3.4m for a site, rising to an expected Pounds 5.8m in the next financial year. But it recently bought a site in Edinburgh at a price estimated by some at Pounds 30m. While expansion of the Safeway chain would continue, investment was being stepped up in Presto and Lo-Cost stores, Sir Alistair said. Group capital expenditure was Pounds 226m in the first half and a figure of Pounds 600m is forecast for the year, rising to Pounds 650m in 1993-94, likely to be the peak year in real terms. The balance sheet had net cash of Pounds 179.5m at the half year end, after an outflow of Pounds 20m. Mr Colin Smith, finance director, said there would be net debt of about Pounds 50m by the March year end. See Lex</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / German blow for machine tools GERMAN machine tool makers are poised to make further inroads into the depressed UK market following the creation of a global strategic alliance between Traub and Maho, two of Germany's biggest producers. The announcement last week that the two companies are to merge their sales forces worldwide is likely to put further pressure on UK machine tool producers by strengthening the German companies' sales opportunities in the UK. The deal, under discussion throughout this year, comes less than two months after Gildemeister and Deckel, two other big German producers, announced they were forming a worldwide joint venture to market their products. Both deals take effect on January 1. Maho and Deckel, meanwhile, are discussing co-operation in manufacturing. The sales links mean that four of the biggest German producers are now grouped into two powerful combines, each with both milling and turning machines to offer a broader range to customers. 'It's got to increase our share of the UK market,' said Mr Paul Maynard, Traub's UK managing director, who will become UK managing director of the two companies. Maho, in particular, would have a substantially increased direct sales force. Germany was the biggest exporter of machine tools to the UK last year, with sales of Pounds 149.1m out of total imports of Pounds 451.2m. This compares with total UK machine tool consumption last year of Pounds 773.2m. The two new groupings will be competitors for each other, and for Japanese companies such as Yamazaki and Mori Seiki. Traub and Maho will retain their legal independence and will still operate from their bases in Wembley and Coventry, but are considering moving to a single site.</p>

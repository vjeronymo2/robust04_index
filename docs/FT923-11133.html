			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Press for pensions accounts Sir, Having read the letters in your journal concerning the failures of the professionals involved in the pensions industry, together with the many suggestions for solutions, perhaps I could offer yet another. Government reviews take a long time and during this period of delay little will change unless members of existing pensions funds take up the initiative. The 'wealth' of some pension funds is often more than the value of the company that has appointed the trustees, who are often the owners in control both of the company and their employees' future . All companies with a pension fund should volunteer to make available an audited copy of their pension fund accounts. Any company that does not should be pressed by the pension scheme members to provide this information to which they are entitled by existing law. Perhaps if this programme gathered momentum those concerned would suffer less. Clive Nathan, Postfach 1611, D-W-8990 Lindau (B), Germany</p>

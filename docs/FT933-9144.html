			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Observer: Family affairs Is Sir James Goldsmith's family more important than the Rothschilds? This seems to be the sub-text to the news that the billionaire financier has commissioned Anthony Allfrey, a retired political consultant, to pen a history of the Goldsmith dynasty. Allfrey, whose book on King Edward VII and his Jewish Court was well reviewed, admits that Sir James is paying for the research but says that he has been given an entirely free hand to investigate a family which stretches back over 500 years. Since there are already two biographies of Sir James himself, Allfrey's patron will not merit much attention. Even so, it promises to be an upbeat work. 'There are bound to be bad apples in any barrel,' says Allfrey, 'but I haven't found any.' It sounds like an ego trip but then the Goldsmiths are not alone. The Warburgs, for example, might be new boys on the block but they were upset by Jacques Attali's portrayal of their affairs, and have bent over backwards to help Ron Chernow, award-winning author of The House of Morgan, with a more sympathetic book on the Warburg dynasty.</p>

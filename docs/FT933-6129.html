			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: US cautious on peace hopes THE US remains outwardly cautious about the prospects for a preliminary self-rule agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but US officials are more excited than they have been for some time about the chances of a breakthrough in the peace process. As delegates gathered in Washington for the 11th round of Middle East talks, President Bill Clinton warned that apparent good news had often turned into disappointment. 'We've still got a long way to go,' he said. Mr Clinton said he could not comment until progress was more concrete. He said: 'I don't know if I would call it an intervention, but we have certainly worked hard to be a handmaiden, or whatever the appropriate term is. We are involved, but our position is not at issue here and should not be discussed until the parties themselves work out their differences.' State Department officials, however, said that a meeting in California on Friday between Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, had made it clear that 'the parties are focused on choices that could produce real progress'. Mr Christopher's aides are clearly elated at the possibility that their boss, who has been vilified in the US press over his handling of the Bosnia crisis as a passive and unprincipled administrator, might score a diplomatic victory. Officials told the New York Times that it was Mr Christopher's trip to the Middle East at the beginning of this month that gave new momentum to the peace talks. 'They needed the US to stimulate things. They have all needed an awful lot of assurance and hand-holding from the US,' the newspaper reported a US official as saying. Mr Christopher's trip turned into an exercise in damage control, as he sought to negotiate an end to Israel's assault on southern Lebanon, and even his aides found little heart to defend his confident assertion that the fighting in Lebanon had in fact 'given a new burst of energy to the negotiations'. US officials said that the crucial success of the trip was in persuading President Hafez al Assad of Syria to advance talks with Israel on the future of the Golan Heights. They suggested that this might have encouraged Mr Yassir Arafat and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation to participate more actively in talks with Israel. This explanation is not universally shared in Washington, however. 'The main pressures on Arafat are financial. The people who have leaned on him are the Saudis and the Egyptians,' said Dr Michael Hudson, professor of Arab studies at Georgetown University. Dr Hudson warned that Israel's proposal to give the Palestinians limited self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip faced serious opposition among Palestinians in the occupied territories, and not just in the militant Hamas movement. 'Much depends on how the US interprets its role as a full partner in the peace process, and how far they are willing to go to make sure this is not the last stop on the road,' he said.</p>

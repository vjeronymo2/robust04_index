			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DETECTIVE KUSTER  </P> <P> I would like to take this opportunity to thank The Times for the tributes paid  my husband, Detective Russell Kuster. I would also like to thank all the many  friends and strangers who have sent cards, flowers and donations to the Russell  Kuster Foundation and the Los Angeles Police Memorial Fund.  </P> <P> My thanks, also, to Chief Daryl Gates who, I think, dies a little himself every  time he loses one of his policemen, and my thanks as well to the entire police  network. They have been my lifeline.  </P> <P> My Russ was my heart. This man, who described himself as a "simple, basic man,"  was passionate in his love for his family, friends, Police Department and his  country. Wasn't everyone?  </P> <P> I recently received a letter from a reporter who had interviewed Russ about a  case he was working on. He said he asked Russ if he was ever afraid for his  life. Russ' response was, "I would rather give my life than be afraid to give  it." That was Russ.  </P> <P> He was the bravest man I ever knew -- he was always my hero! My thanks again to  all the caring people. Care enough and maybe it won't have to happen again.  </P> <P> SUE KUSTER  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

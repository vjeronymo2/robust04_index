			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television Although there has recently been considerable rainfall (in London, anyway) the long term outlook for water supplies in south-east England seems pretty dismal. Channel 4's often excellent documentary series Dispatches goes underground to inspect the damage to reserves and discovers falling water tables, polluted bore holes and dried up wells. The programme suggests that the privatised water companies do not see conservation as part of their role. BBC2 continues the repeat of its outstanding 1985 drama serial Edge Of Darkness which, in the words of its producer Michael Wearing, is 'a thriller set in the world of political power' with 'reminders of the John Buchan tradition' in which a man finds himself 'alone against an unfathomable system': the essence of so many memorable works of fiction (9.25). BBC1's documentary series Inside Story returns (9.30) with a programme called 'Why Women Kill'. Women in American prisons explain how they were 'pushed beyond the limits of endurance' and 'ended the lives of their abusers' ..or murdered them, as the politically incorrect would say.</p>

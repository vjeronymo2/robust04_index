			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark board considers bids THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark, the family-owned shoe manufacturer riven by shareholder dissension, met yesterday to consider several bids for the company, believed to be pitched at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m. A decision on which offer will be recommended by the board is expected to be announced in about two weeks, along with the group's annual results. These are expected to show a slight improvement. One bidder is a consortium of investors including existing institutional shareholders and Electra Investment Trust. Other interested parties are believed to include FII, the UK footwear manufacturer, and Berisford, the food and property group. Neither Berisford nor FII would confirm or deny involvement in the bid process. Electra was unavailable for comment. Speculation has centred on offers of between 180p and 220p per share. At 200p, Clark's would be valued at Pounds 154m. C&amp;J Clark put itself up for sale in December following an acrimonious boardroom row over development strategy. The dispute was triggered by a bid approach from consultant Mr Colin Fisher and backed by Electra. The four board rebels - led by Mr Lance Clark - who sought to unseat the chairman Mr Walter Dickson and director Mr James Power last year are expected to oppose a sale unless the price comes in at the top end of the range. It is believed they want to retain family control of the business, but would be unable to refuse a high enough price. The decision to put the company on the open market was part of a truce agreed with the rebels last October. The bid process began in December when Clark's set up a committee to review offers. Clark's said the board had met five potential bidders. However, sources close to the tender said that only three bids had been tabled. It is known that many members of the 500-strong Clark family, which controls 70 per cent of the private group, would be keen to sell their shares. Many of them, dependent for their livelihood on the company's dividend payments and hard hit by Lloyds' losses, were shocked when depressed trading and losses forced the group to slash the interim payout by 50 per cent. In the six months to July, Clark recorded a Pounds 3.5m pre-tax loss on sales of Pounds 285.1m.</p>

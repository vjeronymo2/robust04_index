			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'ROCKY' COMES RAPPING AT E. A. POE'S DOOR  </P> <P> "Suddenly there came a tapping, as if someone gently rapping, rapping at my  chamber door." Yo.  </P> <P> Edgar Allan Poe, meet Sylvester Stallone.  </P> <P> Stallone took a detour during filming of "Rocky V" to visit the Edgar Allan Poe  National Historic Site, a house where the poet and short-story writer lived for  two years.  </P> <P> Park ranger Joelle Wagner said last week that she answered a knock at the  locked front door Feb. 12 to find the creator of movie hero Rocky Balboa on the  doorstep with co-star Talia Shire and a bodyguard.  </P> <P> "I was flabbergasted," she said. "I had to take a few moments to compose  myself."  </P> <P> As the group toured the three-story structure, one of four houses Poe rented  while living in Philadelphia from 1838 to 1844, Stallone told Wagner he had  written a movie script about the author of the poem "The Raven."  </P> <P> "He's just in awe of Poe," Wagner said. "He said he really admired him."  </P> <P> Stallone, the lead in such action movies as "Rambo" and "Tango and Cash," did  not say if he wanted to portray Poe, she said.  </P> <P> Among Poe's works are "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Black Cat," and  "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," which established the mystery or detective  short-story form.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (6): Big clean-up effort is under way - The Environment TAIWAN is paying the price for failing, until recently, to address environmental problems during its rush to industrialisation. 'We started late,' admits Lung-Sheng Chang, head of Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration. Evidence of unregulated pollution is all too apparent on the streets of Taipei. Rubbish collects on pavements and in back alleys. On a hot and humid evening, the smell of sewage is pervasive in the older parts of the city and the air is yellowed by a seemingly permanent pall of smog. A big clean up effort is under way, amid mounting public pressure. Last year Taiwan's spent more than Dollars 22bn on environmental protection, with similar spending expected to continue for the next five to six years. 'We have come to realise that economic development is not, in itself, our goal. Our aim is to raise the quality of life of our people, says Mr Chang. 'Unless we clean up air, water and solid waste pollution, then growth in the gross national product or per capita income becomes meaningless.' Last year a constitutional amendment revised the republic's public spending priorities to rank environmental protection and ecological conservation along with economic development. Yet the problems created by Taiwan's rapid economic growth are immense. Rising incomes have enabled millions of Taiwanese to buy cars and motorcycles. With a population of just over 20m, Taiwan boasts 4m motor vehicles and 10m motorcycles. In the past 12 months, 500,000 new cars and almost 1m new motorcycles crammed on to the already heavily congested city streets. High levels of vehicle emissions are accentuated by bumper-to-bumper traffic jams. 'We have double digit growth in motor vehicles per year, but less than a one per cent increase in parking spaces and road area,' says Mr Chang. To combat air pollution, Taiwan has adopted the tightest emission regulations for motorcycles in the world, and is matching California's exacting standards for car emissions. More than half of petrol consumed is now lead-free and the EPA has a target of phasing out leaded petrol by 1999. Initial results are encouraging. Last year the number of days when air quality in Taipei remained within acceptable standards increased by 5 per cent to more than 88 per cent. Lead content in the air was reduced by 90 per cent last year. Consideration is also being given to 'pollution taxes' on petrol. 'Our gas prices are very low,' says Mr Chang. 'We are encouraging our people to use the gasoline.' Yet proposals for an increased tax on petrol are controversial because of fears that it could fuel inflation and have a negative impact on the economy. Enforcing anti-pollution measures is difficult, especially when they conflict with business interests, Mr Chang says. Industrial development plans, for example, are now subject to strict environmental impact reviews, severely restricting waste disposal and emissions. But business executives complain that environmental rules are too harsh, increase costs and place them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets. Water pollution is another serious problem in Taiwan. Less than 8 per cent of the population has sewage processing service. Even in Taipei, only 18 per cent of sewage is fully treated. The rest is funneled into river beds, creating a health hazard. The problem has become particularly acute over recent months because Taiwan is suffering a drought. Heavy rainfall during the typhoon season normally flushes the river beds, carrying waste out to sea. Construction of a metropolitan sewage treatment plant costing NTDollars 1bn has begun, but is not expected to be completed for another two years. Government plans call for a huge expenditure of NTDollars 100bn on sewage treatment systems throughout the island over the next seven years. Yet local government agencies, which are required to raise half the cost of treatment plants for their districts - mostly through higher local taxes, have been less than enthusiastic. Local politicians put higher priority on more visible public works, such as the construction of roads and bridges, Mr Chang explains. In an effort to push the projects forward, the EPA has proposed that the national government increase its share of the cost to 70 per cent, lowering the burden on the regions. While the public seems ambivalent towards the sewage treatment problem, proper disposal of household and solid industrial waste has become an issue of widespread concern. 'The people are demanding that we clean up the streets,' says Mr Chang. The Taiwanese government plans to build 22 large scale 'resource recovery' waste incinerators at a cost of NTDollars 100bn that will process more than 80 per cent of household waste and produce electric power in the process. One incinerator in Taipei is already operating and contracts for the construction of six more will be put out to public tender by the end of the year. Taiwan is also buying many garbage collection and street cleaning trucks. 'We are making quite a lot of progress and we believe that within five years our solid waste problem will be solved,' says Mr Chang. Education is another important element of Taiwan's environmental efforts. A schools programme has been so successful that children have become the 'Red Guards' of the environment, Mr Chang says. Recycling is on the rise, with Taiwan leading the world in the recycling of waste paper. 'We have a long tradition of valuing and re-using paper,' Mr Chang explains. Fifty five per cent of waste paper was recycled in Taiwan last year. Although the primary thrust of Taiwan's environmental policies is to address its domestic problems, the republic is also keen to play a role in international environmental efforts by encouraging neighbouring developing Asian countries to recognise the importance of environmental protection before they encounter the problems faced by Taiwan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sermon by Minister of Religious Affairs Sassi Lamouri in </F> Algiers on 20 June--recorded]    [Excerpts] I beseech God's refuge from the curses of the  damned satan. In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. May God's prayers and peace be upon the noblest  of prophets, his family, companions and followers until the day  of judgement.    I would like to salute the whole Algerian people on the  occasion of this blessed day, which falls at the beginning of  the new Hegira year 1415. I wish that new Hegira year will be a  generous year; a year of blessing, concord, unity, compassion  between members of this great people. [passage omitted]    The prophet, may God's prayers and peace be upon him, showed  so much compassion to people. And that is why the message of  Islam is one of compassion. The proof of that is the fact that  the holy Koran's suras, and there are 114 of them, all begin all  with the phrase: In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. This is a good indication for all wise men that  the essence of this religion is compassion between humans. All  godly religions were meant for sowing the seeds of compassion  and peace between people, however.    We are facing in Algeria the most difficult period in our  history. We are facing a period that requires us to exert  united efforts, forget about grudges and rancor, and extend  hands to each other so as to bring about unity, close our ranks,  and bolster fraternity which Islam has called for. [passage  omitted]    I am speaking in my capacity as religious affairs' minister.  I have a duty toward my religion and my dear homeland which  will make me proud the day I see it enjoying security and  stability. I will raise my head high the day I see my country  enjoying unity and closed ranks. It is my duty as a man of  religion and a minister for religious affairs to say the words  of truth. [passage omitted]    The Algerian nation is going through one of the most  difficult periods. The wise men in it must endeavor to do good  and call the unjust people by their names because injustice is a  sin. [passage omitted]    People, being misled from overseas and other places, come to  kill families and slaughter children while the people and the  nation are keeping silent. This is unacceptable from a  religious point of view. It is unacceptable from a religious  point view that families and children are slaughtered while the  nation is keeping silent. This is injustice. This is injustice.  [passage omitted]    Therefore, there is probably a deception in what we are  witnessing in the country. There is deception in the name of  religion. I am telling you that had the prophet been revived,  he would have disclaimed these acts. [passage omitted]    Muhammad, may God's Peace be upon him, did not shed any  blood  nor did he kill anybody, on the contrary he was compassionate.  [passage omitted]    This proves than Islam is a religion of compassion and a  religion of brotherhood; therefore if there is any deception in  the name of religion Islam is innocent of it. Even those who  claim that they speak in the name of religion or in the name of  democracy or any other slogan are mistaken. [passage omitted]    Wise men stand in closed ranks and put an end to bloodshed  and put an end to this raging fire which might spread  everywhere. [Passage omitted]    Therefore, the Islamic religion clears itself from killing  and bloodshed. Islam brought with it compassion, brotherhood,  love, unity, and closing ranks. This is Islam. This is Islam.    This [present situation] could merely be a passing cloud.  But woe unto those who have betrayed their country. Woe unto  people who have betrayed their country. Nothing will last  forever. This is merely a summer cloud that will pass soon.    Thanks be to God the ship is nearly arriving safely at its  destination. The ship is nearly at a safe harbor. Today's  events will be a thing of the past. And one must say the truth  in these very harsh circumstances because any nation which does  not stand for the truth will have no history. And it is,  therefore, the responsibility of the people as the prophet said:  You are all responsible; everyone of you ought to shoulder the  burden of its responsibilities. Hence, everyone of us ought to  shoulder his responsibility. Those who have gone astray should  return to the righteous path, accept to live with this society  and lay down their arms.    To take up arms against the sons of your nation is a crime  which will never be forgiven. Taking to arms is an unforgivable  crime. Even if we punish those people in accordance with the  shari'ah, the shari'ah has ruled: This is the recompense of  those who fight against God and His messenger, and hasten about  the earth, to do corruption there: They will be slaughtered, or  crucified, or their hands and feet will alternately be struck  off, or they will be banished from the land. That is a  degradation for them in this world; and in the world to come  awaits them a mighty chastisement.    This is [the punishment] for those who have taken to arms,  broken with community, are harming the unity of the nation, and  terrorize its members.    Do we have to make people cry every day? Do we have to  terrorize families everyday? Do we have to make children,  women, elderly, and poor people die with fear and terror? Why?  Why all this? Is not there among you someone who is wise  enough?    I am aware that there are people who can help to stop this  bloodshed; but they have so far been very mean. However, it is  their duty to make an effort and put the fire out. It is their  duty to put the fire out. Algeria is for everyone. No one  should be worried about the state of Islam in Algeria. Islam in  Algeria is doing fine. [passage omitted]    I speak the truth and we should not be reluctant to assume  our responsibilities. [passage omitted] The people are  responsible and the Prophet holds you responsible. We are  celebrating the religious festival of 'Ashura, and I wish that  this day will make tomorrow the last day of misfortunes in  Algeria's history. I say to those who have gone astray and have  erred: Lay down your arms, lay down your arms and live in  society a happy and good life. Islam prohibits this and  prohibits killings. Let me say this for the record: Islam is  against the shedding of blood.    I say this and I ask God's forgiveness for you and myself,  for God is much-forgiving and compassionate. May God's peace  and blessings be upon you.</p>

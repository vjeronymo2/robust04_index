			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Brazil expected to limit issue of new currency Brazil's central bank is likely to be limited to issuing Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.9bn) of the country's new currency, the real, between its launch on Friday and April next year. The limit is one of the key mechanisms the government hopes will prevent inflation creeping into the new currency. In the past, governments have relied on printing increasing amounts of currency to pay debts, leading to inflationary spirals. The government is still finalising the details of the currency launch, which it will announce later this week. However, it has already said the real will be linked at parity to the US dollar for an 'indeterminate' time. It is also expected that the Dollars 9bn limit, as well as interim three-monthly targets, will be set in law and monitored by a strengthened National Monetary Council, a body of senior Ministry of Finance and central bank officials. The present monetary base is very low at about Dollars 3.5bn, reflecting the effects of inflation of nearly 50 per cent a month on the local currency, which has seen the value of notes and coins decline steadily in dollar terms. However, if inflation falls when the new currency is introduced, as is widely expected, the dollar value of the notes and coins in circulation is likely to be far greater than at present. 'The limits are difficult because they can't be too tight nor too lax, otherwise you run into credibility problems,' according to Mr Pedro Malan, central bank president. To allow for short-term problems, the law is likely to let the bank relax issue limits for one-month periods. However, any breach of the limits would have to be corrected later. The law creating the new currency is also likely to contain a reference to gradually increasing the autonomy of the central bank, a move it has been seeking for some months. However, it is unclear how substantial these reforms will be, especially since the often populist President Itamar Franco is suspicious of the bank and its policy of keeping interest rates high.

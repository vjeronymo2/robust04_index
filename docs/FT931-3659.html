			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Farmers fearful of a ministerial sea change: Coastline policy that could lead to loss of land THE tides which threatened coastal fields this week added to a concern which will not recede so quickly. Some farmers fear their land could be abandoned to the sea following a review by the Ministry of Agriculture which called for a more 'environmental' policy to protect the coastline. At stake are the sea walls and other shore defences which protect more than 1,250km of the coast - mostly around East Anglia, which is particularly vulnerable to flooding as the coastline is gradually sinking into the sea. More than 1,000km of these defences are maintained by the National Rivers Authority or local authorities, with financial support from the Ministry of Agriculture. In Essex alone, 36,053 acres of low-lying farmland are protected in this way. But a statement by Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, that 'in some areas setting back the line of defence might be the most effective coastal defence option' suggests the ministry may abandon some of the more isolated  -and expensive - stretches of sea wall. The ministry insists that the proposal stems from a desire for a more 'environmentally sensitive' policy, using natural defences instead of walls and buffers, and operating programmes of 'managed retreat'. An experiment of letting farmland revert to salt marshes is under way in Essex. 'We are looking at each area on a case-by-case basis,' the ministry said. It insisted that most farmland and all residential areas would be protected. In the 1992-93 financial year the rivers authority spent Pounds 250m on flood defences - Pounds 20m more than the previous year. Some small sea defences cost more to maintain than the land behind them was worth. Mr Mark Dixon, an environmental specialist at the authority, said: 'This is not perceived to be good value for the taxpayer.' He pointed out that in part of East Anglia about Pounds 650 a year was spent protecting each acre of farmland - almost a third of the value of the land. The proposals have been welcomed by environmentalists, but have provoked an angry response from farmers. Mr Brian McLaughlin, head of the National Farmers' Union land use department, said: 'We are not wanting to adopt a 'King Canute' approach but we do not think the government's proposals have been adequately researched.' The union is demanding compensation for farmers if sea defences are abandoned. Mr McLaughlin said that if a field was flooded, neighbouring land was also affected by salt. He added: 'If you remove protection for land you undermine the value of the farmers' main asset in the eyes of the bank.'</p>

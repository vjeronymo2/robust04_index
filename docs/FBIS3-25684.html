The violence, which  erupted alongside a trade union protest at the cost of living,  has claimed at least six lives with the gunning down late  Wednesday of the latest known victim, a corporal in the  parachute regiment, the security forces stated.    Speaking for the government, the daily L'UNION newspaper  charged that the main opposition party led by Paul Mba Abessole  had hijacked the strike for its own ends and was handing out  hunting rifles, other guns and machetes.    Small groups of armed opposition militants continued to man  barricades in outlying districts of Libreville, which were  cordoned off by police and troops, sources close to the security  forces said. The city centre and the seafront, patrolled by  President Omar Bongo's crack guard troops, remained calm,  however, and no trouble was reported from Gabon's traditionally  volatile second city, Port Gentil.    The whereabouts of Abessole, a Roman Catholic priest and  leader of the National Lumberjacks' Rally (RNB) party, were not  clear on Thursday, opposition activists said. Security forces  had Wednesday stormed his house on the outskirts of the capital  after giving chase to opposition activists who had opened fire  on them, government television reported. But an opposition  spokesman told AFP that the RNB leader had not been at home when  the raid took place.    Thursday's press attack on Abessole, whom L'UNION accused of  being "chief of a warmongering band," was the first direct  criticism of the opposition leader by the government paper since  he claimed to have defeated Bongo in presidential elections in  December.    Tension was reported from Oyem, the chief town of the RNB's  stronghold in the northern Woleu-Ntem Province, where opposition  supporters had moved the local transmitter of their  Radio-Liberte. Early Tuesday, security forces destroyed  Radio-Liberte's equipment in Libreville itself, sparking  violence in which an official of Bongo's Democratic Party was  burned to death in his home.    A dozen public and private sector trade unions launched the  strike Monday to push for higher wages following last month's 50  percent devaluation of the CFA franc, the common currency among  14 African countries pegged to the French franc. "But we are a  long way now from devaluation or politics," one analyst said  Wednesday. The "law of the jungle" had taken over in the poorer  districts of Libreville, he added.</p>

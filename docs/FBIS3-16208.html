			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "Duma Ponders President's </F> Message"]    [Text] After a short vacation the State Duma began  discussing the Russian president's message "On Strengthening the  Russian State" right away Friday.    In a rounded and well-composed report Ivan Rybkin, speaker  of  the lower chamber, voiced a largely positive opinion of the  message and called for constructive work based on the  president's proposals. He said that a number of points in the  message "can and should be disputed," but there were obvious  points with which he could not fail to agree. These included  the reform of the Army or, to be more accurate, the deepening  and completion of that reform.    The report was also couched in such a way as to not cause  tremendous dispute either in the center or on the flanks.  Misunderstanding arose only over why the president needed  another memorandum of accord in society when the Duma has  already adopted such a memorandum. Ivan Rybkin explained that  in this case an extra initiative was not an obstacle but an  "added bonus." But it was visible from the reaction in the hall  that the question of whose memorandum is "more valid" is  nonetheless exercising some people in the Duma. Paradoxically  enough Russia may yet see a war of "peace initiatives."  Evidently foreseeing that danger, Ivan Rybkin came up with a  global idea for reconciliation. He proposed convening an  All-Russia congress of all political forces.    The tone of conciliation and cooperation which Rybkin tried  to set in his report seems to have gone unnoticed by many people.    The debate on the president's message is scheduled to fill a  whole working day for the Duma.</p>

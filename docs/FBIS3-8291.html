[Reporter] The SLD leadership and that of the Polish Peasant  Party, at a joint session on Saturday, gave their support to the  candidature of Prof. Rosati, Zbigniew Siemiatkowski said. The  deciding factors were the qualifications of the candidate, his  wide experience, and the fact that he is well known in  international economic circles.

The prime minister is in touch with  our candidate, Siemiatkowski said.    Prof. Rosati has spent the past few days in Warsaw. He is at  present in Geneva, where, for the past three years, he has been  working as an expert for the United Nations at the European  Economic Commission.    Prof. Rosati is to return to Warsaw at the end of the week,  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski said.    Now a few words about the candidate: He is in his forties,  is not a member of any party, and had been a member of the  Polish United Workers Party until its dissolution. He comes  from Radom. He is married, with two children, and has  outstanding qualifications and abilities for these posts,  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski stressed.</p>

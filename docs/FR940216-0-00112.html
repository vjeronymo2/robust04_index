			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By adopting the approach suggested in the comments EPA is in effect adding an ether-only designation to the any-oxygenate designation implicit in EPA's proposal. EPA also is modifying to some extent the oxygen content and type assumptions that refiners must make if they rely on this RBOB designation in determining compliance with the VOC, toxics, and other non-oxygen content requirements of reformulated gasoline. First, refiners and importers that produce or import RBOB are required to designate the RBOB as any-oxygenate RBOB, or as ether-only RBOB. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These designations are in addition to, but must be consistent with, the specifications for the type(s) and amount(s) of oxygenate that must be included in the product transfer documents for RBOB. Second, refiners or importers that do not meet the requirements for a quality assurance program over downstream oxygenate blending, must assume that ethanol is blended with any-oxygenate RBOB, and that MTBE is blended with ether-only RBOB. For both types of RBOB, the refiner or importer must assume that the amount used is that amount sufficient for the gasoline produced to have 2.0 weight percent oxygen, or approximately 5.70 volume percent in the case of ethanol and approximately 10.80 volume percent in the case of MTBE. Refiner or importer oversight of the downstream oxygenate blending operation is not required if a refiner or importer relies on these ``worst case'' assumptions. However, as noted below, these types of RBOB must be segregated from one another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Any oxygenate RBOB must meet all reformulated gasoline standards subsequent to blending with any of the following: ethanol, methanol, butanol, MTBE, TAME, or ETBE. Ether-only RBOB must meet all reformulated gasoline standards subsequent to blending with any of the following: MTBE, TAME, or ETBE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes these assumptions regarding the type of oxygenate used are appropriate. The principal risk to the environment under the oxygen use assumptions is that an oxygenate blender will blend ethanol with ether-only RBOB, which would result in reformulated gasoline that probably would support neither the toxics nor benzene properties claimed by the refiner or importer of the RBOB (due to an insufficient dilution effect), nor, in the case of VOC-controlled gasoline, the claimed RVP nor VOC properties (due to RVP increases from ethanol). On the other hand, any-oxygenate RBOB will be formulated for blending with ethanol, and would only improve for all properties if blended with an ether such as MTBE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several mechanisms will help ensure ethanol is not blended with ether-only RBOB. Ether-only RBOB and any-oxygenate RBOB must be segregated throughout the distribution system to the point of oxygenate blending. The product transfer documents will identify ether-only RBOB as such, which will put each person in the distribution network, and the oxygenate blender, on notice that the RBOB is not suitable for ethanol blending. Absent a highly unusual situation, a distributor would not be expected to dispense ether-only RBOB into a gasoline delivery truck for splash blending, because ethanol is the only oxygenate that normally is splash blended in trucks. In addition, it is likely that if ethanol were blended with VOC-controlled ether-only RBOB, the resulting gasoline will not meet the RVP maximum or VOC emissions performance minimum requirements, and would be susceptible to detection through EPA inspections or quality assurance programs conducted by regulated parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the volume assumptions based on 2.0 weight percent oxygen are preferable to the commenter's suggested 2.1 weight percent basis, because there is no reason to believe any particular oxygenate blender will elect to use the averaged oxygen standard of 2.1 weight percent. In a situation like this involving default assumptions it is appropriate to adopt a more conservative assumption. Oxygenate blenders have the option of meeting either the oxygen standard for per-gallon compliance of 2.0 weight percent, or the oxygen standard for average compliance of 2.1 weight percent. EPA believes the assumption that oxygenate blenders will at least meet the per-gallon standard is appropriate, and preferable to the proposed ``worst case'' oxygen use assumption of 1.5 weight percent, due to enforcement mechanisms contained in the final rule that apply to oxygenate blenders, i.e., quality assurance sampling and testing and recordkeeping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

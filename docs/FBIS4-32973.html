			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the  Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], said he accepts  Ernesto Zedillo's invitation to hold a debate, but he insists  that the initiative to hold a debate is his.    [Begin Cardenas recording] The candidate for the ruling  party  made a new invitation to the other candidates to participate in  a debate of nine. The candidate for the ruling party seems to  forget or does not want to listen to the other invitations made  by other candidates, including myself, to hold a first debate  among nine candidates. We hope it is not the only debate. The  debates must not be regulated by the interest of the ruling  candidate. It is time for the nine candidates, through their  representatives, to reach an agreement on this next debate, but  also on the other debates we may hold before 21 August.    I understand there should be at least three more debates  among all candidates before 21 August. We also hope to hold  debates among pairs of candidates. We hope all candidates can  begin discussing this. It is not something the government or  the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate has to impose on  us. It is something the candidates must agree upon amongst  ourselves. We also have to reach agreements regarding the  handling of the media following the debates, especially  Televisa, Television Azteca, and Multivision. They should give  all candidates the same opportunities to participate in what we  may call a postdebate. This time should not be used as an  opportunity to favor one or a few candidates to the detriment of  the other candidates. These are the guidelines my  representatives will be suggesting to the other candidates so  that we can all reach an agreement and hold several debates  before 21 August. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Francesco Vendrell, the UN secretary general's  envoy, says that he now understands conditions in East Timor  better. He feels that a report to be presented to UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is complete enough, thanks to  information provided by Indonesian officials during his  three-day stay in the territory. Francesco Vendrell expressed  his views at Dili's Komoro Airport yesterday prior to his  departure from East Timor. He added that the results of his  visit to East Timor will serve as input for the tripartite  Jakarta-Lisbon-UN talks on East Timor scheduled for next May.  Vendrell described development in East Timor as very advanced  and positive in promoting the welfare of the local population.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE AGREES TO TRANSFER 5,700 ACRES FOR PARK SITES  </P> <P> No one questions Bob Hope's charity -- more than one generation would say  "Thanks for the memories."  </P> <P> The problem with the private land sale is the continued unbridled development  of this area in the face of water shortages, traffic standstill, etc. -- and  simply too few wild places left in Southern California.  </P> <P> We must applaud the conservancy deal, for then future generations will give  thanks for more than just memories.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS CUMMINGS  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

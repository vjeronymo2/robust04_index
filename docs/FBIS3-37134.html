He graduated from the historical faculty of Tbilisi  State University and defended his dissertation on 19th century  Georgian history; he is a candidate of historical sciences. He  has worked in the Historical Museum, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, and the Political Department of the Head of State.  Since November 1993, he has been in charge of the Press Service  of the Head of State. [passage omitted]    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What does your service concern  itself with in the main?    [Kandelaki] First and foremost, the interests of the state.  I consider it intolerable when the mass media distorts certain  facts and interprets them in its own way, while not attaching  great significance to this. In such cases, it is a question of  the violation of the interests of the state. We demand from all  the mass media -- we also cooperate with the opposition press --  accuracy and authenticity. [passage omitted]    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Finally, the matter of  censorship. Does it exist or not? Moreover, to what extent is  its existence justified in general?    [Kandelaki] I believe there is no censorship now. It is  another matter that each journalist should have, so to speak,  his own internal censorship that functions regardless of his  personal sympathies and antipathies. Moreover, the criterion  for assessing phenomena of one kind or another should be the  interests of the state.</p>

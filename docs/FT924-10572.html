			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: The bell tolls for this 'Don Juan' - Dance Faced with something as monumentally awful as La Legende de Don Juan, with which the Groupe Emile Dubois infested the Royalty Theatre on Wednesday night, what can one do? Flee into the night, certainly - which is what I did after 85 minutes of tenth-rate rock, frenetically silly movement, and even more desperate inadequacy of dance ideas. Wonder if one could manufacture a hand-grenade from the programme sheet provided by Dance Umbrella, under whose aegis this catastrophe was shown, and blow the cast to smithereens. And wonder, and wonder again, whose misbegotten idea it was to bring this frightful troupe back to London. The Groupe Emile Dubois - and here is where the mind reels - is based at the Centre Choregraphique in Grenoble, and master-minded by Jean-Claude Gallotta. I presume that lots of French government money is spent in supporting this enterprise, and I can only suppose that it is a not-so-secret weapon to be used in some unimaginably terrible war of the future. The French 'new dance' is, for the most part, a dreadful thing, as pretentiousness balances with several other intellectual devils on the head of a pin of uncertain dance technique. Gallotta's contribution - he was unforgettably, alas, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall a couple of years ago - looks to me like dance-therapy for optimistic amateurs. His dancers vary from the competent to the curious (he has brought two chaps whom I privately identify as The Unfrocked Dentist and The Mad Vet) and this Don Juan does nothing for any of them, except set them rushing about as if auditioning for a TV variety show. The witless theme is that the Don becomes a rock star, vocalist and saxophonist, and across the 1950s,'60s,'70s he is seen performing (and frightfully, at that) while interludes show four girls succumbing to his charms. I left before, as I sincerely trust, he was carried off to Hell, but I can report that the noise was brutal, that the dance was vapidly energetic, that his loves were rather solid maidens wearing gold lame dresses and disporting themselves as if suffering from a mild attack of the Denishawns. (They skipped and romped like the earliest American free dancers to weedy piano tinklings). Pascal Gravat was the Don. Character was suggested by a knee-sagging, pigeon-toed stance, and occasional inaudible bursts of chat. Sexuality was represented by some desultory paddling in the girls' skirts. I have rarely seen a performer less communicative, less interesting. The rest of the cast had the harried air of people fleeing a burning hotel. I record with disbelief that the piece was commissioned by Expo '92 Seville and by the French Ministry of Culture's dance delegation, exported by the Association Francaise d'Action Artistique, and sponsored here by the European Arts Festival. Send not to know for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for them all.</p>

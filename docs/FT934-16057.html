			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / New towns commission to be split THE COMMISSION for the New Towns, which owns the remaining assets of the 21 former English new towns, is to be split into two agencies as part of a wide-ranging restructuring. The move, involving the loss of up to 240 jobs, is designed to help speed up the sale of public-sector housing and land before the commission is wound up in 1998. Announcing the reorganisation yesterday, the commission said the first wave of redundancies would be in December. It follows a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, which recommended cutbacks to match the commission's decreasing responsibilities in areas where it has already sold most of its assets. The commission will be split from June next year. CNT Land will handle sales and planning for 18,000 acres of commission-owned land which the government wants to see used for new development and infrastructure projects by the turn of the century. A separate agency, CNT 1998, will aim to sell off the remaining estates, community parks and housing stock. Both agencies will have their own boards and executive structures, although their operations will be overseen by the existing main board. Over the past 10 years assets worth more than Pounds 2bn have been sold off in towns such as Milton Keynes and Harlow.</p>

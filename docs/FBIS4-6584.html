			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Hwang Chang-yop,  secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea, on April 21 met and had a friendly conversation with a  delegation of the Workers Home of the Islamic Republic of Iran  headed by its Deputy General Secretary Ebadati Esrafil Sarigihe.    The head of the delegation said he extended congratulations  to the great leader His Excellency President Kim Il-song on his  birthday.    I am convinced that although the United States, with huge  Armed Forces deployed in and around South Korea, tries to  destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through  military aggression, the people under the guidance of  illustrious leaders, the people with revolutionary faith in  their leaders will certainly win, he said.    Noting that the United States is now using the UN Security  Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other  international organisations as means of putting pressure on  progressive countries, he stressed the United States would bump  into resistance of revolutionary countries and meet its doom  finally.</p>

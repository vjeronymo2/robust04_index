			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS ROUT REDS FOR 11-4 VICTORY  </P> <P> It seems that the New York Mets' weeklong batting slump has ended. After all,  they defeated the Cincinnati Reds, 11-4, Wednesday night at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Not necessarily so. An error on a double play opportunity that would have ended  the sixth inning helped New York break the game open with a six-run rally.  </P> <P> With two on and one out in a 3-3 tie, Met pitcher Ron Darling hit the  double-play ball to shortstop Barry Larkin, whose short toss sailed over the  head of second baseman Ron Oester.  </P> <P> Leadoff batter Mookie Wilson grounded to third, and Chris Sabo fumbled it.  Before the inning ended, another error was made, and Kevin McReynolds and Keith  Hernandez each singled in two runs.  </P> <P> The Mets had gotten only seven runs and 22 hits in the last five games. They  improved their figures, with nine hits, including two home runs.  </P> <P> Howard Johnson hit a two-run home run in the seventh to give the Mets the most  runs they have scored in a game this season. Earlier, Barry Lyons, replacing  slumping catcher Gary Carter, hit his first home run since 1987.  </P> <P> Rick Aguilera pitched the final three innings for the Mets to earn his first  major league save.  </P> <P> Montreal 10, Houston 1 -- For all intents and purposes, the game at Houston was  over when the Expos scored eight runs in the second inning.  </P> <P> The highlight after that was a 15-minute free-for-all in the sixth.  </P> <P> It started when Astro reliever Larry Andersen threw a pitch close to Spike  Owen. Owen charged the mound, and the benches emptied. Andersen suffered a cut  on his nose. Three Montreal players and an Astro coach were ejected.  </P> <P> Tom Foley sparked the Expos' attack with three doubles and a single to drive in  three runs. The Expos were trailing, 1-0, when their first four batters hit  safely in the second to start the rally.  </P> <P> Bryn Smyth (3-1) gave up three hits in seven innings. It was the Expos' seventh  consecutive victory at the Astrodome.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, San Diego 1 -- Joe Magrane, the league's earned-run leader last  season, lost a no-hit bid at St. Louis on a one-out double by Carmelo Martinez  in the seventh.  </P> <P> He gave up an unearned run on shortstop Ozzie Smith's error before Martinez's  hit. But Tom Brunansky hit a two-run home run in the seventh, and Magrane (3-2)  earned the victory. He gave up two hits and struck out a career-high eight  before Todd Worrell came in to strike out Marvell Wynne with two on in the  ninth to get the save.  </P> <P> It was Magrane's third start since coming off the disabled list on April 30,  suffering from colitis. His longest stint this season had been 6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> San Francisco 4, Chicago 3 -- Mitch Williams has given the Cubs' bullpen a big  lift, but they often don't know what to expect from the 6-foot-4 left-hander.  </P> <P> They didn't care much for what he did in this game at Chicago when he came in  to protect a 3-2 lead in the eighth.  </P> <P> First, he let Will Clark single in the tying run. Then, he balked in the  winning run. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

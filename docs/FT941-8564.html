			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (5): Tourism seeks more five-star winners - The industry is trying to go upmarket Malta is becoming increasingly nervous about its success in attracting ever greater numbers of tourists, particularly from the UK. Though all tourists are welcome, fresh marketing tactics are being developed and refined. While tourism is set to remain the island's predominant industry, the authorities are keen to change Malta's cheap sun and sea image and go more upmarket. Two specific problems in the pattern of tourism are being addressed. The first is the common phenomenon of the sharp tourist peak in July and August, when the volume of visitors puts a great strain on services, and the second is the continuing over-dependence on the UK for tourists. The latest statistics show that the corrective campaigns are meeting with mixed success. Mr Michael Soler, chairman of Malta's national tourism organisation, explains: 'Our focus has to change as we are going to reach our maximum capacity soon. We will have to manage volume growth of tourists very carefully.' The figures tell the story. There was a slump in tourism in the early to mid 1980s, caused partly by high prices, variable quality and infrastructure problems including water and electricity shortages, and partly by an adverse political climate as the Labour government courted the Libyans and eastern bloc in a determined attempt to stay neutral and non-aligned. Costs were then pegged, infrastructure improvements launched, and a differential exchange rate introduced for UK tour operators. Tourist numbers rose steadily from 480,000 in 1984 to 746,000 in 1987, 828,000 in 1989 and over 1m in 1992, three years ahead of target. The upward trend continued last year despite difficult economic conditions in most European markets, and the total reached 1,050,000, an all-time record. But to the consternation of the authorities, arrivals in the peak summer months were over 7 per cent up on the corresponding period of 1992. It was not the trend they wanted. A more even flow of visitors throughout the year would lessen the strain on services at peak times and create more permanent year-round employment in hotels and the tourist sector. Tourism, by far the largest industry, employs one third of the workforce and accounts for 40 per cent of gross domestic product. The proposal, therefore, is to attract more visitors in the winter and in the 'shoulder' months of spring and autumn, and at the same time to seek tourists who will spend more per head than the package tour visitor staying in a modest hotel or in self-catering accommodation. 'We need to give more attention to our heritage, history, architecture and yachting facilities to cater for the better-off who will spend more in Malta,' says Mr Soler. One senses a certain exasperation that the British remain more reluctant than the Germans and Italians to move from the sun-and-sea stage of recreational evolution. The raw material for development is certainly there. The history and archaeology of Malta and its sister island of Gozo are astonishingly varied but largely undeveloped, probably because attention has been concentrated on the sun and sea volume end of the market. There are open air neolithic temples on Malta and Gozo, and the subterranean temple or hypogeum at Hal Saflieni, which are reputed to be among the oldest architectural monuments in existence. From later centuries there are many relics left by a succession of conquerors including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs and Normans, leading in 1530 to one of the richest periods in Malta's history, when Emperor Charles V gave the islands to the Knights of St John after they had been driven out of Jerusalem and then Rhodes. The Knights of Malta constructed a wealth of fortifications, churches and palaces in their 268-year rule, including Valletta, one of the world's great fortified harbours. It became Malta's capital under the Knights, replacing the wonderful 'silent city' of Mdina built by the Arabs. Apart from the attractions of history, other high-spending visitors are being sought in off-peak months with special events including flower festivals, historic pageants, music and jazz festivals, a boat show and power boat racing. The government has banned the building of new hotels except those in the five-star category because of a surfeit of lower and middle range accommodation, and a big new yacht marina is being constructed. There is also a proposal to transform the run-down Manoel Island in the centre of Valletta's Grand Harbour into a tourist complex featuring hotels, restaurants, possibly another marina, upmarket shops and a theatre. The tourism industry has proved remarkably resilient during the recession in Malta's chief markets, and despite the pressures caused by the growing numbers of peak season visitors, other aspects of the government's strategy are making progress. An example is the big emphasis on the UK market which in 1980 provided Malta with over 75 per cent of its tourists. This dependence was considered to be commercially unhealthy, and efforts have been made to attract visitors from other countries, particularly Germany, Italy, France and Scandinavia. These efforts have begun to work. As the tourist market has expanded, the increase in the number of visitors from the UK has failed to keep pace. As a result, the UK share has been falling slowly but steadily for a number of years with the sole exception of 1992 when the Queen visted Malta to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime siege. The downward trend should continue as the forward currency rate for British tour operators is phased out next year. Last year, the UK represented 49 per cent of arrivals compared with 52 per cent in 1992, and arrivals from continental Europe rose sharply, including off-peak months. German tourists increased by 8.5 per cent and now represent 16 per cent of all arrivals, second only to the British. Arrivals from Italy increased by over 12 per cent and should grow quickly following the inauguration of Air Malta flights to Milan. The airline and the national tourist office are to open an office in New York to tap the lucrative US market which could be attracted by the history, climate and universal use of English. However, a big handicap is that there is no direct flight to Malta. One proposal is to link up with a big US airline which would fly tourists to Europe from where Air Malta would complete the journey at preferential rates. The best news of all for the authorities last year was that the tactic of trying to attract more upmarket tourists appears to be succeeding after a hesitant start. Per capita spending by visitors increased by a healthy 18 per cent, thanks partly to increasing success in the cruise and conferences market, Nevertheless, package tours will continue to be Malta's tourist staple for some time to come.</p>

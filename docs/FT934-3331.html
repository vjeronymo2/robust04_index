			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Observer: Gorby sits tight Three guesses who is Russia's most famous floating voter? On an extended international jaunt - including London yesterday - Mikhail Gorbachev told Observer his lips are sealed as far as Sunday's election is concerned. Only when he gets back home on Friday will he make up his mind where his vote is going. Mind you, the last non-elected president of the Soviet Union knows who he won't vote for: Boris Yeltsin. 'I do know that I won't vote for Russia's Choice (the reformist bloc backed by nemesis Boris Yeltsin). I will not vote for hardline communists and I will not vote for the extremists.' So if he doesn't fancy Yeltsin or the 'extremists', who is left? Gorbachev is considering only three options: the centrist Civic Union, the Democratic Party of Russia, and cautious reformists led by Grigory Yavlinsky. But given Gorbachev's low standing among Russian voters, probably all political parties are happy with his non-endorsement.</p>

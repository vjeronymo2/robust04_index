			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Aden branch of the  Ministry of Interior and Security has said in a statement to the  YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, SABA'', that life in the economic and  commercial capital, Aden, is proceeding normally, in spite of a  few desperate attempts to subject the city to air bombardment  from time to time -- in order to attack certain vital economic  installations and civil institutions -- which have been  unleashed by aircraft belonging to the bloody gang. The source  stressed that the Aden branch of the ministry had taken all  necessary measures and precautions to assure the freedom and  safety of the citizens, and to ensure their security and  livelihoods. These include civil defense measures and the  securing of sources of water and supplies.    The source called on all the citizens to adhere to security  and stability, and to persevere with their normal daily  activities. The source said that public and private supplies  and consumer installations would continue to render services.  Such installations include restaurants, gas stations, butane  gas depots, and the like.    The source went on to say that the Aden branch of the  Ministry of Cooperatives, the municipality, and other relevant  quarters would apply stern measures against anyone attempting to  incite citizens, hoard foodstuffs or consumer goods, or stir up  disputes concerning supplies. Such measures would include the  withdrawal of trading licenses from business concerns, bakeries,  or restaurants which closed their doors to the needs of the  citizens to prevent them from having access to their products.    Concluding the statement, the source called on all citizens  to cooperate with the police and to report any phenomena liable  to undermine the stability of their security or livelihood.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Names see their losses judgment overturned The Appeal Court yesterday ruled that a group of 500 Lloyd's Names were too late to begin legal action to recover insurance losses, overturning a judgment made last year by the High Court. The Names, individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, were all members of Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in the 1982 year of account and allege breach of duty by their agents. They did not participate in a successful earlier action by fellow Names on the syndicate which resulted in a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in February 1992. The ruling is a setback for Names, but has no impact on other cases currently before the courts. The biggest action, by 3,095 Gooda Walker Names, began in April and another large case by some 2,000 Feltrim Names is scheduled to begin later this year. Last year Mr Justice Saville ruled that the Names could take action against RHM Outhwaite (Underwriting Agencies), which managed syndicate 317/661, and approximately 80 members' agents. Yesterday, however, the Court of Appeal ruled by two to one that the claim was time-barred. The Names had attempted to rely on a provision of the Limitation Act of 1980 by alleging that the defendants had deliberately concealed their own breaches of duty, thereby denying the Names of the knowledge of their right to sue. The Court of Appeal's decision, which involved a detailed review of the law of limitation over the last 350 years, was described as a 'landmark decision' by Denton Hall, the firm of solicitors acting for the Names. Mr Kevin Ryan of Denton Hall said: 'It will affect all litigants hoping to rely on these limitation provisions,' The Names will appeal against the decision to the House of Lords.</p>

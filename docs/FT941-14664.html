			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: How to distribute the cash mountains - A poser facing the regional electricity companies It is the kind of predicament which most companies can only dream of. Some of Britain's electricity distributors have so much money that they do not know what to do with it. This week Eastern Electricity, one of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, has shown one way by starting to buy back some of the shares issued when it was privatised, along with the other 11, three years ago. This will reduce the company's cash pile, Pounds 90m and growing, and increase the earnings of the shares which remain in issue. It also pleased the City which yesterday marked up the company's and the sector's shares. Further, and more radical, balance sheet restructuring in the sector is inevitable as companies get to grips with the welcome but complex problems presented by generating far more profit and cash than the government imagined at flotation. At the end of this financial year in March, several of the companies will be cash positive and the sector as a whole may have net cash. Changes from April 1995 in regulatory controls covering their distribution businesses may dent the growth but some analysts believe that, even if the changes are radical, the companies will continue to generate cash for at least several years. Hoarding it would be inefficient. Utility companies with strong, predictable and safe earnings can afford to have, and would benefit from, higher debt than most companies. Debt should be even more attractive in times of low interest rates. 'Many of the recs are over-capitalised,' says one analyst. 'Put simply the cost of the equity is about 8 per cent, if you assume yield of 4 per cent and about 4 per cent for real dividend growth. The cost of debt in the market would be about 7 per cent.' Mr Bob Turgoose, a partner with Price Waterhouse and a specialist in the electricity sector, says creating large cash piles is unlikely to be welcomed by shareholders. 'The recs would begin to look like banks and that is not what investors have bought shares in them for. 'Providing the companies can invest the money well they will get better returns elsewhere. Electricity companies could lift their gearing levels considerably without anyone batting an eyelid.' The recs' rude financial health stems in part from their unexpected progress in cutting staff and costs but also from the relatively generous terms on which they were floated by the government. 'The more complicated a business the better chance it had in the privatisation process,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett. 'Thus electricity fared far better than water.' Although Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, has signalled he will considerably tighten price controls in the forthcoming review, there are doubts about how tough he can be. 'There is strength in numbers,' says Mr Hawkins. 'There will be huge debates about whether he is treating all the recs fairly but Prof Littlechild would have bigger problems still if he also adopted a strict approach. 'But to stop positive cash flows he is going to have to be pretty vicious. Most of the companies have a fair amount tucked away in their back pockets for future cost reductions.' Even if the review results in the distribution cash flow drying up, some analysts believe the recs could still be cash positive overall, in part because of likely improvements to the supply businesses' debt collection processes. The recs have two main options for dealing with their cash surpluses. The first is to take the familiar but dangerous path of diversification. Finding areas for investment will not be easy. Difficulties experienced by some of the water companies in diversifying have left the market wary. Among utilities, investors tend to favour the cautious. Most of the recs have entered or are looking at the gas supply business following the government's opening up of that market. Some, including Midlands Electricity, are looking at investing in generation projects abroad but the opportunities are limited and commitments so far are minimal. 'The problem with cash piles is that they increase pressure to buy something you may later regret,' says one chief executive. The second option is to pay back some of the cash to shareholders. Share buy-backs are the most obvious route. So far East Midlands, which has permission to buy 5 per cent of its stock, and Swalec are the only companies to have shareholder approval, and several recs are likely to ask for shareholder approval at annual meetings later this year. A simpler payback method would be to increase dividends to shareholders. That could be achieved by lifting the increases by even more in real terms than the 6 per cent or so minimal a year that analysts are expecting post-1995. But this has its dangers, especially as the next general election approaches and the chances of a victorious Labour party imposing a windfall profits tax on electricity companies increases. Some rec executives are therefore beginning to consider privately a large, one-off dividend. Unlike Ofwat, the water regulator, Prof Littlechild has raised no objections to high dividend increases. However, none of the companies are likely to do anything radical before Prof Littlechild completes his distribution review. Even Eastern appears to be merely testing the water, having bought less than 1 per cent of its shares.</p>

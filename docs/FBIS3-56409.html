Four Russian  submarines are destined for that country's metallurgical plants  in the near future.    The submarines in question are SS-60's, known in the West by  the designation "Foxtrot." These diesel-powered torpedo-armed  submarines were constructed in the Soviet Union in the 1960's  and have already completed their intended service life. Of the  40 or so submarines of this class which remain in the Russian  Navy, some are still used as training vessels. The rest,  however, are permanently laid up and are quietly poisoning the  environment at naval bases.    Navy commanders have been authorized to sell off these  decommissioned vessels on their own initiative. Because Russia  lacks adequate production capacity suited to preparing warships  for melting down, and also because the country's economic  position boosts the attractiveness of freely convertible  currency, foreign buyers naturally have priority rights.    The contract to sell four decommissioned submarines to North  Korean buyers was signed by the Russian Pacific Fleet command.    The Japanese newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN has conjectured that,  having obtained the submarines, North Korea will carry out  repairs and put them into service in its navy. In the opinion  of Russian specialists, however, it would be economically  disadvantageous to carry out a complete overhaul of the  "Foxtrots." Moreover, under existing rules all armaments and  guidance systems will be dismantled before the submarines are  dispatched to North Korea.</p>

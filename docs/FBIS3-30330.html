			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Svetoslav Terziev commentary: "Conventional Handshake"] </F>   [Text] It is gratifying when the leader of the only  superpower in the world, namely the President of the United  States, takes the opportunity to say a few nice words about  Bulgaria and its domestic policy. President Bill Clinton did so  while self-appointed pro-American lobbyists in Bulgaria are  sparing no efforts to convince the United States and the whole  world that the country is being recommunized and its democratic  development is lagging behind, after they lost power.    It would have been even more gratifying, however, if  President Clinton's appreciation of Bulgaria's policy in the  sphere of human rights had not been tainted by the well known  U.S. condescension, accompanied by encouragement for obedience  (namely trade without prohibitive customs duties, for example).  Regardless of Bulgaria's difficult economic situation, it still  has its pride, and if someone is willing to exchange goods with  our country, he had better accept us as partners rather than as  subordinates.    Even Russia, which is totally submerged by economic chaos,  had the dignity to declare, through its ambassador in Washington  last Tuesday [25 January], that it prefers real material  assistance to advice on how to run its domestic affairs.    Since the beginning of 1990 Bulgaria has received $150  million from the United States in the form of official financial  assistance, which amounts to $40 million annually, the U.S.  Embassy in Sofia has disclosed. This deserves our gratitude,  but we should admit, in all frankness, that the amount is not  only far from adequate compared with our country's needs, but  also far from being overgenerous compared with the financial  possibilities of the United States. The amount appears even  more modest compared with Washington's ambition to dictate what  should be done and how things should be run in Bulgarian  politics. Once upon a time, the late USSR paid out much more  for the same prerogative.</p>

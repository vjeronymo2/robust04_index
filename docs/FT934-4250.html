			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils pressured Yet another slide in crude oil prices caused consternation but little in the way of substantial downside pressure in the oil sector. BP came under limited pressure late in the session, closing 3 1/2 down at 332p. Shell gave a powerful performance, closing 7 1/2 ahead at 701 1/2 p as some institutions continued to switch out of BP. Brent for January delivery dropped below the psychologically important Dollars 14 a barrel level, slipping to Dollars 13.65 before rallying to Dollars 13.85, its lowest level since November 1988. 'It's not looking good at all for the oils, especially the exploration stocks,' said one specialist. He added that if crude prices stay at current levels for any length of time then the exploration companies 'will have to start looking at their forward planning schedules.' Enterprise, the highest-rated stock in the sub-sector, moved up 10 to 447p, with buying still being stimulated by recent presentations to Scottish institutions, the recent buy note issued by Kleinwort Benson and talk of more positive broker research in the pipeline. Reports that the Securities and Investment Board, the insurance industry watchdog, is planning a further investigation into pension plan transfers triggered a bout of hefty selling throughout the life sector. The severest pressure fell on Prudential, whose shares closed 9 1/2 lower at 360 1/2 p, after turnover of 9.5m shares. Legal &amp; General dipped 7 to 532p on 2.4m traded. Lloyds Abbey slipped 5 to 449p on 1.7m shares. Most food manufacturing stocks remained under pressure as worries over margins - prompted by warnings this week of more pain to come from supermarket group Argyll - continued. Hillsdown slipped 4 to 149p, Cadbury-Schweppes 8 to 467p and Booker 2 to 394p. International exposure kept Unilever strong, up 10 to 1170p. Expectations ahead of results on Monday lifted Scottish and Newcastle, the shares adding 18 to 538p. Profit-takers were in evidence as Allied Lyons fell 6 to 411p and Bass the same amount to 531p. SG Warburg was said to be recommending a switch out of Guinness, down 2 1/2 at 471p, and into Grand Metropolitan, ahead 4 1/2 at 434 1/2 p. Dealers said there was a bear squeeze in Rank Organisation, sending the shares forward 25 to 909p. The sharp rise inevitably gave rise to renewed talk over the possibility of Rank selling its stake in Rank Xerox. After a tortuous week in the market, Ladbroke finally moved into positive territory, the shares edging a penny to 145p. Turnover, at 10m, was again heavy. Conglomerate Hanson saw another day of frenetic trading following Thursday's disappointing results and the shares shed 3 to 265 1/2 p on turnover of 34m. There was also busy trading in the options market. The stock hit a low of 260p but dealers said there was chart support at 262p which encouraged value buying. The television sector retraced some of the week's gains as Kleinwort Benson argued that an over-estimation of projected airtime sales by Yorkshire-Tyne Tees could impact on the rest of the sector. YTT fell 4 to 179p, Scottish lost 4 to 493p and Anglia slipped 3 to 451p. There were reports of downgradings in BTR, said to be from James Capel and Cazenove. The shares closed down 5p at 346p. ASW recovered 10 to 158p, after its recent profits warning. November traffic results from British Airways' caused little excitement with a slight reduction in passenger load factors. The shares were steady at 430p.</p>

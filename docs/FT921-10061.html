			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Partners at odds in their special relationship: US - knee-jerk responses and second thoughts Whenever a prominent Japanese implies that the US is no longer a paragon of every virtue, Americans react reflexively and negatively. It happened this week after Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's observations that perhaps the US (and also Japan) had its values skewed in the 1980s by the pursuit of easy money and the sacrifice of the 'work ethic'. American second thoughts, however - and there have been several columns and editorials this week concurring with Mr Miyazawa's sentiments, if not with his tact and timing - have nothing like the impact of the initial demarche and response. Sometimes second thoughts even translate into action. Last month, for example, Mr Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball, reacted in horror to the proposal that a Japanese-led group take control of the Seattle Mariners. Baseball, he intoned, was an American game and the fact that the people of Seattle welcomed Japanese ownership as the only way of preventing the team from being moved to Florida was irrelevant. This week Mr Vincent somewhat changed his tune, having listened to arguments from citizens of the north-west, who are conspicuously less agitated by the Japanese threat than most of their countrymen because they know them better and trade with them more. He noted that the Japanese-born president of Nintendo of America had lived in the Seattle area for 15 years and might, therefore, be said to meet the notional stipulation that ownership of a franchise be definably local. However, most public rhetoric, if not substantive action, is all one way and against Japan. This is not new, but it has been given current point by President George Bush's trip to Japan last month. Never before had a US president gone on such an overt begging mission. Its sad climax at a banquet seemed to symbolise the weakness of the US against the economic might of its former client state. This sense, allied to the offence taken at the remarks of Mr Miyazawa and others, has produced a scattered knee-jerk response. Several businesses have put into effect 'buy America' discounts and subsidies for their employees. More significant seemed the decision by the Los Angeles transit authority to cancel an order placed with Sumitomo of Japan for light rail cars, although it did advance the case that the collapse of American inner city public transport meant that the country needed a revived indigenous transit manufacturing industry. This is also a presidential election year, which means anything can become an election issue. This is especially so in a country still in recession, where the dominant political theme has been not sex but the potent four-letter word 'jobs'. It follows, therefore, that the easy charge to make, regardless of its truth, is that Japan is stealing American jobs. Predictable political grandstanding apart, there has been rather less of this than might be expected. Among Republicans, Mr Pat Buchanan, who is challenging Mr Bush in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday week, can get in his 'America first' haymakers. Mr Bush finds himself obliged to proclaim that the US has not lost its work ethic, but is now a touch reluctant to identify himself too closely with the highly paid US car company executives whose presence in his Japanese entourage was criticised. Of the Democrats, only Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa, who is the closest to organised labour, engages in mostly unadulterated Japan-bashing. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska did broadcast one TV commercial portraying himself guarding an ice hockey net against presumably Japanese attackers, but he has subsequently partly disowned this pitch. As a former governor, he is not insensitive to the attractions of Japanese investment, estimated now to provide 600,000 direct jobs in the US.</p>

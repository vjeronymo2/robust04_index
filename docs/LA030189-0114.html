			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZENITH, AT&amp;T JOIN TO DEVELOP HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION  </P> <P> Zenith, the only U.S. maker of television sets, and AT&amp;T said Tuesday that  they have teamed up to develop a high-definition television system.  </P> <P> Addressing concerns that foreign competitors are winning the race to develop  HDTV equipment, Zenith Chairman Jerry Pearlman predicted that the partnership  would yield "winning American technology" that will "allow the U.S. to leapfrog  the Japanese and Europeans."  </P> <P> Zenith and AT&amp;T were among 40 to submit high-definition television  proposals to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the  Defense Department. The agency, which has earmarked $30 million for development  of HDTV systems, is expected to award contracts in April.  </P> <P> The identities of the other companies competing for government funding couldn't  be learned late Tuesday. However, industry sources said IBM, Tandy, Sun  Microsystems and SRI International were known to have at least considered a  proposal. The deadline for submitting proposals was Monday.  </P> <P> "It is encouraging to know there has been this kind of response," said Pat Hill  Hubbard, vice president for science and technology policy for the American  Electronics Assn. "We're very pleased."  </P> <P> The Defense Department, which uses HDTV technology in certain weapons systems,  invited proposals for the technology last December. The department said it  expected the technology to have consumer applications but that it would "by no  means solve the HDTV problem."  </P> <P> Some economists and electronics industry officials have expressed concern that  unless U.S. firms catch up to Japanese competitors in HDTV development, this  nation will lose out on another key consumer electronics market.  </P> <P> The Japanese started work on HDTV -- a wide-screen television with  well-defined, color pictures -- in 1970. Since then, the Japanese have  developed cameras, tape recorders and broadcasting equipment for the new  high-definition format. Next year, high definition-television will become  available to Japanese viewers. But the televisions will cost a lot -- about  $4,000.  </P> <P> Last month, 16 U.S. companies, including Zenith, IBM, Apple Computer and Texas  Instruments, agreed to work on setting up a partnership to fund development of  high-definition TV sets. Besides conducting research, the group would also  license HDTV technology to other U.S. companies.  </P> <P> The Defense Department said it will award $15 million for development of a  device that will receive high-definition signals and another $15 million for a  device that will display a high-definition picture. The two devices would  ultimately provide the basis for an HDTV television set.  </P> <P> Jan Bodanyi, a department spokeswoman, said the government would pick one  proposal in each area, and possibly more.  </P> <P> Zenith and AT&amp;T will work on developing the technology to receive the HDTV  signals. The proposal asks for $13 million from the department. The total price  tag would be $24 million, said Daniel S. Lankford, a vice president at AT&amp;T  Microelectronics, one of the AT&amp;T units working on the project.  </P> <P> Lankford said Zenith and AT&amp;T separately submitted proposals for developing  a display screen, the HDTV equivalent of a picture tube.  </P> <P> Lankford said that if AT&amp;T and Zenith failed to receive the government  contract, research would continue, but more slowly. "We would have to  reevaluate the time and resources devoted to the project," he said.  </P></p>

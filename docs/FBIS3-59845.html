The industrial units of the Bangladesh Textile  Mills Corporation [BTMC] incurred losses of 401.25 crore  [4,012.50 million] taka during the past 21 years. The BTMC has  41 textile mills. At present production has virtually stopped in  36 of them. Efforts by the government to sell these mills to the  private sector have not yielded the desired result.    All 41 mills are facing acute financial crisis due to  recurring losses. There was no production in these mills during  the past year due to the unavailability of raw cotton. Only five  mills are operational while the rest have been unofficially  closed. As a result, 47,000 mill workers are unemployed. BTMC  sources said that the Ministry of Industries has invited private  sector bids on 10 mills, but it has been learned that the  response is not very encouraging. Steps are also underway for  the denationalization of 10 more mills. The government's plan is  to privatize the mills in a gradual manner. It has been  reported that the Industries Ministry is going ahead with the  sale of these mills, although the prices offered is far below  the actual cost of the mills. About 10,000 workers in these 10  mills, which were declared closed about nine months ago, have  not yet received the salaries and other benefits due them.    From 1972-1993 the corporation incurred a loss of 401.25  crore taka. During the past two and a half years, that is,  during the term of office of the present government, the  corporation incurred a loss of 286 crore [2,860 million] taka.  This shows that the loss incurred in the textile sector during  the tenure of the present government exceeded all records. The  BTMC earned profits during the 1972-1976 fiscal years. From  1977-1979, the corporation earned a profit of over 1.5 crore [15  million] taka. It also earned profits during the 1982-83,  1984-85, and 1988-89 fiscal years. By deducting the profits made  during the past 21 years, the net loss of the corporation is  estimated to be around 401.25 crore taka.    The BTMC workers union at a press conference held yesterday  called on the government to accept their 14-point demand, which  includes reopening the 10 industrial units of the corporation  which had been closed and payment of their overdue salaries.  They alleged that a grave situation is prevailing in the BTMC  units. The mill workers have not been paid in four or five  months. The union leaders further alleged that these mills  incurred losses worth several million taka during the term of  office of the present government. They said that influential  persons are conspiring to purchase each mill worth about 50  crore [500 million] taka at the nominal price of only 5 to 10  crore [50 to 100 million] taka.    The 14-point demand of the jute mill workers include  reopening the 10 mills which have been closed; payment of the  back salaries of the workers; release of the workers arrested  under the Anti-Terrorism Act; withdrawal of duty on the import  of raw cotton, color, chemicals, and machinery parts; banning  imports of duty-free thread; preventing entry of smuggled thread  and textile yarn; withdrawal of value added tax; lifting of  interest on bank loans; issuance of long-term loans for  modernization of the textile mills; and providing capital to  these mills.    The statement at the press conference was read by the  general  secretary of the workers union, Z.M. Kamrul Anam. The other  union leaders present included Md. Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, Subash  Chandra Debnath, Abu Taher, and Shamsunnahar. The textile  workers have also decided to stage a sit-in in front of the  Bangladesh Secretariat [ Dhaka complex which houses all  government ministries] on 29 December to press their  demands.</p>

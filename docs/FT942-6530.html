			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): de Raad to promote quality The European Foundation for Quality Management, a non-profit association created in 1988 by 14 of Europe's leading companies and today backed by more than 320 corporate members, has a new secretary general, writes Tim Dickson. He is Geert de Raad, a Dutchman who took over the reins of the Brussels-based organisation from John King at the beginning of this month. EFQM's role is to promote the business idea known as total quality management, a philosophy which puts customers and employees at the centre of a company's thinking. With the support of the European Commission and the European Organisation for Quality, EFQM in 1992 launched an annual award which recognises the best European exponents of TQM. De Raad, who has an MBA from Northeastern University of Boston, faces the challenge of trying to spread the TQM 'gospel' to a wider and sometimes sceptical European audience. He was previously responsible for the plastics business of Royal Nijverdal-Ten Cate which included 10 companies, employed 2,900 people and boasted Ecu350m of turnover. As corporate director, he was in charge of all acquisition activities, technology development and the group-wide implementation of TQM. He joined the executive board in 1990 and subsequently became a corporate vice-president.</p>

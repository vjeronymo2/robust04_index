			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA'S ESPITIA SHUTS DOWN VALLEY AGAIN, 3-0  </P> <P> Shane Espitia of Ventura College has a secret -- one he isn't willing to share  with the rest of the area's junior college pitchers. He appears to be the only  one who knows how to beat Valley College, a trick he performed for the second  time this season with a three-hit, 3-0 victory Thursday in a Western State  Conference game at Ventura.  </P> <P> "You have to pitch well to shut out a team like us," Valley Coach Chris Johnson  said.  </P> <P> Valley (14-2-1, 2-1 in WSC play), has suffered its only losses against Espitia,  a freshman right-hander -- the first occurred two weeks ago, a 5-4 setback in  the semifinals of the San Bernardino tournament eventually won by Valley. And  Espitia recently mastered a new pitch, a cut fastball that moves toward  right-handers, to complement his slider, which breaks in the opposite  direction.  </P> <P> "I was hitting my spots with my fastball and my slider," Espitia said. "If I  can't control both pitches, I would have had a tougher time. That whole team  can hit."  </P> <P> But Thursday, Espitia (3-1) kept Valley guessing. He struck out five and walked  four for his second complete game. Only one Valley runner reached third base  and the Monarchs hit into three double plays.  </P> <P> The most costly double play took place in the sixth inning. After Ray Sabado  led off with a single to right to extend his hitting streak to 15 games, Gene  Demyon walked. But Mark Cavaretta put the brakes to the rally with a grounder  to first that was turned into a double play. Sabado advanced to third but was  left there when Greg Struhl grounded to second.  </P> <P> Valley starter Joey Kane (3-2) pitched well enough to win, scattering eight  hits, striking out six and walking three. But he gave up run-scoring doubles to  David Eggert and Mike Spencer in the second inning and an RBI single to Mike  Teron in the fifth.  </P> <P> Ventura is 10-4, 2-2 in the WSC.  </P></p>

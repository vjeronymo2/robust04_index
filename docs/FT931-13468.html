			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Audit regulation has 'improved standards' MORE THAN 90 per cent of auditors think the quality of their work has improved following the introduction of the new audit regulation regime, a survey showed yesterday. And more than a third say they have noticed considerable improvement. Many accountants have had to make changes to their methods, systems, quality controls, staff training and administration in the past year, according to 176 practitioners questioned by Audit Briefing, a monthly newsletter published by Tolley. Audit regulation was introduced by the 1989 Companies Act and became active in October 1991, with the launch of inspections by self-regulatory monitoring bodies. The survey showed that substantial changes had been made in preparation for the regime, although only 11 per cent of those questioned had been visited by regulators. A third believed more audit work was now required for particular types of client, especially small and family businesses and other regulated clients. More than 90 per cent of firms had experienced a rise in chargeable hours required to audit an average client, and a corresponding increase in costs. In view of the competitive market for audit services, more than half the firms absorbed at least part of the costs. Nearly 90 per cent felt the work required to comply with audit regulation was to some degree superfluous. But three quarters of those visited by the regulators felt their recommendations were reasonable, two thirds that they were of considerable use, and 16 per cent believed they were very useful.

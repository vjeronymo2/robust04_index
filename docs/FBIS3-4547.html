			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 25 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton  Friday [25 February] applauded the congressional move to impose  U.S.-set import targets on Japan, saying it represents "the  determination of the American people" to open Japanese markets.    Clinton was commenting on a new trade bill sponsored by  House  majority leader Richard Gephardt that requires the U.S.  Government to retaliate against Japan unless it meets specific  U.S.-set import targets. "I think that it shows the  determination of the American people to improve our trade and to  open the markets (in Japan)," Clinton said at a news conference.    Clinton singled out in particular the involvement of Sen.  John Rockefeller of West Virginia in the proposed legislation as  he gave tacit endorsement to the Gephardt-Rockefeller bill.    Rockefeller, a second-term Democrat who has had extensive  contact with Japan, joined Gephardt Thursday in sponsoring the  "fair market access" and blasted the Japanese Government for  "locking out" American products and services in the Japanese  market. Rockefeller "understands what is at stake here,"  Clinton said, noting that the Democrat senator "has actually  lived in Japan and, I think, is thought of genuinely as a friend  of Japan."    Rockefeller spent three years in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960 as  a  student at the International Christian University.    Clinton, however, stayed short of giving outright support to  the Gephardt-Rockefeller bill, asserting that "we've taken no  position on any particular legislation." The bill, which  received support from both Democratic and Republican  legislators, requires the Commerce Department to define  "objective criteria" for what the U.S. feels would be a "fair"  market share in Japan for U.S. products, using the competitive  position of U.S. firms in other developed markets as a benchmark.    Japan will be subject to U.S. sanctions under provisions of  the legislation if it fails to meet the U.S.-set targets.    Gephardt said the proposed legislation was in support of  Clinton's efforts to open Japanese markets through the framework  trade talks, which collapsed on February 11 over U.S. demands to  set import goals in Japan.    Tokyo has since moved to defuse the growing friction with  Washington, with the coalition government of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa pledging Friday to compile a "voluntary"  market-opening package by the end of March. The Tokyo decision,  announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, drew a  cautious response in Washington.    White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the Clinton  administration has no information about the details of the  proposed market-opening program. "We look forward to the  details of the proposal," Myers told reporters.    The plan includes encouraging imports and foreign investment  in Japan, easing government regulations and procedures involved  in government purchases and spurring competitive policies,  Japanese officials said.</p>

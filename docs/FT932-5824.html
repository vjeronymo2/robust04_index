			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Brewers urge cut in beer excise THE BREWING industry is urging the government to lower the new rate of excise duty on beer, which took effect yesterday, on the grounds that it breaches a pledge by ministers that it would not raise more revenue than the previous system. The Brewers' Society said that if the new system had been applied over the past 12 months it would have yielded Pounds 64m - or 3 per cent - more than the old one. The society said ministers had promised that the rate would be fiscally neutral and would be rectified if that proved not to be the case. It called on the government to change the rate before the November Budget. Customs and Excise expressed surprise that the brewers had not complained earlier and said they had not substantiated their claim. It said the new rate had been calculated in consultation with the society after a survey of brewers. The approximate rate had been indicated to the society a year ago and confirmed in early March. The society had not challenged it until three weeks ago, however, and had produced supporting data only last Friday. The society said it was unsure until recently how the system would work. But Customs and Excise said all the details had been settled three months ago, except for a minor question concerning warehouses. Customs and Excise also pointed out that the revenue neutrality of the rate would depend on the types of beer being sold. It said ministers would examine before the next Budget any data supplied by the society. The new system charges duty on the volume and alcoholic strength of beer production instead of on the gravity of liquid before fermentation.</p>

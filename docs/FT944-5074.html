			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: West urged to step up aid to eastern Europe The west needs to do much more to help eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union on the path to sustainable growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe says in its latest Economic Bulletin published today. Although most eastern European economies are showing signs of recovery from the slump following the revolutions of 1989, output is still falling throughout the former Soviet Union, the ECE notes. It predicts a 2 per cent rise in average gross domestic product in eastern Europe this year but a 16 per cent drop in recorded GDP in Russia and an average drop of nearer 20 per cent for the Commonwealth of Independent States as a whole. The report says the region's long-term growth remains threatened by a dearth of investment in industry and infrastructure. Official help has been minimal and private foreign investors hesitant. 'Private investors simply do not see their role as prime movers in the transition process,' the report says. The ECE, which groups 55 nations in eastern and western Europe, central Asia and North America, calls for more and better targeted aid to remove obstacles to transition to market economies, the basic reason for lack of foreign investment. The west should also quickly remove remaining barriers to eastern exports. Foreign direct investment into eastern Europe was just under Dollars 4bn in 1993 and Dollars 1.3bn in the first half of 1994, the ECE notes. By comparison, Mexico alone received Dollars 3.3bn in FDI in the first six months this year, a 25 per cent increase. At the same time, most transition economies have no access to international capital markets - the exceptions are Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and soon perhaps Poland - and a third have still not qualified for an IMF programme entitling them to loans by international donors. As a consequence, eastern Europe is dependent largely on scarce domestic resources to finance investment, and on exports to pay for needed imports of capital equipment. Exports to the west have risen sharply this year, helped by economic recovery in western Europe and especially Germany, the region's biggest trading partner. However, so-called 'sensitive products' such as steel, textiles and clothing, which account for about half east European exports to the EU, are still subject to restrict ions. Full liberalisation of trade with the west would have a big psychological impact in eastern Europe and among potential foreign investors, the ECE argues. East European exports to the west have risen by almost 40 per cent since 1990, but trade in the other direction has jumped by nearly 80 per cent.</p>

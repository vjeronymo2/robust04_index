[passage omitted]    With regard to the issue of Ukraine's accession to the  nuclear arms nonproliferation treaty, Ivan Plyushch said that  the last time parliament discussed the issue was on 18 November  1993, when it adopted reservations concerning ratification of  the START treaty. Since then, the president of Ukraine has  carried out a great deal of work which resulted in the signing  of the Moscow statement.    Plyushch said the president of Ukraine requested the Supreme  Council to examine the issue of Ukraine's accession to the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty. However, the Supreme Council's  three standing commissions, which met 24 January with the  participation of the working group dealing with ratification of  the treaty, failed to find a common solution.    The parliament speaker said that this afternoon's session of  the Supreme Council will look at the resolution on the state  privatization program for 1994.</p>

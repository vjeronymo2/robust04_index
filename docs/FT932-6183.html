			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Regulation needed to help control executive salaries Sir, Sir Owen Green, former chairman of BTR, has said all that is necessary about the affront to employees and shareholders arising from excessive remuneration of executives. Those of us who naively assumed that one of the aims of the London Stock Exchange was to improve corporate governance will be dismayed by your reports about the salary increases to its former chief executive, and the reference to a pay-off after his resignation ('Exchange paid Rawlins Pounds 348,500', May 24). Shareholders should be even more concerned as the stock exchange is one of the principal paymasters of ProShare, which claims to be representative of their interests - Quis custodiet . . . ? It is sadly now clear that self-regulation is not an option, and that government must take early steps to introduce changes to the Companies Act and to set up a regulator to ensure that executives are made responsible to their shareholders. There are more than enough examples to constitute a big scandal. Derek H Broome, Potters' End, Mears Ashby, Northampton NN6 0DZ</p>

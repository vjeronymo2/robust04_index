Daurenbekov, deputy chairman of the republic </F> State Committee on Statistics: "Increasingly Fewer Job  Vacancies"]    [Text] According to the assessment of the Ministry of  Labor's employment department and the republic State Committee  on Statistics, the situation in the labor market continued to  deteriorate over the past few months.    Beginning last September the number of vacancies reported to  the employment service by enterprises and organizations  continued to decline steadily. Over the elapsed year, of 237,000  persons who have applied to the employment centers, jobs were  found for only 104,500.    The share of nonworking persons among all applicants looking  for a job has increased. More than half of those who applied to  the service last year are women; almost one half (49 percent)  are young people between 16 and 29 years of age. The problem of  their employment remains especially acute in Atyrau, Kzyl-Orda,  East Kazakhstan, and Semipalatinsk Oblasts and the city of  Leninsk.    As a result of the continuing decline in demand for labor  force, the situation deteriorated even further in January: Of  all persons who applied to the employment service, jobs were  found for only one in four; in Atyrau Oblast, approximately one  in 20; in Kzyl-Orda and North Kazakhstan Oblasts--one in nine to  10; and in Aktyubinsk, Semipalatinsk, and Kustanay Oblasts--one  in six to seven. Overall in January 7,300 unemployed were  registered, 45 percent of them rural residents.    A new trend in the labor market should be noted: While last  year the demand for labor systematically exceeded the number of  unemployed (especially in the summer months), as of 1 February  almost 43,000 persons had the status of unemployed. At the same  time the number of job vacancies (those that enterprises and  organizations reported to the employment service offices)  amounted to 28,000, that is, one and a half times less. Another  important point that should be kept in mind is the mismatch  between the supply of and demand for labor by territories,  population centers, and professional skill level.    Of the total number of unemployed, 16,000 (37.4 percent)  were  receiving unemployment benefits; the rest were covered by other  forms of social protection.    The situation with respect to hidden unemployment continues  to worsen as well. According to the oblast employment centers'  data, 1,194 enterprises with a combined labor force of more than  half a million people have halted production partially or fully  or shifted to a shortened work schedule. More than 154,000  persons are on compulsory leave.</p>

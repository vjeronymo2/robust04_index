Hiroshi Oe, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, said that  Japan and China agreed to hold security talks annually and that  talks between the two countries' defense ministries will also be  held beginning early next year.    Tadashi Ikeda, director general of the Asian Affairs Bureau  of the Foreign Ministry, represented Japan in the one-day talks,  which were arranged in a meeting between foreign ministers in  May.    Oe said that both sides acknowledged the importance of  upcoming multilateral talks at an Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) forum on security, also to start next year.    Both sides agreed that the United Nations Cambodian  peacekeeping operation was successful and expressed willingness  to cooperate in the future, Ikeda said.    The Chinese side, represented by Wang Yingfang, director of  the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, said  that China is pursuing its own approach to North Korea  concerning the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, but did  not elaborate, Oe said.    Wang also stressed China's willingness to cooperate in all  nuclear test ban treaties, while emphasizing China's policy of  refusal of first strike capability and refusal to use nuclear  weapons on nonnuclear countries, he said.    He also said that China refused sales of M-11 missile  technology to Pakistan and was appropriately managing its  control of chemical weapons.    China also denied that it is planning to build or buy an  aircraft carrier, Oe said.</p>

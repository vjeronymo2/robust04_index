			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Toyo Shinkin Bank to be split up THE Toyo Shinkin Bank, the Osaka credit co-operative at the centre of a multi-billion dollar loan fraud scheme last summer, is to be split up among the Sanwa Bank and some 22 other credit co-operatives in the Osaka area. Agreement to split the ailing bank came after the Sanwa Bank, which has close links with Toyo, resisted government pressure to take over the entire operation, which included some Y130bn (Dollars 976m) in losses stemming from fraud. The deal, arranged after mediation by the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, will come as a relief to the Sanwa Bank, since the financial burden arising from the scandal will be spread over a wide range of financial institutions. The loan fraud scandal, the biggest in Japanese banking history, arose when Ms Nui Onoue, an Osaka restaurant owner, allegedly borrowed Y250bn from a range of financial institutions using forged deposit certificates from the Toyo Shinkin. The Industrial Bank of Japan, one of Japan's most prestigious banks, was also severely embarrassed by the affair, as its own loans to Ms Onoue had helped increase her credibility in the eyes of the financial community. She was also at one point the largest individual shareholder in the IBJ. The borrowed money is believed to have been used to cover losses in the stock market. Under the scheme, details of which were still emerging last night, 25 of Toyo Shinkin's 30 branches are to be sold to credit co-operatives in the area, with the balance of the business to be taken over by the Sanwa Bank. Both the IBJ and the Fuji Bank will write off 70 per cent of the billions of yen of loans issued to the Toyo Shinkin, and the IBJ has agreed to extend credit to the remainder of the business to help it get back on its feet again. Money from Japan's deposit insurance scheme is also being used to support the deal. A total of Y130bn in loans owed by the Toyo Shinkin are to be written off, including money owed to non-bank institutions that accepted fraudulent Toyo Shinkin paper. The papers were allegedly signed by an officer of the bank without authorisation, and the Toyo Shinkin has been held responsible for them.</p>

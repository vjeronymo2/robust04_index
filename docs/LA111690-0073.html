			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC PANEL OKS UCLA EXPANSION;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: REGENTS ARE EXPECTED TO APPROVE SCALED-DOWN PLAN DESPITE WESTWOOD  RESIDENTS' FEARS OF TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK AND POLLUTION.  </P> <P> Despite protests from Westwood residents about potential traffic gridlock and  pollution, a UC Board of Regents panel Thursday approved plans by UCLA to boost  office, classroom, housing and medical space by as much as 27% while slightly  decreasing student enrollment.  </P> <P> The plan, covering development through the year 2005, could add 3.71 million  square feet of campus facilities -- about one-fifth smaller than the original  proposal. Among previous changes, a controversial proposal for a UCLA  conference center in Westwood with room for 300 overnight guests was dropped as  a result of neighborhood concerns, and an agreement with the city of Los  Angeles to limit traffic was added. The plan is expected to be approved by the  full board today.  </P> <P> In his presentation to the regents, UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young said the  development plan was needed "to relieve crowded conditions in teaching and  research, to replace technologically obsolete facilities and to improve the  quality of campus life."  </P> <P> The regents committee unanimously agreed without discussion.  </P> <P> The action, however, does not guarantee that all, or any, of UCLA's wishes will  become brick and mortar. Each new building will require separate approval, an  uncertainty given voters' rejection last week of a bond issue for university  construction. Officials gave no estimate of the total potential cost, but it  clearly could be more than several hundred million dollars.  </P> <P> Scaling back the plan has not eliminated the anger against it. In a letter to  the regents, Alvin Milder, chairman of a Westwood group called UCLA Watch,  urged that the vote be postponed for further study of the five-volume plan and  the environmental impact statement. Resulting development and traffic would  have "a devastating effect" on the already-crowded neighborhood, he wrote.  </P> <P> Milder and other community activists did not attend the meeting in San  Francisco partly because, they said, they each were given only five minutes to  speak, as is usual for public presentations to the regents, and they considered  approval a certainty.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Milder said the vote "shows that they really have  very little concern about the citizens in the area."  </P> <P> Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, also wrote to the regents, asking  for a sharp reduction in the plan she described as "Godzilla goes to Westwood."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Lake denounced the action and UC's exemption, as a  state entity, from local zoning and growth rules.  </P> <P> "The regents themselves have tunnel vision. They are untouchable and  unaccountable to the public," Lake said. "I think this flags the need for the  Legislature to make them accountable because we are not the only community  getting crushed by the University of California."  </P> <P> However, Young told the regents that UCLA has made "substantial compromises to  accommodate community concerns" by scaling down the plan.  </P> <P> The UCLA plan includes an agreement with the city to limit campus-related  "vehicle trips" to 139,500 daily, an increase of 10,500, and to make more  extensive use of ride-sharing and van pools. That agreement was criticized by  Lake and others because it can be revised if UCLA's educational plans change  significantly.  </P> <P> Originally, UCLA wanted an increase of 526 students from the 34,674 who  attended two years ago. Then, that was cut to an increase of 105. However,  enrollment this year is projected to be 35,100. So the student body would have  to drop by 320 to meet the plan's revised goal of 34,779 over 15 years.  </P> <P> However, the number of faculty and staff would rise by 3,128 to 21,945.  </P> <P> Other highlights of the plan include a residential village for 2,300 graduate  students and 400 faculty on what is now a parking lot between Veteran and  Gayley avenues, land that reaches into Westwood Village; a new hospital  building; a child care center; library expansions and new laboratories. The  main campus boundaries would not expand, leading critics to ask how the  university could build so much and still maintain what Young contends is "a  campus in a garden" atmosphere.  </P> <P> At a press conference during a break in the meeting, officials of the U.S.  Department of Education announced that centers for research in education will  be established at three UC campuses with federal grants totaling $25.6 million  over the next five years. A related $6-million grant for a center at USC is to  be formally announced today.  </P> <P> The center at UCLA would concentrate on student evaluation and testing, one at  UC Santa Cruz on cultural diversity and second language learning, and the one  at UC Berkeley on writing and literacy. USC researchers will look at links  between finance and quality in education. They will be part of a national  network of what is to be 17 such research headquarters.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bank cleared of favour claims FAY, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank, was yesterday cleared by a public inquiry of allegations that as a leading shareholder in Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) it was granted favours relating an urgent NZDollars 42.5m (USDollars 22.31m) loan it received from BNZ in 1990, writes Terry Hall. At the time Fay, Richwhite held around 26.9 per cent of BNZ and was its biggest shareholder, apart from the New Zealand government. Both sold their combined 82.9 per cent holding to National Australia Bank (NAB) last week. The claims were made during investigations into BNZ's affairs between 1985 and 1990 when it faced financial disaster due to NZDollars 2.8bn of bad debts. The investigations followed accusations made in parliament by Mr Winston Peters, a dissident government backbencher. Mr Peters and a dismissed BNZ executive claimed Fay, Richwhite had used undue influence in getting a loan to refinance its Auckland headquarters building, and it was in excess of the BNZ's normal loan to value ratio. Mr Larry Johnson, the BNZ executive, also claimed in an affidavit in parliament he had been intimidated into approving the loan by Sir Michael Fay, who was both a director of the BNZ, and joint managing director of Fay, Richwhite.</p>

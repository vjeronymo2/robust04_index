			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By political editor Mary Binks] </F>   [Text] Britain's door to negotiation with China on  arrangements for Hong Kong's final elections under British rule  officially closed yesterday with the acknowledgement that co-  operation was no longer possible. Until now, Britain and the  Hong Kong administration had adamantly declared the door  remained open to negotiation with China and that the British  side was ready to fly to Beijing at short notice to resume  talks. But yesterday, Chief Secretary Anson Chan conceded the  time for negotiation on constitutional reform was over because  of time constraints governing arrangements for the final  elections under British rule.    Mrs Chan also, for the first time, conceded the possibility  that China might dismantle Hong Kong's political system in 1997.    Mrs Chan cast doubts over her own political future saying  she  would find it difficult to preside over electoral arrangements  which she did not consider fair and open if China dismantled  Hong Kong's three tiers of government in 1997. "We've tried to  give as much time as possible to reach agreement with the  Chinese, that is the reason we decided to push ahead with the  first stage first," Mrs Chan told The Hongkong Standard.    "The first stage dealt with very simple issues which we did  not think the Chinese should have too much diffi culty with and  the whole purpose of that was to buy ourselves more time so we  could continue talks with the Chinese on more complex issues.  "At the moment there is a considerable gap between the Chinese  view and the British Hong Kong view. It is unfortunate that  there has been no agreement but now we have no choice but to  push ahead."    The Executive Council will on Tuesday endorse Governor Chris  Patten's decision to push ahead with the remainder of his  constitutional reform package, to be gazetted as early as next  Friday and tabled on 9 March.    While Mr Patten has called China's bluff over its threats to  disband the three tiers of government in 1997, Mrs Chan is more  pragmatic. She warned Beijing that continuity in Hong Kong was  crucial to the transfer of sovereignty, both politically and  economically. "I would hope that if we had in place  arrangements that would ensure fair, open elections that in the  interests of preserving Hong Kong's prosperity and stability  they would not be dismantled after the 1st July 1997."    Mrs Chan said she would personally find it difficult to  remain in a government which presided over "unfair" electoral  arrangements. However she stated, she was not expecting that to  occur.    Mrs Chan hoped she would not be regarded by the Chinese  leadership as a subversive for supporting political reform which  although enshrined in the Joint Declaration was implemented  without Beijing's consent. "I find it very difficult to read  the thoughts of the Chinese," she said. "I hope they will  regard every single member of the civil service as doing what  they regard as in the best interests of Hong Kong."    She intended to serve in government until her retirement at  60 in the year 2,000. "According to the Joint Declaration,  provided that we uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to  the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government, I  can't see any reason why serving civil servants could not  continue after 1997. We don't want to see a wholesale  replacement of senior officials on 1 July 1997."    Mrs Chan however did not discount being a candidate for the  position of Chief Executive of the post-1997 SAR.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading The futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was sold back yesterday prompting a gentle slide in the underlying equity index on the last day of the current trading account, writes Peter John. The contract for December, which expires on Friday opened lower at 3,273 and was pushed up 20 points in early trading. But the gains proved unsustainable and the contract fell back throughout the day to end a net 5 points lower at 3,268 on turnover of only 11,000 lots. The spread between the December and March contract widened to 21 points against a broad fair value estimate of some 14 points. The wide spread has discouraged many traders from rolling over positions. Volume in traded options fell back with only 35,000 lots dealt by the close of business, less than half of which represented the Footsie. The most heavily traded stock option was British Steel with just over 2,000 contracts changing hands.</p>

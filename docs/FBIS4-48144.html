			<p>BFN     [Text] The government and the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] could return to the negotiating  table tomorrow. Contrary to what had been planned, the document  drafted by the mediator, regarding the UN role, was not  discussed today. What is known is that the talks will resume  tomorrow. Sources close to the mediator say the document to be  discussed tomorrow is not a very difficult one. The source said  if the government and UNITA show goodwill, a new UN Angola  Verification Mission mandate could be approved tomorrow.</p>

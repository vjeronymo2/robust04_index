			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Benetton launches L200bn deal with 'knock-out warrants' THE INTERNATIONAL bond market saw plenty of activity yesterday as borrowers  -consisting mainly of corporate names - launched an assortment of equity-linked and straight bond issues. Benetton, Italy's best-known maker of casual clothes, issued L200bn of Eurobonds with 'knock-out warrants' through its Dutch subsidiary, Benetton International NV. The money raised will be used mainly to refinance maturing medium-term debt and outstanding short-term debt. Benetton is following in the footsteps of Roche Holdings, the US financing arm of the Swiss drugs group, which did a Dollars 1bn issue in March with knock-out warrants. The deal is intended to 'offer participation in the upside potential of the Benetton share whilst affording conditional protection against downside movement, at a discount of approximately 3 - 5 per cent to the share price', according to Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager of the issue. The bonds have a five-year maturity and a coupon in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent. Each principal amount of L5m of bonds has between 57 and 65 knock-out warrants attached, with each warrant corresponding to one ordinary Benetton share. Several Japanese borrowers tapped the market using convertible bonds and bonds with warrants yesterday. However, dealers stressed that the timing of these issues had been arranged several weeks in advance and were 'not opportunistic' in terms of the underlying market conditions. Elsewhere, Asea Brown Boveri International Finance, part of the European power engineering group, tapped the Eurolira sector with a 10-year L250bn deal. The bonds have a 10 per cent coupon, reversing a recent trend away from double-digit coupons in this particular sector. ABB has a credit rating of AA/AA2, but in recent days some triple-A names have come to the Eurolira market with coupons of 9.5 to 9.75 per cent.</p>

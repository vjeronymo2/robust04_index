Japan and Russia have been working out the schedule for the  trip after Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and  his Russian counterpart Aleksandr Panov earlier this week agreed  on Hata's visit in March. Fukuda and Panov agreed during two  days of meetings in Moscow to promote political dialogue between  the two nations and continue talks on a long-standing  territorial dispute involving four Russian-held islands off  Hokkaido.    Conditions for Hata's visit were set after Yeltsin vowed  Thursday in an address to Parliament to continue efforts to  settle the territorial row with Japan and conclude a peace  treaty, the officials said.    Japan claims sovereignty over Etorofu, Kunashiri and  Shikotan  islands and the Habomai group of islets, which the former Soviet  Union seized at the end of World War II. The dispute has  prevented the two sides from concluding a peace treaty.    But analysts say Tokyo and Moscow are unlikely to achieve  any  major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's visit  because ultrarightists and conservatives, opposed to returning  the islands to Japan, dominate the new Russian Parliament.    During his visit, Hata may also meet Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of Parliament, the  officials said.    Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for Russia's  reform  efforts and shift toward a market-oriented economy in his talks  with Russian leaders, they said.    He is also likely to discuss promoting personnel exchanges  between the two nations, they said.</p>

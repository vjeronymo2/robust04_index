			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Retail sales edge upwards in 'fragile' climate SHOP SALES are steadily edging upwards, even though the sector's commercial performance last month was patchy, according to government figures released yesterday. In the three months to the end of August, seasonally-adjusted retail volumes increased 1 per cent compared with the previous three months and by 3.8 per cent on the corresponding period last year. However, sales volumes in August were up just 0.1 per cent on the month before, when volumes fell 0.3 per cent on June. Shops selling clothes and shoes, and those selling a mixture of food and non-edible items, performed particularly weakly in August, according to the Central Statistical Office's figures. The data underlines how retail sales, which account for about a quarter of gross domestic product, are continuing their pattern of slow upward movement in line with signs of economic recovery. In the three months to the end of May, volumes increased 0.9 per cent compared with the previous three months, while between December last year and February the three-monthly increase was 0.6 per cent. Between July and August, food shops saw a 0.4 per cent increase in their sales, while 'mixed retail' stores suffered a downturn of 0.3 per cent. The British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, said many shops were experiencing 'difficult trading conditions', in spite of signs of an end to recession. People remained reluctant to buy non-essential items, a sign that consumer confidence was 'fragile'. In the area of clothing and footwear, where sales volumes slipped 1.1 per cent between July and August, the consortium said: 'Basic necessity clothing did comparatively well while the more exotic, less 'necessary' designer end fared badly.' Sales last month of recorded music, videos, furniture and carpets were poor, while stores selling DIY goods experienced only modest growth. A bright spot was that the large numbers of tourists in August pushed up sales in many big London stores, a trend helped by the continuing weakness of the pound.</p>

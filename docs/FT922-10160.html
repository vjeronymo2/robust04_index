			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities Talk of lower UK base rates has a certain aptness for the equity market. On Wednesday, the FT-All Share index closed at an all-time high. The previous record, set last September, was reached just two days after base rates were cut to their present level of 10.5 per cent. But in real terms, the market is still sadly adrift. To match last year's peak adjusted for inflation, the All Share would have to be 6 per cent higher than it is now. To match its previous peak in 1987, it would have to be 30 per cent higher. In terms of the FT-SE, that would require a rise of some 800 points. Not even the most bullish broking houses expect a rise of much more than 300 points by the year end. Then again, that in itself suggests that the market is not wildly overpriced. This week, it repeated its performance of the week before by struggling a fraction higher in heavy trading. Plainly, the market is adjusting to the realities of weak and non-inflationary recovery. Even a half point cut in base rates would scarcely be grounds for a change of view.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Motoring: VW's pollution-beater Can a diesel-engined car really cause less atmospheric pollution than a battery-electric vehicle? It seems unlikely, but according to Volkswagen, it is true, subject to a couple of qualifications. The diesel car must be a Golf Ecomatic and the batteries have to be charged with current generated by burning fossil fuels. If the power station's boilers are fired with a particularly dirty fuel  - like some kinds of low-grade coal - the Ecomatic will be even cleaner than a battery car. Only when it runs on a charge generated by nuclear or hydro-electricity can a battery car beat the Ecomatic for environmental friendliness. The secret of the the Ecomatic's spectacular cleanliness? It works like a free-wheeling cyclist, using energy only when needed. Fuel wastage and air pollution are reduced by the engine shutting itself off when power is not needed to accelerate or maintain speed, or when the car is standing still. In essence, the Ecomatic is a normal Golf powered by a 1.9-litre diesel engine with exhaust catalyser and a five-speed gearbox. It has only accelerator and brake pedals because the clutch works automatically. When the driver lifts off the accelerator, the engine cuts out, restarting when the pedal is pressed. When I tried an Ecomatic, I found it almost as relaxing as a proper automatic. It was easier to drive than a car with a normal clutch and much quieter because, even in moderately heavy traffic, the engine was off more than on. As a bonus, a light came on to indicate the most economical time to change up a gear. The result of all this is an achievable urban cycle fuel consumption of under 51 / 100km, which is close to 60mpg and makes the Ecomatic almost a teetotaller among cars. Indeed, Britain's offical Warren Spring environmental laboratory called it the cleanest car it had ever tested. The Golf Ecomatic will be on sale later this year. Sadly, it is expected to cost about Pounds 1,000 more than a normal Golf 1.9-litre diesel because sophisticated electronic controls and limited production runs do not come cheaply. In addition to the engine and clutch management electronics, the Ecomatic needs extra electrical kit to keep the power steering and brake servo working when the engine is not running. Also, it must have an extra battery to cope with the power drain of continual re-starting and the use of headlamps and heated rear window with a dead engine. The Ecomatic can, of course, be driven long distances at motorway cruising speeds exactly like the normal diesel car it is, but VW thinks its most sensible use would be as a town car. All of which brings me back to the battery-electric cars I was discussing last week and, specifically, to the large-scale feasability study being conducted by the French motor industry and the national power generating company, EDF. Driving a Peugeot 106 battery car in La Rochelle, I had a taste of motoring's future and I think it really could work, given application of a legal stick and financial carrot. The PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) has provided 50 battery-electric cars - 25 each of the 106s and Citroen AXs - and EDF has developed a recharging infrastructure. Batteries which give a range of around 50 miles (80km) normally are recharged overnight at users' homes. During the day, they can be perked up in a few hours at points in car parks operated by 'smart' cards, or given a 15-minute boost - good for another nine-12 miles (15-20km)  -at Total service stations. The electric cars are being rented (for around Pounds 100 a month) by such people as doctors, government officials and businessmen, who will commute in them to their offices in La Rochelle from their homes up to 25 miles (40km) away. The rent includes the nickel-cadmium battery pack, which is reckoned to last for up to 10 years and will eventually cost more than Pounds 5,000, at today's prices, to replace. Users pay for their own electricity. A home charge, good for 50 miles (80km), costs around Pounds 1.25; daytime top-ups come dearer. As a sweetener, La Rochelle city council is waiving parking charges for battery car users, although it will not let them use bus lanes or park with impunity on single yellow lines. PSA will manufacture up to 5,000 battery-electric 106s and AXs this year. It thinks that if the authorities increase the heat on city-centre drivers using cars with petrol or diesel engines, total European production of electric cars by the year 2000 could be 200,000 units. Of this, PSA might have a 25 per cent share. No one spoke about costs because the whole thing is a test marketing exercise. When a limited number of battery 106s and AXs go on public sale later this year, they must - unless subsidised - cost more than petrol or diesel equivalents. They go remarkably well, though. The 106 I drove was power-steered and, on a length of dual carriageway, I saw 90kph (56mph) on the speedometer. Tyre swish apart, it was virtually silent. It rode like a heavily-laden car (remember those batteries) but was as easy to drive as a golfer's caddy car. The main problem was avoiding pedestrians who could not hear it approach. As a family's second or third car, a battery-electric 106 or AX would have a lot going for it as a very short-range runabout. But, until vehicles with internal combustion engines are banned from environmentally sensitive areas such as city centres, an Ecomatic has to make more sense. You need only to fill its tank with diesel to drive it non-stop for 500 miles (805km). And you could remind yourself that unless you lived in France or Switzerland, which produce nearly all their electricity by nuclear or water power, you would be driving an environmentally cleaner vehicle.</p>

Speaking to East Midlands area party members, Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, also announced the appointment of two advisers: Sir Allen Shephard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, and Mr Richard Simmons, a senior partner of Arthur Anderson, the accountants and management consultants.

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURSE'S ENGLISH-ONLY SUIT  </P> <P> In "Nursing Profession in Need of Transfusion" (Metro, Feb. 25), staff writer  Kenneth Garcia cites the national nursing shortage as a key factor impacting  our troubled health care network and presents long-term solutions to the  problem (i.e, better pay, upgrade in status, improved working conditions).  Garcia, however, neglects to identify a primary impediment to the immediate  improvement of this state of affairs, namely the absence of congressional  action to change our immigration laws to allow a flow of highly qualified and  dedicated foreign nurses to enter the U.S. medical system now -- before matters  worsen.  </P> <P> In a move that squelches overt accusations of apathy on its part, the U.S.  House Immigration Subcommittee enacted the Immigration Nursing Relief Act in  September, 1989. The bill purports to relieve short-term needs by allowing a  restricted cadre of foreign nurses to adjust their status on temporary H-1  visas while maintaining a 6-year cap to their stay.  </P> <P> What has received little if any attention, though, is the unprecedented  administrative and financial burdens imposed on our already overburdened  health-care providers if they turn toward foreign recruitment.  </P> <P> As an example, the bill requires that a series of annual attestations be filed  documenting the institutions' efforts to fill nurse quotas with U.S. citizens.  Some of the requirements are laudable, such as the required  hospital-administered training programs.  </P> <P> It is beyond sound economic reasoning, however, that the bill demands that our  hospitals first offer U.S. RN's salary compensation above prevailing local  rates. Similarly unjustified is the INS disclosure that this is "not to be  considered an exclusive list of requirements" after all. So go ahead, buddy.  Take your chances.  </P> <P> Before a labor-strapped institution can access the substantial foreign-born  nurse pool, it must also consider that these attestations are considered public  documents and are therefore open to the scrutiny and investigation of the U.S.  Department of Labor. Projecting this precariousness further, unions and other  "aggrieved" parties are welcome to file complaints and demand administrative  hearings regarding those grievances -- subjecting the hospital to the  possibility of civil monetary penalties and administrative sanctions.  </P> <P> In short, the overall effect is further deterioration of the nursing crisis by  making it more difficult -- and tenuous -- to petition for foreign-born  professionals.  </P> <P> While improved wages and working conditions will help revive the U.S. nursing  profession for the long-haul, legal immigration reform must be instituted if  our health-care needs are to be met adequately in the not-so-distant future.  </P> <P> Considering what's at risk, we owe it to ourselves to support our medical  institutions in making this clear to Congress.  </P> <P> RUTH SHAMIR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

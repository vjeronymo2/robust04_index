These meetings discussed a wide range of problems stemming  from the need to continue the reform in the Armed Forces  following the adoption of the budget. In a special session, the  leaderships of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff made a  comprehensive analysis of the issues raised by servicemen during  the above meetings. The most severe problems are finding rented  living accommodation for officers on the free market, and the  prospects as regards pay and housing policy. This issue of  improved everyday conditions for the soldiers also awaits a  solution. Particular attention was paid to the need to speed up  structural reform in the Armed Forces.    The Defense Ministry leadership expressed the conviction  that  the defining of clear prospects for the Army in the future is of  decisive importance as regards motivating the personnel and  increasing the combat readiness of the Armed Forces.    Notwithstanding the limited budget possibilities, the  minister of defense has ordered proposals to be prepared on  solving the most pressing problems.

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> FOUR ARE INJURED IN PILEUP AT OFF-RAMP  </P> <P> Four people were injured early Sunday when a car crashed into an overheated car  being pushed by three men along a freeway off-ramp. A spokeswoman for the  California Highway Patrol said a car driven by Young Ko, 41, of Irvine struck  the disabled car about 1:20 a.m. on the Culver Drive off-ramp from the  southbound lanes of the Santa Ana Freeway. Ko apparently did not see the  vehicle as it was being pushed from the side and rear by Salvador S. Figueroa,  32, of San Gabriel; Carlos Ramos, 21, also of San Gabriel; and a young man CHP  officers have not yet identified. Figueroa, who suffered broken bones and  internal injuries, was listed in satisfactory condition at Fountain Valley  Regional Hospital and Medical Center. Ramos is in fair condition with similar  injuries. Ko is in stable condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. The  unidentified man was taken to Humana Hospital-Huntington Beach, where he  remains in stable condition.  </P></p>

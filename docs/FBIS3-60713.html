			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Novovoronezh nuclear plant is close to being  partially or completely shut down. It is one of nine plants  providing lighting and heating for Russia. Its contribution to  the country's power system is 12 percent. In the central and  black earth region the Novovoronezh plant provides 75 percent of  the power needed by the region. Systematic nonpayments by  consumers are the reason for the possible shutdown: the  nonpayments slow down the reconstruction and modernization of  the station's power sets. There are not sufficient funds to  improve safety guarantees. [passage omitted]</p>

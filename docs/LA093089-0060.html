			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE  </P> <P> Your art review of Max Yavno ("Of Muscles and Old Men: Max Yavno's 200 Views,"  Sept. 9) perpetuates the myth that the black-and-white photographs by Yavno and  others were the result of "waiting patiently for the moment when the atmosphere  of a locale would crystallize into a single image."  </P> <P> I liked to believe this romantic image until I had the opportunity to talk with  Yavno at an exhibition of his work in the early 1980s. I asked him if he had,  indeed, waited until the time was right, the woman thrown in the air, the man  lifting the child, etc. to take his famous "Muscle Beach" photo you displayed  on your front page.  </P> <P> Yavno looked at me with disdain. "Are you crazy?" he challenged, irascibly. "I  took hundreds of pictures that day. I don't even remember taking that specific  picture. I didn't wait for anything. This was just one of hundreds and it just  happened to turn out to be good."  </P> <P> So much for fanciful fables.  </P> <P> H. ANTHONY MEDLEY  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

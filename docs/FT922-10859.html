			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Plastiseal dives into red after poor second half PLASTISEAL, which manufactures windows and doors, mainly for the public sector, dipped sharply into the red last year following poor sales in the second half. The USM-traded company incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 780,000 for the 12 months to January 31, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 269,000 (Pounds 520,000), as profits of Pounds 496,000 on property disposals were offset by closure and re-organisation costs of Pounds 765,000. Properties worth a further Pounds 700,000 are being held for resale. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 310,000 last time and Pounds 438,000 at the interim stage. Turnover fell to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 18m). There was an operating loss of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 1.15m profit). Mr Anthony Marson, who took over as chairman this month, said that the company was affected by lower local authority and Property Services Agency spending. However, he said that there has been a slight improvement since the election and that the company is expected to return to profit this year. Interest charges increased to Pounds 364,000 (Pounds 320,000) on net borrowings of about Pounds 3.5m. Year-end gearing went above 100 per cent, due to seasonal factors, but it has since been reduced. Mr Michael Price, one of the two former joint chairmen, has resigned. The other, Mr Howard Manttan, becomes managing director. The Nuneaton head office is being closed down while uPVC window manufacturing has been transferred from Bury to Coventry. Losses per share emerged at 6.2p (earnings 2.4p) and the final dividend is passed, leaving a total of 1.5p.</p>

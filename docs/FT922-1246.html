			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (6): Regulations relaxed - Foreign Investment FOREIGN investment is no luxury for Indonesia. 'Every year we have to create 2.4m new job opportunities,' says Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, chairman of the Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM). 'That's the population of the Republic of Singapore. That's why we invite foreign investors and domestic investors to build new factories.' With this in mind, and in the face of continuing competition from other capital-hungry developing countries, the government announced a liberalisation of foreign investment rules in April. Henceforth, foreigners can start with 100 per cent ownership of a project either if it has a paid-up capital of at least Dollars 50m, or if it is sited outside the main island of Java and the more developed parts of Sumatra. This is in accordance with the government's efforts to spread development to the remoter reaches of the archipelago, or if the project is located in a designated industrial park in Java or Sumatra and all production is for export. Within five years of start-up, the investors must sell at least 5 per cent to Indonesian interests, usually rising to 20 per cent within 20 years. Regulations for existing investors have also been relaxed. Previously, 100 per cent foreign investments were allowed only on the bonded island of Batam near Singapore. Potential foreign investors will welcome the new rules if they are properly implemented, partly because the revised regulations reduce the need for political connections when launching a project and allow more time for the difficult task of finding a suitable local partner. 'I think they are very happy about it,' says Mr Sastrowardoyo. 'We do hope that many more foreign investors will come to Indonesia, because now they don't have the immediate difficulty of finding the Indonesian partner and they can select calmly and systematically within five years.' The BKPM, which covers all investments except for oil, gas and finance, approved Dollars 3bn worth of new foreign investment in the first four months of this year, which compares favourably with the figures of Dollars 8.7bn and Dollars 8.8bn reported in 1990 and 1991 respectively. In the past 25 years, half the foreign investment approvals by value have actually been implemented. 'We can say optimistically that by the end of this year the level (of foreign investment approvals) will be the same as in the last two years,' says Mr Sastrowardoyo. The government's 'tight money' policy, however, has sharply reduced domestic investment and officials fear that foreign investment will also be curtailed by the slowdown of the world economy and Japan's financial turmoil. Indonesia's low labour costs remain particularly attractive - workers have complained that some Korean employers do not even pay the legal minimum - so much so that questions have been raised about whether Indonesia is getting a sufficient return from its manufactured exports. Sports shoes from dozens of Indonesian factories, for example, are exported through Singapore middlemen. 'The production costs of a pair of Nike or Reebok shoes or whatever are only Dollars 6-Dollars 7 a pair,' says Mr Sastrowardoyo, 'while the same pair sells in Europe or the US for Dollars 70-Dollars 85.' As in other south-east Asian countries, the transport and communications infrastructure has been overwhelmed by rapid economic expansion. Mr Sastrowardoyo acknowledges that there are complaints about electricity supplies but he says investors know that infrastructural deficiencies are temporary, and they can pay extra for their own supply. Political stability has always been high on the list of investors' worries about Indonesia and it is difficult to say if the recent troubles in Thailand will exacerbate those fears (by highlighting the instability of the region's under-developed political systems) or allay them (by suggesting that Indonesia is no worse than supposedly stable Thailand). 'The Indonesian political system has provided stability and room for discussion,' said one prophetic stockbroker in Jakarta before the clashes between troops and demonstrators in Bangkok last month.' Gross domestic product has increased steadily. There has been a shift from oil to non-oil export growth. Yet we come to 1992 and Indonesia's political risk rating is far higher than, say, Thailand.' A complicating factor for large foreign investments in Indonesia is the government's understandable concern about its foreign debt, which has risen 44 per cent in three years to some Dollars 75bn. The government set ceilings on foreign borrowing in October, postponed several large investments, including four petrochemical projects, and redoubled its efforts to persuade investors to finance their projects with equity rather than loans. One of the petrochemical projects, the Chandra Asri plant backed by President Suharto's second son, was subsequently reprieved on condition that it be scaled down and transferred to foreign ownership. The new investment rules were announced later, leading to charges that the liberalisation was designed to legitimise, post facto, a go-ahead for Chandra Asri. Other large investments in the pipeline include foreign bids for units of the Paiton power complex, the proposed Dollars 1bn Exor III refinery on Bintan Island (a joint venture between BP and C. Itoh), two US chemical plants and two US banana projects, Mr Sastrowardoyo says. There are no immediate plans to provide further ownership incentives for foreign investors. 'That's it for the time being,' says Mr Sastrowardoyo. 'We are going to move in another direction. We are going to simplify our negative list.' The number of sectors restricted for new investment fell to 60 last year from 75 in 1989 and there are plans to reduce the figure further. Indonesian officials are hoping that any decline in Japanese interest will be compensated for by countries such as Taiwan (which had the highest value of investment approvals last year) or by western companies anxious to establish a springboard for exports into the rest of Asia. Mr Radius Prawiro, the minister responsible for overseeing the economy, says the focus of Indonesia's trade is moving away from commodity exports to Europe and energy exports to the US towards closer links with the Asia Pacific region. 'Our trade with Asia and the Pacific now takes 70 to 75 per cent of our exports,' he says. 'This makes our country attractive for non-Asian investment.'</p>

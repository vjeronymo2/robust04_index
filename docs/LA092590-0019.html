			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE LINK TO MISSING WOMAN IS INVESTIGATED;  </P> <P> CRIME: HOMICIDE TASK FORCE HAS SEARCHED THE PROPERTY OF A SERGEANT, SEEKING  CLUES TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A PROSTITUTE AND FRIEND OF DONNA GENTILE.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force is investigating the relationship between  San Diego police officers and a prostitute who disappeared four years ago, The  Times has learned.  </P> <P> Gary Schons, a deputy state attorney general and task force member, confirmed  Monday that the disappearance of Cynthia Maine has been included as part of a  broad investigation of the murders of 43 women, mostly prostitutes, over a  five-year period.  </P> <P> Last week, task force investigators searched the home, desk, car and locker of  a San Diego police sergeant, looking for photographs tying Maine to several  police officers and to slain prostitute Donna Gentile, according to a source  familiar with the investigation.  </P> <P> The source told The Times that Maine, the daughter of former San Diego Police  Officer Kenneth Maine, was a close friend of Gentile, whose death in 1985 was  the first prostitute murder in the series.  </P> <P> The homicide task force, composed of investigators from the San Diego County  district attorney's office, the San Diego Police Department, the county  Sheriff's Department and the state attorney general's office, has been  investigating whether San Diego police officers killed Gentile.  </P> <P> At a press conference early this month, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis, the  task force spokeswoman, said the attorney general's office would be looking at  police misconduct based on information that "more than one officer was involved  with Donna Gentile."  </P> <P> Just before she was killed, Gentile testified against two officers, one of whom  was fired and the other demoted. Four months before her death, she predicted in  a tape-recorded conversation that she might be harmed by "someone in uniform  with a badge."  </P> <P> Schons and other task force officials refused to comment on any details of the  investigation of Maine's disappearance.  </P> <P> Maine was the daughter of Kenneth Maine, who served on the force from 1967 to  1973. Kenneth Maine, who has since died, was sentenced to 18 months in federal  prison and fined $5,000 in 1979 for his role in the scandal of a financial  company operated by San Diego financier Joseph Bello.  </P> <P> Maine was indicted on 35 counts that charged he and Bello with bilking 1,200  investors out of about $20 million through MB Financial, an allegedly phony  insurance investment scheme. Bello was sentenced to seven years in federal  prison, but served only about 40 months before he was released.  </P> <P> The homicide task force is split into three areas: One branch is focusing  solely on Gentile; another is investigating the other 42 murders; the third is  looking at possible police misconduct.  </P> <P> Gentile's death long has bothered top police officials, particularly Chief Bob  Burgreen, who detached Norm Stamper, his second in command, to personally  supervise the investigation.  </P> <P> "There is no slaying in this city that has bothered me more than the murder of  Donna Gentile," Burgreen said in a June interview with The Times. "And, if  indeed a police officer was involved in murder, I want him arrested and I want  him put behind bars."  </P> <P> Gentile's nude and battered body was discovered east of Sunrise Highway in East  County, her mouth stuffed with gravel, which some investigators interpreted to  mean she had been killed in retaliation for her testimony at a police civil  service hearing.  </P> <P> Cynthia Maine disappeared in 1986. A source said the task force has been  investigating her disappearance "for about a year."  </P> <P> But the source said investigators just last week searched a police sergeant's  home for evidence linking Maine to several officers.  </P> <P> Four months before Gentile's death, Gentile tape-recorded a message while  sitting in the Las Colinas women's jail, where she was taken after being  convicted of soliciting for prostitution. When her body was found and  identified, her attorney released the tape to the media.  </P> <P> "In case I disappear, I want my lawyer to give this to the press," she said on  the tape. "I have no intention of disappearing or going out of town without  letting my lawyer know first. Because of the publicity that I have given a  police scandal, this is the reason why I'm making this. . . .  </P> <P> "I feel someone in a uniform with a badge can still be a serious criminal."  </P> <P> The Times reported in June that police officers were expecting criminal  prosecutions against the department. One source said he was told to expect  "some indictments soon against some rather high-ranking San Diego police  officials."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard A. Serrano contributed to this report.  </P></p>

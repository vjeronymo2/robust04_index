			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / BCCI creditors face long delay after court ruling: Appeal against liquidators' plans upheld in Luxembourg THOUSANDS of creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International may face a delay of several more years before receiving any compensation for the millions they lost when the bank collapsed. This follows a surprise decision by the Luxembourg courts yesterday upholding an appeal against plans by the liquidators for an agreement with Abu Dhabi which could have led to a payout next year. The decision represented a victory for three individual creditors who have persistently argued in the English and Luxembourg courts against the liquidators' agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank. It jeopardises the agreement by which Abu Dhabi would have contributed more than Dollars 1.7bn to the liquidators for distribution to creditors, in exchange for a waiver of all legal claims against it. Mr Brian Smouha, one of threeliquidators to BCCI appointed by the Luxembourg courts and the man who negotiated the agreement with Abu Dhabi, warned that the decision might trigger legal actions and delay payments for as much as 10 years. 'We were disappointed,' said Mr Smouha, a partner with accountants Touche Ross. 'This has caused there to be no money in the hands of the creditors. Now they can face only uncertainties.' Mr Keith Vaz, the opposition Labour MP who has championed the cause of BCCI creditors, called for the UK government to intervene in bringing about a settlement. But Downing Street said last night that the government was not a party to the Luxembourg hearing, and would not be involved in further legal action. It said compensation was a matter for Touche Ross, the liquidator, 'if they want to take it further'. Judge Raul Gretsch told the Luxembourg court of appeal yesterday morning: 'The appeal is justified and the liquidators have no right to sign an agreement.' The ruling has destroyed the prospect of a ballot by the liquidators of BCCI's estimated 530,000 worldwide creditors on their plans, which could have led to a payment of 15p in the pound to creditors next August. The Luxembourg liquidators are due to meet today to discuss their options in advance of a meeting of BCCI liquidators around the world on Wednesday and Thursday next week. They will consider appealing the judgment, attempting to renegotiate with Abu Dhabi, or suing it to gain more money. But Mr Julien Roden, one of the Luxembourg liquidators, yesterday appeared to rule out an appeal. 'The court has decided. We are court-appointed liquidators and we will follow what the court has decided - that's my first reaction,' he said. Mr Adil Elias, one of the three creditors who brought the appeal, said: 'We had confidence that the Luxembourg courts would listen.' He said his action was brought on behalf of 1,000 creditors from 24 countries in the Depositors' Protection Association who are owed Dollars 500m. He said they had supported him 'financially and emotionally' during the case, which had cost 'a few million'. Liquidators try to put brave face on ruling, Page 6</p>

The Dniester side virtually refuses to fulfill the  assumed commitment, namely, to implement the Moldovan-Russian  accord signed on 21 July 1992, which refers to the peaceful  settlement of the conflict, said President Snegur.    In the security zone that has been instituted on both banks  of the Dniester River, the separatists of Tiraspol recently  deployed numerous military formations, motorized, infantry, or  rocket units, the president of the Republic of Moldova also  announced, adding that the situation has worsened even more due  to the proclamation of the state of emergency that led to the  enclosing of the local population within a real reservation.    Further, Mr. Mircea Snegur referred to the violation of  human  rights by the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic, who, not wishing to cooperate in the activity of  finding political solutions to the conflict, can organize other  provocative acts that might end with new bloodshed.    The appeal concluded with the following words, quote, we  will  not admit solutions to the current problems through the use of  force. The responsibility for the eventual consequences of the  provocations rests with the leaders in Tiraspol, end quote.    A declaration with a similar content was issued today also  by  the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Moldova.    Also in Chisinau, the Central Electoral Commission, which  will supervise the elections, held a meeting and examined issues  connected with electoral lists and the regulations regarding the  statute of the representatives of the parties and independent  candidates.    Likewise, the meeting discussed a request submitted by Ilie  Ilascu [Tiraspol detainee], candidate on behalf of the Alliance  of the Christian Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, who  requests that appropriate conditions should be created so that  he can address the electorate in accordance with the legal  provisions. The Central Electoral Commission suggested that the  request should be submitted to President of the Republic of  Moldova Mircea Snegur and ask him, in his capacity of head of  state, to intervene and fulfill candidate Ilie Ilascu's request.  In this respect, a decision of the Central Electoral Commission  will probably be taken tomorrow, Radio Chisinau reported.</p>

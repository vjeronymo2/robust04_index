			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ABSOLVES WEATHER SERVICE OF BLAME IN '85 DELTA PLANE CRASH THAT KILLED  137  </P> <P> A federal judge, saying the crew was negligent for trying to land during a  severe thunderstorm, on Friday absolved the National Weather Service and air  traffic controllers of negligence in the 1985 crash of a Delta Air Lines  jetliner.  </P> <P> In a 72-page opinion, U.S. District Judge David O. Belew Jr. said Delta "failed  to prove that the United States of America was guilty of any negligence."  </P> <P> In the longest major aviation trial in U.S. history, attorneys for Delta argued  that the weather service was to blame for the crash at Dallas-Ft. Worth  International Airport because crew members did not have sufficient warning  about the severity of a thunderstorm at the airport.  </P> <P> The Lockheed L-1011, en route from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Dallas, crashed  while trying to land on Aug. 2, 1985, when it was caught in a downburst of  wind, killing 137 people.  </P> <P> A National Transportation Safety Board investigation had blamed wind shear for  the crash.  </P> <P> But in his ruling, Belew said the crew of Delta Flight 191 knew, or should have  known, that there was severe weather on the approach to the airport, and that  the thunderstorms were likely to cause dangerous wind shear, an abrupt change  in wind direction and force.  </P> <P> Belew said that "attempting to land the aircraft in a thunderstorm constituted  negligence on the part of the crew of DL-191, and proximately caused the  crash."  </P> <P> Although air traffic controllers failed to route the jet to another runway, the  judge said that failure did not constitute negligence.  </P> <P> The airline had sought to make the government pay all or part of the millions  of dollars in claims arising from the crash. The Atlanta-based airline said it  would appeal the decision, noting that it was "in direct conflict with the  recent jury verdict . . . in Ft. Lauderdale holding Delta blameless in all  respects for the accident."  </P> <P> Delta "continues to believe that the facts surrounding this case clearly  establish total government responsibility for the tragic accident."  </P> <P> The trial began in March, 1988, and lasted almost 14 months, although it  recessed several times so Belew could clear backlogged criminal cases.  </P> <P> The government argued that the flight crew did not heed FAA tower warnings, did  not ask for weather information and decided to fly into the storm. The  government also said the jet's radar should have warned the pilots of weather  conditions.  </P> <P> Delta has paid at least $66 million in death, injury and damage claims from the  Flight 191 crash, but in those cases survivors waived the issue of liability.  In the only previous case that considered liability, a U.S. District Court jury  in Ft. Lauderdale determined that Delta was blameless in the crash.  </P></p>

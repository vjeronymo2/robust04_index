			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Choe Won-sok] </F>   [Text] The slight but steady decline of the Japanese yen's  value against the U.S. dollar is alarming Korean business  concerns which have already set their business plans for this  year out of the assumption that the Japanese currency may  further appreciate.    They are of the opinion that they will have to adjust their  projected investments and turnout and export goals downwards in  case the present depreciation trend of the yen against the  greenback continues.    They fear that their business projects set for the year  won't  be able to be carried out as scheduled.    To cope with the impact of the changing value of the  Japanese  currency on their business, they are strengthening their  international financing teams as a way to reinforce their roles  in estimating foreign exchange fluctuations.    They are also groping for steps for each of their products  to  counter the clout of the yen's depreciation. But they are  troubled as they have not found practical measures as yet.    They estimated the exchange rate of the Japanese currency  against the U.S. dollar at the onset of the year at 105-107 yen  per greenback, while predicting the yen's value would drop in  the second half of the year.    They were unanimous in believing that even though the value  of the yen against the U.S. dollar drops, the exchange rate will  not fall below 110 yen per greenback.    Based on their conjecture of how the value of the yen will  fluctuate, they mapped out their business plans for the year  including their export and total sales targets.    However, their estimation of the yen's value against the  greenback proved wrong from the start of the year as the parity  rate hovers between 112-113 yen per collar at present.    On Jan. 4, the exchange rate soared to 113.27 yen per  dollar.  It dropped to 112 yen yesterday.    Some monetary experts even forecast that the parity rate  would soon rise to the level of 120 yen per dollar. The  depreciation of the Japanese currency to the 120 yen level will  deal a deadly blow to Korean products in international markets.    Last year, Korea enjoyed an estimated $15-20 million trade  surplus on a current account basis, the first figure in the  black since 1989, which was mainly attributed to the strong  value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and other  major currencies in international money markets.    A researcher at the Samsung Economic Research Institute  predicted that the present low value of the Japanese currency  would continue to persist for quite a while.    He said that the prolonged depreciation of the yen will  seriously afflict exports of such major products as cars, ships  and electronics.    It is generally expected that auto-makers, which regained  their export competitiveness last year thanks to the  appreciation of the Japanese yen, will be hit hardest.    An official at Hyundai Motor said that the parity rate of  the  Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar is running in a  disadvantageous direction for Korea quite contrary to general  expectations.    He worried that as long as the value of the Japanese yen  against the U.S. dollar remains weak, it is inevitable for  Korean cars to substantially lose their price competitiveness in  the United States, the 12-member European Community and other  advanced countries.    Shipbuilders are also worrying about the deterioration of  their business conditions because their Japanese counterparts  are expected to recover their competitiveness due to the  depreciation of the yen.    Last year, Korea superseded Japan as the world's biggest  shipbuilder, which was ascribed to the strong value of the  Japanese currency in international money markets.    Many business experts are apprehensive that as Korean  shipbuilders are saturated with orders at present, they might  lose their hegemony in the world shipbuilding market if Japanese  makers go on the offensive by lowering prices of their products,  taking advantage of the yen's lower value against the U.S.  dollar.    Textile makers are also expected to suffer from the  depreciation of the Japanese currency.    On their assumption that the value of the yen will continue  to decrease against the U.S. dollar, Korean enterprises, mostly  those affiliated with business groups, are endeavoring hard to  lower their production costs and improve their productivity.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES SWINDALL'S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL  </P> <P> A federal judge has denied former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall's motion to get a new  trial or overturn his conviction on nine counts of lying to a federal grand  jury. Swindall, a Republican, cited pretrial publicity and argued that a  statement by a prosecutor improperly focused attention on Swindall's failure to  testify.  </P> <P> The perjury conviction was related to Swindall's grand jury testimony on  negotiations for an $850,000 home loan from an undercover agent posing as a  money launderer. He is to be sentenced Aug. 28.  </P></p>

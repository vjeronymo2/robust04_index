			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Bridge building in the County of Avon CHRISTIANI AND NIELSEN has been awarded two road and bridge contracts by the County of Avon. The larger, at Pounds 4m, is the Weston-Super-Mare primary distributor road Stage VB and is located either side of the A371 Locking Moor Road, one kilometre south of the junction with A370 Locking Road. The contract is for the construction of 0.9km of dual carriageway, a three-span railway bridge crossing the British Rail main line to the south west, a roundabout and the diversion of associated approach roads. Work on site is expected to start in March and be completed by the end of 1993. The Cleveland Bridge at Bath, a Grade ll structure, is to undergo a major refurbishment valued at about Pounds 500,000. The bridge originally constructed in 1827 and strengthened in 1929 incorporated ornate parapets which are being refurbished. Concrete repairs to the truss girders together with repainting, new water proofing and resurfacing of the road are included in the contract. Completion is scheduled for the autumn.</p>

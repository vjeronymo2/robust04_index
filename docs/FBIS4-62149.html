			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Visits" rubric: "Peace </F> in Europe Depends Not Only on Russia and Germany. But Their  Good Relations Will Help To Create an All-European Security  System"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin began the second day of his official  visit to the FRG by meeting with Rudolf Scharping, chairman of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The conversation took  place in the Petersberg Palace, where the Russian president was  staying, and was of the nature of personal contacts between two  political leaders. After this Boris Yeltsin visited the cities  of Dadeyskhaym [name as transliterated] and Oggersheim and  called at the private home of Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  According to the diplomats who prepared the program of the  visit, the visit to the German chancellor's home places was a  response to last year's trip to Lake Baykal by Boris Yeltsin and  Helmut Kohl. It is believed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  that such meetings between the leaders "deep inside the two  states" help to better understand the spirit of both countries  and peoples and to strengthen mutual trust.    But even having left the capital, the leaders did not, I  believe, stop the dialogue begun in the previous day's official  talks. Although a great deal had already been done on  Wednesday. One of the most delicate tasks was safely resolved --  that of the venue for the ceremony marking the final withdrawal  of the Russian troops from German territory: It will take place  in Berlin 31 August, as Moscow had been insisting, and not in  Weimar, as proposed by Bonn. "The war ended in Berlin, so what  question can there be of Weimar?" Colonel General Matvey  Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group of Forces,  explained our position. "Since it is a question of eliminating  the consequences of the war, the ceremony must be held in  Berlin." The Germans, as we see, have conceded. "My aim,"  Helmut Kohl declared for his part, "is to ensure that the  Russian servicemen's send-off is worthy and respectful and is  conducted in a spirit of friendship."    Despite its complexity, the subject of the Russian troops'  send-off did not dominate the talks which the Russian Federation  president had with the German leaders. A very wide range of  questions of interaction and cooperation between Russia and the  FRG was discussed during the conversation with President Richard  von Weizsaecker, in the confidential conversations with Helmut  Kohl, and in the enlarged meetings of the two delegations (the  Russian Federation president was accompanied by Vice Premier  Aleksandr Shokhin, Ministers Andrey Kozyrev, Pavel Grachev, and  Yevgeniy Sidorov, and also Vladislav Terekhov, Russian  Federation ambassador to Bonn).    As soon as the Russian president's aircraft arrived at  Bonn/Cologne Airport from Moscow Wednesday morning, Boris  Yeltsin made it clear that the visit was of a "planned nature."  He said that 38 major joint projects have been prepared during  the two years since his previous visit to Bonn. "The time has  come to audit the way they are being implemented and also to  discuss some 20 future joint projects," he remarked.    Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl confirmed yet again that  Russia  and Germany regard each other as equal partners, on the state of  whose relations the fate of European and world politics largely  depends. At the same time the Russian Federation president  emphasized that the ensuring of peace throughout the European  continent depends not only on bilateral relations between the  FRG and Russia. But the fact that the two greatest states on  the continent can reach agreement on complex problems attests  that it will also be easier to work with other countries in  order to have a unified security system in Europe.    One element of it could be Russia's joining the  "Partnership for Peace" program. To judge from Boris Yeltsin's  statement, Moscow agrees with this NATO initiative in principle.  But Russia cannot sign this document without a special protocol.  "There must be one more document, which would stipulate specific  questions concerning Russia's special features, including, for  example, the fact that we have an army of 3 million men," he  said.    This position is obviously shared by Bonn also. Moreover,  acknowledging Russia's status as a great power, the FRG is  sincerely interested in the success of the democratic and market  reforms being implemented by its leadership and is prepared to  continue giving it what support it can to surmount the present  difficulties, as well as for further integration into the  international community. Chancellor Kohl welcomed, in  particular, the idea of turning the "G-7" into the "G-8" by  means of including Russia. This question will be discussed, he  said, in Naples at the meeting of the heads of the seven most  developed industrial countries scheduled for July, and Germany  will promote Russia's integration into international  organizations in every possible way. "Any other development  would be disastrous," Helmut Kohl emphasized.    Another complex topic of the dialogue in Bonn was the  problem  of the return of cultural assets lost by both countries as a  result of World War II. The work of the commission set up by  the two countries' Ministries of Culture has not yet produced  results. An accord has now been reached that in the future this  commission will work to a rigid schedule approved personally by  the leaders of both countries. But we do not intend to  interfere in the commission's work. Let professionals make the  decisions, Boris Yeltsin remarked.    Today is the final day of the visit. Boris Yeltsin will  spend it in Stuttgart, one of Germany's major industrial and  cultural centers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 30 May (EFE) -- The Cuban and Belgium  Governments fully concur that the 114 persons who stormed the  Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana on Saturday must leave  peacefully, officials sources at the Cuban Foreign Ministry  [Minrex] told EFE.    "That is the fundamental agreement. They must leave  peacefully because they did not enter in a legal manner," a top  official who declined to be identified stated. The source  indicated that these persons "will not be punished for breaking  into the embassy," but noted that the Belgian authorities have  not provided Cuba with the list of persons who are there and  that "therefore we do not know who they are and whether there  are fugitives or delinquents among them."    This official indicated that today, the Minrex will reply  "in  writing" to the written request for guarantees and other matters  submitted by the Belgium side but did not want to venture an  opinion on when the incident would end.    "What we cannot allow," he said, "is the transgression of  the  law or the transgression of the extraterritoriality of an  embassy to leave the country, because that is not good for us or  anyone."    Regarding the police deployment around the ambassador's  residence -- more discrete during the day but highly noticeable  at night -- he said the Belgian authorities requested it to  prevent future entries. "That is logical, and, at any rate, we  would have provided it," he noted.    Asked about the food supply for the occupants, including 24  children, he said that was the Belgian ambassador's problem. "We  told him," he said, "the Cubalse state enterprise that supplies  the diplomatic corps and foreigners was in a position to provide  the necessary food."    In fact, it is still a mystery how this large a number of  people have been fed since Saturday as the police and neighbors  have said that no movement in or out of the embassy has been  detected, except by the ambassador and one of the 114 occupants  who left last night. Official sources said he was a young man  and that he left the embassy voluntarily but did not disclose  his name.    This morning, when approached by a couple of newsmen while  leaving his residence, Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch said  all had slept well and did not want to comment on how they were  fed.    This is the most serious incident that has taken place in a  diplomatic mission since the 1980 events at the Peruvian Embassy  when over 10,000 Cubans invaded it after the Havana government  decided to withdraw the guards from the embassy. Previously,  Peru had granted political asylum to more than 10 citizens who  had forced their way into the embassy in an incident in which  one policeman was killed.    This time, the group that apparently had gathered in a park  in front of the mission took advantage of someone opening the  door to storm the grounds. Police sources told EFE that there  were five guards on duty but that they were overwhelmed by the  crowd. Meanwhile, the rest of the embassies remain with their  usual guard, which varies from two to five agents according to  the size of the building.</p>

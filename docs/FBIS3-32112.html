The press report states that during the meeting it was  agreed  that from now on the government will use the criminal  organization's financial resources for purposes other than  subversive activities. [sentence as publsihed]    Fujimori, after asserting that he has not and will not hold  a  meeting with Guzman, said the report was "biased and  ill-intended," but did not refer to the media.    Fujimori also confirmed that drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrera, alias "Vaticano," has been placed at the disposal  of Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] after it was  established he had clear connections with terrorist groups,  especially the Shining Path.    He went on to immediately explain that that does not mean  Dinandro [the Police Antidrug Division] will stop its  investigations into drug trafficking. He said: "Investigations  will continue simultaneously."    The chief of state had a busy agenda in this province in  Cajamarca Department, where he arrived at noon on 24 January  with the Canadian ambassador and Transportation Minister Dante  Cordoba and Agriculture Minister Absalon Vasquez.    The president dedicated an irrigation canal the region's  farmers have been longing for for 56 years. Some 2,000 farmers  will benefit from the system that will expand the agricultural  zone toward the mountain range.    Fujimori also offered an ambulance to the local health  center  and to repair schools that are in a poor shape.</p>

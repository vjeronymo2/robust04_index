			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAFT STUDENTS HOPE TEAM'S VICTORY WILL RUB OFF ON THEM  </P> <P> Students at Taft High School prepared Monday for a string of celebrations to  revel in the school's victory in the U.S. Academic Decathlon, overjoyed not  only for their brainy classmates, but because they expect the honor to rub off  on them in the competition to get into college.  </P> <P> "It's going to help when we apply to colleges," said junior Elisa Miller, who  holds the student government office of director of school spirit. She plans to  apply to fashion merchandising programs at the University of Arizona and  Syracuse University.  </P> <P> "They'll say, 'She was part of Taft High School.' They'll know now where I go  to school."  </P> <P> "It will really prove to colleges that when you earn a grade at Taft, it's  really a grade. There are no easy A's here," student body President Josh  Stenger said as he rearranged the red letters on the school marquee at the  corner of Ventura Boulevard and Winnetka Avenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Message  </P> <P> The messages touting a blood drive and Cinco De Mayo celebration gave way to:  </P> <P> "CONGRATULATIONS DECATHLON NATIONAL CHAMPIONS."  </P> <P> Students whooped, hollered "Alllll Riiiight" and clapped when, just after the  lunch bell, Assistant Principal Patricia White announced over the public  address system that Taft had defeated 38 other schools to win the decathlon in  Rhode Island.  </P> <P> White had waited all morning for a long-distance call from Principal Ronald  Berz, who accompanied the team. "I just had the feeling we were going to win  this year," she said, and after Taft won the nationally televised Super Quiz on  Saturday, the contest's final event, "it made that feeling stronger."  </P> <P> Stenger, a friend of many of the decathlon members, said the victory was a  relief because "they wanted it so much."  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to hearing their tales of success," Stenger said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Well-Rounded Students  </P> <P> "They're much more socially well-rounded than people think," he said of the  team members, noting that they include a varsity basketball player, drama  student and student government leader.  </P> <P> "You can't just call them nerds, because they aren't. They all have other  things to offer."  </P> <P> Junior Chris Allen was staffing the switchboard, which buzzed with calls from  parents and reporters. Allen, who transferred to Taft this year from a Granada  Hills school, said: "It's kind of cool to come to a school where they're into  studying that much.  </P> <P> "People are really into their work. . . . It's easier to learn here."  </P> <P> The band, drill team, cheerleaders, student government leaders and selected  students will take two buses to LAX today to greet the champions when they step  off American Airlines Flight 275 at 4:54 p.m. "We want to let them know how  proud we are of them -- we appreciate the hard work they put in," said Stenger,  who hopes the school will hold a banquet for the team members and their  parents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Airport Welcome  </P> <P> Among the airport greeters will be seniors Jesus Abellaneda and Maribel Aragon,  who ride a bus a half an hour every morning from outside the Valley to get to  Taft. They do not know any of the decathlon members but accepted White's  invitation to go to LAX, because, Aragon said, "we're proud of our school."  </P> <P> "It goes to show we're the smartest school," Abellaneda said. "We can tell our  kids that we went to that famous school that won the decathlon."  </P> <P> A rally is planned for Friday, White said. She said that Mayor Tom Bradley  called to say he would visit the school this week to congratulate the team.  </P> <P> Several underclassmen were not as enthusiastic about the news. They did not  know the team members and, being further from college applications, did not  feel a personal stake in the victory.  </P> <P> Others were not surprised because, they said, Taft has always been strong in  academics and because it came in second in the decathlon last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Surprise  </P> <P> "I wasn't surprised because they wanted it badly enough to win it," said  English teacher Nina Pashley, who has taught several of the team members in her  11th-grade honors class in American literature and composition. The team's  coach, Arthur Berchin, "goes for breadth and depth" and the students "are  committed and have good rapport with the coach," she said.  </P> <P> "I was hoping for it, but also expecting it."  </P> <P> Senior Seyong Cho said her parents -- who read about the team in a bilingual  Korean-English newspaper last year -- will probably be more thrilled than she  is. "They were really excited and said, 'Oh, I wish you were on the decathlon  team.' "  </P> <P> She was more blase.  </P> <P> "We've always been number one. We're used to it," she said. "If we came in  fourth or fifth, then we would talk about it."  </P> <P> THE WINNERS  </P> <P> Story of the victory. Page 1.  </P></p>

"We have different ideas of how such a candidacy should be  dealt with appropriately," Hintze told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  SONNTAGSZEITUNG. The CDU did not agree with CSU Chairman Theo  Waigel's approach, said Hintze. The CDU would only make a  statement when the CDU leadership bodies had held their meeting  and made a decision on 14 and 15 January. Waigel acted  differently; he first made public statements, and subsequently  asked the bodies, said Hintze.    At the closed CSU meeting in the Kreuth sap, Waigel said on  6  January that, following a telephone conversation with Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the CDU chairman, it was "clear who will  be the candidate of the CDU and CSU." WELT AM SONNTAG learned  from the Chancellor's Office on 8 January that Helmut Kohl, too,  does not agree with Waigel's premature presentation of Herzog.    On 8 January, Michael Glos, CSU land group chairman in the  Bundestag, sharply rejected Hintze's criticism. His party's  approach had been "very appropriate," said Glos at a news  conference in Munich. The CSU had always favored Herzog -- who  is still president of the Federal Constitutional Court -- for  the office of federal president (to be elected on 23 May). He  said the CSU had only supported the former CDU/CSU candidate,  Steffen Heitmann (CDU), in order not to "put off" the sister  party CDU, added Glos.    Now that Heitmann "finally" was not available any more, the  CSU should have the right to say "audibly and publicly whom it  considers a qualified candidate," said Glos.    Glos also recommended to the CDU to "make very sure" that  the  candidate suggested by it has the backing of its own ranks. The  CSU did not want to see a CDU candidate called into question by  the party's own ranks. Owing to sharp criticism even from CDU  politicians, Saxony Justice Minister Heitmann had withdrawn his  candidacy as a successor to Richard von Weizsaecker on 25  November 1993.    While Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed his intention to  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE to continue talking about a common  candidate with his coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party  [FDP], FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer stressed that his  party would also stick to its candidate, Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher, when Roman Herzog is nominated (the candidate of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany is North  Rhine-Westphalian Minister President Johannes Rau).    According to a Wickert poll, 77.9 percent of the Germans  consider Roman Herzog qualified as federal president.</p>

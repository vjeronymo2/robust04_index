			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> A PAINTER RECALLS THE REIGN OF TERROR  </P> <P> Memoirs of Madame Vigee Lebrun, translated by Lionel Strachey (George  Braziller; $24.95; 233 pages)  </P> <P> For an unlikely story of prosperity in unpromising circumstances, consider  Louise Elisabeth Vigee Lebrun.  </P> <P> At 7, she tells us in her memoirs, she insisted on covering her school books  and classroom walls with drawings. When her father saw them, "He went into  transports of joy, exclaiming, 'You will be a painter, child, if ever there was  one.' "  </P> <P> Now this was 1763. Even a painter father, such as the elder Vigee, would not  normally welcome a daughter into the trade with such enthusiasm. Granted, he  was witty and unconventional, and so was his daughter. Both chatted up their  sitters as they painted, giving them, in her case at least -- his portraits  have not survived -- a fresh look, as if they themselves were about to think of  something witty to say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father Encouraged Her  </P> <P> Vigee pere firmly supported his daughter's vocation until his death, when she  was 12. His colleagues continued the encouragement. At 15, she was already in  demand at the court in Versailles.  </P> <P> Furthermore, she remained a successful painter of kings and nobles all her  life. Considering that she died at 86 -- in 1842 -- and considering the  convulsions that France and much of Europe went through, this was remarkable.  </P> <P> If you are in the business of painting faces, it is a real problem of supply  and demand to have the guillotine remove them so drastically. Mme. Vigee never  got over the French Revolution, though she survived it by knowing when it was  time to hop a stagecoach and head for the frontier.  </P> <P> She found work in Catherine the Great's Russia. There, an Ancien Regime really  knew how to take care of itself. Later, she moved to England and returned to  France once Napoleon was firmly in charge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wrote of Court Life  </P> <P> Buoyancy and self-confidence mark the memoirs of this woman, whom the sun  tended to shine on with the help of some shrewd meteorological positioning. She  writes, with a pleasure that approaches innocence, of the beautiful people,  their parties, their clothes and how much they liked her. Once in awhile,  though, darkness breaks through. The guillotine left its shadow.  </P> <P> At two points in this abridged version of the Memoirs -- it is a reissue of the  selection made and translated in 1903 by Lionel Strachy -- Mme. Vigee produces  a graphic and unalloyed moment of pain. In contrast to her rosy-fleshed  portraits, she is painting bone.  </P> <P> One of these is an unsettling comment on the report that Mme. Du Barry, Louis  XV's mistress, struggled and cried for mercy as she was put on the guillotine  block. There was a moment of shocked hesitation; the other victims had  generally made a point of showing serenity.  </P> <P> If the others, Mme. Vigee muses, "had not had the noble pride of dying with  fortitude, the Terror would have ceased long before it did."  </P> <P> More chilling is her account of the last court ball at Versailles. By this  time, some of the nobility were distancing themselves from Louis XVI and Marie  Antoinette, and expressing tentative sympathy with the early ideas of the  Revolution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Partners for Queen  </P> <P> Mme. Vigee writes as compact and vivid a detail as we have of how the bottom  fell out of a world. The queen was unable to get any of the younger courtiers  to dance with her. "Their refusal likened a sort of revolt -- the prelude to  revolts of a more serious kind."  </P> <P> Not all of this book is as revealing. There is a bland, even gushing quality to  many of the painter's descriptions of the high, if insecure society she moved  among and lived off.  </P> <P> A more active editing job might have compensated for the rather unfocused  effect. Although a foreword by John Russell helps, it would have been useful to  have more in the way of dates; and at least a few footnotes giving a historical  context for some of Vigee's stories. And the reader should be told that this is  an abridgment, not the full Memoirs.  </P> <P> There are some good moments, nevertheless. Mme. Vigee would flatter the mighty,  but only up to a certain point. One of her aristocratic sitters kept pursing  her lips to make her mouth look smaller. Finally, the painter offered to do her  without a mouth at all. Louis XVIII, proud of his voice, would sing while  posing. Did she think he sang well? he asked. "Like a prince," she replied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spent Time in Russia  </P> <P> Her description of the lavish scale on which the Russian nobility lived is  striking; these were untamed feudal barons in contrast to the domesticated  courtiers of Versailles. Count Stroganoff, for example, employed an orchestra  in which each musician was assigned a single note, which he repeated each time  it came up. It was a human music box; a grotesque masterpiece of cultural  autocracy.  </P> <P> To function, however, the Russian empire needed its share of practiced and  skillful officials. The most memorable was Prince Bezborod, secretary of state  for foreign affairs. Wherever he went, he was deluged by requests, and he  perfected two consummate bureaucratic retorts. To those who asked a favor, he  invariably replied: "I shall forget." To those who sought to fortify his memory  by handing him a written petition, he would say: "I shall lose it."  </P></p>

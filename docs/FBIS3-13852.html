			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League General  Secretariat has urged the UN Security Council to implement  expeditiously its resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    In a statement issued today, the General Secretariat cited  Security Council Resolution 904, which condemns the massacre,  urges measures to guarantee the safety of Palestinian civilians  in the occupied territories, calls for international or foreign  presence in those areas and the confiscation of the Israeli  settlers' weapons, and urges further efforts by the peace  conference co-sponsors to revive the peace process.    The statement pointed out that the contents of the  resolution  are guidelines that must be built upon to attain a comprehensive  and just peace in the Middle East, particularly as its clauses  are similar to some parts of the Arab League Council's  resolution of 27 February on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    The Arab League General Secretariat appealed to the Security  Council to implement its resolution with due speed, demanding  that the resolution not be subjected to Israeli procrastination  and evasion designed to dilute it.    The statement noted that expeditious implementation of the  resolution, being in line with existing international  agreements, will protect the unarmed Palestinian people from  Israeli practices.    The Secretariat reiterated its firm position on the Arabness  of Jerusalem and the need to abide by UN Security Council  Resolutions 242, 252, 338, 425, and 465.</p>

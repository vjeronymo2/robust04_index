After the one and a half-hour talks,  Qian Qichen made a speech to Chinese and foreign correspondents,  summing up the bilateral talks between China and the United  States, and answered questions from the correspondents.    Qian said that the 10-hour-talks between China and the  United  States were open, frank and realistic. The two sides  unanimously agreed that the Sino-U.S. relations are not only  bilateral, but should also be viewed in a world-wide perspective  and with thoughts of the future and the 21st century. The three  joint communiques between China and the United States are the  cornerstone of the Sino-U.S. relations. China and the United  States, both big countries with world influence and permanent  members of the United Nations Security Council, have many common  interests in global affairs and in safeguarding international  peace and security. Their stands on safeguarding regional peace  and stability coincide closely.    Qian stressed that during the talks the two sides expressed  satisfaction with the rapid progress in the fields of economy  and trade and said that he considers the economic and trade  cooperation between the two countries to have great potential  and broad prospects.    Qian pointed out that the issues of human rights and most  favored nation (MFN) trade status were main points of the  Sino-U.S. bilateral discussions. China opposes linking human  rights with the issue of the MFN. The issue of human rights has  two aspects: One is that China and the United States have  different viewpoints on human rights, and this will remain as a  long-term fact. Another is that the two countries deal with  disputes differently. China is of the opinion that the two  sides can hold talks on the issue of human rights on the basis  of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's  internal affairs. China can only do things allowed by Chinese  law. It is futile and damaging to use the human rights issue to  exert pressure on China.    On the concrete achievements of the Sino-U.S. talks, Qian  listed the following five points:    First, the two sides agreed to continue with high-level  contacts. Chinese State Councillor Song Jian and Minister Wu Yi  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will go to the United  States in April to attend meetings of the Joint Commission of  Science and the Joint Commission of Trade separately.    Second, the United States reaffirmed its firm support for  China's reentry into GATT.    Third, the two sides have agreed to restore and develop  military exchanges and have agreed to set up a joint commission  for defense conversion.    Fourth, out of the friendship and humanitarianism it feels  toward the American people, China has agreed to allow a U.S.  team to be sent to its territory to survey three Missing In  Action cases which occurred during the Vietnam War.    Fifth, the two sides signed the statement of cooperation in  implementing the memorandum of understanding on banning the  import and export of prison labor products.    Qian said that the two sides have reached other agreements  as  well. He hoped Christopher's visit will enhance mutual  understanding and improve Sino-U.S. relations.    On Sino-U.S. differences on the human rights issue, Qian  pointed out that the U.S. secretary of state said that he  intended to link the human rights issue with the MFN because he  had to implement the U.S. President's executive order and  observe U.S. laws. This is understandable. The secretary of  state is a lawyer. Qian said he had told him that neither the  U.S. President's executive order nor U.S. law can rule China.  China has no duty to carry them out. The disputes between  China and the United States can only be resolved through  consultations.    On the issue of the MFN, Qian said that there are different  opinions within the United States. The U.S. commercial circle  strongly supports the postponement of China's MFN. There are  also different views. China and the United States have many  common interests and also have many differences. This is a  fact. China will never become the United States. If it were  required that China accept the U.S. standard and be the same as  the United States as a precondition to developing trade it would  be impossible and there would be no trade in the world. Qian  said he believes that trade between China and the United States  will continue.    Qian said that the secretary of state's visit was of major  importance to the Sino-U.S. relations. He said that the trend  shows that to develop Sino-U.S. relations, the two sides should  carry out the understandings reached by the Chinese and U.S.  heads of states in Seattle last November. He believed that  Christopher, during his visit, did attempt to resolve the  questions and, despite difficulties, the positive trend in  Sino-U.S. relations will continue.</p>

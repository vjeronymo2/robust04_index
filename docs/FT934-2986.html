			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Swiss telecoms group sacks chief executive Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment maker, yesterday sacked its chief executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, and announced another restructuring. Ascom was formed in 1987 when three suppliers to the Swiss PTT merged. It has struggled to develop a strategy to cope with liberalised markets. Mr Vannotti became chief executive in 1991. He had previously held senior positions with ABB-Asea Brown Boveri and Mr Stephan Schmidheiny's Unotec group. In April, Ascom shocked investors by announcing it would post a 1992 net loss of SFr46m (Dollars 31.4m) and pass its dividend. Days earlier, it had forecast a profit of around SFr25m. Mr Vannotti took full responsibility, but rashly predicted a return to profit this year. In August the group reported a loss of SFr79m in the first half and admitted it would face a 'marked loss' in the full year. Directors said Mr Fred Sutter, deputy chief executive, would succeed Mr Vannotti, and they have formed a committee to direct the group during its restructuring phase.</p>

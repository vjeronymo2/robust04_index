			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial </F> CPC Committee, at the closing ceremony of the provincial work  conference on improving rural areas, on 6 March]    [Text] The provincial work conference on making rural areas  become fairly well-off was held according to the unified  arrangement of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government. I believe that through this conference a new  situation in which the rural areas will become fairly well-off  will emerge as soon as possible and good achievements will be  made. I am going to put forward several opinions:    1. With many tasks to perform, the rural areas should  persistently consider the overall situation in line with the  target of being fairly well-off. I have three reasons for  saying so: First, realizing the comfortably-off target by the  end of this century is the second-step strategic goal of China's  modernization as defined by the party Central Committee  according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic ideas, a point to  start with and end the work of the party and the government in  the 1990's, and a fundamental task that we must do our best to  fulfill. The majority of the province live in the rural areas.  Therefore, the province should focus the realization of the  comfortably-off target on the rural areas. Only when the rural  areas accelerate the pace of becoming fairly well-off and make  the peasants become fairly well-off as scheduled will there be  prospects and guarantees for making the province as a whole  become fairly well-off. Second, making the rural areas become  comfortably-off is an integrated system with targets. This  system not only is persistently dominated by economic targets,  but also considers all aspects relating to social development.  In reality, it involves rural work with economic construction  as a key link. Grasping the work of making the rural areas  become fairly well-off means grasping the "outline" of the rural  work and the "halter" of the overall rural work. Third, the  fundamental purpose of making the rural areas become fairly  well-off is to make the broad masses of the peasants improve  their living standard. This is directly related to the personal  interests of the peasants and fully embodies the strong  expectations of the peasants. Only when we firmly grasp the  fulfillment of the target of making the rural areas become  fairly well-off will we be able to fully mobilize the enthusiasm  of the peasants and to concentrate energy on developing  productive forces. Therefore, the failure in the work of making  the rural areas become fairly well-off in the 1990's is the  failure to grasp the essence of the rural work. The rural areas  will not be able to comprehensively make economic and social  development if this target cannot be fulfilled. The party  committees and governments at various levels must approach from  this high plane to understand this issue and persistently focus  the rural work on making the rural areas become fairly well-off.    We must acknowledge that over the past few years, the  majority of the local party committees and governments in the  province have clear ideas and have done their work solidly and  effectively in the aspect of focusing the rural work on making  the rural areas become fairly well-off. However, some local  party committees and governments still have no clear or firm  ideas. Some even are seriously in the state of fearing  difficulties and some are even ideologically satisfied at having  sufficient food and clothing. The party and government leading  bodies at various levels, particularly the party committees and  governments at the county and township levels, should  conscientiously review and examine their work, further seek  unity of thinking, define the relationship between the work of  making the rural areas become fairly well-off and the work in  other spheres, further clearly define the work of the party  committees and governments at various levels in the rural areas,  further prominently define their work priorities, and have their  energy further be concentrated and their measures become more  forceful. We should also mobilize the broad masses of the  peasants' enthusiasm and creativeness, make them actually become  the main forces to promote the rural areas step toward the  target of being fairly well-off. We should organize all  departments and all trades and professions to better support,  serve, and participate in the work of making the rural areas  become fairly well-off; actually pool the joint efforts to  promote the rural areas to step toward the target of being  fairly well-off; and strive to create a brand new situation in  making the rural areas become fairly well-off.    2. Making the rural areas well-off is a huge project in  which we must make breakthroughs in key areas and carry them out  in an all-around manner. The project of making the rural areas  well-off will involve all aspects and involve much work. The  crucial issue involved now is to accelerate economic  development. Economic development is the precondition and basis  on which we can rely to realize the objective of making the  rural areas well-off. Without a rapid economic development, an  increase in rural people's income, and enhancement of rural  financial resources, enriching the material and spiritual life  and developing the social welfare undertakings will be out of  the question. Therefore, in the course of making the rural  areas well-off, we must accelerate economic development and  regard it as a matter of prime importance. The key to  accelerating economic development is to conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the  third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, persist  in regarding reform as a motivation and conscientiously grasp  three major tasks well. First, we should make strenuous efforts  to develop "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient"  farming. On one hand, we should attend to the production of  basic agricultural products, including grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops, in line with the demands of the domestic and  foreign markets, readjust the agricultural structure, make full  use of local agricultural resources, actively develop  export-oriented products, such as melons, vegetables, fruits,  medicinal herbs, and livestock, and aquatic products with fine  quality and good efficiency, and, on the premise of guaranteeing  a stable increase in the production of farm and sideline  products, accelerate the optimization of agricultural structure,  do a good job in the precision and intensive processing of farm  and sideline products, realistically change the traditional  farming of low efficiency into the "high-yield, fine-quality,  and highly efficient" modern farming, and the small-scale  farming with an unitary structure into large-scale farming with  a comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal  husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery. In this way, we  can steadily increase the income of the broad masses of peasants  and lay a solid foundation for peasants to become well-off.  Second, we should actively develop township enterprises. As far  as the overall rural economy is concerned, to realize the  objective of becoming well-off and to have conditions for  marching towards prosperity, in a final analysis, we must  vigorously develop township enterprises, actively promote the  process of industrialization in the rural areas, and urge a  batch of rural labor forces to engage in nonagricultural  industry. The experiences of 20 counties advanced in marching  towards the goal of prosperity across the province, which we  summed up and popularized last year, and the experiences which  we have exchanged during this conference have fully explained  this. Therefore, while making efforts to grasp the "high-yield,  fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming, we must concentrate  greater energy on grasping the development of township  enterprises. All cities, prefectures, counties, and townships  should uphold the principle of persisting in promoting various  ownerships and systems, and giving simultaneous attention to  development and improvement, attend to input, development, and  opening up, and strive to carry out a number of new projects  every year, to establish a number of new enterprises and put  them into operation, to enable a number of old enterprises to  turn themselves into joint ventures or cooperative enterprises  through grafting or transformation, to enter a batch of products  in the international market, and to make a number of rural  manpower engage in secondary and tertiary industries in an  effort to make the rate and quality of Hebei's township  enterprises attain or surpass the national average as quickly as  possible. Third, we should do a good job in family planning  work. It will be difficult to realize the objective of becoming  well-off if we only pay attention to economic development and  neglect the effective control of population growth. We should  base ourselves on realizing the overall economic balance and  simultaneously increasing the per capita share of things and the  per capita income, and, in addition to pushing the economy  forward, resolutely lower the natural population growth rate.  We should always firmly grasp family planning work, unceasingly  raise it to a new level, and guarantee the realization of the  population control target. Only by simultaneously attending to  production and family planning can we have guarantee for making  the rural areas well-off.    Becoming fairly well-off involves not only the improvement  of the people's material lives but also the enhancement of the  people's spiritual lives and the overall social development. So,  the realization of the target of becoming fairly well-off  comprehensively reflects the overall improvement of the national  strength, the population quality, and the living standards.  Therefore, in the course of making the rural areas become fairly  well-off, we must conscientiously implement the principle of  grasping with two hands and being sure that both hands are  tough. At present, the rural areas in the province, both  economically good areas and backward areas, have many problems  in the aspects of popularizing and improving scientific and  cultural knowledge, strengthening and improving the ideological  and educational work, comprehensively improving social order,  purifying the social practice, improving the appearances of  villages, and developing various social welfare undertakings.  On the premise of persistently taking the economic construction  as a key link, the party committees and governments at various  levels should make a unified arrangement for making the rural  areas become fairly well-off, comprehensively make development,  conscientiously solve the problems one after another, and  ceaselessly satisfy the broad masses of the peasants' increasing  higher demands for material and cultural lives.    3. To accelerate the pace of making the rural areas become  fairly well-off, we must strive to have the localities where  conditions permit take the lead in becoming fairly well-off.  The development of things is always uneven. It is impossible  for all the rural areas to become fairly well-off at the same  time. At the time of comprehensively promoting the rural areas  to become fairly well-off, we should first have the localities  with conditions accelerate the pace of development and take the  lead in making a breakthrough. By so doing will we be able to  gain experiences to better guide the work of the whole, bring  into play the experimental and leading roles of the advanced  models to rapidly promote the progress of other localities, and  further form a vivid situation that the rural areas that become  rich ahead of others help promote the work of the others and  finally seek common wealth. To this end, in the course of  promoting the rural areas to become fairly well-off, the party  committees and governments at various levels should assume the  responsibility for the work of the same levels and first have a  number of counties, townships, and villages with good conditions  become fairly well-off ahead of others. The province as well as  all relevant cities and prefectures should first grasp the work  that the counties (cities) of the first and second groups that  should become fairly well-off by 1997 as defined in the  "outlines of the Hebei Provincial plan for making the rural  areas become fairly well-off" which was discussed and revised at  this conference. These counties (cities) have not only good  natural conditions and geographic positions but also  considerably good economic foundations. Only when they base  themselves on the existing advantages to make consistent efforts  will they certainly become fairly well-off and be able to  realize the target ahead of schedule. So, they should fully  understand their positions and roles in making the province as a  whole become fairly well-off, enhance the sense of  responsibility and the sense of urgency, strive to make bigger  strides for development, and ensure the fulfillment of the  target of becoming fairly well-off on or ahead of schedule. The  counties of the third and fourth groups that will not be able to  realize the target of becoming fairly well-off by 1997 should  define, according to the requirements of the 2000 plan, their  economic development targets and per capita income levels that  they should attain. Simultaneously, all cities, prefectures, and  counties should proceed from actual conditions and annually  organize groups of townships (towns) and villages to become rich  ahead of others. We may determine that through the efforts in  the next four years, about 50 percent of the counties (cities)  and a large number of townships and villages in the province  will be the first in becoming fairly well-off by 1997 and  gigantic changes will take place in the appearances of the rural  areas. Of course, at the time of grasping the work of the  localities with conditions to become fairly well-off ahead of  others, we must not ignore the work of the localities that do  not have conditions temporarily. We should guide and encourage  them to emancipate the mind, have firm confidence, overcome  difficulties, work arduously, emulate and catch up with the  advanced, make unremitting efforts to improve themselves, and  have the localities with good conditions make bigger progress  and the localities with poor conditions be unwilling to lag  behind. By so doing will there be a situation that the vast  rural areas in the province promote one another to step toward  the target of becoming fairly well-off in an orderly and  step-by-step manner.    4. The foundation for rural areas to achieve a fairly  comfortable life lies in the village level, and, therefore,  great efforts should be made to build a good party branch and  select a good leader. Relying merely on peasant households, it  is impossible for rural areas to achieve a fairly comfortable  life. We should also give full play to the role of the  organizations of a community. Villages are fairly stable  communities in rural areas where unified operation and peasant  households' independent operation are combined. Many things  that peasant households cannot manage individually in their  march toward a fairly comfortable life should be managed by  villages. As villages are the most fundamental level to lead  peasants to a fairly comfortable life, peasants will find it  acceptable and compatible with their common economic interests  to take villages as a unit in the endeavor to achieve a fairly  comfortable life. This makes it easier to rally the forces of  peasants and is also conducive to developing the role of the  collective economy. Villages are also the lowest organizations  to implement rural work, and only when they truly take action,  can the endeavor of achieving a fairly comfortable life become  concrete work. Therefore, to lead rural area to a fairly  comfortable life more rapidly, we should place our work focus on  villages, and county and township party committees and  governments should exert efforts to build villages well, which  are the foundation. To do so, the key is to build a good party  branch and select a good leader. As has been proven by the  experiences of many villages advanced in achieving a fairly  comfortable life, a good leader with correct ideology and work  styles who are capable of using the brain to work out ideas and  exercising leadership and are willing to work hard will create a  good party branch, find out a feasible road to affluence, and  lead the entire village to a fairly comfortable life. Judging  from Hebei's actual conditions in rural areas, however, many  villages have yet to build such good party branches and select  such good leaders. We should give particular attention to this  issue. All party committees, especially those at the county and  township levels, should regard it as the most important measure  for achieving a fairly comfortable life to improve village-level  party branches and select leaders well. At present, they should  first rectify the party branches that are stagnant or half  stagnant in doing work and successfully improve the backward  leading bodies. They should adopt various measures to discover,  select, and send some outstanding party members to work in  backward villages. The mechanism of elimination through  competition should be applied to the selection of village  cadres, especially secretaries of party branches. Party  branches which are stagnant in doing work, have many problems,  and are incapable of leading peasants to a fairly comfortable  life should be reshuffled in a timely manner. Town and township  party committees have direct responsibility for the building of  village party branches, and they should be held accountable  first when party branches are not successfully built.    5. With a fairly comfortable life as the goal, we should  apply the mechanism of incentives to county-, township-, and  village-level cadres. Party committees and governments at the  county and township levels are the key to whether rural areas  can achieve a fairly comfortable life. The provincial party  committee has decided and begun to formulate the methods to  appraise county-level cadres and the mechanisms to encourage and  restrain them in order to fully mobilize county-level leading  bodies and leading cadres to work hard and compete for achieving  a fairly comfortable life and to better perform their  responsibilities. The organization department and the  agriculture and industry department of the provincial party  committee again invited comrades in charge from some cities,  prefectures, and counties to discuss them at this conference.  After being revised and screened by the standing committee of  the provincial party committee, the methods and mechanisms will  be issued for implementation. I will again emphasize two points  here. First, we should keep the present leading bodies basically  stable. Most of Hebei's county party committees and governments  were reshuffled last year. Their five-year tenure is exactly  the crucial period for achieving the fairly comfortable life.  County party and government leading bodies should take it for  granted to become ones to lead the masses to a fairly  comfortable life. Before realizing the goal of becoming  well-off in line with the "outlines," in principle, we will not  transfer any county secretaries, county heads, or other  important members of the leading bodies. People with mediocre  work and limited ability to form a joint force and affect the  realization of the objective of making the rural areas well-off  must be promptly readjusted. They must not be transferred to a  post of the same level, and must be demoted. Second, we must  link the achievements of leading bodies in making the rural  areas well-off with the immediate interests of cadres. In  addition to giving relative political treatment to those who  make prominent achievements in making the rural areas well-off  within the set time limit, we should also give them necessary  material awards. Those who basically fulfill the work target may  be retained for continued use; and those who fail to fulfill the  target must be demoted. The township level is also very  important. Over the past years, some counties and cities in  Hebei have formulated some encouraging measures for cadres and  explored some effective methods. Though these measures and  methods are different, they have all given prominence to the  evaluation of the fulfillment of work tasks, awarding the good,  and punishing the lazy, and played a very good role in  encouraging and stimulating the people. All localities should  further enrich and improve these methods in line with the demand  of making the rural areas well-off, and strive to popularize  them to all areas. Places without a township-level financial  department must build one this year. Counties and cities  without this kind of evaluation method should learn the  successful experiences of the advanced counties and cities, step  up efforts to formulate methods, and put them into practice. The  rural work department of the provincial party committee should  assume responsibility and supervise the implementation of this  work. The township and town party committees and governments  may use the principles and spirit of the county and township  levels for reference, study, and decide on their own how to  establish the mechanism of encouragement and restraint for  villages. In short, through the establishment of effective  mechanism of encouragement and restraint at all levels, we  should make the leading bodies and cadres of the county and  township levels form a strong motivation that "they must work  hard and must not do sloppy work," and realistically concentrate  the energy on thinking of, working for, and marching towards  prosperity.    6. We should strengthen organizational guidance over the  work  of making the rural areas well-off, and let the broad masses of  grass-roots cadres and people to have a goal and working  enthusiasm. Making the rural areas well-off is a process of  tangible practice. Leaders at all levels should successfully  carry out all sorts of organizational leadership work with an  enterprising spirit and a sense of responsibility. First, they  must attend to the flexible methods on becoming well-off of  counties, townships, and villages. The plans of counties and  townships must be submitted to the people's congresses of a  corresponding level for discussion and approval; villages should  discuss their plans with villagers and let each and every  household understand them. Second, they should regard  accelerating the pace of making the rural areas well-off as  their aim, act in line with market demands, organize and  develop items and projects that help to make peasants rich in  line with local conditions, and actively develop the commodity  economy. Third, they should conduct timely investigation and  evaluation, exchange experience, and promote this work. Fourth,  they should strengthen public opinions and propaganda on  becoming well-off, and form an atmosphere in which all rural  households think of becoming well-off.    Comrades, counting from now to 2000, we have about six or  seven years for making the rural areas well-off. The tasks  facing us are very arduous. Comrades of all cities,  prefectures, and counties should have a sense of urgency, exert  strenuous efforts to accelerate all tasks on making the rural  areas well-off, and strive to create a new situation in this  aspect within a short period of time. This is not only the  ardent hope of the provincial party committee and government but  is also the urgent wish of the broad masses of rural cadres. I  believe all of you will give a forceful answer to this with  actual deeds.</p>

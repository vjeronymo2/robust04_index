			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONALISM;  </P> <P> YUGOSLAV UNITY ON LINE IN SERBIAN VOTE;  </P> <P> IT'S SEEN AS A LAST CHANCE TO AVERT A RUSH TOWARD DISINTEGRATION. BUT THE  FORCES OF PEACE ARE TRAILING.  </P> <P> Serbia's date with the ballot box Sunday will end one of Europe's few remaining  one-party regimes, but the election also provides a last chance for Yugoslavia  to reconsider its headlong rush toward disintegration and civil war.  </P> <P> Serbia is the last of Yugoslavia's six republics to expose communism to a  competitive vote. While the multi-party ballot is a sign of democratic  development, the forces for peace and unity are expected to lose.  </P> <P> Four Yugoslav republics that held elections earlier this year stripped the  Communists of their parliamentary majorities, voting instead for nationalists  pursuing independence from Belgrade.  </P> <P> In Serbia, by contrast, communism and nationalism have worked hand in hand.  </P> <P> The Serbian Socialists, as the former Communists are known, have won strong  support among the 6.8 million voters by vowing to settle old scores with rival  Croatia and by subjugating ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.  </P> <P> The leading opposition group, the radical Serbian Renewal Movement, has made  the same promise of Serbian supremacy, while casting the former Communists as  despots who will stop at nothing to stay in power.  </P> <P> Presidential contender Vuk Draskovic said on the final day of campaigning  Thursday that a 30-year-old supporter was slain while hanging political posters  in the southern town of Vranje.  </P> <P> A victory by either of the front-running parties would probably encourage the  wealthy and westward-looking republics of Slovenia and Croatia to step up  efforts to secede from the federation, which they say is controlled by Serbian  bullies.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia's army remains under the command of orthodox Communist generals,  predominantly Serbs, who have threatened to use force to prevent secession,  which would probably unleash a civil war. Armed conflict in the volatile  Balkans would pose a threat to others in Europe, as borders established only  this century would be called into question.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Veljko Kadijevic warned this week that the army favors  socialism, heightening fears of a military coup.  </P> <P> Federal unity and peaceful negotiation of differences are the aims of the new  party of federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic, the Alliance of Reformist  Forces. But the moderates have been virtually ignored in Serbia's vitriolic  campaign.  </P> <P> Incumbent Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, a hard-line Socialist, on  Wednesday condemned the prime minister's party for trumpeting "ideas of a false  Yugoslavism, the aim of which is to make people afraid of Serbia and the  Serbian people."  </P> <P> Draskovic, whose black beard and dreadlocks evoke the image of Rasputin, wound  up his campaign with a fiery appeal to followers for calm in the face of  provocation.  </P> <P> "They wanted to have bloodshed because this is the only way for them to retain  power," he said of the Socialists. "I beg you not to retaliate."  </P> <P> By week's end, Draskovic was said to be running an even race with Milosevic,  the early favorite.  </P> <P> A dozen opposition parties last week threatened a boycott, charging that the  former Communists were monopolizing the media and packing vote-counting panels.  </P> <P> More than 50 opposition parties are challenging the Socialists, portending a  divided assembly that would be unable to exert its will over the other  republics, heightening Serbia's sense of isolation.  </P> <P> Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia -- the republics that have  already held elections -- want Yugoslavia reshaped into a loose confederation  of independent states, like the European Community.  </P> <P> Most Serbs insist on a strong federation, with their capital of Belgrade  continuing to wield central authority. That position is supported only by tiny  Montenegro, the sixth republic, which has always moved in lock-step with  Serbia. Montenegrins also go to the polls on Sunday.  </P> <P> Serbs, who number about 9 million, are the largest ethnic group in Yugoslavia,  a nation formed in 1918 from remnants of the Ottoman Turkish and  Austro-Hungarian empires. Today, Yugoslavia's 23 million people remain divided  by nationality, language, alphabet, culture and religion.  </P></p>

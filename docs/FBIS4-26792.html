			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Songxin: "Germans Set Sights On Growth"] </F>   [Text] German construction giant Philipp Holzmann is  targeting Chinese infrastructural and real estate projects after  solidifying its development in the former East Germany.    "As we've consolidated ourselves in the united German  market,  we are expanding quickly to foreign countries, with the primary  focus on China where demand for infrastructure is large," said  Lothar Mayer chairman of the board of Holzmann.    The company has invested heavily in highrises, industrial  construction, hotels, highways, railways and environmental  protection projects in Berlin and other areas of the former East  Germany since the unification of Germany in 1989.    "Infrastructure and highrises are our priorities in China,"  said Gerhard Logters, member of the board.    Mayer, Logters and other senior executives were in Beijing  last week to boost Holzmann's image and consolidate its business  in China.    China accounts for half of the firm's business in the Asia-  Pacific region.    With millions of dollars of contracts in hand, Holzmann is  targeting several urban construction and infrastructure projects  in China including highways and harbours.    It is one of the foreign companies competing for tunnelling  work in the proposed 18.1-kilometre Guangzhou subway. The  subway is expected to cost 6 billion yuan ($689 million).  Foreign firms will be allowed to dig two tunnels for the subway.    Bidding on the tunnelling portion of the contract are  companies from Japan, South Korea and Europe.    Jurgen Lindemann, director of Holzmann's Overseas  Department,  claims that his company has a good chance of winning the  contract because of the company's technology, its experience in  other parts of the world, its 15 years experience in working  with Chinese partners and its overall knowledge of the market.    In another development, it is announced that Holzmann will  develop an office and apartment centre in Beijing. It has  already signed a letter of intent with the Beijing government.    Located in the eastern suburb of the city, the site will  occupy 53,000 square metres. Logters estimates that the project  could cost 300 million German marks ($187.5 million) and take  three years to build.    The project, which is being undertaken with the Beijing  Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Corporation, will be the  second development Holzmann has been awarded in the capital  city. The first one was the Beijing Lufthansa Centre, which is  a complex including a hotel, office building, apartments and  major shopping centre.    At present, Holzmann is building two power plants: One is in  Ertan, Sichuan Province; the other in Xiaolangdi, Henan  Province. Both projects are funded by World Bank loans. It is  also constructing an elevated highway in downtown Shanghai.    Apart from infrastructure, Holzmann and its subsidiaries are  seeking investment in China in building materials, environmental  protection and industrial sectors.</p>

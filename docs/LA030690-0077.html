			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHBOUND FEUD;  </P> <P> CUSTODY: NEW ZEALAND, A POTENTIAL HAVEN FROM U. S. FAMILY LAW, IS THE LATEST  BATTLEGROUND IN THE CUSTODY WAR OVER HILARY FORETICH.  </P> <P> As classes let out at the Selwyn House private school for girls, the happy  children in their brown blazers and Panama hats contrast sharply with the women  pulling up in their four-wheel-drive station wagons and Jeeps.  </P> <P> The mothers are in a foul mood. As they quickly whisk their daughters away,  some even spit out obscenities at the reporters who are staking out the school  in vain hope of glimpsing Hilary Foretich.  </P> <P> "Leave her alone!" one passing motorist shouts.  </P> <P> "Hey, we're just doing our job," a sheepish Rick Kirkham of "Inside Edition,"  who had flown in from New York City, mutters to no one in particular.  </P> <P> Already at the center of perhaps America's most wrenching child custody battle,  Hilary, 7, has suddenly become New Zealand's most famous pupil, now that her 2  1/2 years in hiding have come to a pandemoniac end.  </P> <P> Her mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, spent more than two years in a Washington  jail on a civil contempt charge for refusing to divulge Hilary's whereabouts.  Her father, Dr. Eric Foretich, accused by Morgan of sexually molesting Hilary,  finally tracked Hilary down to this scenic South Island city, where she is  living with Morgan's parents.  </P> <P> Foretich has vehemently denied Morgan's accusation, contending it was Morgan  who did the molesting.  </P> <P> As the focus of the nasty, long-running dispute between her divorced parents  shifts here, the usually courteous citizens of Christchurch are getting more  than just a taste of the news media's excesses.  </P> <P> Like it or not, New Zealanders and their particular way of dispensing family  justice have been thrust into the harsh limelight and both are being sorely  tested.  </P> <P> After four appeals and $1 million in legal bills in American courts, the fight  between Morgan and Foretich is being reborn half a world away.  </P> <P> Just as Congress and President George Bush got dragged into the squabble back  in the United States, so now are New Zealand's prime minister and members of  Parliament being drawn into the escalating debate.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether New Zealand's family court can do any better in  dealing with the seemingly intractable dispute.  </P> <P> But the legal system appears determined to give it its best shot.  </P> <P> In Washington Friday, the D. C. Court of Appeals released Morgan's passport,  making her departure to New Zealand imminent. She hopes for a reunion as far  away as possible from the international glare of attention that has dogged  Hilary since her discovery.  </P> <P> "I don't want to arrive with 1 million photographers there to watch me embrace  Hilary," Morgan said in an interview Friday. "That is not my idea of looking  out for my daughter.  </P> <P> "This past week has been an enormously upsetting one for her," Morgan  continued. "I think the first thing that's important for Hilary is to be  allowed to get back to her ordinary life, and not to have another unexpected  eruption, no matter how welcome. The best thing I can do for her is to let her  life settle down and go on from there.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I want very much to see her, but only in a way that's right for  her," Morgan added.  </P> <P> Morgan and Foretich -- she a once-prominent plastic surgeon, he an oral surgeon  -- separated shortly before Hilary's birth. Morgan gained custody of the child.  Then came a custody challenge by Foretich and allegations of sexual abuse by  Morgan.  </P> <P> The claims of sexual abuse were not proven to the satisfaction of D. C.  Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon Jr., and in 1987, Dixon ordered Morgan to  produce Hilary for unsupervised visits with her father.  </P> <P> Morgan refused and sent her child into hiding. When she refused to reveal  Hilary's whereabouts, Dixon sent her to jail. She was released last September  only after Congress enacted, and Bush signed, a law designed specifically for  her, limiting the time a person can be jailed on civil contempt in child  custody cases in the District of Columbia.  </P> <P> Last week, after discovering that Hilary had been living here since July, 1988,  with her aging maternal grandparents, Foretich and his lawyers rushed to family  court here, seeking to force his U. S. court-granted visitation rights.  </P> <P> But a family court judge denied that request and ordered Foretich not to  contact his daughter. The judge then granted Hilary's grandparents, William and  Antonia Morgan, temporary custody of Hilary, but took away their passports.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the prospect of Elizabeth Morgan's arrival in New Zealand to take up  her side of the battle clearly disturbs Foretich's U. S. attorneys, who had  hoped New Zealand would return the case to the United States.  </P> <P> John C. Lenahan, one of Foretich's lawyers, said, "I feel Dr. Morgan has  thumbed her nose at the court and . . . has tried to further defy (the  visitation order) by going to New Zealand and seeking to litigate the case  there. The parties have no business there. This is not a New Zealand case. They  aren't New Zealand citizens. This is an American case involving American  parties, and it should be resolved by an American court."  </P> <P> Morgan, however, said "I am very happy" at the prospect of traveling to New  Zealand, and said she was prepared to stay there as long as necessary -- even  if it meant she might have to remain there permanently to be with her daughter.  </P> <P> Morgan married her second husband, federal appeals Judge Paul Michel, who  waited for Morgan throughout her two years in prison, in January. Morgan said  the two discussed all the possible outcomes of the custody fight before their  marriage.  </P> <P> "We both agreed that Hilary came first," she said.  </P> <P> Clearly, Morgan could have found few better havens against the American family  law than New Zealand. It has not signed the 1980 Hague Convention on child  abduction, which calls for the return "forthwith" of any child "wrongfully  removed" from his or her home jurisdiction.  </P> <P> The family court here is not bound by any of the actions of U. S. courts in the  case.  </P> <P> New Zealand's child custody laws instruct judges here to "regard the welfare of  the child as the first and paramount consideration," which often translates  into allowing a child taken to New Zealand to remain, if the child appears  settled in the new environment. Since Hilary has been here 19 months, Morgan  and her parents may be able to meet that criteria easily.  </P> <P> Unlike the American courts, the judge here also appointed a lawyer to represent  Hilary. That attorney, Isabell Mitchell, is conducting her own investigation  and has hinted she may even look into earlier allegations that Foretich had  molested another daughter from a previous marriage. Hilary is said to have  already undergone a psychiatric and sex abuse evaluation.  </P> <P> In keeping with New Zealand law, all the proceedings are taking place behind  closed doors.  </P> <P> "They do things completely differently in New Zealand," Morgan said. "My  understanding is that the court has taken control of Hilary's welfare. In  completely closed hearings, they will review whatever requests are made, and  will probably listen most to Hilary's lawyer and the (child abuse) expert that  Hilary's lawyer is consulting."  </P> <P> According to Patrick D. Mahony, New Zealand's chief family court judge, cases  such as this will unfold in stages, with attempts at reconciliation and  mediation preceding any formal hearing.  </P> <P> Since making his only public declarations on the matter -- at a contentious  meeting with some 30 reporters, a session he terminated abruptly -- Mahony has  ordered everyone involved to clam up.  </P> <P> Foretich has declined to speak with reporters since his arrival in New Zealand  last week, saying he intends to respect the wishes of the New Zealand  authorities. Similarly, the elder Morgans, who granted several candid and  graphic interviews shortly after they were found here, took the warning to  heart and abruptly terminated their contacts with the media.  </P> <P> And Elizabeth Morgan, in Washington, warned that she will cease talking to the  press once she lands on New Zealand soil. "I just cannot take any chances by  talking to anyone once I get there," she said.  </P> <P> Mahony also warned the media that disclosure of family court proceedings could  lend them in jail under the Guardianship Act of 1968.  </P> <P> Neither Mahony nor anyone else would say when the proceedings might get under  way, although experts earlier speculated that they could be weeks off.  </P> <P> "The New Zealand court has to decide in their view what is best for this child  in these circumstances, and they are the ones who decide, not somebody else,"  declared Prime Minister W. Geoffrey Palmer.  </P> <P> Palmer ordered Immigration Minister Annette King to reconsider granting  Hilary's grandparents' application for permanent residency, lest their current  visas expire next week.  </P> <P> A member of Parliament, Philip Burdon, also has petitioned the Immigration  Ministry on the Morgans' behalf.  </P> <P> But even a decision on that will not be announced, said a Ministry spokesman.  </P> <P> All this has left reporters from around the world idling about Christchurch.  The judge's stern caution appears to have had an effect, turning front-page  saturation coverage in local papers into inside stories by week's end.  </P> <P> Last Thursday night, the country's High Court granted an injunction sought by  Mitchell, Hilary's court-appointed attorney, seeking to ban a scheduled showing  of a BBC documentary on the custody battle called "Hilary in Hiding."  </P> <P> Former Principal Family Court Judge Peter Trapski said he was "sickened" and  "appalled" by the scores of journalists who have desended on New Zealand.  </P> <P> The comment that seemed to resonate the most with the public came Wednesday  night at a rock concert here, when Elton John dedicated a song, "Sacrifice," to  Hilary.  </P> <P> From a piano top, he lamented that she was being "surrounded by the worst type  of media" and urged the public to "run the bastards out of town."  </P> <P> His comment -- and the roar of approval from the audience -- were broadcast  Thursday night as the lead item on New Zealand's network news.  </P> <P> Chen reported from Christchurch; Cimons from Washington.  </P></p>

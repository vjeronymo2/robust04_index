			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb 26 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The House of  Representatives (DPR) on Saturday appealed to the world  community to condemn the massacre of Palestinian worshipers at a  Ibrahimi mosque in Al Khalil (Hebron) by a Jewish settler on  Friday. "That's uncivilized and brutal act. It not only  violates but also shrugs off human rights," said Theo Sambuaga,  who is the deputy chairman of the House Commission I overseeing  foreign affairs, information and defence and security.    Witnesses said a Jewish settler firing an automatic riffle  killed at least 48 Palestinians and wounded dozens at prayer in  Ibrahimi mosque on Friday. But the PLO claimed the death toll  reached 103 and 270 people were wounded.    Sambuaga said all communities elsewhere in the world,  including the United States, should condemn the masacre which  was the biggest single killing of Palestinians since Israel  captured the West Bank and Gaza strip in 1967. "The world  community should thoroughly investigate Israel and should openly  announce the result of the investigation to the world  community," Sambuaga said. The mass killing of innocent  Palestinians became cause for deep concern and apparently gave a  blow to the peace accord reached by the two conflicting  countries, he said. In fact, the peace accord had been the hope  of the international community, he said.    Meanwhile, Agus Tagor, another member of the House's  Commission I, is of the opinion that such tragic events have  been occurring in the conflict involving the two countries so  far. "However, we are hopeful for the peace process because the  key for the solution is peace," he said. "We condemn the  massacre. However, all sides must control themselves, moreover  during the fasting month of Ramadan," he added.    Theo Sambuaga said he did not understand what Israel  actually  wants because every time there is a peace initiative, criminal  acts which are contradictive to peace, always prevail. "Israel  should be honest in dealing with the problem," He stated, adding  that all countries including the United States should pressure  Israel to open the case fairly. He is of the view that it is  naive if the Israeli Government said that those should be  responsible are individuals.    A spokesman of the PLO in Tunis said that the massacre was  led by an Israeli army captain.</p>

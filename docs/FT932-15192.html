			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / French grain supplier applies for protection INTERAGRA, the French farming products business which was one of the most prominent western suppliers of grain and food to eastern Europe during the cold war, yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection. The company, founded in 1955 by the late Jean-Baptiste Doumeng, known as le milliardaire rouge, the red billionaire, has applied to the Paris commercial court for protection. The court will announce its judgment on Tuesday. In its heyday Interagra made annual sales of up to FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) by selling the European Community's 'food mountain' - surplus supplies of subsidised grain, meat, dairy products and powdered milk - to communist countries. Mr Doumeng built up the business by exploiting connections with eastern bloc leaders but Interagra has floundered since his death in 1987. The final blows were the collapse of the Soviet Union and the United Nations embargo on trading with Iraq during the Gulf war. Annual sales have fallen to just FFr5bn a year and its debts have risen rapidly to FFr500m. France's commercial banks yesterday responded to the recent fall in money market rates and to Tuesday's reduction in the Bank of France's repurchase rate by cutting base rates from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. The reduction was triggered on Tuesday night by Credit du Nord. French base rates had been held at 10 per cent since December as the French authorities battled to defend the franc from speculative attack in the run-up to last month's parliamentary elections.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonia Vymazalova: "Imports Only With a </F> Certificate"]    [Text] Bratislava--The first item on the agenda of the  government session, chaired by Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik  yesterday, was the National Council of the Slovak Republic bill  on certain measures to prevent increasing insolvency in the  Slovak Republic. The government returned the bill for  alterations. If it passed the bill in its current form, there  would be the threat of a slowdown of the privatization process  and the formation of an obstacle to enterprise.    The government discussed and approved several proposals for  intergovernment agreements and documents, among them the draft  Agreement Between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the  Government of the Croatian Republic on the Extradition and  Admission of Citizens. It also approved the National Council of  the Slovak Republic's bill on customs. At a news conference  during the government session, Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko  said that the customs law deals in a completely new way with the  organization of the customs administration and its status with  respect to other bodies, duties, powers, and resources of the  customs officer, the rights and obligations of natural and legal  persons toward customs officers. He emphasized that the law  gives greater powers to customs officers and even enables them  to use some restrictive measures.    The government approved its work schedule and its plan of  legislative work until 30 September 1994. It agreed to the  schedule of carrying out work ensuing from the report on the  state of the Department of Agriculture and the economic  conditions for the implementation of the intentions for this  year. It also approved a directive on one-time extraordinary  compensation of between 10,000 and 50,000 Slovak korunas for an  injury or death in the course of working for the civilian  defense.    It approved an amendment to the National Council of the  Slovak Republic Law No. 83/1991 on the work of Slovak Republic  bodies in the implementation of the employment policy according  to earlier regulations. The bill submitted makes payments from  the Slovak Employment Fund for financing work beneficial to the  public also available to state budget and subsidized  organizations, which the National Council of the Slovak Republic  Law No. 325/1993 ruled out. The proposed amendment does not  affect the state budget. The government disagreed with a  deputy's draft extensively amending the National Council of the  Slovak Republic Law No. 325/1993 on the state budget of the  Slovak Republic for 1994 and changes to other laws.    The government acknowledged the report on guaranteeing the  offer of property in the second wave of coupon privatization.  It contains, among other things, the criteria for the selection  of enterprises offering property in the coupon privatization, a  proposal of the schedule for the preparation of the offer, and  the implementation of the actual process of distribution of the  shares. "The relevant minister will prepare by 20 May 1994, in  cooperation with the founding ministries, a list of the  enterprises included in the coupon privatization. The volume  will thus be determined with added precision of property  included in the second wave of coupon privatization," Minister  Milan Janicina said at a news conference. The government also  acknowledged informative documentation on the preparation for  the introduction of a compulsory certification of farm and food  products in the Slovak Republic beginning on 1 May 1994. As  Minister Peter Magvasi stated, because four conditions were not  satisfied for calling off the 1 May date, exporters of food  products will have to present a certificate from the country to  which they are exporting. According to the agreement in effect,  the government can no longer change the date of compulsory  certification of farm and food products in the Slovak Republic  because it is given by approval in the National Council of the  Slovak Republic. The government authorized Minister Magvasi to  discuss the issue with his Czech counterpart, Dlouhy.</p>

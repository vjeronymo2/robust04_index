Antonov, secretary of the Political  Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of Khazakhstan, and  M. Farooqi, secretary of the National Council of the Communist  Party of India, in support of the Korean people's struggle for  peace in the Korean peninsula and the reunification of the  country.    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India  (Marxist) in its message charges that the United States is  scheming to attain its aim of putting down ever growing support  to the proposals of the DPRK to reunify the country  independently and peacefully and in a democratic way.    We reaffirm our support and solidarity for the DPRK and  believe that its efforts for peace and equality among the  nations are sure to produce good results, says the message.    The secretary of the Political Executive Committee of the  Socialist Party of Kazakhstan in the message demanded that  practical measures to implement the resolution of the 30th U.N.  General Assembly session on putting a period to the stationing  of foreign troops in South Korea and removing the source of  causing North-South confrontation be taken at once.    The secretary of the National Council of the Communist Party  of India in the message stressed that the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula should be solved only through peaceful  negotiations.</p>

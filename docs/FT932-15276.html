			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse posts Dollars 64m profit WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has encountered serious problems within its financial services division and seen a variety of management changes recently, yesterday posted profits of Dollars 64m after tax in the first quarter. The figure compares with a net loss of Dollars 246m in the same period of 1992, but this deficit largely reflected accounting-related charges. Westinghouse said that first-quarter profits and sales from continuing operations were flat year-on-year, at Dollars 64m, compared with Dollars 65m, and Dollars 1.86bn against Dollars 1.85bn, respectively. Westinghouse's attempts to sort out its financial services division's problems took a step forward last week when the company announced that it would sell most of the commercial property loans held by this unit to a newly-formed partnership, in which Lehman Brothers would be the general partner and Westinghouse would have a 49 per cent interest. The partnership, in turn, will attempt to offload the properties as quickly as possible. Yesterday, Westinghouse noted that its financial services unit had also sold other assets, for about Dollars 700m in cash, during the first quarter - proceeds which were in excess of the assets' reserved value. Coupled with last week's announcement on the commercial property loans, Mr Gary Clark, Westinghouse's acting chief executive, said that this left the company's restructuring plan ahead of schedule. 'We expect to remain ahead of plan throughout the year', he added. However, Mr Clark added that any improvement in operating results would probably be concentrated in the second half of 1993. During the first three months, substantially improved sales and profits figures from the power systems business and an advance on the broadcasting side, were offset by declines in the electronics systems division, which primarily makes military equipment, and in the industrial division. However, Westinghouse shares, which rose modestly on news of the real estate transaction, gained another Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 15 1/4 yesterday morning.</p>

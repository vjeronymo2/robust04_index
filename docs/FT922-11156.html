			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Turks pin EC hopes on British presidency TURKEY is putting its faith in the forthcoming British presidency of the European Community to further its ambitions of forging a closer relationship with both the EC and the nine-nation Western European Union (WEU) defence organisation, Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. Though the Turkish government has reluctantly accepted the EC's decision, taken more than two years ago, to put Turkey's application for full membership of the EC on ice for the foreseeable future, it continues to seek early activation of the financial arrangements provided for by the country's 1963 association agreement with the EC. It also wants to be included in the Community's new Mediterranean policy. Both developments are being blocked by Greece, which is a full member of the EC and can exercise therefore a veto in the community's Council of Ministers. But Greece's attitude is causing increasing irritation in other EC capitals, and Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, made clear during a visit to Ankara last week that he wants to 'enhance' Turkey's relationship with the community and the WEU. Mr Cetin recognises that Turkey was unlikely to become a full member of the Community before the end of the century, but he emphasised that, no matter what happened, Turkey would pursue its long-term objective to become 'part of Europe and to be in all the institutions of Europe.' He made clear that, important as Turkey's economic relations with the Community were, his government was equally concerned about its future defence relationship with western Europe. He was particularly grateful to Britain and one or two other Community countries for having supported, during the Maastricht treaty negotiations at the end of last year, Turkey's full participation in the WEU. But he was decidedly unhappy about the eventual decision by the Community as a whole to offer only associate membership. 'Turkey has contributed to European defence in the past, and Turkey has also paid for it. We think that Turkey contributed to the ending of the Cold War in this part of the world. Now, it should not be the policy to say to Turkey that it is no longer needed and that Turkey should be given second class-membership. That cannot be accepted,' Mr Cetin said. 'Associate membership of the WEU can be accepted by Turkey for a temporary period only if we know that we will become a member of the EC in the future. Just during that temporary period, Turkey can accept associate status, and in that case it will nevertheless expect to participate in all actions of the WEU.' Mr Cetin emphasised his concern at the probability that, if Greece were to become a full member of the WEU and Turkey were given only associate status, the bilateral problems of Turkey and Greece would be transferred to the whole defence organisation.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Cookery: Oranges: the tasty way to start the day A COUNTRY house hotel where I stayed recently put fresh flowers and fruit in the bedrooms but made me get out of the bath to accept delivery of a breakfast tray at the door. This unthinking service left me in a poor humour, and my mood took a turn for the worse when I tasted the orange juice - low-grade stuff from a carton instead of the freshly-squeezed product you would expect in an establishment where bed and breakfast costs a cool Pounds 135. Good mornings begin with good orange juice, and this is the time of year to enjoy the very best. There is nothing quite like blood oranges to start the day. Their juice is deliciously astringent but not too tart. It rivals the vivid colour of bortsch, and a draught is just as invigorating as a Bloody Mary in its way. But there is more to blood oranges than just drinking their juice. Used in place of ordinary sweet oranges, the moro and the tarocco make a sensational sorbet, especially when spiked with a sprig of rosemary. I am more than mildly addicted to wedges of unpeeled blood orange threaded onto skewers with bay leaves, brushed with olive oil and grilled until hot and slightly toffeed. (Take care not to burn them to a cinder). To make a meal of this, use the caramelised oranges to partner spit-roasted small birds served on rounds of grilled or fried polenta. Or simply add chicken livers to the skewers. I have recently had some success with the following appetiser, and I rate blood oranges a valuable flavouring for couscous with quails. SICILIAN SALAD (serves 4-6) Packed with crunch and exuberant flavours, this should wake you up to spring. Ingredients: 4 blood oranges; 2 bulbs of Florentine fennel; 2-3 oz young spinach leaves or 1 small radicchio; 1 oz toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds; a handful of black olives; two 2 oz cans of anchovy fillets; garlic and fennel seed. Method: Grate finely the oily zest from one of the oranges. Then cut the skins off all four oranges, leaving no trace of pith clinging to the flesh. Squeeze the juice from the trimmings adhering to the peel and mix it with the orange zest, a small garlic clove and some fennel seeds crushed to a paste with mortar and pestle. Stir-in the olive oil drained from one can of anchovy fillets and season with salt to taste. Dip the spinach leaves or radicchio into the dressing. Shake off excess and arrange the leaves round the edge of a shallow dish. Slice the oranges. Trim the fennel and cut it into thin wedges. Toss both ingredients in the dressing and pile them into the centre of the leaves, scattering the olives and toasted nuts here and there together with the anchovies from one can, cut into snippets. Arrange the anchovies from the second can, criss-cross fashion, over the top and serve with slices of good country bread brushed with the oil from the second can and toasted under the grill. COUSCOUS WITH QUAIL (serves 4-5) Fruity and spicy with the tang of mint and blood oranges, this is a simplified version of a favourite Moroccan dish. Ingredients: 8 quail (each one stuffed with a bay leaf and a short length of cinnamon stick, and trussed);  1/2 lb couscous; 4 blood oranges; 1 large onion and 1-2 garlic cloves; cumin seed; cinnamon; a small bunch of mint; 2 oz toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds; 2 oz sultanas;  1/2 lb each carrots and broccoli; a 15 oz can of chick peas; 1 1/2 pt chicken stock; a little olive oil. Method: For the stew, first chop a large onion and soften it for a few minutes in a little oil in a couscousier or other heavy stew pan. Add the little birds and colour them all over. Stir in the crushed garlic, a heaped teaspoon of crushed cumin, and a large pinch of ground cinnamon. Add the stock and the juice and zest of two oranges. Bring quickly to simmering point, cover, and cook gently for 15 minutes. Add the sliced carrots and drained chick peas and simmer for about 10 minutes more. Then add the broccoli, broken into florets, bring back to simmering point, switch off the heat and leave for five minutes to make the greenery tender. For the couscous (which should be prepared and cooked in tandem with the stew), first aromatise the grain with the finely-grated zest of two oranges, a heaped teaspoon of ground cumin, and a generous pinch of cinnamon. Add the sultanas, the flesh of one orange cut into membrane-free segments, the juice of the second orange, and a little cold salted water. Let the grain soften and swell for 10 minutes or so, raking it occasionally with your fingers to break up any lumps. Then put the couscous into a steamer basket lined with butter muslin and place it over the stew pan to cook. It will need 15 minutes or so to become thoroughly hot and tender. Enrich the cooked grain with a little warmed olive oil, the toasted nuts and some salt. Arrange it in a nest-like ring on a serving dish. Spoon the vegetables into the centre and sit the quail on top. Serve with a sauce-boat of the cooking liquor, seasoned and laced with chopped mint to make a fragrant gravy.</p>

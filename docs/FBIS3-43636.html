			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the STAR Africa Service] </F>   [Text] Lusaka -- President Frederick Chiluba yesterday axed  a Minister and a deputy Minister in a Cabinet shuffle that  appears to fall short of the demands by donor nations for  decisive action to wipe out corruption in his government.    Chiluba fired Health Minister Boniface Kawimbe and Dean  Mung'omba, Deputy Minister in the National Commission for  Development Planning, but gave a reason far removed from  allegations of corruption. He accused Kawimbe and MUng'omba of  "irresponsible indiscretion" in holding a news conference on  their return from the Paris Club meeting last month before  briefing him on the outcome of the meeting.    At that meeting, western donors demanded stronger measures  than the tougher anti-corruption legislation proposed by  Chiluba's government. They are reported to have demanded the  removal of Ministers engaged in drug trafficking and other  corruption.    Announcing the Cabinet shuffle at a news conference, Chiluba  said his Cabinet was clean and he saw no reason to fire more  ministers. He denied suppressing corruption probe reports and  produced a report exonerating all but one Minister. The report  recommended the prosecution of the new Health Minister, Michael  Sata, who was found to have failed to declare an interest in a  financial deal involving his ministry.</p>

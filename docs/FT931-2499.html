			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Technology: The men in the ring Peter Rawlins A bright, iconoclastic young accountant, Rawlins was brought in as chief executive of the Stock Exchange at the end of 1989 to cut its bureaucracy, revamp its computer systems and find a new role for a venerable City institution that many claimed had lost its way. He failed to give enough attention early on to Taurus, which was begun before he arrived. It was not until the autumn of 1992 that he switched his full attention to it. One exchange board member says: 'Rawlins has done a good job in the last six months getting to grips with it. But he made the mistake of relying for too long on the project management team. John Watson As deputy chief executive of the exchange in the late 1970s, Watson had developed the successful Talisman settlement system. A consultant (and made a partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in 1990), he was brought in as project manager of Taurus in the summer of 1989 and helped to forge a consensus in the City by the end of that year. Critics claim now that he had no experience of sufficiently large-scale technology projects. The project team is also accused by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the exchange, of suffering from 'self-delusion' over the progress of the project. John Redwood An ambitious junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry until last April, Redwood was responsible for the legislative and regulatory framework for Taurus. His department's delay in drafting legal changes held back the project. It also resulted in voluminous regulations that took the many Taurus participants months to sift. Redwood also insisted on security standards for the system that led the stock exchange into commissioning a communications system from IBM that, it claimed, was the most secure anywhere in the world outside the defence establishment. Pen Kent An associate director of the Bank of England, Kent took a close interest in Taurus from the start. When banks came to the Bank of England in 1988, complaining of the damage that could be done to their registration and custody businesses by Taurus, Kent sponsored the setting up of an industry-wide committee to find a way forward. Its brief was to find a solution that was acceptable to all interest groups in the securities industry, sowing the seeds for the compromise that followed. With the collapse of Taurus, Kent moved quickly last week to set up a new task force to find a way forward.</p>

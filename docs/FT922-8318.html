			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (10): Challenge of competition - Industry's problems THE challenge to Argentina's manufacturing industry is clear: it must modernise, begin investing and rapidly attain international levels of efficiency. The challenge is all the greater, not just because Argentina has invested little in recent years, but because it has not built an internationally competitive industrial base, in spite of 60 years of protectionism. Import barriers, subsidies and cartelisation have led to grotesque distortions and inefficiencies. Large swathes of industry are now unable to compete. Businessmen realise the old days of government support have gone for good: the bankrupt state is unable to protect them any longer. On the contrary, President Carlos Menem has converted Argentina from one of the world's most closed economies into one of the most open ones. Analysts agree that large sectors of the car, steel and engineering industries will succumb to foreign competition, especially from Brazil, as economic integration deepens. The government has ignored industry's appeals for help. But it is trying to reduce the inefficiencies that weigh heavily on companies' costs. The energy, transport and communications infrastructure is being privatised. Unnecessary regulations are being scrapped, the labour market is being reformed and the banking system broadened to cut financial costs. Companies are benefiting from rising domestic demand, softening the impact of import competition. Manufacturing industry raised output by an average 20 per cent last year, with productivity increasing by 7 per cent. However, the trend is uneven: car output in the first quarter rose 167 per cent, while steel production slumped by 27 per cent. Few companies are focusing enough on controlling costs. An automobile executive says: 'Argentine companies are not very competitive. Argentina must make a greater effort to reduce costs of inputs and labour.' He says labour costs are 40 per cent greater than in Brazil - hardly an efficient economy - and component costs are 30 per cent greater. Overall, costs are 50 per cent above international levels. Nonetheless, some multinationals have been able to operate well in Argentina. Thus, Autolatina's new USDollars 220m state-of-the-art axle and gearbox unit is as efficient as any in the rest of the world. The government says industry must concentrate on areas where it can exploit Argentina's principal strengths. These include low-cost energy, an efficient agricultural sector and abundant capital. Private savers hold an estimated USDollars 50bn in overseas bank accounts. A tenth of that flight capital returned last year. Companies should therefore expand in food processing, services, energy and capital-intensive industries and specialist market niches such as electronics or special plastics. An example of growing economic specialisation is Arcor, a leading sweet company. It plans to raise sales by 52 per cent over five years to USDollars 855m in 1996. It is capitalising on Argentina's plentiful supplies of natural gas and foodstuffs and intends to increase its presence in Brazil. Though sales across the board are booming and companies can sell all they produce, the economy is still the same size as in 1980. There are few signs of big ticket investments. Businessmen say the economic climate is too uncertain. They are still unsure whether to hire more staff: most factories are currently working a single shift. They add that they lack confidence to take on more staff because the law makes it expensive to shed workers if sales stop growing. Furthermore, most large companies are too busy buying up state companies to spare resources for industrial investments. Nevertheless, imports of capital goods are growing. But companies are not exporting much. Most lack experience in fiercely competitive international markets. Industrial exports grew by only 2 per cent last year to USDollars 1.09bn. Industrialists claim it is pointless to sign up overseas clients or invest for the export market until stability is consolidated and the economy's cost levels are revealed more clearly. Argentina will at best balance its trade account this year. Next year, it will almost certainly sink into the red. Hopes for achieving annual growth of 5-6 per cent will inevitably peter out unless companies begin exporting and investing soon.</p>

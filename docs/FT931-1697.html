			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: A sweet prize for the successful suitor - The sale of the Irish government's Greencore stake THE CORPORATE courting of a prized daughter of Ireland's food industry, wooed by two incompatible visions for her future, reaches a climax today. The seductive colleen is Greencore, a near-monopoly concern in Ireland's sugar, milling and malting industries, which is considered one of the most efficient in Europe. Paternal guidance and control was fully exercised by the Irish government until Greencore's partial flotation in 1991. Then last month, strapped for cash, the government put its remaining 30.4 per cent stake up for sale. Tenders close today and offers could range as high as IPounds 70m. An independently-minded offspring though, Greencore has already been out courting and has firmly declared her own choice for the future. After careful preparation, Mr Gerry Murphy, chief executive of Greencore, last month finally introduced its favoured groom to the family mandarins at the Finance Ministry - it was Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness conglomerate. Much huffing and puffing followed. 'A foreigner will take the sugar quota overseas and leave our farming cousins jobless. A foreigner will not have Greencore's and the whole country's best interests at stake. Can't Greencore find a suitable Irish suitor?' were some of the objections. Accordingly, the government made an appeal for a politically acceptable suitor. But few seem to have been found, and Greencore appears unwilling to be forced into a marriage of convenience. In a letter to employees last month, Mr Murphy stated that: 'The board does not believe that any potential Irish investor could bring the same benefits to the group in our drive to become a more significant and more successful Irish-based international food company'. Greencore's preferred choice he said 'apart from supporting the group with capital for development, would bring unparalleled access to world class technology in our core business, global market intelligence and distribution capability'. And, 'the board will do everything in its power to ensure that our ability to pursue our stated strategy is at least safeguarded, and hopefully enhanced, by the ultimate owner of the government's stake'. The company can call an EGM for shareholder approval of any purchase of a stake greater than 15 per cent in the group. Existing shareholders are likely to support the board. The key issue for Greencore is how to finance a European expansion. It is a mature company at home with few prospects for further growth. Management strategy therefore is to target the UK and other EC markets for large acquisitions in its core business sectors. According to Mr Joe Gill, a food sector analyst at Riada stockbrokers in Dublin, 'Greencore will have to acquire scale, and not in small units, which will require major investments. From a shareholders' and institutional investors' point of view, a trade partner with the financial muscle such as ADM is the best option, as it gives the best possibility for expansion and of adding value to the company'. The Irish food companies, the majority of which are either directly or indirectly controlled by dairy co-operatives, have in recent years been undergoing rapid expansion themselves, both overseas and at home, borrowing heavily to do so. Efforts by IAWS, Ireland's biggest supplier of animal feed ingredients, to put together a bid for Greencore together with its parent dairy co-operatives, has apparently not been well received by the co-ops. Fyffes, the fruit and vegetable distributor, with a cash hoard of IPounds 100m, is the only Irish food company considered to have sufficient resources on its own to buy the stake. It has indicated an interest, but analysts are sceptical. Greencore does not fit with Fyffes' main strategic objective, which is to secure a foothold in the mainland EC fruit distribution market. Its only interest, therefore, is considered to be in rationalising parts of Greencore and using it to generate more cash to pursue its prime goal. This would be unlikely to win government approval. It is under pressure from farmers and trade unions, and from the Labour party ranks within the government coalition, to keep Irish control of Greencore. They will be quick to remind the government of Fyffe's IPounds 25m capital gain in selling its 20 per cent stake in Irish Distillers in 1988, thereby ceding control of Ireland's main whiskey producer to Pernod Ricard, the French drinks company. A compromise solution under consideration is a share placement with institutions. This, however, will not address Greencore's central objective which is to seek a trade partner with the wherewithal to finance acquisitions, and will not realise as large a return to the government as a sale to a single buyer which can be expected to pay a premium over market prices. As the sale is vital to this year's budget arithmetic, the government cannot procrastinate for long and needs cash to bale out Aer Lingus, the ailing state airline. Its main worry must be whether, when it opens the tenders today, Greencore's favoured suitor will still be there. If not, the jilted lover is likely to bear a grudge about the missed opportunity, and, as with most grudges, it may resurface again in the future.</p>

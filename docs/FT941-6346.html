			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: A Greek tragedy in Moscow - Arkady Ostrovsky reviews 'The Oresteia' The German theatre director Peter Stein could hardly have found a better venue for the ancient Greek tragedy, Aeschylus's Oresteia, when he arrived in Moscow: the stage of the 'Central Theatre of The Soviet Army'. Just as in Aeschylus's times when the audience would spend the whole day in theatre, Stein's production of The Oresteia lasts 9 1/2 hours. The theatre works as an ideal set; it seems only natural when the great warrior Agamemnon appears on this stage decorated by military symbols. On stage is a high black wall with a big door in the middle. Every entrance or exit through the door brings tragic news or death to the city of Argos, represented by a chorus of 12 men dressed in black coats. All the leading parts are played by the same actors who make up the chorus. Each actor in turn steps out of the crowd in order to play his part. The black wall sets off the appearance of Clytemnestra (Ekaterina Vasilyeva). She is the only one who never steps back into the chorus - she stands out, not only as a character, but as an actress as well. The killing of Agamemnon and Cassandra is one of the best scenes in the whole production. According to the rules of Greek drama the killing takes place behind the black wall, inside the house. We see only the result. Soiled with blood, Clytemnestra appears on the moving platform. The dead bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra lie at her feet. Blood slowly streams from the platform onto the floor. Clytemnestra's monologue is accompanied by the monotonous sound of dripping blood; by the end of her speech it makes a big puddle. Vasilyeva's Clytemnestra is a mixture of goddess and barbarian. She stands, with feet wide apart in black stockings, with a tucked up skirt; her white shirt is tied in a knot. Clytemnestra has been waiting for this moment for ten long years, since Agamemnon killed their daughter, Iphigenia. She holds a sword and smiles, probably experiencing the same feeling of satisfaction as Agamemnon did when Troy fell. For her, the killing of Agamemnon is justified and fair. After her monologue, it seems fair to the audience also. In fact, every murder in this tragedy is justified; but the pool of blood threatens to engulf them all. Unfortunately, however, the tragedy ends when the actress disappears from the stage. All that happens after this resembles a Christmas pantomime. Athena flies like a fairy across the stage in a silver dress; Apollo appears in a laurel wreath, with a lyre in his hands; the badly made-up Furies run up and down the stage as if trying to frighten bad boys and girls who fail to listen to their parents. All this seems totally divorced from the previous two parts. Apollo here is a trivial joker, who would hardly be capable of sending Orestes off to kill Clytemnestra since he is too busy making cheap comments about the jury and flirting with Athena. Members of the jury behave like the Russian parliament and the whole trial scene turns into a rather primitive skit on Russian political life. Stein, in apparently deciding to 'update' this great tragedy, made a mistake: Russian audiences no longer appreciate superficial political hints in the direction of the government. Paradoxically, the high tone of Ekaterina Vasilyeva's acting reveals much more about the problems of the modern world than any of the Apollo's cheap jokes. In Moscow, then goes on tour in Germany</p>

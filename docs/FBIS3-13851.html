			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Randah Habib report from Amman] </F>   [Text] The Jordanian monarch King Husayn believes that it  was a mistake to force the Jerusalem issue into a draft UN  Security Council [UNSC] resolution on the Hebron massacre,  something which prompted the United States to abstain when the  paragraph pertaining to Jerusalem was put to the vote. He said  that this was caused by the lack of inter-Arab coordination. He  also asked Washington to explain its vote at the UNSC.    In an exclusive interview with King Husayn, the Hashemite  monarch criticized the way the draft resolution was handled. He  indicated that it was possible to avoid any mention of  Jerusalem, and to only invoke the Geneva Convention to address  the issue of protecting the Palestinians in the territories  occupied since 1967.    The Jordanian monarch added: Had this scenario been pursued,  we might have come up with an outcome that is better than the  current one, which is marked by Washington's abstention. This  is because this abstention might be interpreted as a change in  its position toward Arab claims to Jerusalem.    Having expressed his worries about the fragmented,  uncomfortable, and unsatisfactory Arab state of affairs, the  Hashemite monarch wondered: Was it necessary to force the  Jerusalem issue into this draft resolution, given the fact that  there were chances for a U.S. veto or abstention?    The Hashemite monarch added: We must receive assurances that  the U.S. policy toward Jerusalem has remained unchanged. The  U.S. policy on settlements changed because it first deemed them  illegal. Later, it deemed them an obstacle to peace.    King Husayn went on to say: The only explanation I have for  this situation is that it is the outcome of the lack of  coordination in critical, sensitive, and difficult  circumstances. He noted that the calls for coordination only  surface to ensure a sort of cover for some when they need it.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Oxford is next for BES FOLLOWING its stock market-linked business expansion scheme launched just two weeks ago, Close Brothers is sponsoring a similar plan. Money raised through BESSA Oxford will go towards providing student accommodation for Oxford colleges. As with BESSA Christ's College Companies, which has sold out, investors are given a choice of two companies in which to invest. The first offers a fixed return after five years of 120p for every 100p invested, which equates to a return of 13.7 per cent a year to a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.4 per cent to a lower rate-payer. The return is backed by five-year zero coupon bonds. The second will give a fixed return of 60p for each 100p invested after five years - the original net investment for a higher-rate taxpayer - with a variable return which depends on a rise in the FT-SE 100 index over four years and 11 months. Close Brothers says it can treble the rise in the Footsie on the net investment through the use of options. How? The terms of the option mean that, for each 1 per cent rise in the index, the variable return will increase by 181p a share. Since the cost to a higher rate-payer investing 100p a share is only a net 60p, the 1 per cent rise will give shareholders 181p for their 100p gross investment - three times the net investment. If the Footsie falls, or does not rise, the index options will have no value and investors will simply get back their original investment. They can divide their money between the two companies; the minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Capital Ventures has increased the contracted exit price on its Cambridge Collegiate Consortium BES from 117p after five years for every 100p invested, to 120p.</p>

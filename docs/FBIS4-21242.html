Three kingpins in  the organization were also ordered to hand over to the state the  tens of thousands of markkas in profits they received from drug  selling.    The longest sentence, six and a half years, was given to  Nils  Erik Sjoberg. He was convicted on two counts of felony drug  violations and five misdemeanor drug violations.    Sjoberg had received and passed on altogether three  kilograms  of hashish and 50 to 100 grams of amphetamines in the period of  summer 1991 to February 1993. He was arrested at his residence,  from which was seized a little over two kilograms of  amphetamines and well over a kilogram of hashish.    Of the others convicted, Janne Hautapaakkanen was given a  prison sentence of four and a half years, and Markko Franken  three years. Neither will be able to receive parole.    In addition to felony drug charges, Hautapaakkanen was also  convicted on four weapons violation counts. Found on his  possession was a so-called tear pistol, which can only fire one  round. The court considered this aggravating, since this type of  weapon is used only for committing crimes.    Franken's sentence came from two felony drug counts and  several misdemeanor drug counts.    In addition, two others received sentences to six and seven  months of prison without chance of parole.</p>

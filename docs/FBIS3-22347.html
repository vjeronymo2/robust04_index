			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksiy Petrunya: "Yuriy Kostenko: We Are Not </F> Against Nuclear Energy as Such, but ... against Its Present  Level of Security"]    [Text] Ukraine needs a clear concept of the development of  nuclear energy, worked out on the basis of the world's  experience. Yuriy Kostenko stated this in conversation with the  correspondent of Ukrinform. He stated that this is the opinion  of his ministry. We have never come out against, and are not  coming out against nuclear energy as such, understanding that  the future energy security of the state is connected with the  employment of nuclear energy. But the level of security of the  nuclear power stations evokes concern.    Unfortunately, the minister said, the departments which are  responsible for them often follow only their own concerns, and  pay attention only to the positive aspects of nuclear energy.  Our fundamental goal is to do everything so that all branches of  the economy do the least possible harm to people and to nature.    Analyzing the world's experience with the development of  nuclear energy, one comes to the conclusion, that it is not as  effective as the ministries concerned imagine. And in this, the  most telling is the experience of the United States, where the  majority of nuclear stations belong to private companies. It  shows that the cost of the electricity produced by nuclear power  stations is approximately one and a half times higher than that  produced by stations which use gas or coal. And this is in  addition to the fact that in the United States the equipment is  much more advanced than here.    In speaking about the ecological aspect, it is true that if  the station functions normally, it ejects into the atmosphere  few harmful substances, compared with other energy producers.  Nuclear power stations are ecologically cleaner, and their  operation does not cause air pollution. This is a plus. But the  minus side also cannot be forgotten. Accidents at nuclear  stations can lead to disastrous consequences. The Chernobyl  tragedy and events at other stations show this.    Yuriy Kostenko emphasized that nuclear energy has to exist,  but to act on different principles. That is, to be economically  effective and ecologically secure. First of all, a closed  nuclear cycle has to be created, which can guarantee a lower  level of ecological danger. Another way is the development of  less powerful but more effective reactors. In fact, this program  is now being studied in the United States. In this approach, new  types of reactors can be brought to such a degree of security  that, in any sort of accident, ejections of radioactive  substances do not go beyond the boundary of the thermal shell.  If we choose this way, the development of nuclear energy in  Ukraine will proceed successfully. All the more so because we  have the industrial base for it, and personnel, and experience.  But with all this, we still lack a clear, and well reasoned and  calculated concept of its development.    Speaking about the aspects of nuclear energy characteristic  of the past year, Yuriy Kostenko pointed out that countries  using nuclear power stations have encountered a series of  complex problems. One of these is the security of the fuel.  Previously, the government took care of this completely,  allotting a great deal of money from the budget. Thus, the cost  of fuel did not have an effect on the price of electrical  energy. But now, when the majority of so called imposed expenses  are imposed onto the stations, the price of electrical energy  will grow. Another complex problem is connected with the  exhausted fuel. It proved to be an especially difficult issue  last year. A critical situation developed at the Rivnenska,  Khmelnytska, and Zaporizka stations, where the storage areas at  the stations were already overfilled. Unquestionably, this  situation will force us to consider the necessity of creating  national storage areas for exhausted fuel, to seek ways of  acquiring fuel at cheap prices, and possibly to organize  industries for this in Ukraine.    The Supreme Council of Ukraine has cancelled the moratorium  for bringing new nuclear power station blocs on line. I do not  think, Yuriy Kostenko said, that it is necessary to bring them  all on line. The three which are at the highest level of  readiness are enough. I think, the minister emphasized again,  that without the development of nuclear energy, though of a  higher qualitative level, we will not be able to function.</p>

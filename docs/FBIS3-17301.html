Quoting Russian airborne troops commander Colonel-General  Yevgeniy Podkolzin, the paper said that there are 1,200 Russian  paratroopers in former Yugoslavia. A month ago from the Klis  airport in Serb Krajina, where then 900 Russian paratroopers  were stationed, 400 men were moved to Sarajevo, who, contrary to  normal regulations marched some 500 km in 24 hours.    The Russian battalion in former Yugoslavia, popularly called  "Rusbat," has been divided, Yevgeniy Podkolzin said. Now there  are two Russian battalions in Yugoslavia. The first one, which  left in Klis, is commanded by Colonel Sergey Voznesenski, and  the second one in Sarajevo -- by Colonel Viktor Vorobyov.    The federal assembly has decided to despatch another 300  paratroopers and an echelon with armoured vehicles. According  to U.N. peacekeeping force regulations, any military equipment  arriving at the places, where U.N. missions are being carried  out, is paid for according to international prices. In the  given case the United Nations will purchase armoured personnel  carriers from Russia, the paper writes.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Film licensing difficulties behind fall to Pounds 0.65m at Novo Licensing difficulties within the film entertainment services division and provisions against the planned disposal of its French associate resulted in interim pre-tax profits at Novo Group falling from Pounds 670,000 to Pounds 649,000. Licensing irregularities were discovered in the Walport International offshoot which affected trading in the period and is expected to cause 'significant damage' to future earnings. The company added that it had received advice that it might be able to claim against BET, the former owner of Walport, to recover a substantial part of the costs and losses arising from the irregularities. As a result of the problems Novo is paying only a nominal interim dividend of 0.1p (0.3p). The level of future payments will depend on the reinstatement of Walport's film supplies and satisfactory outcome of the warranty claims. Turnover for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 5.97m). Provisions of Pounds 259,000 related primarily to the planned disposal of the French associates. Earnings per share were 0.97p (2.98p).</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Construction output to fall further CONSTRUCTION output will fall further this year than had been expected, an industry forecasting body said yesterday, Andrew Taylor writes. The National Council of Building Material Producers said it expected output to fall by 2.5 per cent this year. It had been forecasting a 1.5 per cent decline. The group blamed the outlook on a worse-than-expected decline in commercial property building and the government's delay in giving approval for the Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee Underground line extension in London.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: F&amp;C takes the helm - At a Glance Foreign &amp; Colonial will take over the management of the former New Frontiers Development Trust in a deal which will give F&amp;C its first global emerging markets investment trust. The deal means that F&amp;C replaces Ivory &amp; Sime, which had managed the trust for the past two years. The restructuring follows the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund decision to sell its 75 per cent stake in the trust; as part of that sale, F&amp;C is buying a 29.9 per cent holding. Other New Frontiers shareholders can receive the same price as the MNOPF, around 96.2 per cent of net asset value. The trust's new name will be Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets Trust.</p>

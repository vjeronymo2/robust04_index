			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW ADDS 9.12 DESPITE IBM'S WEAK SHOWING  </P> <P> Stock prices finished mixed Wednesday in a session marked by pressure on some  technology issues but strength in other blue chips.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up about 10 in early trading and down  about 4 at mid-afternoon, added 9.12 to close at 2,673.06.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 626 up, 826 down and 514 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 158.40 million shares, against 158.35 million Tuesday.  Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in  those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled  185.41 million shares.  </P> <P> The market had to contend with some renewed weakness in the dollar and an  accompanying rise in credit market interest rates.  </P> <P> Stocks were also weighed down by International Business Machines' disclosure  that it expects its third-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts'  estimates.  </P> <P> IBM shares fell 6 to 111 1/2. Elsewhere in the technology sector, Digital  Equipment dropped 1 3/8 to 93 5/8, Unisys 3/4 to 18 7/8 and Apple Computer 1/2  to 44 3/4 in the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> But brokers said buyers were encouraged by takeover news and rumors, notably in  the entertainment industry, that seemed to ease recent fears that Wall Street's  boom in buyouts and mergers might be near an end.  </P> <P> Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which agreed to be acquired by Sony Corp. for  $27 a share, rose 1/4 to 26 1/2 in heavy trading.  </P> <P> Paramount Communications, another prominent player in entertainment, climbed 1  1/8 to 57 3/8.  </P> <P> Gainers among blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 3/8 at  43; General Electric, up 1/2 at 56; Philip Morris, up 3 7/8 at 160 1/2, and  Merck, up 2 7/8 at 74.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks retreated for the first time in five trading days. The Nikkei  225-share index closed down 74.25 to 35,370.57.  </P> <P> Shares closed slightly lower in London on continued nervousness about the  direction of British interest rates and corporate profitability. The Financial  Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down 4.9 at 2,332.0.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> Central banks sold dollars for a third straight day Wednesday, pushing the  currency lower after an agreement last weekend that it had risen too much in  recent months.  </P> <P> The losses left the dollar 4% lower against the West German mark and Japanese  yen than it was late last week, back to its levels of late July and early  August.  </P> <P> The central banks squashed a rally attempt at mid-morning in New York. Still,  the slight rebound in the dollar signaled to some traders that the official  bankers had won the battle against the $300-billion-a-day currency market, but  not yet the war.  </P> <P> "Do they want it to get off the mat or do they want to kick it while it's down?  Assuming they're playing a serious game, I think you'd go for the kidneys now  rather than later," said Charles Taylor, an international economist at  Prudential-Bache Securities in Washington.  </P> <P> A strong dollar tends to swell the U.S. trade deficit by making imports cheap  and pushing up the price of American goods in foreign markets. At a meeting in  Washington, finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  Saturday that the dollar's rise was "inconsistent with longer-run economic  fundamentals."  </P> <P> Traders said the frequency of sales rather than their size was pushing down the  dollar.  </P> <P> The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar, which  often moves in tandem with the U.S. dollar, and the British pound, which was  weighed down by a worse-than-expected trade deficit report.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound fell to $1.6155 from $1.6215 late Tuesday. In New  York, the pound fell to $1.6167 from $1.6190.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.45 Japanese yen to 141.35 yen. Later, in London, it  dropped to 139.45 yen. It was quoted at 140.32 yen in late New York trading,  down from 142.35 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gold edged higher in active European trading. In London, the metal rose to a  late bid of $368 an ounce from $367.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich,  Switzerland, gold also rose to a late bid of $368 from $367.75 bid late  Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at a bid of $369.92.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell  to $367.60 from $368.50. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold  was bid at $366.20, down from $367.30 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.28 an ounce, down from $5.31  bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell  to $5.245 from $5.263 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices fell slightly in a continued reaction to the dollar's slide.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped about 1/8 point, or $1.25  for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield edged up to 8.24% from 8.23% late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bond investors fear that the value of their Treasury bond portfolio will be  damaged if the dollar continues to lose ground against other currencies.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues declined 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/8 point to 3/16  point, and long-term issues lost 1/16 point to 1/8 point, according to Telerate  Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.08% as the discount jumped 6  basis points to 7.82%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.26% as the discount  gained 2 basis points at 7.83%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.36% as  the discount rose 5 basis points to 7.77%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 9%, unchanged from late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Exports demand pushed down grain futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Crude oil futures rose amid OPEC-member opposition to an accord increasing the  cartel's production ceiling.  </P> <P> On other markets, wheat prices were mixed, corn drifted lower, livestock and  pork fell, and precious metals declined.  </P> <P> "There's been very strong export demand for wheat," said Jerry Zusel, manager  of CBOT floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.  </P> <P> Zusel said Egypt late Tuesday tendered for 500,000 metric tons of wheat and the  Agriculture Department on Wednesday morning targeted Egypt for 1 million metric  tons of export bonus wheat.  </P> <P> Wheat prices were mixed, weakened by a lack of commercial buying while  supported by strong export demands, traders said. Corn slipped lower from lack  of any major demand.  </P> <P> Prices of crude oil futures moved higher when news reached the New York  Mercantile Exchange of OPEC member opposition to an Iranian proposal to  increase the oil cartel's production ceiling for the rest of the year.  </P> <P> Crude oil settled 6 to 24 cents higher, with November at $19.59 a barrel;  heating oil was 0.70 to 0.90 cent higher, with October at 58.46 cents a gallon,  and unleaded gasoline was 1.64 cents lower to 0.27 cent higher, with October at  58.74 a gallon.  </P> <P> On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for livestock and pork were  mostly lower.  </P> <P> Prices for live hogs and frozen pork bellies moved lower as traders, awaiting  Friday's hog inventory report from the Agriculture Department, were concerned  over some weakness in the cash markets, said Paul Hare, an analyst in Chicago  with Linnco Futures Inc.  </P> <P> Sizable deliveries of cattle to farmer markets weighed on cattle futures, he  said.  </P> <P> Futures prices for precious metals were lower on the Commodity Exchange in New  York.  </P> <P> Gold settled 50 cents to $1 lower, with the contract for delivery in September  at $367.60 an ounce; silver was 1.8 to 2.2 cents lower, with September at  $5.245 an ounce.  </P></p>

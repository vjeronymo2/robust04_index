			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL PAYS $820,000 CIVIL FINE IN DEFENSE CONTRACT CASE  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. on Wednesday paid the federal government more than  $800,000 to settle civil claims arising from the firm's conviction earlier this  year on charges of overbilling the Air Force for a satellite navigation system.  </P> <P> The company has now paid nearly $1.27 million to satisfy federal court  judgments in the case, which require the aerospace contractor to pay about  $820,000 in civil penalties, $446,000 in restitution and $5.5 million in  criminal fines. The $5.5 million is the largest fine levied in a defense  procurement fraud case.  </P> <P> In January, Rockwell pleaded guilty to overbilling the Air Force $500,000 on  the $1.2-billion NAVSTAR global positioning system, by which civilian and  military planes, ships and land vehicles can use radio signals broadcast by  satellites to fix their exact location.  </P> <P> The $5.5-million criminal penalty, which the company has already paid, was  imposed March 6 by Los Angeles U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall.  </P> <P> A company spokesman said the $820,000 civil fine was not unexpected.  </P> <P> At the time of Rockwell's guilty plea, company lawyers contended that the  overcharges came to light as a result of an internal investigation. It said the  fraud was carried out by two former executives of Rockwell's satellite systems  division.  </P> <P> The government accused Rockwell of obtaining secret reimbursement for  unexpected repair costs on the NAVSTAR project from a subcontractor and then  billing the Air Force for the same costs.  </P> <P> The indictment included a conspiracy count alleging that Rockwell tried to  cover up the fraud when federal auditors began asking questions.  </P> <P> Rockwell said at the time that the company was not guilty of any wrongdoing,  but that under law it must accept responsibility for criminal acts committed by  its employees while representing the company.  </P></p>

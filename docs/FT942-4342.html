			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / NHS 'grey suits' seek brighter image: The idea of professional health managers has gained ground slowly Any delegate who attends this week's conference of the Institute of Health Services Management wearing a grey suit will be suspected of an act of defiance. The grey-suits jibe was started by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, in November when he spoke of a 'restlessness among medical staff about the number of men in grey suits'. It has since become an everyday expression, tinged with insult, throughout the service. The 1990s have not been an easy time for National Health Service managers. They have carried responsibility for introducing the biggest ever changes in the way the service is run, only to be rewarded, many feel, by increasingly bitter and personal attacks from politicians, doctors and the public. Although the health service is one of the largest organisations in the world, the notion that it needs to be managed professionally has gained ground only slowly. It is less than 10 years since the first business-style general managers began reshaping a committee-dominated administrative system. The 1991 reforms increased the importance and status of managers - but also brought criticism that money was being diverted to management from clinical services. Mr Alan Langlands, who today addresses institute delegates for the first time since becoming NHS chief executive, says he recognises that some of his colleagues feel 'a bit bruised' by the style of the recent public debate about managers. 'The fact that the health service needs good managers should no longer be in doubt,' he says. 'We need people capable of managing in the complex environment of changing social standards, demographic change, technological advance, resource constraints and a climate of intense public and political interest. But we must act responsibly and show that we are aware of public concern about management costs.' Mr Langlands says information he has gathered on authorities purchasing healthcare on behalf of populations of 500,000 people show typical management costs of Pounds 5 per head of population - compared with spending of Pounds 660 per head on services. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday warned the conference that there were 'unacceptably wide' variations in management costs between trusts, ranging from almost 4 per cent to 8.6 per cent of the total pay bill. High administrative costs did not help managers, who were already suffering an image problem and were regarded with scepticism by the public, she said. Forthcoming changes in health service structure are likely to bring reductions in managerial and administrative costs. Ministers are considering reports on the role of the health department's central administration and of the Leeds-based NHS executive now that the 1991 reforms have pushed day-to-day activity to local level. Mr Langlands expects 'substantial staff cost savings' from moves to amalgamate district health authorities, which purchase hospital care, and the family health service authorities responsible for primary services. Raising the average standard of middle managers is among Mr Langlands's priorities. The reforms have increased demand for specialist staff in areas such as finance and personnel. At the same time, the number of career health service managers being recruited by other organisations is growing - evidence that NHS managers are appreciated somewhere, if not always in the service itself.</p>

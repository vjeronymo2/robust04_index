			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Canadian forestry groups advance sharply Canadian forest products companies have reported big improvements in third-quarter performance stemming from strong demand, higher prices and the lower Canadian dollar. The price rises cover most paper and packaging products, from newsprint to containerboard. North American timber prices, however, moderated as the threat of strikes in British Columbia waned. Japanese markets for specialised Canadian wood products turned higher. Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, sharply cut its third-quarter loss to CDollars 5.7m (USDollars 4.2m), or 6 cents a common share, from CDollars 26.8m, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Operating profit more than doubled to CDollars 8.7m, while sales rose 18.5 per cent to CDollars 552.6m. North American newsprint producers have raised prices twice so far this year, and have announced a third increase, equivalent to a 7 per cent cut in discounts. Abitibi said that 'the fundamental drivers of the newsprint business continue to improve', with newsprint consumption at US daily newspapers up 4.9 per cent last year. In the first nine months of 1994, newsprint shipments to overseas markets jumped 43 per cent. Noranda Forest, now solely an eastern producer, posted a third-quarter net profit of CDollars 28m, or 18 cents a share, against CDollars 6m, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 457m, against CDollars 381m. Nine-month profit was CDollars 82m, or 55 cents, against a loss of CDollars 42m, or 38 cents, (including a CDollars 66m loss on the sale of 49 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel). Doman, a western timber and pulp producer, had third-quarter net profit of CDollars 7.4m, or 17 cents a share, against CDollars 11.1m, or 30 cents, on revenues of CDollars 193m against CDollars 155m. Primex, a big exporter to Japan, had third-quarter net of CDollars 4.8m, or 56 cents, against CDollars 1.47m, or 17 cents, on sales of CDollars 63m against CDollars 41m. West Fraser Timber, an integrated producer, earned CDollars 29.6m, or CDollars 1.30 a share, up from CDollars 10.1m, or 53 cents, on sales of CDollars 339m against CDollars 228m.</p>

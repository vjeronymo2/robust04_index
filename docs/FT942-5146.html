			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Focus likely to remain on commodities - New York Last Friday's employment report, the most closely scrutinised economic data of the month, was supposed to clear the air and establish a fresh direction for equities. In the event, the numbers had the opposite effect, exacerbating the sense of confusion on Wall Street about the economy's strength and the implications for interest rates and corporate profits. If uncertainty was a force driving down share prices for most of the spring, it has held stocks in a state of near-paralysis more recently. Last week, the bellwether Dow Jones Industrial average opened at 3,758.37 and closed at 3,772.22, for a net gain of only 14 points. No sharp movements are expected this week, though a negative bias is likely to settle over stocks until the next important economic data - industrial production and capacity utilisation figures - are released in a fortnight. Friday was a topsy-turvy day on Wall Street. Initially, the May jobs report appeared to be highly favourable for stocks. The headline figure  - an increase in non-farm payrolls of 191,000 - was much weaker than analysts had thought. Bond prices jumped and share prices seemed sure to follow when trading began, because the weak number could delay for months the next move by the Federal Reserve to tighter money. However, investors gulped when they read past the first line. The Labor Department had made a big upward revision in its initial estimates of April and March payrolls. 'If anything, when you include the revisions, job creation was somewhat stronger than we had thought,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany in New York. A surprising drop in the monthly unemployment rate, from 6.4 to 6.0 per cent, was even more disturbing; 6.0 per cent is considered by many economists to be in effect 'full employment', at which point upward pressure on wages would intensify. Indeed, the May report showed a slight gain in hourly earnings, which suggested wage inflation had started last month. 'To put it into simple terms, it looks as if conditions in the labour markets are starting to tighten up,' says Mr Johnson. 'That means the Fed may need to raise rates again to cool the economy.' What, then, is the explanation for the mood swing that swept the markets as Friday's session progressed, lifting share prices amid a bond rally? Commodity prices, to cite one of several unconvincing explanations, showed further declines, in keeping with a pattern that helped support share prices last week. Wall Street will continue to focus on commodities this week, but their recent volatility leaves in doubt the likely impact on stocks. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to this Friday's producer price data and the consumer numbers, due next Monday. The data are expected to reveal that inflation remains subdued, but such confirmation is unlikely to impress investors.</p>

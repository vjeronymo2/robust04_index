			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NTIA requires that all applicants whose proposed projects need authorization from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must tender an application to the FCC for such authority on or before March 17, 1994. (An application is tendered to the FCC when it has been received by the Secretary of the FCC.) However, applicants are urged to submit it with as much lead time before the PTFP closing date as possible. The greater the lead time, the better the chance the FCC application will be processed to coincide with NTIA's grant cycle. NTIA may return the application of any applicant which fails to tender an application to the FCC for any necessary authority on or before March 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective October 1, 1988, OMB Circular A&hyph;102, as it applies to grant recipients, has been superseded by Department of Commerce regulations, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments (53 FR 8034, codified at 15 CFR 24 (1988)). Applicants should note that PTFP grant recipients, depending on their type of organization, are subject to the provisions of diverse Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars; i.e., A&hyph;87 ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments,'' A&hyph;21 ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,'' A&hyph;110, A&hyph;122, A&hyph;128, as implemented by 15 CFR part 29a, and A&hyph;133, as implemented by 15 CFR part 29b. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indirect costs for construction applications are not supported by this program. The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in a planning application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or 100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All non-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges such as fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial integrity. Potential grant recipient organizations may also be subject to reviews of Dun and Bradstreet data or other similar credit checks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD&hyph;511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.''

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL FIELD DEFENDS USE OF ANIMALS IN LAB  </P> <P> Facing growing protests over the use of animals in biomedical research, a group  of medical school deans, research scientists, patient advocacy groups and two  Cabinet officers banded together for the first time Friday to defend the  controversial practice.  </P> <P> On the eve of a weeklong series of animal rights protests, Health and Human  Resources Secretary Louis W. Sullivan and National Drug Policy Director William  J. Bennett lent their official support to beleaguered medical researchers  facing physical and verbal attacks, cuts in funding and increased costs for  security and regulations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Crucial' for Research  </P> <P> In statements released at a press conference here, Sullivan said that the use  of laboratory animals was "crucial" for research on life-threatening illnesses,  including AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Bennett called such research an  "indispensable part of our work against drug addiction."  </P> <P> The high-powered offensive by the government and medical establishment,  including the American Medical Assn., indicated the growing influence of more  than 200 so-called "animal rights" groups, which oppose, sometimes violently,  the traditional use of rats, dogs, monkeys and other animals for biomedical  research.  </P> <P> "Congress gets more letters on animal rights than on any other issue," said Dr.  Frederick K. Goodwin, administrator of the U.S. Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental  Health Administration, who defended the use of lab animals.  </P> <P> Animal rights groups have scheduled 300 demonstrations and rallies next week at  universities, private research centers and government institutions in New York,  Washington, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Sacramento and other cities to mark  "Animal Liberation Week" and the 10th anniversary of their movement.  </P> <P> "We want to end the war on animals in laboratories nationwide," said Ginger  Redmon, a spokeswoman for In Defense of Animals, one of the coordinating  groups. The groups also generally oppose wearing furs, raising animals in  "factory farms," killing strays and what they call the "exploitation" of  animals in other forms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A War of Sorts  </P> <P> Movement radicals have launched their own war of sorts. Boasting of their 70th  "action" for animal rights, an underground group called the Animal Liberation  Front claimed responsibility for two arson fires earlier this month that caused  more than $150,000 damage at a University of Arizona lab in Tucson. Officials  said the group also took 1,200 animals, including 30 mice infected with a  disease potentially fatal to humans.  </P> <P> In Norwalk, Conn., a former schoolteacher awaits trial on charges of attempted  murder for allegedly trying to bomb a company that uses dogs for surgical  training. Other activists destroyed a $3.5-million animal diagnostic lab at UC  Davis in April, 1987.  </P> <P> Regina Gavin, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania-based Trans-Species Unlimited,  one of the most active animal rights groups, said in a phone interview that her  organization does not support such violence. "But we understand the motivation  behind it," she said. "Frankly, I don't shed a tear when I hear a lab has been  broken into."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Peril to Mankind  </P> <P> Scientists credit research on animals for developing vaccines against polio and  measles, treatment against leukemia and lymphoma and new procedures in  everything from cataracts to heart surgery. But Gavin said such research was  "dangerous to mankind."  </P> <P> "It is dangerous to extrapolate data from animals to human beings," she said.  Before animals were used for research, she added, "centuries ago, we were going  along at a good rate. When we began to test animals, we may have set things  back."  </P> <P> Her group will lead a protest Saturday in lower Manhattan against New York  University associate professor Ronald W. Wood, a psychologist who uses rats and  eight long-tailed macaques to study the toxicity and other effects of inhaling  crack cocaine. He also uses the animals to study the effects of toluene, an  addictive compound found in glue, paint thinner, solvents and other common  products.  </P> <P> Gavin called the research a "total waste of taxpayers' money as well as  ethically wrong." But at the press conference at the NYU School of Medicine,  Dr. Wood won warm tributes from a panel of federal officials, a representative  of the American Medical Assn. and an association of 14 New York medical  schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demands Called Baseless  </P> <P> "We will not sacrifice Dr. Wood's work, or the work of any other scientist that  has passed our rigorous review process, to the baseless demands of any animal  rights group," said Charles R. Schuster, director of the National Institute of  Drug Abuse. He accused Trans-Species of using "misinformation, distortion and  outright fabrication" in its campaign.  </P> <P> He and other officials said they are publicly supporting Wood because Cornell  University capitulated to protests by Trans-Species last year by forcing a  prominent pharmacologist, Michiko Okamoto, to return a three-year federal grant  of $530,000 for drug-addiction experiments on cats.  </P> <P> Panelists said that scientists are now forced to spend 30% of their research  money to improve security and meet new federal regulations on the care and  treatment of lab animals.  </P> <P> Moreover, young scientists and doctors are turning away from needed medical  research "in response to pressure and propaganda from animal activists," said  Dr. Russell H. Patterson Jr., head of the AMA's council on ethical and judicial  affairs. He accused the activists of "infiltrating our schools and influencing  our children" to further their goals.  </P> <P> Hoping to counter the use of heart-rending photos and stories by animal rights  groups, the panel presented a 12-year-old girl from Berwyn, Pa., wearing braces  and a pink dress, whose life apparently was saved by animal research.  </P> <P> In a calm voice, Virginia Black said that her daughter, Barbara, was born with  fluid on the brain and endured years of pain, vomiting and seizures despite  more than a dozen operations. "Our other daughter would ask, 'Mommy, is Barbara  going to die?' " Mrs. Black said.  </P> <P> She said the family finally met Dr. Fred Epstein, a New York neurosurgeon who  was using cats to study pressure on the brain. After he performed surgery to  expand Barbara's cranial cavity, she now enjoys a normal life as a 6th grader,  riding her bike and swimming.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt that I have saved children who would not have survived were  it not for animal studies," Dr. Epstein said.  </P></p>

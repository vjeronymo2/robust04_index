			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shafiq al-Asadi] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi--The UAE's [United Arab Emirate] crude oil  revenues in 1993 dropped by 1.766 billion dirhams [UD] (about  $600 million) to UD51.350 billion ($13.99 billion) relative to  its crude oil revenues in 1992, which totaled UD53.116 billion  ($14.5 billion). This drop is attributed to the decline in crude  oil prices that occurred in the second half of 1993.    The UAE's crude oil revenues in 1993 constituted 39 percent  of its gross product, which totaled about UD131.6 billion.    The Planning Ministry, in preliminary estimates published  yesterday on economic developments in the UAE in 1993, stressed  that the decline in oil revenues was accompanied by an increase  in the non-oil sectors' share of gross product, which totaled  UD80.310 billion ($21.88 billion), compared to UD77.047 billion  ($20.99 billion) in 1992.    Most of the oil revenues in the UAE go to the Emirate of Abu  Dhabi.    According to 1992 estimates, the oil sector in each of the  emirates contributed the following to the UAE's domestic  product: Abu Dhabi, UD43.541 billion; Dubai, UD8.394 billion;  al-Shariqah, UD10.061 billion; Ra's al-Khaymah, UD120 million.    Of all of the emirates, Abu Dhabi's oil output contributes  the most to the GDP. The Planning Ministry states that Abu  Dhabi's gross product rose to UD81.692 billion in 1993, compared  to UD80.979 billion in 1992 and UD79.9 billion in 1991, despite  the drop in oil prices.    The gross product of the Emirate of Dubai rose to UD31.200  billion in 1993, compared to UD30.729 billion in 1992 and  UD28.967 billion in 1991.    The gross product of the Emirate of al-Shariqah rose to  UD10.322 billion in 1993, compared to UD10.194 billion in 1992  and UD9.616 billion in 1991.    The gross product of the Emirate of 'Ajman rose to UD1.602  billion in 1993, compared to UD1.562 billion in 1992 and UD1.489  billion in 1991. The gross product of the Emirate of Umm  al-Qaywayn rose to UD873 million in 1993, compared to UD852  million in 1992 and UD800 million in 1991.    The gross product of the Emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah rose to  UD3.941 billion in 1993, compared to UD3.860 billion in 1992 and  UD3.655 billion in 1991. The gross product of the Emirate of  al-Fujayrah rose to UD2.030 billion in 1992, compared to UD1.987  billion and UD1.788 billion during 1992 and 1991 respectively.    The UAE's GDP in 1993 rose to UD131.660 billion, compared to  UD130.163 billion in 1992.    The UAE Planning Ministry stated that the different  production sectors recorded varying degrees of development. The  most salient development was the drop in the value of the output  of the extraction (crude oil) industries to UD51.350 billion in  1993, compared to UD53.116 billion in 1992. However, the value  of the output of the other extraction industries rose to UD369  million, compared to UD355 million in 1992.    The share of manufacturing industries rose to UD10.891  billion, compared to UD9.942 billion in 1992. During the same  period, the share of the electricity and water sector rose from  UD2.869 billion to UD2.961 billion; that of the building and  construction sector rose from UD11.125 to UD11.582 billion; that  of the wholesale and retail trade and hotel sector rose from  UD13.020 billion to UD13.382 billion; and that of the transport,  storage, and communications sector rose from UD7.167 billion to  UD7.390 billion.</p>

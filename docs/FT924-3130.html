			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Outcry over exchange expansion - CBOT plans to build a Dollars 150m trading facility COMPUTER trading may be where the future lies for financial markets in general, but North America's largest futures exchanges are all planning to expand their trading floors in 1993, sticking loyally to the open outcry system. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, jumped on the expansion bandwagon this month with a proposal to build a Dollars 150m trading facility immediately south of the exchange on LaSalle Street. The membership will vote on the plan on December 17. The proposal comes as US financial futures products are under increasingly competitive assault by over-the-counter traders and overseas exchanges. Smaller CBOT member firms which are struggling financially have not received the proposal happily. The plan, to be financed in part by a four-year increase in trading fees, coincides with a controversial exchange-sponsored study that suggests declining profitability among brokers. While exchange officials refuse to comment on the study, a Chicago newspaper last week reported that the analysis found that average annual income for the CBOT's soya bean futures traders dropped an inflation-adjusted 40 per cent between 1988 and 1991, and that even traders in the exchange's frenzied Treasury bond pit have seen income decline in recent years. In a letter to members Mr Thomas Donovan, CBOT president, said the data in the newspaper report was preliminary and misleading. However, he failed to quell complaints by independent traders and small brokerage houses that they are losing money as business concentrates in fewer pits and the large investment houses. The CBOT building project is aimed at relieving overcrowding on the exchange's financial futures trading floor. Despite the complaints, exchange volume has risen every year, thanks to the US Treasury bond and note pits, where trading space has long been inadequate. Bond and note brokers work in a stuffy, poorly-lit 19,000 sq ft space first designed for cash grain trading. A proposal to move the financial futures trade across the hall and into the exchange's 35,000 sq ft state-of-the art trading floor was blocked by grain and soyabean futures traders, who have used the facility since it opened in 1984. In practice, agricultural members control the CBOT's politics, although they generate little more than 20 per cent of exchange volume. Those same interests may veto the new building plan, although officials say it is essential to the CBOT's growth. While the CBOT and the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange have invested heavily in Globex, the electronic after-hours trading system, Globex is not expected to replace immediately the trading floor. Launched in the summer, Globex has been troubled by software bugs and rarely records daily volumes above 3,000 contracts. 'All three exchanges (the CBOT, the CME and the New York Mercantile Exchange) have capacity problems, and one has to be prepared to expand the factory,' says Mr Richard Sandor, one of the architects of the first CBOT financial futures contract, and now an executive managing director at Kidder Peabody in New York. While electronic trading has become popular, particularly in Europe, Mr Sandor says: 'These are long-tailed cycles . . . these things can co-exist side-by-side.' In the first 11 months of 1992, the CBOT traded 140.5m contracts, up 8.5 per cent over the same period in 1991. Of that total, 105.5m were financial futures and options, mostly Treasury bonds and notes. The CME increased volume by 25.3 per cent over the same period with more than 68m contracts traded in the overcrowded Eurodollar futures and options pits. The Eurodollar derivatives are growing in excess of 64 per cent per year, thanks mostly to interest rate swap business. The CME plans to move its Eurodollar and foreign currency futures and options pits to a new trading floor directly above its current floor next summer. It is engaged in a Dollars 26.6m outfitting which will equal the size of the CME's existing 35,000 sq ft floor. The CME has out-grown its trading space four times in the past 20 years. Mr Jack Sander, CME chairman, said space on the existing floor freed by the move will be devoted to foreign and domestic stock index futures. The CME expansion is being financed from existing resources and will not require increased clearing fees. New York's Nymex has also taken a conservative approach to overcrowding, opting to lease, rather than build. Last month the exchange, which has a growing complex of energy futures products, announced it would move from its shared floor in the World Trade Center to a building in lower Manhattan. Plans for the space, which the Nymex will lease for 15 years, include a 25,000sq ft trading floor. Nymex received a variety of tax breaks and incentives to take the site and does not expect to have to raise clearing fees to finance the move. New York's three smaller commodity exchanges, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, hope to start on a new building in lower Manhattan in mid-1993. The exchanges are still negotiating financing on the Dollars 150m project, and expect to remain in the World Trade Center location they share with Nymex throughout next year.</p>

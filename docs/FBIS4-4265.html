			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472): "Resolutely and </F> Enduringly Conduct Anticorruption Struggle"]    [Text] Yesterday, the municipal party committee and the  municipal government held a meeting of party-member leading  cadres of districts, counties, and bureaus to relay the  important speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin at the third plenary  session of the central discipline inspection commission and the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the central  discipline inspection commission, and to work out plans for  conducting anticorruption struggle this year. Chen Xitong,  secretary of the municipal party committee, gave a speech. He  called on leaders at all levels to use practical experience and  to resolutely attend to anticorruption struggle in line with the  central demands.    Mayor Li Qiyan presided over the meeting. Chen Guangwen,  deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, relayed the  important speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin. On behalf of the  municipal party committee and the municipal government, Li  Yongan, member of the standing committee of the municipal party  committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection  committee, gave a report "on the opinions for implementing the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the central  discipline inspection and deeply conducting the next stage of  anticorruption struggle."    Li Yongan said: Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining  stability is the overall situation of the whole party's work.  Anticorruption and the building of party style and  administrative honesty must obey and serve this overall  situation. The overall demands of this year's Beijing municipal  anticorruption struggle are to continuously and resolutely  implement the central plan on anticorruption struggle, uphold  the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and be tough with  both," proceed from the reality of the work of the entire  municipality, and on the basis of consolidating the  achievements, grasp the prominent problems that hamper and  affect reform, development, and stability, define this year's  anticorruption specific tasks and objectives, and integrate  anticorruption with the work of comprehensively promoting party  style and administrative honesty; combine the establishment and  perfection of rules and regulations with the strengthening of  ideological and political work and professional ethics; combine  administrative honesty with diligent administration, deepen  reform, firmly grasp education, improve systems, strengthen  supervision, strictly enforce law and discipline, integrate  honesty with diligence, deeply, enduringly and effectively carry  out anticorruption struggle, and serve Beijing Municipality's  reform, development, and stability.    He said: It is necessary to resolutely implement the  "opinions for implementing the five stipulations on keeping  leading cadres of party and government organs at and above the  county (section) level clean and self-disciplined," "on the  method of handling in line with party discipline the acts of  violating the five stipulations on honesty and self-discipline  of party and government leading cadres at and above the county  (section) level; and continue to attend to supervision,  inspection, and implementation. The central authorities have  issued another "five stipulations" on keeping leading cadres  clean and self-disciplined this year. The problems involving in  these "five stipulations" have existed at varying degrees and  within a certain scope in Beijing Municipality. The masses have  expressed comments on and criticism of the phenomena that a  small number of party and government leading cadres have ridden  on "black plate" cars used by foreign enterprises; arbitrarily  misappropriated the cars of subordinate units for a long time  under the pretext of borrowing them; and replaced their old cars  with imported luxurious cars. The problems as reflected by the  masses, were concentrated on the using of public funds for  furnishing one's own house above the set standards, which should  be listed as a priority for investigation and rectification. In  addition, cases on holding lavish weddings and funerals have  frequently occurred in some cadres; and cases on borrowing and  misappropriating public funds (articles) or delaying the payment  of public funds have also existed at varying degrees in some  departments and units. Although these two problems have not yet  become a common practice, we should conscientiously resolve them  by proceeding from reality. Regarding the aforementioned  problems, party committees and governments at all levels should  proceed from reality and resolutely carry out their work in  accordance with the stipulations of the central authorities and  the municipal party committee and government.    He said: Continued efforts should be made to investigate and  handle major and appalling cases. We should continue to persist  in regarding investigation and handling of cases on law and  discipline violations involving party and government leading  organs, leading cadres and judicial department, administrative  law-enforcing departments, economic management departments, and  other functionaries as the priorities.    Priorities should be  given to investigating and handling cases on leading cadres who  engage in corruption and bribe-taking and abuse their powers to  seek personal gain and cases on law and discipline enforcing  personnel who practice favoritism and engage in malpractice, who  take bribes and bend the law, and who violate law and  discipline, and cases on law and discipline violations involving  legal entities. It is necessary to attend to the handling and  punishment for typical cases.    He said: Continued efforts should be made to check unhealthy  trends in various trades. While checking the random collection  of fees, fines, and forced donations this year, we should put  special emphasis on strengthening supervision and inspection and  firmly carry out this work. On the one hand, we should pursue  the responsibility of relevant leaders who continue to collect  funds which are formally ordered to be abolished by the  municipal party committee and give them necessary punishment in  line with party and administrative discipline; on the other  hand, we should organize inspection activities, experiment with  the method of "using cadres to supervise the collection of  funds," implement the stipulations and other measures on  separating the management of the collection of administrative  funds from the collection of fines, and consolidate and expand  the achievements in checking the random of collection of fees,  fines, and forced donations. Meanwhile, we should continue to  grasp the work of reducing the burdens of peasants.    Li Yongan said: The demands of the party Central Committee,  the State Council, and the municipal party committee and  government on strengthening party style and administrative  honesty are also applicable to enterprises and units. The party  committee and administrative leaders of enterprises and units  should proceed from the reality of their own units, set forth  explicit demands on self- discipline for party and government  cadres of enterprises, institutions, and units in line with a  series of relevant demands of the central authorities, and  supervise the implementation of these demands.    In his speech, Chen Xitong pointed out: Last year, in line  with the decision and plans of the central authorities, all  sectors in the municipality made common efforts, resolutely  conducted anticorruption struggle, strengthened administrative  honesty, and achieved expected results. Most units made  achievements of varying degrees, units with good performance  made more obvious achievements, and some units that were slack  in their work went through the motions. This year the whole  municipality should act in accordance with the central demand on  deeply, enduringly, and more effectively conducting  anticorruption struggle, and the plans and tasks of the central  discipline inspection commission, launch the struggle in line  with Beijing's reality, apply the experience of the previous  stage, and continue to exert strenuous efforts to make the  anticorruption work a greater success.    Chen Xitong stressed: To fight corruption, we must first be  resolute. If we fail to be resolute, we will not have fighting  strength, will not be able to fight corruption, will depart from  the masses, and will not be qualified to be a leader. We should  soberly recognize that some systems, laws, and regulations are  not perfect under the new situation, leaving loopholes for the  people to exploit. Therefore, anticorruption struggle has  become more important, and must be grasped resolutely. At  present, the idea of "that is good enough" and the worries that  anticorruption work may affect reform, development, and  stability which hamper our efforts to fight corruption are all  wrong. Actually, we still have disparities in anticorruption  work. Only by resolutely carrying out anticorruption struggle  can we facilitate reform and opening up, win support from the  people, and bring about stability. Leaders at all levels should  persist in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both,  and combine anticorruption with deepening reform, expanding  opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability.  Only by resolutely grasping anticorruption work can we  consolidate the ruling status of our party, and better undertake  the historical heavy task of leading reform, opening up, and  modernization.    Chen Xitong said: Anticorruption work must be constantly  carried out. We must guard against impetuous. Some people inside  the party will be contaminated by things of the old society. It  is impossible to be absolutely perfect.    For many reasons, including the "mosquitoes and flies"  brought in by history, society, class, ideology, and opening up,  anticorruption is a long-term struggle. It is impossible to  finish a work at one go and accomplish one task at one stroke.  We must fight a long war. It is not right to be rash, not right  not to grasp this work conscientiously, and not right to do it  slowly.    Chen Xitong said: To fight corruption, we must grasp a  portion of the expected achievements because this is the  manifestation of the principle of being resolute and enduring,  carry out this work stage by stage, and sum up every portion of  the expected achievements to form an overall achievement. In  this way, we may reduce the corrupt phenomena to the minimum.    He said: We should strengthen both self supervision and mass  supervision. Party organizations should do a good job in  holding democratic life activities, conduct self supervision,  use criticism and self-criticism as a weapon, and help one  another, and should not establish vulgar relations or engage in  hypocritical work style. Last year, we persisted in holding  democratic life activities, promoted honesty and  self-discipline, encouraged people to exchange views, and then  reported the results to the masses of each specific unit and to  the democratic parties to listen to their opinions, and  gradually form them into a system, which was welcomed by the  masses. This good experience should be upheld.    He said: It is necessary to strengthen education and deal  strict blows to criminals and combine the two together. We  should conscientiously investigate and handle major and  appalling cases, resolutely deal strict blows to serious crimes,  and never be soft-handed. Regarding those who are contaminated  by bourgeois work style and commit mistakes which should not be  punished in line with the criminal law, we should educate them,  and encourage them to find out the reasons for their mistakes,  to absorb lessons, and to make corrections. Some should be  punished in line with party and administrative discipline, which  is also an education for them. We should make full use of  negative examples to enhance the understanding of the people,  and must not neglect everything after ending a case without  noticing its educational role. The core of education is to  cultivate the communist outlook on life and the world outlook.  Struggling to fulfill the communist ideals is a lofty move, and  letting the Chinese people reach common prosperity and lead a  happy life is of great significance in life.    He said: We should combine diligent administration with  honest administration, attend to administrative honesty and  promote diligent administration, attach importance to both, do  a better job in this aspect, work for the well-being of the  people, and do more practical and good things for them.  Practice has proved that we will achieve good results in  promoting diligent administration by always introducing the  achievements of anticorruption and administrative honesty to it.    Chen Xitong said: We should concentrate efforts on grasping  administrative honesty and grasp it regularly. Leaders should  concentrate their energy and time on solving problems. For  example, last year we universally held democratic life  activities. However, concentrating efforts on grasping this  work does not mean that we should turn it into a movement. We  should attend to it regularly and should have systems and  inspection to support this work. He called on leaders at all  levels to uphold these experiences which have been proved by  practice and apply them this year's work so as to achieve  greater achievements in anticorruption struggle.    In his speech, Li Qiyan said: Anticorruption work is one  which has a vital bearing on the overall situation. It should  be carried out under the party committee's unified leadership  and plans and with the joint efforts of the party and government  organs. Administrative leaders should not neglect anticorruption  struggle even under the situation of having numerous economic  work and heavy tasks. A success in this work will help develop  our various undertakings. It is necessary to conscientiously  relay the conference guidelines, form a momentum, adopt  practical measures, and realistically achieve a portion of the  expected results in anticorruption struggle.    Municipal leaders Wang Baosen, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi,  Duan Bingren, Qiang Wei, Meng Zhiyuan, Xia Qinlin, Tao Xiping,  Xue Bingzhong, Lu Yucheng, Hu Zhaoguang, Duan Qiang, Feng  Mingwei, and Fan Yuanmou attended the conference.</p>

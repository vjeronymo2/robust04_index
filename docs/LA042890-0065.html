			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED WILL LAY OFF 2,000 IN SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> In another sign that the local aircraft industry is slowing down, Lockheed  Corp. said Friday it will lay off 2,750 salaried and hourly employees in its  aircraft division, including 2,000 in Southern California.  </P> <P> The company attributed the cuts at its Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., which  were expected, to the shrinking defense budget and the completion of some major  defense projects, such as the contract to build the F-117A Stealth fighter  plane.  </P> <P> Lockheed, based in Calabasas, was not alone Friday in announcing  defense-related cuts. General Electric Co. said it would eliminate 4,200 jobs  over two years at GE Aerospace plants in New York and New Jersey.  </P> <P> And the Lockheed announcement came only a day after McDonnell Douglas Corp.  said it would cut 3,000 white-collar jobs at its operation in Long Beach, where  its commercial and military aircraft divisions have suffered financial and  production problems.  </P> <P> "It's just a sign of the times," said Jerry Cantwell, an industry analyst for  Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York, citing growing pressure to reduce  military spending. Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale, however, said the layoffs  were not directly related to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's announcement  Thursday that he will seek $34 billion in spending cuts over the next six  years.  </P> <P> About 1,700 jobs will be eliminated at Lockheed's sprawling plant in Burbank,  200 at its Palmdale plant and about 100 at a research center in the Santa  Clarita Valley. The remaining 750 layoffs will occur at Lockheed's Marietta,  Ga., facility. Most of the layoffs are expected to be implemented by July.  </P> <P> The layoffs represent about 16% of the aircraft division's local employees, and  about 12% of its employees nationwide. "Slightly more than half" of the layoffs  will be among salaried employees, Ragsdale said.  </P> <P> Lockheed has already cut about 9,000 aircraft division jobs since 1988, when it  began to scale down production of the C-5B cargo plane. And the company said  the situation was not expected to brighten soon.  </P> <P> "It is unlikely we will have any large new military aircraft production project  that will begin before the mid-1990s," Ken Cannestra, president of Lockheed's  aeronautical division, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Lockheed does not have any specific forecasts of more layoffs, but "it is  possible we could see some more," Ragsdale said.  </P> <P> Union officials seemed resigned to the cuts. "It's an unfortunate situation,"  said Don Nakamoto, spokesman for District 727 of the International Assn. of  Machinists and Aerospace Workers. "We understand that their business is  declining."  </P> <P> The Lockheed layoffs did not surprise city officials in Burbank, who recalled  the company's announcement a year ago that it plans to move its operations out  of the area eventually. City officials said the layoffs also will hurt the  local businesses that provide materials and services to Lockheed.  </P> <P> "We don't like to hear about any economic condition that causes residents and  employers to reduce their work force," said Stephen Helvey, Burbank's assistant  city manager. "It's obviously going to have some impact on our economy; it will  be tough to know what that impact will be until we see what Lockheed's  continued use of the facilities will be in the city."  </P> <P> But officials said that even an entire pullout would not send the city into a  tailspin. In fact, it could help the city by freeing up the land for more  revenue-producing uses such as retail stores, City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard  said. Also, the property tax base would jump if the land were sold and assessed  at a higher value, the officials said.  </P> <P> Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep might feel under pressure in the future to  cut costs elsewhere in the company, said analyst Lawrence M. Harris, with  Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. Harris noted that Tellep and his  management team only recently prevailed against financier Harold C. Simmons in  a bitter proxy battle for control of Lockheed.  </P> <P> "In the wake of the proxy fight, Mr. Tellep has indicated increased emphasis  will be placed on profits and cash flow, which means each of the units of  Lockheed will be getting a closer look," Harris said.  </P> <P> Lockheed last year delivered its last C-5B transport plane and TR-1  reconnaissance plane to the Air Force and expects to deliver the last F-117A  this year. Lockheed will build only six more P-3 anti-submarine planes -- for  Canada and Pakistan -- by September, 1991.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lynn O'Shaughnessy contributed to this article.  </P></p>

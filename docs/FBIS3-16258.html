			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Izark Vasilidze, including </F> recorded remarks by Vakhtang Gogaudze, Georgian Supreme Council  speaker and Zurab Erkvania, chairman of the Council of Ministers  of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia]    [Text] Another provocation and an attempt to destabilize  the situation in the republic -- that is the leitmotif of the  view of the Abkhazian Parliament of yesterday's action by the  Georgian Supreme Council, which I will remind you adopted a  resolution dissolving the Abkhazian Parliament. Tbilisi also  continues to discuss this topic.    [Vasilidze] The unanimity with which the resolution was  adopted leads one to think that either a solution to the  Abkhazian question already exists, and everything is ready for  its implementation, or that it is one of those purely academic  issues at the level of juridical law making. Having spoken to  officials, the opinion remains that the whole affair is most  probably within the realm of the second alternative. Inter alia  Vakhtang Goguadze, the speaker of the [Georgian] Supreme  Council, replied to the question of how the decision will be  implemented, saying:    [Goguadze] It depends on the further development of the  situation, the general circumstances; what things are like in  Russia, Georgia, our mutual understanding and relations -- it  depends more on this than directly on the decision adopted.    [Vasilidze] Regarding the question of the possible renewal  of  military actions in Abkhazia by the Georgian leadership,  Vakhtang Goguadze replied:    [Goguadze] For our part, for the part of the leadership,  this  is in no way permissible. Therefore, Abkhazia should be  demilitarized, and then we have to restore police order, and  live according to the language of the Constitution.    [Vasilidze] Zurab Erkvania, the chairman of the council of  ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, which by the  Supreme Council's decision received the status of the  temporarily evacuated and only legal body of authority in  Abkhazia until elections are held, spoke about the situation in  Abkhazia.    [Erkvania] The confederation, which is calling the tune on  the temporarily occupied territory of Abkhazia is virtually, in  essence, a terrorist, illegal organization that was formed on  the territories of independent, sovereign states -- the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Georgia. It is evident that this  resolution gives a legal evaluation of their criminal activities.    [Vasilidze] At the same time, the Georgian Supreme Council's  decision clearly arouses increased interest by Russia as well.  There is no doubt that today's confidential meeting between  Vladimir Zemskiy, the Russian ambassador to Georgia, and the  Supreme Council's speaker, touched on this theme.    Izark Vasilidze from Tbilisi, specially for NTV.    [Announcer] Certain very confidential sources claim that  Eduard Shevardnadze secretly met the Abkhazian leader Vladislav  Ardzinba in New York, and it is not ruled out that this  information made it to the Georgian Supreme Council, causing  such a harsh reaction.</p>

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Bonds jolted by jump in US inflation THE US bond market was jolted yesterday by news of an unexpected 0.5 per cent jump in consumer prices last month. The spurt in inflation came only a day after the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, cut interest rates by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent in an attempt to accelerate a weak economic recovery. The rise in prices, the largest for 17 months, took the annual rate of inflation to 3.2 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent in February. The benchmark 30-year long bond initially fell more than half a point, but regained some ground by midday as analysts pointed to the dangers of taking one month's figures too seriously. The increase in prices was broadly based, with food, energy, clothing and transportation prices all registering big gains. The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.5 per cent last month, nearly twice the increase analysts had expected. On an annual basis, core inflation rose to 3.9 per cent last month, against 3.7 per cent in February. The jump in inflation was a minor embarrassment for the Fed which nudged interest rates lower partly on the basis of encouraging figures for wholesale price inflation. Producer prices, reported on Thursday, rose only 0.2 per cent last month and by 0.9 per cent in the year to March. The poor consumer price figures may raise fears that inflation will accelerate again if the economy recovers from three years of abnormally sluggish growth. Most analysts, however, were inclined to treat the March figures as an aberration. The economy is widely seen as too weak to sustain price increases of this magnitude. 'I expect the underlying rate of inflation to continue to drift down, but slowly,' said Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corporation, a New York financial services company. Some analysts, however, said the unexpected jump in prices would make the Fed reluctant to sanction any further cuts in interest rates.</p>

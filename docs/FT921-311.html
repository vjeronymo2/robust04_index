			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Economics: Search for further signs of recovery in the US THE last two months have seen some signs of recovery in the US. The question this week is whether these positive pointers will continue into those relating to March. New home sales rose by 12.9 per cent in February, while the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) survey for February pointed to a slightly more upbeat assessment in the outlook among manufacturers. The consensus of analysts' forecasts compiled by MMS International, the business information group, suggests that both trends will continue. Friday's labour market data for March should show no further increase in unemployment from February's 7.3 per cent. In February 164,000 jobs were created, the highest number for two years. According to research by Midland Montagu, however, nearly all the employment growth in February was in services, with a big proportion of the new jobs concentrated in retail trade. Increases in manufacturing were more meagre - February produced only 12,000 new jobs in the sector as a whole. Midland Montagu believes manufacturers that will probably raise employment during March in response to an increase in orders and strong consumer spending in February. Several important inflation indicators will be released in Europe. With Germany's preliminary cost of living index for March expected to show annual inflation at 4.7 per cent, up from 4.3 per cent in February, the Bundesbank will not want to relax its high interest rate policy for the time being. Unemployment data is also due in Germany. The continued rise in unemployment reflects the weakness of the economy - West German unemployment has been badly affected by weak manufacturing production and high inflows of immigrant workers. In the UK there is virtually no economic data and certainly none that politicians will attempt to latch onto as the election campaign enters its third week. Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of City forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company, include: Today: US, February new home sales; Denmark, fourth quarter GDP; Canada, January employment earnings.

In an interview for CTK, however, he said that his statement  "does not have to correspond completely to reality," but added  that the ministry had decided to make such a statement in its  foreign policy report to parliament only after much  consideration.    "The ministry has analysed several specific statements by  the  chairman of the (Hungarian) Egyutteles movement, Miklos Duray  and come to the conclusion that they contain elements of  irredentism," Moravcik said. He added that some of these  statements led to the holding of the January 8 meeting in  Komarno, Southern Slovakia, where members of the country's  Hungarian minority were to discuss the creation of an autonomous  Hungarian "province" in the region, but eventually dropped the  issue.    Moravcik reiterated his opposition to the idea that granting  rights to minorities should create artificial borders between  various ethnic groups. He said that a situation where the  granting of one demand only leads to the raising of another is  intolerable.    The Slovak-Hungarian friendship treaty under preparation is  a  "basic pillar" of cooperation between the two countries, he  said, adding that Slovakia saw no reason to delay signing it  soon.</p>

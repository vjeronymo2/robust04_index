			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Waterford Wedgwood at IPounds 0.4 WATERFORD Wedgwood yesterday reported its first interim profit in six years as the long and painful rationalisation of its luxury crystal business in Ireland began finally to bear fruit. For the six months to end-June the group swung from losses of IPounds 5.8m to profits of IPounds 400,000 (Pounds 374,000) at the pre-tax level. Since 1987 the group, created by the merger of the Wedgwood fine china and Waterford crystal businesses, has suffered accumulated losses in the region of IPounds 85m. First-half turnover rose just 3.7 per cent to IPounds 135.4m. The group said profit growth had been achieved 'through cost reduction rather than volume growth'. The Waterford crystal division reported operating profits of IPounds 1.6m against a previous deficit of IPounds 3.3m. In January this year trade unions representing the 1,600 workforce at the Waterford Crystal division agreed to a rescue plan involving 200 voluntary redundancies, pay cuts of up to 25 per cent, and a three-year no-strike agreement. Waterford's sales in the first half rose 24 per cent to IPounds 38.7m, largely a result of growing success with the new outsourced Marquis range of crystalware in a more buoyant US market, as well as a 150-strong new product range introduced in the company's Classic range of crystalware. Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of Waterford, said: 'We are much stronger now than we were a year ago, with improved volumes and increased market share. 'An operating profit of IPounds 1.6m is still not enough though and there are further non-labour cost savings we are working on.' He said that the Marquis range, which is aimed at the middle-income sector of the market, 'has carved out its own place in the sun. There was concern that it might cannibalise the upper end of the market but this has not happened. There has been growth in both markets with sales in Marquis well up on last year'. The Wedgwood fine china division had a particularly tough year, with sales down 2.6 per cent to IPounds 96.7m. Mr Kneale Ashwell, the division's chairman and chief executive, said the Japanese market had suffered through a downturn in consumer spending 'but we are doing better, not only than our competitors in picking up market share, but better than the luxury goods sector as a whole'. He said that rationalisation measures begun last year 'should be largely complete by the year-end'. Like the crystal division, he said Wedgwood was also 'now looking at worldwide outsourcing of new products', which are not currently manufactured by the company but which will be introduced under the Wedgwood brand name. Mr Richard Barnes, group chief financial officer, said that although net debt had grown to IPounds 72.6m (IPounds 63m) this was largely due to exchange rate fluctuations, and should return to about IPounds 60m by year-end. He said no exceptional items were anticipated in the current year's results, and that 'on existing capacity-demand relationships no further rationalisations should be necessary'. Earnings per share were 0.02p (losses of 0.91p).</p>

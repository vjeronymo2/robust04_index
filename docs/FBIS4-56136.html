			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec said today that a two-day conference on the  stability pact, which opens in Paris tomorrow, will be the  culmination of many months of effort by diplomats from France  and the countries applying for European Union (EU) membership.    He told reporters prior to his departure for Paris that he  hoped that the conference would start a process "leading to  greater understanding between the states in central and Eastern  Europe, and also in their relation to the EU." Zieleniec said  he did not expect any document to be signed in Paris, as the  conference, he said, would rather be a political event.  Zieleniec expressed satisfaction with all the texts prepared  for the conference, as they now reflect consensus in France, the  EU but also in the associated countries.    The stability pact will not lead to the creation of new  international institutions, but will start a process which will  (naturally) become part of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) process, Zieleniec said.</p>

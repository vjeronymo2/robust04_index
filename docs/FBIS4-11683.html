			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Hajj"] </F>   [Text] The head of our country's Hajj and Pilgrimage  Organization has asked Saudi Arabia to honor the Saudi-Iranian  agreement on the number of Iranian pilgrims and the manner of  performing the hajj ritual. Under the agreement Saudi Arabia  consented to the dispatch of 110,000 Iranian pilgrims to that  country and also to the performing of the Disavowal of Infidels  ritual during the hajj period. Three years after the sending of  Iranian pilgrims was halted, following the tragedy of the  massacre at the holy shrine in 1369 [1990], the foreign  ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement which has  been implemented over the past three years. [sentence as heard]    Now, within the framework of its commitments in its  relations  with Iran, Saudi Arabia is expected to provide the necessary  facilities for the reception of Iranian pilgrims eager to visit  the holy House of God. Since adherence to the Koranic and legal  principle of honoring commitments is considered as a basis for  international relations, its violation is considered a violation  of international regulations and norms and would undoubtedly  reduce Saudi Arabia's international credit.    Saudi Arabia's adherence to its commitments concerning its  bilateral and multilateral relations notwithstanding, the Saudi  rulers should be aware of their present position and of their  sensitive responsibility for managing the two holy shrines.  They should know that their main duty, if they value that  management, is to help eligible Muslims to perform their  religious duty of hajj.    Saudi Arabia's sudden, unconventional, and unethical  decision  to reduce the number of Iranian pilgrims by 50 percent, in  addition to delaying hundreds of thousands of eager Iranian  pilgrims in the performance of their hajj duty, would completely  prevent about 177,000 septuagenarian Iranian pilgrims  [accumulated backlog of elderly still waiting to undertake  pilgrimage] from performing this divine duty. Undoubtedly, this  is contrary to the Saudi rulers' religious and moral commitment  to assist Muslims in the performance of their religious duty.  Although the Saudi Government, by insisting on its criterion --  that is, accepting one pilgrim per thousand of the population of  each country -- is trying to reduce Iran's quota, it is  perfectly obvious that many countries are sending a much smaller  number than their quota. Therefore, sending 110,000 or more  Iranian pilgrims, as in previous years, would not have a  fundamental effect on the management of the pilgrims' affairs.    Arabistan [Saudi Arabia] is insisting on reducing the quota  of pilgrims agreed with Iran, while every year several countries  send more than their set quota to the House of God. In this  connection one can mention Egypt, which has a smaller population  than Iran but exceeds the quota set by Arabistan by tens of  thousands of pilgrims.    Such contradictory assertions and behavior by the Saudi  rulers give rise to the thought that the Saudi Government has  adopted a political attitude in relation to the hajj. This of  course is not in harmony with that country's obligation to  manage the affairs of the two holy shrines. Adopting a  politically laden attitude toward people's religious obligations  is a sensitive issue which can, furthermore, induce sensitivity.  This attitude, moreover, cannot be justified or interpreted  coherently within the framework of the two countries' friendly  relations, which Iran has always tried to maintain.    It is appropriate that while there is still time the Saudi  rulers should adopt a more careful stance toward the  uncompromising behavior of some of their diplomats in connection  with the issue of the hajj, and in particular toward the issue  of pilgrimage by hundreds of thousands of Iranians, so that, as  it did a few years ago, this political and Islamic ritual can  take place in an appropriate and fitting fashion.</p>

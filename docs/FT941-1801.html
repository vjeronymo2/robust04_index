			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Markets shrug off tightening by Fed Financial markets yesterday shrugged off Tuesday's Federal Reserve's 0.25 per cent increase in short-term interest rates. The Fed's first move to tighten monetary policy, announced on February 4, had prompted widespread falls in bond and share prices, writes Philip Coggan. But the latest move, which raised US short-term interest rates to 3.5 per cent, was widely expected, and seen as ending the recent uncertainty. By 1pm New York time yesterday, the Dow Jones industral average was 18.71 higher at 3,881.26, while the long bond was up a quarter of a point. Even though the Fed announcement was followed by yesterday's cut of eight basis points in the German repo rate, the dollar failed to gain against the D-Mark. In London trading, the dollar closed at DM1.685, down from its Tuesday close of DM1.6885. European markets were mainly influenced by events in Germany, with shares climbing in Frankfurt on the cut in the repo rate. The Dax index closed 19.79 points ahead at 2,161.13. But later in the day, European bourses fell on fears that the German M3 money supply figures for February might show an annualised rise of as much as 30 per cent. the Eurotrack 100 rose 6.98 points, or 0.49 per cent, on the day, to close at 1,445.46.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gina Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Movement for Socialism [MAS] Deputy Enrique Ochoa  Antich has reported that to help prevent crime, the Human Rights  Committee has stressed the need to implement some urgent  measures in addition to the government's personal safety  program. Ochoa Antich added that the Chamber of Deputies'  Domestic Policy Commission should open a dialogue with the  Foreign Ministry to discuss this subject.    One of the 10 measures proposed by Ochoa Antich is to create  a national office to coordinate state security agencies'  intelligence services to preclude the need for mass repression  operations. He also proposes to institutionalize regular  meetings between the organized society and the country's  security services, as well as to create a special fund whereby  businessmen and citizens can contribute to the hiring of new  police members who will be specifically assigned to their own  areas.    He also said that police villages should be built so they  and  their families can be protected while police are on duty.  Another action would be to approve an agreement between  universities and the Interior Relations Ministry whereby medical  and psychology students provide periodic checkups for the police.    It would be advisable to include human rights in the  soldiers  and police academies curriculum and to guarantee the allocation  of budgets to build new kinds of jails to help counter the  pernicious self-reproducing effect of crime in traditional  prisons.    Two of the most important points in the dozen proposed by  Ochoa Antich deal with approving a special program to care for  abandoned children and the discussion with television station  owners on program violence and the possibility of stations  refraining from airing programs specifically targeted for adults  during daylight hours.    Because all this involves disbursement, the deputy  underlined  the fact that while only one or two percent of the national  budget is earmarked for public security in Venezuela, up to 10  percent of the national budget is earmarked for this purpose in  other countries. For this reason, he said it is necessary to  reshuffle the budget.</p>

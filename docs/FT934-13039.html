			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Privatising at BR's convenience Sir, I write to urge the government to include an element of unbundling in the forthcoming privatisation of British Rail. During a recent trip to Turkey, I noticed that the public conveniences in the main bus station in Ankara serve, I estimate, well in excess of 8,000 clients a day, at a price (effectively index-linked) of almost 8 pence a visit. This business enjoys a local monopoly, a strong client base, 24-hour custom all the year round, minimal fixed assets, no working capital requirements and hence produces an astonishing cashflow. Could not this element of BR's business be sold separately, under the price control of, say, Ofbog, thus providing a new utility sector to the FT-SE index? It is vital that the government obtains the best price for the potentially profitable parts of what 'silver' is left in the cupboard.

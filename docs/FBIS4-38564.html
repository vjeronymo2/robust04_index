			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko </F> by Sophie Shihab in Paris on 25 May: "Zlenko: `In Crimea We  Have Chosen Preventive Diplomacy'"]    [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told LE  MONDE on Wednesday, 25 May, that he had come to Paris as a "full  participant" in the Stability in Europe Conference, and objected  to the title of "guest or observer." He was conciliatory and  optimistic with regard to the current crisis in Crimea.    For three days now we have been awaiting the outcome of the  Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Moscow to assess whether Crimea  has any chance of escaping the same terrible fate already  suffered by other "hot" outlying regions of Russia, although it  is true that in these other regions Russia was up against states  even more vulnerable than Ukraine. On Wednesday 25 May, both  sides announced that a further wait would be required while the  experts draw up "in 10 to 12 days" a "detailed" agreement on how  the Black Sea Fleet is to be split up. This is the fourth time  in less than two years that Kiev and Moscow have postponed an  agreement on this problem which risks escalating even further.    Nevertheless, the same day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko, who is in Paris to attend the Stability in  Europe Conference, presented the main points of a solution which  he considered to be almost within reach: As planned, the  Russians will keep their major base in Sebastopol, while the  Ukrainian Naval Command (controlling 18 percent of the ships)  will be installed a little further, in Balaklava. The other  bases of the divided fleet will be detailed in "separate,  case-by-case agreements based on their location." In short,  they would then get down to the serious business of the  financial arrangements.    For Mr. Zlenko "does not believe" that Crimea risks a  conflagration, even if "there are parallels with what happened  in Transnistria [as published] and Abkhazia." These two regions  of Moldavia and Georgia, respectively, whose population consists  mainly of Russians or Russian allies, have experienced civil war  in which Moscow took the side of the separatists, even though  Russia is now supervising negotiations between these forces and  their former administrations. In the Ukrainian minister's view:  "These bitter experiences will serve as a lesson, showing us  that everyone is a loser when a military solution is attempted;  you know, the Abkhazians today are in a most unenviable  situation."    He continued: "That is why in Crimea we have already chosen  preventive diplomacy." He stressed in passing that his country  had not waited for Mr. Balladur to come up with a security pact  for central and eastern Europe, in which Russia was invited to  participate out of decency. Mr. Zlenko again denied that any  Ukrainian military reinforcements had been sent to Crimea, as  had been reported and vigorously condemned by the Russian media.  In Kiev on Wednesday, a delegation from the pro-Russian Crimean  Government agreed to temporarily freeze the application of its  virtually separatist Constitution in exchange for the creation  of joint working groups by the Kiev and Crimean Parliaments -- a  first step toward federal-type relations. As for President  Kravchuk, he recognized that "we cannot ignore the fact that the  Russian majority in Crimea will always tend to look to Moscow."    Mr. Zlenko said that Crimea could have a status similar to a  "special economic zone," but there was still no question of the  Ukraine becoming a federation: "Our opinion polls show that  this is not a pressing issue," he said. He described as  "stories made up by journalists" the reports of cossack  volunteers arriving in Crimea and similar preparations under way  in the opposing ultranationalist paramilitary camp in western  Ukraine.    Although these "stories" are worrying, with two Armed Forces  taking up positions in the peninsula, the Crimean crisis is not  on the agenda at the Paris Stability Conference. According to  the hosts, it "directly" concerns only those countries looking  to join the European Union and which are not already "in a  crisis situation."    Mr. Zlenko and his eight-man delegation object to this: "We  are here as full participants in the conference, not as guests  or observers. In this way, Ukraine wants to show that we must  not continue with the policy of dividing Europe, but should  instead unite around shared principles those people who consider  that this, today, is their conference and those who are supposed  to be on the other side of the fence."    Does this "fence" separate Russia and Ukraine? The response  given by Mr. Zlenko, well-versed in Soviet diplomacy, shows the  road that has been taken since the swaggering declarations made  in the initial stages of Ukrainian independence: "I must still  tell you the most important thing: Russia cannot be excluded  from the security system that has to be created in Europe. That  is logical, the world must move on and shed the stereotypes of  confrontation..."</p>

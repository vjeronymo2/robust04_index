In November and December the industry spent Pounds 7m on more than 140 full page ads with provocative copy lines such as ' Some people are being conned by TV commercials. The people who pay for them.' Unfortunately, some of Sir Frank's fellow publishers, led by the Mirror Group, don't seem to have much faith in their own message.

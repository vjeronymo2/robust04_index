			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- International  anti-nuclear and Korean environmental groups were of one voice  Friday in opposing South Korea's nuclear power development and  demanding information on the issue from the government.    "We are seriously concerned about nuclear (reactor)  proliferation in South Korea," said Tom Clements, Greenpeace  International's plutonium campaign manager based in Washington,  D.C., and chief of the Greenpeace team touring Korea since April  12.    "We feel that coming from Western countries, we can share  our  experience and knowledge about nuclear development and wastes  with the Korean people," he told a press conference at the Korea  Federation of Environment Movement (KFEM) headquarters in Seoul  together with five other Greenpeace representatives and Korean  environmental activists.    Prof. Yi Pil-ryol, representing 222 petitioners from various  walks of life, questioned Seoul's support for the atomic energy  industry, which he said is being abandoned worldwide due to its  hazardous nature.    Shaun Burnie, a nuclear campaign coordinator based in  Amsterdam, said he has learned of defects in the steam  generators made by Westinghouse of the United States that have  been causing troubles throughout the world.    Clements said in the United States, Westinghouse was being  sued by 15 utilities for making faulty generators.    The campaigners, who have been touring proposed reactor  sites  and power stations in the Southern part of the country, arrived  in Inchon aboard their flagship MV Greenpeace Thursday and moved  on to the capital for three days of debate, protests and other  activities.    They hope to meet government officials, including the prime  minister, for Earth Day falling on Friday.</p>

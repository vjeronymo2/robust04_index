Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FDA is announcing that, in accordance with section 3(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(A)(vi), (b)(1)(A)(x), and (b)(2) of the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535), as amended by the DS act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571), the change in its regulations that it proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296 through 53305), to reflect its tentative decision not to authorize health claims relating an association between dietary fiber and cancer (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480F); dietary fiber and CVD (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480C); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480A); omega-3 fatty acids and CHD (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480O); and zinc and immune deficiency in the elderly (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480Z) on the labels and in the labeling of dietary supplements is now considered a final regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Passage of 1990 Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The 1990 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), and by delegation FDA, the authority to issue regulations authorizing health claims on the labels and in the labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)) provides that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related condition, unless the claim is made in accordance with procedures and standards established under section 403(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 amendments also directed the Secretary to determine through rulemaking whether claims regarding 10 nutrient-disease relationships meet the requirements of the act. Dietary fiber and cancer, dietary fiber and CVD, antioxidant vitamins and cancer, zinc and immune function in the elderly, and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD were among the topics that FDA was directed to evaluate under section 3(b)(1)(A)(vi) and (b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. The 1991 Health Claims Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 27, 1991, FDA proposed not to authorize health claims on dietary fiber and CVD (56 FR 60582); dietary fiber and cancer (56 FR 60566); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (56 FR 60624); zinc and immune function in the elderly (56 FR 60652); and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD (56 FR 60663). The agency tentatively concluded that the available evidence did not establish that the standard that FDA had proposed for health claims for dietary supplements under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act was met, that is, the agency tentatively concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence that these claims are valid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In October 1992, the DS act was enacted. This statute imposed a moratorium on FDA's implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993 (although the DS act did provide that FDA could authorize claims for dietary supplements before that date). The DS act directed FDA to issue proposed rules to implement the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements by June 15, 1993, and to issue final rules based on these proposals by December 31, 1993. The DS act also amended the so-called ``hammer'' provision of the 1990 amendments, section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, to provide that if the agency did not meet the established December 31, 1993, timeframe for issuance of final rules, the proposed regulations would be considered final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. The 1993 Final Rules For Health Claims For Foods in Conventional Food Form <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules on the general requirements for health claims on the labels and in the labeling of foods in conventional food form (58 FR 2478), and final rules authorizing health claims on seven nutrient-disease relationships (calcium and osteoporosis; fat and cancer; saturated fat and cholesterol and CHD; fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer; fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber and risk of CHD; and fruits and vegetables and cancer). Three of the health claims that FDA authorized were for fresh fruits and vegetables and grains, and thus these claims were not authorized for dietary supplements. Because of the DS act, FDA took no final action with respect to the use on dietary supplements of health claims on dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; zinc and immune function in the elderly; and antioxidant vitamins and cancer. (The agency's actions with respect to health claims involving folic acid and neural tube defects are described in a notice published elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. The 1993 Proposal to Not Authorize Health Claims For Dietary Supplements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 14, 1993, FDA published a proposal to not authorize health claims on the labels of dietary supplements on five nutrient-disease relationships: Dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function in the elderly (58 FR 53296). FDA provided 60 days for comment on this proposed action. Thus, the comment period closed on December 13, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, as amended by section 202(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the DS act, provides that if the Secretary does not promulgate final regulations on any of the health claims applicable to dietary supplements in a timely manner, the proposed regulations shall be considered final regulations but not until after December 31, 1993. FDA did not issue final regulations on the use of health claims on dietary supplements on dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function in the elderly by December 31, 1993. Therefore, FDA is issuing this document announcing that by operation of law, the change in its regulations that FDA proposed to reflect a decision not to authorize health claims about the relationships of dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function in the elderly, published in the October 14, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is now considered a final regulation by operation of law. The agency proposed that 21 CFR part 101 be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 101_FOOD LABELING <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 101.71 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;101.71  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Health claims: claims not authorized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Health claims not authorized for foods in conventional food form or for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar substances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 amendments state that FDA is to promptly publish notice of the new status of the proposed change in its regulations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This notice is issued in response to that requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency notes that this rulemaking constitutes a separate rulemaking from that instituted with respect to the five nutrient-disease relationships on October 14, 1993. This separate rulemaking was contemplated by Congress if a final rule was not issued by December 31, 1993. The agency notes, however, that the October 14, 1993, rulemaking remains ongoing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, with regard to antioxidant vitamins and cancer, on November 1 through 3, 1993, FDA held a public conference on this nutrient-disease relationship. (The conference also covered antioxidant vitamins and CVD.) The transcript of that meeting has been submitted to the Docket as a comment, and other comments were solicited in the announcement of the conference (58 FR 54595, October 22, 1993). FDA intends to consider all comments and data received at this conference. FDA intends to take any actions that it concludes are warranted by this information either in the ongoing rulemaking on an antioxidant vitamins and cancer claim for dietary supplements or, if the agency concludes that it is appropriate, in a separate rulemaking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David A.

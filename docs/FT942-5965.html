			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Imro discipline system outlined Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is to have more scope to explain the reasoning behind disciplinary actions against its members. The move will come as part of the new disciplinary regime which will take effect for all cases opened after August 1. Issuing a statement on its disciplinary policy yesterday, Imro said that it wanted to bring greater openness into the process. Its statement sets out the four principles underlying the system, and the considerations - such as the number of investors suffering losses, and whether previous warnings were given - which affect the penalties imposed. This is the first time a self-regulatory organisation has published such a comprehensive statement of its disciplinary process - although earlier this year Lautro, the regulator for the life insurance industry, issued a statement warning life offices that, as a matter of policy, rule breaches un-covered in the second round of routine inspection visits would attract more severe penalties. Imro also published yesterday a guidance note setting new minimum standards on how unit trust managers should deal with pricing errors and compensate investors significantly affected.</p>

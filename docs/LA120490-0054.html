			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HORNBUCKLE ELECTED MAYOR OF COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CITY GOVERNMENT: SHE FACES HER FIRST CHALLENGE AS THE COUNCIL TAKES UP THE  ISSUE OF WHETHER TO CENSURE A FELLOW MEMBER.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday elected Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle to serve a  two-year term as mayor. Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis was elected vice mayor.  </P> <P> Hornbuckle, a schoolteacher who is serving her second council term, was lauded  by outgoing Mayor Peter F. Buffa as "caring, compassionate and prepared." Other  council members noted her consensus-building skills.  </P> <P> Those skills will come into play almost immediately as the council considers  what to do about Councilman Ed Glasgow, who has admitted that he participated  in the monitoring of private computer messages between Police Chief David L.  Snowden and City Manager Allan L. Roeder.  </P> <P> The council was scheduled to discuss possible censure of Glasgow in a closed  session after Monday's council meeting.  </P> <P> According to an investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office,  the computer printouts were allegedly made by Costa Mesa Police Lt. John A.  Regan, who is now retired.  </P> <P> Regan told investigators that he monitored the messages as part of his own  "investigation" into alleged improprieties by Snowden. Glasgow saw copies of  the messages over a period of several months and asked the city attorney to  investigate Snowden. However, neither the city attorney nor the district  attorney found any evidence of wrongdoing by Snowden.  </P> <P> Snowden asked the district attorney to investigate Regan for the alleged  illegal interception of his messages, but a four-month inquiry yielded  insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution, according to investigators.  </P> <P> Glasgow has stated publicly that he will not resign over the incident.  </P> <P> The council on Monday also seated its newest member, Jay Humphrey.  </P> <P> Humphrey, a pharmaceuticals salesman, won the council seat on his second try.  He is a fiscal conservative and an advocate of slow growth.  </P> <P> The election of Humphrey, combined with the defeat of staunchly pro-development  councilman Orville Amburgey, may move the council to take a more critical view  of development projects.  </P></p>

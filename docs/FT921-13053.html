			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Rich and poor grow further apart as consumerism soars ELECTION-YEAR Britain is united around consumerism but divided by growing disparities of income and wealth, according to Social Trends, the Central Statistical Office's annual state-of-the-nation publication. It provides a one-volume guide to the lives of the people whose votes the political parties will be seeking in coming months. Social Trends contains information to support the policies and prejudices of candidates of all political persuasions. For example: Home ownership has grown - with more than two thirds of dwellings now owner-occupied - but so has homelessness. The number of families in temporary bed-and-breakfast accommodation more than doubled to 48,000 between 1986 and 1990. The UK has a higher proportion of people in prison than any other EC country, but that has not stopped recorded crimes soaring from 2.5m in 1980 to 4.4m in 1990. By 1990, one in four of the adult population were shareholders, compared with only one in 13 in 1981 - but more than half own shares in only one company and the proportion of shares in private rather than institutional hands has declined. Total consumer expenditure rose by almost 70 per cent between 1971 and 1990, with spending on consumer durables increasing at double the overall level, although the rate of growth has slowed sharply since 1989. The amount of outstanding consumer debt more than doubled in real terms between 1981 and 1990. Savings as a percentage of household disposable income have been negative since 1986. The most classless consumer purchase is the television set - almost every home has at least one, with little variation across occupational groups. Vote-seeking politicians will be gratified to learn that television remains one of the leading influences in national life - time spent viewing has declined slightly since the mid 1980s but people still devoted an average 23 1/2 hours a week to the pursuit in 1990. More seriously, Social Trends points to continuing social class divisions in matters of life and death. In spite of an overall improvement in infant mortality, death rates are still three quarters higher for babies whose fathers are unskilled than for those born into professional families. Many long-standing illnesses and disabilities are similarly less common among the professional and managerial groups than among manual workers. Social Trends presents an image of a nation becoming better off - average real disposable income grew by nearly three quarters between 1971 and 1990 - but not all benefited to the same extent. The gap between the top 10 per cent of wage earners and the bottom 10 per cent is widening and the share of income going to the top 20 per cent of households has increased. By 1988, the top 20 per cent received 44 per cent of post-tax income, compared with 37 per cent in 1977. The share of marketable wealth in the hands of the richest 1 per cent of the population fell from 21 per cent in 1976 to 18 per cent in 1981 - and has remained at 18 per cent since. That apparent shift towards a more egalitarian distribution of wealth has not travelled any further down the social scale. The most wealthy 5 per cent of the population increased its share of marketable wealth from 36 per cent to 38 per cent between 1986 and 1989. More than half the nation's total marketable wealth - 53 per cent - was owned by 10 per cent of the population in 1989. Social Trends cannot predict the outcome of this year's election but it does provide a reminder that, on the basis of other recent general elections, about a quarter of the electorate will not bother to vote. In EC elections, apathy is far worse. Although 14m British holidaymakers visited other EC countries in 1990, only 36 per cent of the electorate took part in the last European parliament elections.

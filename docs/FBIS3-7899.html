"In keeping with the deep sympathy expressed by  the Hungarian general public, we wish to express our condolence  to the victims' relatives," the statement says.    Concerning the February 25 massacre, the document says: "The  Hungarian Foreign Ministry sees the event as a common tragedy  for both peoples, the direct consequences of which may  unfortunately affect, but hopefully not deadlock, the promising  Middle East peace talks.    "However, it is a necessity for the peace process to  continue  with success, so that in the future there should be no similarly  senseless acts of violence aimed at putting an end to  negotiations based on common will."    "It is cause for concern that there is a dangerous  escalation  of violent reactionary actions and vengeances being committed by  both opposing sides in the area under Israeli occupation."    "The Hungarian Foreign Ministry holds the position that in  this painful hour all sides involved in the peace talks should  display increased self-restraint."    "It is particularly important that both the PLO and the  Israeli Government should spare no effort to control extremist  organizations and persons prepared to commit similar acts of  violence. They should be neutralized as soon as possible in a  form coordinated and accepted by both sides."    "We are convinced that the extremely complex Mideast issue  can only be solved through compromise and negotiations aimed at  creating peace, security, cooperation and peaceful coexistence  in the region.    "We hope that the peace process will put an end to the  decades-long conflict, create stability in the region, and  enforce both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and  the right to security for the State of Israel."</p>

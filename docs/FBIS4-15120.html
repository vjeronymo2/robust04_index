			<p>BFN     [Text] According to BELAPAN, in the office of Alyaksandr  Lukashenka, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Provisional  Anticorruption Commission, the door lock has been changed and  the door itself sealed. This was done because the Belarusian  leadership believes that the commission has fulfilled its task.  Speaking at a conference of law enforcement agency chiefs,  Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, in particular, pointed  out that the work of the commission had in fact been completed.  However, Alyaksandr Lukashenka has a different opinion.  Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Legislative  Commission, voiced his concern in an interview with BELAPAN,  saying that there can be attempts to stop financing the  Anticorruption Commission, close its mouth, and hold activities.  The only thing that the commission has so far managed to  accomplish is Stanislaw Shushkevich's resignation from the post  of Supreme Soviet chairman. The resignation was prompted by  claims that Shushkevich had failed to pay several hundred rubles  to the government's construction and repairs department.</p>

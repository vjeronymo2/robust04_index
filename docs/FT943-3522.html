			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Matra to appeal on Taipei damages Matra Transport, a unit of Matra-Hachette, is expected to appeal against a court ruling which reversed an earlier judgment requiring the Taipei city government to pay the French company NTDollars 1bn (Dollars 37m) in damages over a mass transit construction dispute. In a highly publicised fracas, a government-backed arbitration panel last October awarded Matra the funds in compensation for extensive losses incurred due to construction delays on the 11km Mucha Line of the city's mass rapid transit system. Matra's contract for its section of the transit system is estimated at nearly Dollars 300m. The Taipei district court ruled on Monday that Matra had not followed procedures as outlined in the contract in the event of a dispute. 'The main reason the court invalidated the ruling was because Matra didn't follow its contract with Taipei's department of rapid transit system (Dorts) before it sought arbitration,' the court said. Matra had originally sought NTDollars 2bn in damages from Dorts, which it claimed was responsible for the delays. Following the arbitration panel's ruling, Dorts filed a counter-suit.</p>

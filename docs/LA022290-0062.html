			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS PREPARE TO CUT STAFF  </P> <P> The Simi Valley Unified School District, claiming that it faces an $8-million  budget deficit next year, has taken steps to cut labor costs by reducing the  number of assistant principals and school psychologists, among other  administrators.  </P> <P> The Board of Education voted late Tuesday to notify 34 administrators that they  may be reassigned next year and 32 temporary teachers that they may not be  rehired if the administrators fill their posts, Supt. John Duncan said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although staff reductions ultimately may not be necessary, the board acted  because state law requires that most administrators be told of possible  reassignments and salary reductions by March 15.  </P> <P> The board is scheduled to meet again March 6 and will be asked to consider  additional budget cuts, most probably in the area of clerical and maintenance  employees and in some educational programs, Duncan said.  </P> <P> Duncan and board President Helen Beebe said the rest of the district's  approximately 800 teachers are not expected to receive layoff notices.  </P> <P> "We've done what we had to to keep things as far away from the kids as  possible," Beebe said.  </P> <P> Under the plan discussed in closed session Tuesday night, an assistant  principal's job would be eliminated in each of the district's two high schools  and four junior high schools. High schools would be staffed with two assistant  principals instead of three and junior highs with one assistant principal  instead of two, Duncan said.  </P> <P> Two elementary schools each currently staffed with a principal and an assistant  principal would lose the assistant principal position, he said.  </P> <P> The number of guidance counselors and psychologists would also be reduced,  although the exact number was not available Wednesday.  </P> <P> Also subject to elimination would be special-programs coordinators and  student-activities directors, Duncan said.  </P> <P> Under the plan, affected administrators would be reassigned to lower-level  positions with reduced salaries, ultimately replacing temporary teachers. If  implemented, it could save the district an estimated $1.5 million, Duncan said.  </P> <P> The board also acted Tuesday to freeze hiring, purchases and travel expenses in  the current fiscal year, and to reduce substitute teaching costs by 75% and  instructional-material costs by 10% next year.  </P> <P> Declining student enrollment and limited state funding combined with increased  labor costs -- especially for medical insurance -- are largely to blame for the  anticipated deficit, Duncan and his staff told the board. The projected  $8-million shortfall is about 10.5% of the district's proposed $76-million  spending plan for 1990-91. Labor costs make up 85% of the budget, Duncan said.  </P> <P> In another attempt to cut costs, the district has asked the teachers union to  sacrifice more than half of a salary increase due next year under the terms of  a three-year-old contract.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'CENSORSHIP' EXPLORES HISTORY OF REPRESSION  </P> <P> Art has become big business, commanding high prices and speaking the slippery  language of investment potential. But the world of economics is the front yard  of politics. So art, with its once-independent criteria for excellence, has  suddenly found itself on the scrimmage line in a political football game with  whistles to the left and right directing the play.  </P> <P> Just how prone to social whim the rules of that game can be is the point made  by the current exhibition "Censorship." This is a small gathering of historic  paintings and photographs that have been at some point censored or labeled  obscene, plus a few current images that would, given the current climate,  undoubtedly be hit with the same tag.  </P> <P> Composed mainly of erotic or homoerotic art, the exhibition deftly sidesteps  the titillation factor inherent in this kind of imagery by focusing on issues  of politics and repression. In the company of the boldly erotic 19th-Century  Japanese Shunga woodblock prints and the sensuous but tame abstract etchings of  Matta, Hans Burkhardt's "Crucifixion" -- labeled "communist" in 1949 for its  modernist abstraction -- makes it clear that, more than any kind of moral  imperative, it is simple fear of the unknown that feeds censorship.  </P> <P> It is the strength of that argument that draws this very disparate work  together. It's an understanding that unites Margaret Lazzari's powerfully  explicit painting of a castrated white male figure with the puerile sexuality  of an underground comic book on incest without equating the two as art. It adds  tension to John C. Hesketh's gentle Cibachrome photo play of sex-in-the-suburbs  to place it alongside Robert Mapplethorpe's leather-covered male model in light  of the howls of protest his photographs have brought. The implication is that  what goes around will come around -- to dictate definitions of art and  sexuality.  </P> <P> Given the different directions the artists follow here, the issue of obscenity  emerges as a large one. Indeed, it remains a personal one, as this exhibition  presents both innocuous images and others that undoubtedly push beyond what  many individuals consider even faintly erotic. What the historic works and  their attendant histories make clear is that obscene is too vague and  inconsistent an adjective to be used for anything more than name-calling. And  censorship, too, is revealed by time to be a hidebound reaction of insecurity.  </P> <P>  Couturier Gallery, 166 N. La Brea Ave., to Aug. 18.  </P> <P> Power of the Mark: Laurence Dreiband's bold charcoal studies of clusters of  black eucalyptus leaves are pure, powerful drawings. The subject may be  mundane, but the power of the line and the way the artist spreads the forms  like unpremeditated spills across the page are fresh. Indeed, the spontaneity  and effortlessness of these compositions recall the Taoist principles of  17th-Century Chinese painting.  </P> <P> Dreiband's drawings celebrate the power of the mark: the cutting sharpness of a  clean linear form, the delicate softness of finger smudges and erased edges.  Most drawings are like works in progress, revealing the tender process of  building up solid mass from dry pigment while trailing bits of unfinished  drawing, dust and change across the once-pristine whiteness of the page. This  appreciation for the exposed process of drawing gives each work an honest  vigor.  </P> <P> In the next gallery are Christopher Georgesco's long vertical columns of  reinforced concrete and stainless steel. Ostensibly drawing their form from the  space left by four circles meeting, these pieces have an odd finality about  them. Like truncated and stretched modernist obelisks, they stand on odd, often  problematic bases looking taut yet abruptly severed at top and bottom.  </P> <P>  Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to Aug. 11.  </P> <P> Madness From Within: The paintings Diane Gamboa puts together for this  exhibition are their own kind of angular hell. Imbued with the Chicana artist's  familiar love of busy pattern, careening line and bright color, this round of  work has a jagged, disturbing energy. The pictorial spaces are tightly packed  interiors where contrasting colors and pattern run riot over tilting spaces.  Objects jockey to suggest three dimensions in what is blatantly a  two-dimensional world.  </P> <P> Gamboa's somewhat cartoony scenarios implying violence and upheaval are  curiously open-ended for all the aggression they suggest. Indeed, her  characters appear as unrepentant moral monsters along the lines of Leon Golub's  tormentors or the "No Exit" denizens of Gronk's "Grand Hotel." By picturing  this world from the inside, the artist and audience are made part of the  depravity.  </P> <P> Williams Lamb Gallery, 102 West 3rd St., Long Beach, to Aug. 31.  </P></p>

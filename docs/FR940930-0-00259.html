			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _PFS participants must make considerable efforts and undergo significant inconvenience in seeking out buyers, making the property presentable, and allowing the public access to their home as they attempt to reach an approved sale transaction before the participation period has run.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Cash incentives for expedited pre-foreclosure sales occurring within three months of commencing the PFS procedure represent a small portion of the estimated savings to the Department of interest that would otherwise have to be paid to mortgagees as part of the insurance contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _It is HUD's objective to maximize the number of interested participants in pre-foreclosure sales, because of the estimated aggregate savings to the Department that successful pre-foreclosure sales transactions represent. We estimate that the PFS-related consideration will be more than offset by the savings in pre- and post-acquisition costs for the properties affected by participation in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Mortgagors can request deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure without first attempting to execute pre-foreclosure sales and might request deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure rather than the pre-foreclosure sale option, when they become fully apprised of the efforts involved in the pre-foreclosure sale, as well as possible tax implications. If a mortgagor meets prevailing criteria and the mortgagee is willing to cooperate, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure can occur. This would benefit the mortgagor but would represent only modest savings to the Department. Therefore, it is in HUD's interest to make the pre-foreclosure sale option as attractive as possible in order to maximize the number of interested participants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although payment of such consideration is warranted by the anticipated savings to the Department, HUD acknowledges the need for vigilance to head off abuse of the process by opportunistic parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Deed-In-Lieu of Foreclosure as Feature of the PFS Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the time he or she requests to participate in the Pre-Foreclosure Sale procedure, the mortgagor is asked whether there are encumbrances on the mortgage, or whether there are title problems of which he or she is aware. The mortgagee should order a title search during the mortgagor's participation in the PFS procedure. The existence of encumbrances or title problems may preclude or result in a refusal to permit either a pre-foreclosure sale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a deed-in-lieu. For those mortgagors who can deliver clear title, but who, despite a good faith effort, do not consummate a pre-foreclosure sale, the mortgagee will customarily process a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure upon the failure of the participant to execute a pre-foreclosure sale. A deed-in-lieu action will leave the mortgagor without a foreclosure on his or her credit history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notification of PFS Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will circulate an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Information Sheet <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on pre-foreclosure sales among mortgagees and housing counseling agencies, and the mortgagees and housing counseling agencies will be encouraged to distribute the document among mortgagors who might be interested in, and possibly qualified to participate in, the Pre-Foreclosure Sale procedure. It will contain basic information about pre-foreclosure sales and will instruct mortgagors or others interested in PFS to contact the homeowner's mortgagee for more information or an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mortgagees are required to notify mortgagors about the pre-foreclosure sale procedure by sending a prescribed communication (HUD&hyph;426) when the mortgagors fall two payments behind, and a copy of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Information Sheet <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when the mortgagors become three or more payments in arrears. The requirement that mortgagees provide notification of the pre-foreclosure sale option to mortgagors in default is contained in 24 CFR 203.370(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commencing the Pre-foreclosure Sale Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once a mortgagor is found to be eligible to participate in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure, and is so notified by the mortgagee, the mortgagor may begin marketing the property. Section 203.356(b) requires mortgagees to notify HUD of that change in status of the mortgagor. The mortgagee will also direct the mortgagor to retain the services of a real estate broker in an attempt to market the property within the established time and price guidelines. These brokers are prohibited from sharing a business interest with the mortgagee or mortgagor (seller).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An appraisal will be ordered by the mortgagee from an appraiser who meets standard eligibility requirements for performing FHA Single Family appraisals. The appraisal will contain ``as is'' and ``as repaired'' valuations of the property. Reasonable costs for the property appraisal will be reimbursed through the FHA claims process. Section 203.402(l) has been revised to include the cost of an appraisal performed as part of the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure. The Department reserves the right, in the future, to authorize mortgagees to substitute or add the use of Broker Price Opinions (BPOs) to the valuation process under the Pre-Foreclosure Sale procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yan Xuetong (7051 1331 6639): "Differences on </F> Human Rights Between China and the United States and Their  Causes"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher failed  to reach an anticipated consensus on the human rights issue  during his visit to China, and there have been a lot of  discussions in the foreign press on this. Differences on the  human rights issue between China and the United States are very  great, and it is not realistic to expect that a consensus could  be reached through just one high-level visit.    Differences on the concept of human rights between China and  the United States are mainly expressed in four aspects.    The first is that the idea of human rights in China is  different from that in the United States. China holds that  human rights is a comprehensive idea and is not a purely  political concept. In accordance with the basic principle that  "everybody enjoys freedom of speech and belief and is free from  fear and want" stated in the "Universal Declaration of Human  Rights," China holds that the contents of human rights should  include four aspects, that is, the right to subsistence, the  right to development, political rights, and social and cultural  rights. These rights complement each other, and no one of them  should be emphasized at the expense of another. In a certain  sense, the right to subsistence and the right to development are  the basis of political rights and social and cultural rights.  If a person's safety, clothing, and food is not guaranteed,  that person can in no way enjoy his political rights or social  rights. However, the United States regards human rights in a  narrow sense as civil rights, such as freedom of speech and  freedom of belief, which do not include the right to  subsistence, including safety and the basic conditions for  subsistence. According to the "Universal Declaration of Human  Rights," civil rights are only a part of human rights and human  rights is a more extensive concept than civil rights. However,  the United States equates the idea of human rights with that of  civil rights.    The second is that China's understanding of the scope of  human rights is different from that of the United States. China  has a dialectical view of the scope of human rights and holds  that human rights is the unity of the human rights of  individuals with those of the collective in society. The idea  of human rights has developed from the 18th century to its third  generation at present. The first generation of the human rights  concept stresses civil rights. In the second generation of the  idea, economic rights, social rights, and cultural rights were  added. The third generation, which emerged 20 years ago,  includes the right to protect the environment and the right to  death. China holds that the development of the idea of human  rights from that of the human rights of the individual alone to  stressing the human rights of the collective is human progress,  because damage to the human rights of the collective is an  infringement upon the human rights of most individuals. For  example, an encroachment upon a country's sovereignty is an  infringement of the right to independence of each citizen of  that country. Although some U.S. scholars have criticized the  outdated U.S. idea of human rights, the influence of the old  idea remains very strong, and the idea of only stressing the  human rights of the individual still occupies a dominant  position in the United States. Since individualism is one of the  mainstays of U.S. ideology, the idea of the human rights of the  collective cannot be easily accepted by the government.    The third is that China's understanding of human rights  standards is different from that of the United States. China  holds that the standard for human rights has international and  national characteristics. As a human right, each natural human  being should of course enjoy some identical rights, and this  part of human rights should be based on international standards,  for example, the right to safeguard peace, the right to oppose  armed aggression, the right of racial equality, the right to  oppose terror and threats, the right to protect the natural  environment, and so on. However, because people live in  different countries and the political system, economic level,  history, culture, customs, and habits of different countries  vary greatly, some human rights can only be determined according  to the standards of the respective nations and countries and  cannot be unified. For example, a murderer still has the right  to subsistence in countries where the death penalty has been  abolished, but does not have such a right in countries where the  death penalty still exists. Since the death penalty has been  abolished in only some U.S. states, the criminals' right to  subsistence varies even within the country. However, the United  States holds that human rights have only one standard, which is  the international standard of the West. In fact, the human  rights standards of various western countries are not the same.  For example, Canada has accepted the "International Convention  on Eliminating All Forms of Racial Discrimination," but the  United States has not.    The fourth is that China and the United States hold  different views on the relationship between the rights and  obligations of human beings. China holds that the rights and  obligations of human beings are equal. While enjoying  legitimate rights, each individual or nation must undertake the  obligation of not preventing another individual or nation from  enjoying legitimate rights. If this principle is not followed,  it is impossible to guarantee that people can enjoy human rights  fairly. When U.S. Armed Forces sent Panamanian President  Noriega under armed escort to the United States for trial on 3  January 1990 under the pretext that drugs threatened U.S.  security, the right of the United States to defend its security  was based on depriving the Panamanians' right to defend the  political security of their country. Therefore, China holds  that when the human rights standard of one country differs from  another, no country should impose its standard on another,  otherwise this means depriving the people of that country of  their right to make a decision on their standard for human  rights. Such an act itself would be an infringement of human  rights. Nevertheless, the United States does not think that the  rights and obligations of human beings are necessarily  intrinsically connected. The United States holds that human  rights are endowed by nature and that God has not endowed each  individual with equal rights and obligations. For example, the  United States only stresses that parents have the right to give  birth to children and to divorce, but does not talk about  parental obligations to raise and educate children. As a  result, the number of single parents has rapidly increased, and  many children have lost their right to enjoy normal family life  and to receive tertiary education. [as published]    Causes of differences on human rights between China and the  United States can be classified under two categories: objective  causes and subjective causes. Objectively speaking, China's  culture is different from that of the United States. China's  culture praises the collective spirit highly, while U.S. culture  praises individualism highly. Economically speaking, China is a  developing country and still has many difficulties in solving  the problem of clothing and feeding its 1.2 billion people.  However, the United States, as a developed country, has the  material conditions for solving the problem of clothing and  feeding its people. Politically speaking, China is a socialist  country and the equal sharing of social wealth is one important  political goal of the country. However, the United States is a  capitalist country, and protecting the rapid growth of private  capital is one of the political tasks of that country.  Differences on the concept of human rights between China and  the United States are to a certain extent influenced by  objective factors. However, the cause of such sharp differences  between China and the United States is a subjective one, that  is, the United States has adopted an attitude not conducive to  settling differences.    First of all, the United States has tried to compel China to  accept the U.S. standard for human rights while disregarding  international human rights standards. The United States does  not accept the unified standard for human rights of  international society and uses its own standard to assess the  human rights situation of other countries. Since the United  Nations adopted the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" in  1948, it has formulated a series of international conventions on  human rights. The United States has not signed the "Universal  Declaration of Human Rights," and, moreover, it has not joined  many of the international conventions on human rights, such as  "The International Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Racial  Discrimination," "The International Convention on Civil and  Political Rights," "The Convention on Economic, Social, and  Cultural Rights," "The International Convention on Banning and  Punishing Crimes of Apartheid " "The Convention on Eliminating  All Forms of Discrimination Against Women," "The Convention on  Banning Atrocities and Other Cruel, Inhumane, and Humiliating  Treatment or Punishment," and so on. The main reason why the  United States does not recognize international conventions on  human rights is that the United States holds that international  law should not override domestic law. Therefore, the United  States does not recognize any international convention which is  not in keeping with domestic U.S. law. The United States holds  that domestic law is the highest law, that these laws are  applicable to all international affairs related to the United  States, and that the countries concerned should also follow U.S.  law to solve issues. In solving differences on human rights  between China and the United States, the United States has  explicitly demanded that China carry out the administrative  orders of the U.S. President and improve human rights according  to U.S. standards. Therefore, China cannot accept these  hegemonic acts of the United States.    Secondly, the United States has adopted double standards on  the human rights issue. It has all along adopted double  standards in its foreign policy by relying on its strength as a  superpower. It has adopted different moral standards in  accordance with the peculiarities of specific issues. For  example, in order to develop markets in Japan as a deficit  exists in its trade with Japan, the United States has put  forward the necessity of protecting free trade and has opposed  linking Japanese-U.S. political relations with economic issues.  However, to reduce imports of products made in China as  imbalances occur in Sino-U.S. trade, the United States has put  forward restrictions on China's export and regards the human  rights issue as a prerequisite for extending China's  most-favored-nation status. In settling differences on human  rights between China and the United States, the United States  has also adopted double standards. For example, the United  States has said that China letting reform-through-labor  prisoners engage in production of export goods violates human  rights, but the United States itself is enthusiastically engaged  in exporting goods made in prisons. According to a report by the  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, Higgs [xi ge 1585 2706], the  marketing manager of Oregon State's prison industries, said that  the state would export $3 million of prison products this year  and would export jeans, shirts, and shorts made by prisoners to  Japan, Italy, and other countries. California would also export  on a trial basis similar goods to Japan and Malaysia. China, of  course, cannot agree to the U.S. practice of adopting double  standards on human rights.    Third, much of the human rights criticism in the United  States is based on groundless rumors. In criticizing China's  human rights situation, the United States has seldom taken facts  into consideration, but has often used hearsay as a basis. For  example, the United States said the Beijing No. 1 Prison Qinghe  Socks Plant exported socks made by reform-through-labor  prisoners to the United States, but the results of an  investigation showed no such thing. The U.S. government  publication FEDERAL REGISTER announced the conclusion of an  investigation in December 1993, which confirmed that socks made  by prisoners at that plant were not, and could not have been,  exported to the United States. The United States says that  under communist rule, Tibetans have lost their human rights,  however, in fact, Tibetan serfs escaped their status as serfs  and were put on an equal footing politically with other people  only after liberation. China has done nothing which infringes  upon human rights and naturally cannot accept groundless U.S.  accusations.    Fourth, the United States has disagreed with China's  rational  views on human rights to cover up its poor human rights  situation at home. For example, China has put forward that  human rights should include the right to subsistence and the  right to development. This view tallies with the fundamental  principle of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" and has  won universal support and the recognition of the international  community. The "Bangkok Declaration," the "Tunis Declaration,"  and the "Pact of San Jose" have accepted this view from China.  However, the United States disagrees that the right to  subsistence and the right to development are part of human  rights. The main reason why the United States has disagreed  with China's view is that the United States, being a country  with the best material conditions, has not been able to ensure  the basic right to subsistence of its people. According to a  report carried in issue No. 9 of the U.S. weekly TIME, published  on 28 February this year, several million people are homeless in  the United States, and the number once reached 7 million in the  1980's. This is equivalent to the total population of Tianjin,  the third biggest city in China at that time. In winter,  hundreds of people die from exposure. If calculated according  to the official standards for poverty, the number of people  living in poverty in 1994 reached 33.7 million. One-third of  people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance  and do not have normal medical care. Because of serious crimes  of violence, the personal security of Americans is not  safeguarded. According to official U.S. statistics, 23,200  people were murdered in 1990, and if those who were robbed and  raped were included, a total of 2 million people were victims of  violent crime. In order to enable the people of all the  countries in the world to enjoy legitimate rights to  subsistence, China cannot but insist on its own correct stand.  In the final analysis, differences on the human rights issue  between China and the United States are not differences of  cultural ideas or traditions. Nor are they merely an expression  of a hegemonic mentality. It is an attempt by the United States  to use the human rights issue as a point to break through to  threaten China's existing system so that China will be in a  state of chaos or weakness.</p>

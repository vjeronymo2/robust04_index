			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / Gregory cleared in Mirror Group inquiry MIRROR Group Newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Robert Gregory, director of human resources, had been cleared of any 'improper conduct or shortcomings' as a result of an internal inquiry, Raymond Snoddy writes. It said the outcome of the inquiry was being published because a question asked at the recent annual general meeting made shareholders aware of the inquiry. MGN did not say what the allegations against Mr Gregory had been, although the company had always stressed he had never been accused of any illegality. Mr Gregory, the company said, would continue in his post and the inquiry had not interrupted his work. The inquiry is believed to have looked at the transfer of Mr Gregory's pension from Maxwell Communication Corporation to MGN. It was found to be in order following a change in Mr Gregory's role.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Metals While financial markets have been in turmoil since US interest rates started to rise, the bull run in metals has continued. After another sharp rise this month, copper, aluminium and tin have risen by 30 per cent from last autumn's lows. Nickel has risen by more. The uncertainty is whether this represents a fundamental trend or whether the hot money squeezed out of bonds and other financial assets has simply found another temporary home. Judging when metals are overvalued is difficult. Production costs should determine the price in the long run, but the relationship is subject to wild swings through the economic cycle. Re-opening production capacity is often expensive, so producers do not respond immediately to higher prices by increasing supply. When supply and demand are in rough balance, though, it is unusual to see the price of a metal much above its marginal cost of production. Copper for one has already passed this point. The fundamentals are starting to look more favourable for most metals. Aluminium producers have started to cut production to restore market balance. Continental European economies are recovering faster than had been anticipated, which should eventually feed through into higher metals consumption. But only in copper have stocks fallen significantly from the record levels seen at the end of last year. Elsewhere the overhang of stock shows no sign of abating. Until that changes, metals will be vulnerable to profit-taking or swings in investment fashion.</p>

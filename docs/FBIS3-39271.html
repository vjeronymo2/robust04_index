[Biderman] The agreement is more negative for the clothing  industry than for textiles in general. The lack of a definitive  agreement and the maintenance of the tariff ceilings are  threatening 150,000 of the 600,000 jobs in this sector in  France, according to the experts. I share these fears. We must  expect export difficulties, and that we will face savage  competition.    [LE QUOTIDIEN] How do you plan to respond?    [Biderman] I do not foresee major upsets for my business in  the job sector. We have already made restructuring efforts in  the course of these recent years. The solution in the medium  time range seems to me to be specialization in quality products,  in the designer label sector. We are already in the front ran k  in the middle and upper ranges, since we supply Saint-Laurent,  Daniel Hechter, and Courreges with ready-to-wear garments. Now,  I am not sure that the leading designers will be willing to  entrust their labels to manufacturers located out of the  country. But the horizon beyond the year 1995 is not very clear.  At the present time, I am not in a position to make predictions  over the longer term. My immediate concerns are the domestic  consumption level (down five percent in October for textiles)  and the reorganization of distribution.</p>

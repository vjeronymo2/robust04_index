			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will authorize the large-scale import  of food products to check the rapid increase in the cost of  living. Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has said a document is  being drafted to eliminate what he described as excessive  subsidizing of the agricultural sector. He also announced that  the local price of coffee would be revised before August.    [Begin Hommes recording] There is excessive protection of  the  agricultural and livestock sectors. This excessive protection is  main reason for this price hike. Something can be done through  foreign trade by expediting the import of certain types of food  products. [end recording]    With this remark, Minister Hommes announced the government's  determination to disable the system whereby a minimum price is  set for the import of rice, sugar, beans, and other  government-subsidized products. For the time being, the import  of potatoes, rice, cooking oil, and certain cereals will get the  green light.    [Begin Hommes recording] For instance, the prices of  materials for the cooking oil industry are too high and there is  excessive protection in this area. I wonder why the gentlemen  [not further identified] are so silent. [end recording]    Before flying to London, where he would meet with several  businessmen interested in investing in Colombia, Hommes  announced he would revise the local price of coffee and said  that a decree will be issued next week to prevent the  participation of pension and dismissal funds in Banco Popular's  privatization process.</p>

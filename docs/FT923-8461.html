			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Ministers form spending body MR Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, are to be members of the government's public expenditure committee, announced last month. The other members are Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who will serve as chairman; Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury; Mr William Waldegrave, public service and science minister, and Mr Tony Newton and Lord Wakeham, leaders respectively of the Commons and the Lords. The committee, which meets for the first time next month, will seek to ensure that the government sticks to its planning total for public expenditure by arbitrating on individual departmental bids. The body will submit a list of options for meeting the planning total to the cabinet, which will decide departmental allocations. The regime is intended to demonstrate the extent of government determination to limit increases in the public-sector borrowing requirement by linking spending to the expected low economic growth in the next few years. Downing Street said yesterday that Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine had been appointed in their capacity as spending ministers. Since some committee decisions might have implications for legislation it was sensible to have two ministers involved who handled legislative matters.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to the </F> prime minister, by Yutaka Iwasa, chief editor of SHUKAN  DAIYAMONDO: "Purposeful Deregulation Will Prove Effective in  Stimulating Business Activity"; place and date not given]    [Text] [Iwasa] Almost 100 days have passed since you were  appointed special assistant to the prime minister. Has there  been any change in the situation since you assumed the post?    [Tanaka] As you know, the new government was organized to  carry out political reform. Today, however, three major reforms  -- administrative reform and economic reform in addition to  political reform -- are all targets of the new government. This  may be regarded as a new development, and not a change in the  situation over the past 100 days. If you seriously tackle  political reform, you will inevitably be involved in  administrative and economic reform. Take deregulation as an  example. There are so many government regulations in Japan, it  creates a climate in which money politics can take root.  Political reform aims to change such a climate. Also, needless  to say, deregulation is the major target of administrative  reform. Besides, Japan should clear this obstacle in order to  grow into a new economic community. Thus, it has become  necessary for Japan to realize these three fundamental reforms.  Though, at first, the new government was organized as a  specialty store to pursue political reform, it was inevitable  that the government would increase the number of targets. We  are hoping that, as the prime minister said in his statement,  fundamental reforms will pave the way for a better and more  substantial quality of life in Japan.  <H3>  The Problem Is Whether Business Recovery and the Three  Reforms Can Be Realized Concurrently </H3>   [Iwasa] But is it not very difficult to break down the  existing relationship among politicians, bureaucrats, and  businessmen?    [Tanaka] There are particular circumstances in any time  which automatically show us the right direction. However, it  really is a very hard task to break down the existing structure.    [Iwasa] At present, the problems of political and economic  reform are being mixed up in the public discussion. What is  your understanding of current business conditions?    [Tanaka] I understand conditions are very serious. Last  year, I was a staff member of the Economic Planning Agency and  had the opportunity to attend lectures on business conditions.  What I learned from the lectures was totally different from  what I had learned in the electoral districts and what I heard  from taxicab drivers. Therefore, it should be frankly admitted  there was a misjudgment on the part of the government. At  present we are in a serious economic condition we have never  before experienced and the prime minister shares the sense of  crisis.    [Iwasa] The government has to improve business conditions  and pass the political reform package at the same time, does it  not?    [Tanaka] That is the main problem. If we want to secure  long-lasting prosperity for Japan, we must, by all means  necessary, reorganize the existing economic community. We  should liberalize the economic community, which has been trussed  up by regulations, and create an environment for new businesses.  It is also necessary to frame a system under which the fruit of  economic growth is returned to the people who make a steady  living. The Economic Reform Study Group is currently studying  hard to create such an economic community. The process is like  a surgical operation on Japan's economy. We need to have basic  physical strength in order to undergo the operation. It is  impossible to perform an operation when you are physically weak,  suffering from a cold or stomach upset. Our target for the time  being, therefore, is to build up our physical strength in order  to be strong enough to undergo this vital operation. It is true  that the necessity of performing the operation and the necessity  of recovering physical strength tend to be mixed up in public  discussion. Put another way, our problem at the moment is  deciding what measures must be taken to prevent our community  from collapsing at the base.    [Iwasa] The only action possible seems to be an increase in  government disbursements, does it not?    [Tanaka] I am sorry, but I am not in a position to talk  about that.    [Iwasa] We are already in a period of deflation, a  process which might be accelerated if further deregulation is  carried out. In the short-term, this situation may be  accompanied by some pain.    [Tanaka] It is certain that, for the time being,  deregulation will have a negative influence on employment. It  is also true that drastic deregulation does produce surplus  manpower. Therefore, I am saying that we need to build up  physical strength to meet the situation. Another point is that  there are certain deregulatory measures which show an immediate  effect in stimulating business conditions.    The government is to organize a deregulation promotion  headquarters. I hope its promotion does not involve merely  enumerating the regulations to be removed. Deregulation should  be effected for various purposes, even if it deals with only one  regulation.    Take as an example housing construction, which is a key  industry in the Japanese economy. If we want to further  activate this sector, it is necessary to further reduce  construction costs. If we want to promote deregulation with the  focus on cutting construction costs, it will not be enough to  simply remove the regulations under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of Construction. We must also remove the regulations  under the control of the Ministry of Transport to ease the  transportation of materials, and regulations controlled by the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry to help import  those materials. If we carry out deregulation for a purpose and  look beyond simply the extent of accountability of ministries  and agencies, we may be able to link deregulation to measures to  stimulate business conditions. If we remove regulations placed  on newcomers, it also becomes possible to create an investment  opportunity for enterprises and industries which are now facing  deadlock.  <H5>  The Prime Minister, as `Political Leader' Must Be Helped </H5>   [Iwasa] Is it true that deregulation based on political  policy is desirable?    [Tanaka] According to our interim report, the deregulation  promotion plan is to have a five-year lifetime. In principle,  economic regulations will be removed during this period.  However, if the five-year period proves insufficient, we will  try another five-year period.    [Iwasa] But people are hoping to see deregulation come into  effect as early as the latter half of 1994.    [Tanaka] Actually, we have not even organized a deregulation  promotion headquarters. Yet, I appreciate your comment as  information. However, I am sure that, this time, the new  headquarters will operate powerfully in a quite different way  from past operations.    [Iwasa] Will the new headquarters make it clear to the  general public that it will deal with the government offices  very differently from the past?    [Tanaka] Regulations are the authority and assets of  government offices. There is a limit, therefore, to the extent  that they will contribute their assets voluntarily. Political  leadership will be required to secure the cooperation of  government offices in removing regulations. I feel the  promotion headquarters must play the role of leader. As for me,  I am to play an unpopular role (laughter).    [Iwasa] Will there be strong opposition from staff members  of government offices?    [Tanaka] Contrary to our belief, people within the  administration are developing a deeper understanding. They have  a sense of crisis. They are afraid the Japanese economy may be  pushed more and more into a corner if nothing is done, and that  only those industries which are protected by regulations will be  left in Japan.    Therefore, since the start of the Hosokawa administration,  we  have been surprised by the number of regulations reported to us  by each government office which they believe should be removed.  Also, when we were trying to correct the difference between  foreign and domestic prices, I had a telephone call from the  director of the Price Bureau at the Economic Planning Agency who  told me he was glad to see more items reported by government  offices than he had expected.    You can be sure though, that there are still regulations  which could usefully be cut. The role of the Prime Minister's  Office is to further promote deregulation. Hosokawa is fully  prepared to play his part.    [Iwasa] How about Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership?    [Tanaka] Hosokawa seems to be a prime minister chosen by the  times. Though at first I opposed the decision to give him the  post, now I feel he may have been destined to become prime  minister.    [Iwasa] The prime minister is supposed to be the leader of  the administration and, at the same time, the political leader.  In which of these two areas do you think you are best able to  assist the prime minister?    [Tanaka] In the world of politics, there is a large  emotional element to the job in which you are required to  coordinate people's feeling, or to persuade people. Therefore,  as leader of the administration, the prime minister will every  day experience a serious sense of conflict within himself. The  conflict becomes even more serious when you feel the existing  systems do not work. I could well understand his feelings while  working for him. So my best role is the assistance I can give  Hosokawa as political leader.    [Iwasa] Don't you think there are a variety of ways to carry  out reforms?    [Tanaka] No, I think there are only two -- the successful  and the unsuccessful. I think the process of carrying out  reform is very important. In carrying out political reform for  example, one way may be to force the bills through without any  sort of consensus, the other way is to deal with the bills in  such a way that even opponents of reform will be able to  cooperate once the bills are passed into law. In carrying out  political reform, we should make every effort to take the latter  road, as this is important in the world of politics. I envy,  though, the freedom of the mass media to make bold statements.  <H3>  After Reform, We Aim To Form a Brilliant Country, Even  Though It May Be Small </H3>   [Iwasa] What type of a leader will be needed in the future?    [Tanaka] I am not good at talking about leadership. We are  currently at the stage of drawing up plans for the three major  reforms. Once our social system has undergone the changes  envisaged in the reforms, then the setting will also be changed.  The "Sakigake" (Harbinger) to which I belong is trying to  visualize the sort of ideals we should have then, what type of a  nation we should build, and what type of a people should we  become. It is rather on these points that I can communicate  with Hosokawa. In 20 or 30 years from now, Japan will be able  to establish its life-style as a whole with its identity as a  nation also established. Personally, I hope that, by every  means, Japan will become a country where importance is placed on  quality and substance. Whenever I have a drink with Takemura,  he says, "it is our earnest dream to build a brilliant country,  even though it may be small." Hosokawa shares the same dream.  Their philosophy seems to be closest in this respect.    [Iwasa] How is he going to deal with foreign countries? At  the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference], the  United States expressed its intention to stress inter-Pacific  relations.    [Tanaka] The United States is more concerned with Asia than  we suppose it to be. It is true that Asia is a very active  area. However, there exist in Asia certain countries which have  different social structures and which are in different stages of  development. The best approach for Japan is to assist each  country bearing in mind its level of development. Japan should  not try to assume leadership. The United States should also try  to be patient in dealing with Asia, or it may fail. I  accompanied [the prime minister] when he attended the APEC the  other day. When President Clinton said "let us toast" at the  dinner party sponsored by the APEC, I found the wine had not  been served yet, and there was only a glass of water before me.  Well, since I love water, I was happy to give my toast with  water (laughter).</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / People: DAKS' new style DAKS Simpson, which is now owned by the Japanese Sankyo Seiko group, has appointed a new chief executive to replace the flamboyant pony-tailed Johnny Mengers who left earlier this year after 40 years with the stylish UK clothing company. The new boss is 56-year-old Jeremy Franks, who has been managing director of the group - which includes manufacturing, licensing, wholesaling and accessories as well as retailing - since February 1991. Prior to that he had, since 1984, been running the Simpson Piccadilly store. Despite speculation, when Mengers went, that there had been friction between him and the new Japanese shareholders, the company says it has largely been left to run its own affairs since the acquisition. But it admits that Sankyo Seiko continues to take a 'close interest' in its direction. Kozo Chiba, of Sankyo Seiko, will join the DAKS Simpson board replacing Yasukazu Saito who retired as a director last month.</p>

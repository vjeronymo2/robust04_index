			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Coflexip merges with Stena unit Coflexip, the French oilfield services company, yesterday completed a Dollars 230m merger with Stena Offshore, the offshore contracting arm of Stena of Sweden. The two companies claimed the deal would create Europe's largest offshore contracting company, and the world's seventh largest by market capitalisation. The merger was financed by issues of shares and convertible Coflexip stock which, when fully exercised, will give Stena 32 per cent of Coflexip. Coflexip, which specialises in flexible sub-sea pipework, is based in Paris and had sales of Dollars 379m and profits of Dollars 33m in 1993. About 40 per cent of its business is in the North Sea. It also has facilities in Australia, Brazil, Singapore and the US. Stena Offshore specialises in sub-sea contracting in the North Sea. Revenues in 1993 were Dollars 321m and operating profit Dollars 34m. The company has its headquarters in Aberdeen, Scotland, and employs 1,600. Mr Derek Leach, vice-president of marine and north sea operations for the combined group, said the merger reflected the changing conditions of the offshore contracting market, where weak oil prices were putting pressure on exploration and forcing companies to cut costs. Increasingly, he said, oil companies wanted contractors who could provide complete solutions for offshore work. In addition, the declining size of new finds in the North Sea meant more wells were serviced by seabed technology rather than platforms. 'This is a market niche where both companies are market leaders,' he said. The combined company will be known as Coflexip/Stena Offshore.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Many Voters Believe the Netherlands </F> Is Saturated"]    [Excerpt] Rotterdam, 23 Apr -- The Netherlands is full.  This topic is dominating the thoughts of Netherlands voters.  There is no more room for asylum-seekers. Hardly any racist  arguments are being advanced, mainly economic ones.    That is the most significant opinion expressed to 30  reporters from NRC HANDELSBLAD during approximately 500  interviews conducted with voters in the Netherlands last Monday  [17 April]. Few of those interviewed professed to disliking  foreigners. Most interviewees saw a direct link between cuts,  rising unemployment, lower benefit payments, the shortage of  housing, and the "foreigners," who are supposedly to blame.    In order to go further than the meager opinion polls, last  Monday the Central Bureau for Statistics visited 30 selected  neighborhoods which together accurately reflect the Netherlands  as a whole. In all, 527 people were interviewed about their  voting behavior and the arguments behind it, about the country's  main problems in their eyes and what "politicians" are doing  about them.    Of all those interviewed, 35 percent spontaneously cited  "foreigners" as the country's most serious problem.  "Unemployment" and the Old Age Pensions Law [AOW] followed a  considerable distance behind, each of these two topics being  mentioned by approximately 15 percent. The planned cuts on old  age pensions and other benefits for the elderly have stirred up  a lot of bad blood. The voters regard "crime" as being less  important than many politicians believe: Only 10 percent  spontaneously ranked this topic among the important issues.  Issues such as "social security," "discrimination," and "the  environment" remained some way behind, being mentioned by  between 5 and 10 percent of those interviewed. [passage omitted]</p>

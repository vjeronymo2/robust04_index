			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER DEFENDS U.S. WARMING TOWARD CHINA  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, defending the Bush Administration's  attempt to repair its relationship with China, said Sunday that continued  isolation of the Beijing regime would only "compound the tragedy" of the bloody  repression of the pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> Baker said President Bush decided to send White House national security adviser  Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to China  to revive the "geopolitical and geostrategic" relationship between the two  nations.  </P> <P> The trip, which shattered Bush's ban on high-level visits, was not announced  until Scowcroft and Eagleburger were already in China on Saturday.  Nevertheless, it drew a chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill, where the  prevailing sentiment calls for toughening, rather than relaxing, sanctions  against the Beijing government.  </P> <P> Appearing on the ABC-TV program "This Week with David Brinkley," Baker said  Scowcroft and Eagleburger emphasized U.S. concern about human rights in their  talks in China. But he said it is time to restore a more normal relationship  between Washington and Beijing.  </P> <P> "I don't think the American people would want to see their government compound  the tragedy of Tian An Men Square," Baker said. "It is our judgment . . . that  that is what would happen if we try to isolate China."  </P> <P> He said that Washington continues to maintain economic sanctions against China,  but "it is a question of moving responsibly, reasonably and with due regard for  human rights to try to preserve a relationship."  </P> <P> Baker said that Chinese students "absolutely" will be permitted to remain in  the United States until it is safe for them to return home despite Bush's veto  of legislation, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, to suspend the requirement  that students return to China after completing their studies.  </P> <P> About 70% or 80% of the estimated 40,000 Chinese students in this country have  visas saying they are sponsored by the Chinese government -- although many  students say their tuition and expenses actually are paid by U.S. universities  or private sources -- and thus are subject to the requirement to return home  for two years.  </P> <P> Baker was interviewed just hours before he was scheduled to leave on a weeklong  trip to Europe for consultations with U.S. allies about the fast-changing  situation in Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze, interviewed on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," said Moscow  is ready for a totally new relationship with the United States in which the  superpowers no longer regard each other as adversaries.  </P> <P> Underlining the comments of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Malta  summit, Shevardnadze said, "The Soviet Union is ready to no longer regard the  United States of America as its adversary, and we are ready to state that  publicly."  </P> <P> Asked if he envisioned the U.S.-Soviet relationship as one between friends,  Shevardnadze said, "Like partners and like friends." Then he added: "Friends  sometimes have arguments, too."  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Stelco cuts losses to CDollars 4m in final term STELCO, one of Canada's two biggest steelmakers, did better than expected in the final quarter of 1992, with shipments up 24 per cent to the best level in more than two years. Prices stabilised and about 25 per cent of Stelco's output went to the US market The quarter's loss was CDollars 4m (USDollars 3.1m) or 10 cents a share against a loss of CDollars 38m or 51 cents a share a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 549m against CDollars 500m. The latest period included 50 cents a share in tax recoveries. For all 1992, the net loss came to CDollars 127m or CDollars 1.76 a share against CDollars 136m or CDollars 3.05 a share in 1991. Sales slipped to CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.2bn Stelco generated positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and is expected to avoid any financial restructuring even though its balance sheet remains strained. The company warned that in spite of better demand from the car and energy sectors and a recent run-up in the price of its stock, uncertainties remained - not least because of the US anti-dumping duties. It may therefore not be able to maintain shipments to the US at present levels. Algoma Steel, the troubled Ontario-based company owned by Canada's other large steelmaker, Dofasco, lost CDollars 74m or CDollars 2.96 a share in the seven months ended December 31 on sales of CDollars 429m. Algoma, which itself is Canada's third biggest steel producer, has been broadly restructured by Dofasco since it was acquired in 1987 from Canadian Pacific. Warburg Pincus, a CDollars 3bn investment management group, is putting CDollars 40m into SHL Systemhouse, the Ottawa-based computer systems integrator, by buying 4.5m SHL shares at CDollars 9 a share. SHL will use the money to expand further in the US and Europe.</p>

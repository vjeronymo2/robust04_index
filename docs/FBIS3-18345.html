			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Taoiseach [Prime Minister  Albert Reynolds] has delivered a sharp dismissal of the  proposals from the Ulster Unionist Party for a devolved assembly  in Northern Ireland.    Mr. Reynolds told the Dail [Irish parliament] this afternoon  the document published by Jim Molyneaux represented the road to  nowhere and a cul-de-sac in political terms. Replying to  opposition questions he said the government would not accept for  one moment any question of talks on an internal settlement. The  government believed the three strand talks process was the only  basis on which to proceed and they were waiting to hear the  British Government's view. Our political editor, Donald Kemp.    [Kemp] Two weeks ago, after their meeting in London, the  Taoiseach and the British prime minister committed their  governments to a resumption of the three strand talks process.  But yesterday the Ulster Unionists published their proposals  for a devolved northern assembly and said they would not talk  with Dublin until it was established.    However, in the Dail today that position earned them a  strong  rebuke from the Taoiseach.    [Begin Reynolds recording] The Irish Government will not  entertain a one-sided approach that downgrades the Irish  dimension and makes any discussion of it contingent on the prior  achievement of an internal settlement.

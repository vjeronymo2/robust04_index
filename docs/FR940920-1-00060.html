			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, MSW combustion is more common in the EU than in the United States. There are 12 members of the EU: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal. The percentage of waste combusted in many of the EU countries is over 30 percent, with Denmark, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, combusting 60, 60, and 40 percent of their waste, respectively. As a national average for the United States, 16 percent of the waste generated is combusted. In the Eastern United States, where the majority of MWC's are located, the rate of waste combustion is higher, averaging 25 to 30 percent. In the New England region, the rate of waste combustion approaches 60 percent. Therefore, although the United States as a whole has a much lower rate of waste combustion than does the EU, certain regions of the United States have combustion rates similar to those in the EU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factors such as population density, percentage of urbanization, land availability, and topography/geology influence the method of waste disposal for a country or a region. In the EU, the majority of the countries have population densities that range from 200 to 600 people per square mile and urban population percentages of 60 to 90 percent. The United States, in comparison, has a much lower average population density of approximately 70 people per square mile, and the percentage of the population living in urban areas is approximately 75 percent. In the Eastern United States, the population density and percentage of urban population are higher than national levels, at around 200 people per square mile with over 80 percent of the population living in urban areas, which is comparable to most of Europe. As noted above, other factors contribute to the use of MWC technology. For example, in Florida, the geology is such that in some cases landfilling waste is not a desirable option. Similarly, the mountainous regions in parts of Europe restrict the use of landfilling, and the increased use of MWC's is common. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding regulatory development in the EU, the EU sets uniform environmental guidelines, and individual EU countries may adopt those guidelines or more stringent requirements. This is similar to the role the EPA plays with the individual States. Table 5 presents: (1) The proposed EPA NSPS for new MWC plants with capacities above 35 and 225 Mg/day and (2) the EU guidelines that apply to new MWC plants with capacities greater than 72 Mg/day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

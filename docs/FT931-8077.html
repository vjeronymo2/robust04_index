			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel: Secret joys of the hidden valley - Off Piste / Ian Roger learns with an expert in Andermatt MY ENGLISH companion in the Gemsstock cable car groaned as I introduced myself. 'Oh no] You are not going to write about Andermatt, are you?' he said. Bob, a retired dentist, was depressed by the thought that the ski resort he has regarded as almost his own for 30 years would become more widely known. Andermatt, in the Urseren valley in the middle of Switzerland's Gotthard pass, has many special qualities. It is one of Europe's historic trade crossroads, and the town and other villages in the valley retain considerable historic charm and the natives an unexpected openness. The weather is frequently wet which makes for unusually good snow cover in winter. Andermatt's biggest attraction is that it takes no package tours. During the week, the valley's villages remain blissfully quiet. No lager louts, no overly jolly chalet girls, no designer shops. Just a handful of small, friendly hotels and pensions. At weekends, a nearby motorway exit makes the resort easily accessible for Swiss and Italian day trippers, but there are ways to avoid them. Andermatt is for serious skiers - such as Bob. 'I have tried all the other places, but this is still the best,' he says. The ski area is deceptively large, although from lift and piste maps it actually looks limited, with only the cable car and a couple of drag lifts on the Gemsstock, a couple more drags on the other side of Andermatt at Natschen and another at Hospental, by the entry to the Gotthard. Each of these lifts also leads to a vast expanse of off-piste skiing. In addition, the cog-wheel train (included in the weekly lift pass) on the Furka-Oberalp railway runs to the top of the Oberalp pass to the east, and from there a series of pistes and lifts leads down to Disentis in the upper Rhine valley. Off-piste routes lead back to Andermatt. 'We like to get in about 30,000 feet vertical on a good day,' Bob said, as I was panting from trying to keep up with him after only one run. There are few resorts in the Alps where it would be logistically comfortable to ski 30,000 vertical feet in a day. The top of the 9,714 ft Gemsstock can be reached in less than 20 minutes. From there, it is an all black run, the initial portion over a glacier, to the town 5,000ft below. Or, like Bob, skiers can plunge through powder most of the way. If all this sounds too macho for the average intermediate, do not despair. Andermatt is a good place to learn to be a serious skier. The resort has two specialist off-piste guiding and instructing organisations. After two outings with Alpine Adventures, run by Canadian John Hogg, I can confidently say that if there is safely skiable powder to be found in the region, John will find it. If it is not within reach from the lifts, he will put climbing skins on pupils' skis and take them up to nearby glaciers to introduce them to the joys of ski touring. I joined him feeling a little apprehensive: there had been no fresh snow for a week and crowds of day trippers could be expected. The well-known off-piste runs from the Gemsstock had been skied out and most of the rest had deteriorated into crud. But John led our group of five up a little-known shoulder of the Gemsstock and down a steep, untouched chute into the Unteralp valley. For most of the way, the snow was surprisingly good. Then we went up and down the broad north face of the 8,500ft Winterhorn above Hospental a number of times without meeting another skier. The conditions varied mainly from breakable to unbreakable crust, but every so often we came across some good powder. As John said: 'If you can ski in this stuff, you can ski in anything.' An intermediate looking for the next leap may find Andermatt is for them. Do not tell anyone. Bob would be upset. Ian Rodger travelled with Alpine Adventures in Andermatt, Switzerland.

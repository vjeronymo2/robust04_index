			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Mua'yyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah: "The Three </F> Islands and These Iranian Statements"]    [Text] For Iran to refuse returning the occupied islands to  Arab sovereignty and to insist on carving up, confiscating, and  Persianizing these islands; and in fact escalating its  aggressive threats every time their subject is brought up here  or there is not new. That regime is accustomed to making such  threats through its officials from time to time, which clearly  reveals Iran's greed and ambitions for expansion and occupation.  This tendency has always characterized its policy with the  neighboring countries.    Although the Iranian regime has tried several times to show  moderation, flexibility, and a desire to establish relations of  good neighborliness with the countries of the region, those  attempts were, at best, no more than a bridge to cross, expand,  and interfere in the internal affairs of those countries and to  fulfill its sickening dreams and delusions to dominate the  region and its affairs.    Perhaps Rafsanjani's recent statements to maintain the  occupation of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa Islands and  his declaration that any attempt to regain those islands will  have to be through a sea of blood, truly express the Iranian  regime's arrogant mentality and policy of belligerency and  piracy. But the responsibility for this Iranian belligerency  and piracy is born by the UAE and most of the other Gulf states  for appeasing that regime and keeping silent about its  interferences and terrorist acts. That unprincipled,  compromising has contributed to Iranian expansionism and  encouraged the Tehran regime to maintain its occupation of the  three islands.    By returning to the language of threats anew at a time when  Tehran and other Iranian cities are witnessing protests,  strikes, resistance operations, and deteriorating social,  economic, and political conditions, the Iranian regime is trying  to divert the Iranian people's attention from their worsening  internal conditions. This is an old game which Iran also used  during its aggression against Iraq. It is still playing this  game in order to prolong the life of its crippled regime. By  renewing its impudent threats and affirming its adherence to the  tendencies of aggression and expansion and the same old dreams,  the Iranian regime wants to hint that it can instill itself and  its existence on the region. Yet, the reality confirms that  regime's hollow claims, bankruptcy, and imminent collapse.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Renault beats forecasts with FFr1.07bn profit Renault, the French state-owned vehicle group, suffered a sharp fall in profits last year, but managed to achieve a net result of FFr1.07bn (Dollars 186m) despite the contraction in the European car market. Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman, forecast improved earnings in the current year. The result for last year, which compares with net profits of FFr5.68bn in 1992, was higher than most industry analysts had forecast. Mr Schweitzer said it demonstrated the competitiveness of the company in the midst of depressed markets, adding that few other European car manufacturers had managed to remain in profit through the recession. The Renault chairman said the group was seeking to forge new industrial partnerships following last year's collapse of its plans to merge with Volvo. But he played down the prospect of a far-reaching alliance. 'We need to develop limited co-operation agreements with competitors, like other players in the industry,' he said. Mr Schweitzer said talks were being held with Fiat of Italy, but denied a 'global' agreement was being discussed. The negotiations are thought to include the sharing of foundry facilities. Renault dismissed the idea of plans to exchange engines with Fiat or to seek an alliance between RVI, its trucks and buses division, with the Italian group's Iveco truck operation. Last year's profits were supported by financial income of FFr537m, compared with a charge of FFr43m in 1992, reflecting lower interest charges, and improved income from its financial subsidiaries. Reduced losses from its shareholding in Volvo, which has been partly unwound since the collapse of the merger, also helped earnings. Mr Schweitzer's prediction of an improved performance this year is based on signs of recovery in the European vehicle market and continued cost-cutting and efficiency measures. Renault said that the French market had been strongly boosted by government measures which include the payment of FFr5,000 to car-owners who trade in a vehicle more than 10 years old to buy a new one. According to Mr Schweitzer, the measures could bring about 200,000 extra orders in the French market. Turnover last year fell from FFr184.25bn to FFr169.79bn, after adjusting last year's figures for an accounting change which consolidated revenues from financial services. In unit terms, Renault sold 1.79m vehicles, a 12 per cent fall on 1992. In western Europe, sales of cars and light passenger vehicles fell 17 per cent to 1.39m, while market share slipped slightly from 11.3 per cent to 11.1 per cent. Renault is one of the 21 companies slated for privatisation. The sale of the government's controlling stake, however, which had been forecast to take place this year has been pushed back until 1995.</p>

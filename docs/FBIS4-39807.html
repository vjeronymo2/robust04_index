			<p>BFN     [Text] ITAR-TASS reported today that at a meeting with  employees of the Interior Affairs Ministry, the head of the  Crimean parliament, Tsekov, called on them not to accept jobs at  the Crimean Main Interior Affairs Administration at the  Ukrainian Interior Affairs Ministry. The Crimean Supreme  Soviet, he declared, will do its best to preserve the Crimean  Interior Affairs Ministry and ensure its operations. This will  be done, Tsekov continued, by raising taxes and introducing  other unpopular measures, including lifting state subsidies for  bread. I asked Militia Colonel Ivan (Leskiv), chief of the Main  Public Relations Department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry,  to comment on the ITAR-TASS report.    [Begin recording] [(Leskiv]) Let me remind you that on 18  May, by edict of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, the  Crimean Interior Affairs Ministry was reorganized into the  Crimean Main Interior Affairs Administration within the  Ukrainian Interior Affairs Ministry. However, some Crimean  politicians are bluntly ignoring this legislative act. The Main  Public Relations Department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry  is convinced that the above declaration will result only in  further embroiling the militia in the political [word  indistinct]. It is clear what a heavy burden those  ill-considered decisions can prove for Crimean residents -- and  not only for them. [words indistinct] because at present, the  Crimea is virtually funded by the Ukrainian budget, consuming  more than it produces. As for the newly created Main  Administration, it has been financed by the Ukrainian Interior  Affairs Ministry budget from the beginning. It receives the  necessary equipment to ensure normal operation of all the  Crimean Interior Affairs bodies and subunits. This is why  high-ranking officials reacted with surprise to the declaration  and, even more so, the speed with which the Russian media  reported it. This by no means promote will promote unity and  cohesion among the ranks of Interior Affairs Ministry employees  or lower the already high crime rate in the Republic.    Over the past five months, the crime rate rose more than 14  percent in the Crimea. Violence accounts for a considerable  part of all crimes committed. This type of crime has risen by  326 percent, while arrests have decreased. Street and group  crimes increased substantially. Every second robbery and every  fourth assault or case of hooliganism were committed on the  streets and in other public places. Almost half the crimes were  committed by citizens under the influence of alcohol. With the  militia distracted from performing its duties and the political  interference in the operations of the Crimean Interior Affairs  Administration, criminals are becoming even more arrogant. This  causes concern and anxiety not only for the Crimean population,  but also for the entire Ukraine.    Hoping for success of the negotiations initiated in the  Crimea, one would like to be confident that at this complicated  and crucial time, the Crimean president and Supreme Soviet will  display political wisdom and foresight in legally resolving the  artificially created problems in regard to the Interior  Ministry.

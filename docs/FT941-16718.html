			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU traveller finds barriers slow to come down Sir, At the conclusion of Andrew Hill's very relevant article ('Balloon struggles to get airborne', January 5) on the single market and the need for better enforcement towards the level playing field, he mentions the failure to withdraw passport formalities across member state boundaries. In my recent experience, this is getting worse, not better. For a simple flight between the UK and continental Europe I have usually been obliged to produce my passport on no less than three occasions: once at check-in, then in passport control, and just before boarding the aircraft. We were surely all told that the coming of the European Union would do away with this kind of thing. Is a new law to be enunciated? For all governmental actions (especially those stated to have the reduction of bureaucracy as their objective) greater bureaucracy will result.

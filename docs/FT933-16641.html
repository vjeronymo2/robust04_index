			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Southern Electric's attempt to win this year's dividend race by a short head is of little fundamental significance. Yet it does re-focus attention on the financial strength of the regional electricity companies. The review of transmission prices over the next year will cut into the RECs margins. Average dividend cover is, however, around three times and strong cash flow continues to cut gearing. Since electricity prices will be falling from 1995, political pressure on the sector may be slight. None of the range of probable outcomes of the transmission review are likely to cut into Southern's ability to pay 8 per cent real dividend increases through the rest of the decade. That is in contrast to the water sector where gearing is rising sharply. Shares in the water sector have fallen, and there are fears that once the transmission review is under way, electricity may suffer too. Yet the sector's high yield relative to the market already discounts much of the risk. On a prospective basis, electricity shares yield almost as much as water, which is surely too cautious given their markedly different prospects. Southern and the other RECs which are getting on with cost cutting look sensible, since Offer is unlikely to be hoodwinked about the costs of companies which are merely lazy. Yet Southern's zeal in setting up new pay bargaining arrangements and 2.9 per cent award to staff sits oddly besides the directors' higher pay awards and continuing three-year rolling contracts. The company seems to be learning 1980s-style management techniques in the 1990s.</p>

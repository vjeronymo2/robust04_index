			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Riot police in Managua fired tear gas at 1,000 striking taxi drivers protesting  government measures that have more than doubled the price of gasoline. Taxi  drivers, who own their cabs, stopped work Tuesday after gasoline prices rose by  110% after a 52.5% devaluation of Nicaragua's currency. In addition to a return  to the old price for gasoline, the drivers also want discounts on tires and  spare parts and suppression of unofficial "pirate taxis." The austerity  measures by the leftist Sandinista government are aimed at combatting  inflation, which was 15.5% last month. The cost of living rose 20,000% last  year.  </P></p>

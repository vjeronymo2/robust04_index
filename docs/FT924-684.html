			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Shake-up for EC leadership: Delors aims to strengthen trade policy Brittan given new portfolio MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday signalled the birth of a tougher, more outward-looking European Community executive when he announced the duties of his 16 fellow commissioners for the next two years. The commissioners who will work in Mr Delors' third Commission met for the first time yesterday. Having spent the past few weeks jockeying for position  -in person and through national governments - they took only 15 minutes to decide which jobs they will inherit when they take office on January 6. The changes should lend new weight to the EC's diplomatic and trade policy. The Commission's external affairs portfolio - previously the domain of one commissioner, Mr Frans Andriessen - will be split between Mr Andriessen's successor as Dutch commissioner, Mr Hans van den Broek, the Netherlands' foreign minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner. Mr Van den Broek will take on responsibility for external political relations, and will lead 'enlargement' negotiations with applicants for EC membership - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Sir Leon, now responsible for competition and financial services, will handle trade relations with the industrialised nations, including the expected conclusion of the Uruguay Round and anti-dumping policy. Sir Leon said yesterday he believed he and Mr Van den Broek - who discussed their new responsibilities last week - shared the same liberal and 'Atlanticist' approach to external relations, and would work well together. The new allocation of duties will mean division of the Commission's sprawling external relations department by April. Further restructuring of the Brussels bureaucracy is likely to follow. Sir Leon's competition portfolio passes to Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian socialist currently in charge of transport and environment policy. Mr Van Miert said earlier this week 'there will be changes' in the conduct of EC competition policy, a job which Sir Leon and his predecessor, Mr Peter Sutherland, built into one of the most powerful in Brussels. In particular, Mr Van Miert is likely to try to make competition policy more responsive to social and industrial considerations. The distribution of portfolios reflects the enlargement of the Community's role envisaged in the Maastricht treaty. For example, Mr Van den Broek, who chaired the Council of Ministers in the run-up to the Maastricht summit, will be responsible for Commission input to the EC's embryonic foreign and security policy. Mr Padraig Flynn, the new Irish commissioner, will monitor EC justice and immigration policy as well as social policy. In response to calls for more openness and accountability in EC decision-making, a portfolio has been created for Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the highly regarded former Portuguese foreign minister. He will liaise with the European Parliament, which will be strengthened if Maastricht is ratified. He will also develop Mr Delors' idea that Brussels should give a regular account of itself to national parliaments and through a more active information policy. In principle, the new Commission - which includes 10 members of the current executive - will last for two years, assuming Maastricht is ratified. The appointment of a five-year Commission at the end of 1994 will run in tandem with a newly elected European Parliament. Aid for developing countries has been regrouped under the senior Spanish commissioner, Mr Manuel Marin. Spain pressed for a higher profile in the Brussels executive and has gained from the reshuffle. Its junior commissioner, Mr Abel Matutes, gets two jobs from the previous Commission - energy and transport.</p>

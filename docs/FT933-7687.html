			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / US jets raid north Iraq missile site US AIRCRAFT attacked and destroyed an Iraqi missile position just west of the northern city of Mosul yesterday, according to the Pentagon in Washington. Six aircraft were involved in the attack, which was made in response to the launching of two Sam-3 missiles. The US statement did not say whether the missiles had been aimed at the aircraft. An Iraqi spokesman in Baghdad claimed that the US attack had been unprovoked and its anti-aircraft battery had opened fire in self defence. He added that a soldier and a civilian had been wounded. Mosul is within the air exclusion zone north of the 36th parallel, which US aircraft patrol daily to protect the Kurdish population. The northern 'no-fly' zone was imposed more than two years ago.</p>

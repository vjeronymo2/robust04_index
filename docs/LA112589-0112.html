			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> DeLorean Court Order Set Aside: Lawyers for former auto maker John Z. DeLorean,  whose Belfast-based car company went bankrupt in 1982, won a British court  order setting aside an earlier court order against him for more than $51  million. Judge Peter Gibson overturned a July, 1987, court order that allowed  legal documents in the case to be served on DeLorean at his home in New Jersey,  outside the jurisdiction of English courts. The ruling was the latest stage in  a dispute between the liquidators of DSQ Property Co., incorporated in Northern  Ireland and formerly called DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd., and DeLorean. Unstated  damages had been claimed against DeLorean for alleged conspiracy, deceit and  breach of fiduciary duty, Gibson said. In June, 1988, a judgment was entered  against DeLorean, ordering him to pay more than $51 million. DeLorean, a former  General Motors Co. executive, set up his plant in Belfast in 1978, employing  more than 2,600 workers at its peak.  </P></p>

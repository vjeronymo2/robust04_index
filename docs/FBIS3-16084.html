This time more than half of the adult population came to the  polls in Tatarstan, where the elections to the Federal Assembly  were held again after the failure of December 12. On the eve of  the elections President Mintimer Shaymiyev said that the  republic had radically changed the political course. After the  signing of the intergovernmental treaty with Russia, the people  of Tatarstan decided to send their representatives to the  federal parliament.    Preliminary results will probably become known today, while  the official results will be announced on Tuesday, a spokesman  for the elections headquarters told ITAR-TASS.    A little more than 37 per cent of electors came to the  polling stations in Chuvashia. This figure reflects a  tremendous difference in opinions, Chairman of the Republican  Electoral Commission Anatoliy Ukhtiyarov believes. In a number  of rural areas some 75 per cent of the adult population took  part in the voting, while in Cheboksary the figure was 19 per  cent, and in Novocheboksarsk even less than that. Thus, even  before the preliminary results are announced, it is clear that  repeated elections will be held in Chuvashia late in March. The  struggle will be continued by the candidates who win the first  and the second place. Today it will be known whether or not  the rural areas of the republic managed to elect deputies in  their constituencies with the first attempt.    It is obvious now that the elections to the regional and  city  dumas were a success in the Kostroma region. Most  constituencies managed to exceed the "25 per cent plus one"  limit. In the evening it became clear that more than one third  of the electors agree with the need to form new bodies of power  to replace the soviets.    Along with elections to the Duma, Kostroma became the first  city in Russia to hold a referendum on the "city constitution,"  which is a kind of local government regulations. For the  Constitution to become valid, it should have been supported by  50 per cent of Kostroma residents. However, only 25 per cent of  the city residents came to the polling stations, and the  referendum actually did not take place.    Elections to the territorial legislative assembly and local  government bodies failed to attract the needed number of  electors in the Altay region. According to the preliminary  results, received by ITAR-TASS at the regional electoral  commission, 36.8 per cent of officially registered electors took  part in the voting.    Fifty candidates were vying for 15 seats in the legislative  assembly of the Jewish autonomous region. The results show that  the elections did take place in 12 constituencies. According to  local government regulations, the assembly will be given the  status of a local legislative authority, Chairman of the  Regional Electoral Commission Yakov Sherman told ITAR-TASS. In  three constituencies of Birobidzhan, where less than 25 per cent  of electors turned up, repeated elections will be held.    Birobidzhan March 14 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent  Viktor Gorelkin -- The 12 seats in the legislative assembly of  the Jewish region were distributed in the following way: Four  went to heads of local administrations, six -- to senior  officials of industrial enterprises, one -- to a medic and one  to an economist.    An electoral campaign is going on in other Russian cities.  It entered a decisive stage in the Novgorod region, where  elections to the duma will be held on March 27. 143 candidates  will vie for 27 seats. It will not be easy for residents of the  Novgorod region to make a choice. This is also true of  residents of the Novosibirsk region. However, according to the  results of public opinion polls, only 40 per cent of them are  going to take part in the voting on March 27 during the  elections to the regional Council of Deputies.    So far as the Chechen Republic (Chechnya) is concerned, its  authorities refuse so much as to discuss elections and are very  far from holding them. Movladiy Udugov, head of the information  and press department of the republic, said laconically in a  telephone interview with ITAR-TASS: "I know elections are  taking place in some regions of Russia. As for us, we are  getting prepared for the end of the Uraza celebrations."  According to Udugov, Chechnya is more concerned now over the  growing number of the acts of subversion and provocations,  obviously aimed at again destabilising the situation in the  republic.    Khabarovsk March 14 TASS -- Elections, held on Sunday in the  Khabarovsk region, revealed the names of 18 out of 25 deputies  to the regional duma. Two thirds of the duma have been elected,  and the new representative authority will soon start functioning.    Candidates from the democratic choice bloc again suffered a  crushing defeat. Only one of fifteen candidates was elected to  the regional duma. Members of the Communist Party did not win  the support of electors either. They will also have only one  representative in the duma. Most deputies are industrial  managers of various levels, as well as heads of local  administrations, lawyers and servicemen. As a rule, they were  all nominated by groups of electors.    "On the whole, the results of the elections may be described  as positive," Viktor Tsirfa, chairman of the regional electoral  commission, told ITAR-TASS. "The defeat of the Democratic  Choice, of other political parties and movements, can hardly be  regarded as accidental. People are tired of confrontation, of  the endless settlement of scores. I think, a large number of  heads of state enterprises and business structures, elected to  the duma, will make it possible for the new authority to work in  a constructive way. In seven constituencies, where less than 25  per cent of electors came to the polls, or where most electors  crossed out the names of all candidates, repeated elections will  be held next autumn."</p>

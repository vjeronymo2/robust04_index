			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Matchsticks, a spending mess and the Union Sir, Mr Joe Rogaly writes ('Farewell balanced books', April 8) that Lord Home made an ass of himself when he used matchsticks in an effort to demonstrate how the economy worked. Was he as big an ass as the post-war prime ministers and chancellors who bet their reputations on the Treasury's forecasts and lost? Mr Rogaly should ask John Major, Norman Lamont, Nigel Lawson and Denis Healey to name but a few. Patrick Sergeant, Euromoney House, Playhouse Yard, London EC4</p>

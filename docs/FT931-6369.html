			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The merchants' adventure  -Charles Batchelor asks whether trade missions are of any value to smaller companies John Major's recent return from Saudi Arabia with an order from King Fahd for 48 Tornado aircraft in his briefcase focused attention on that cornerstone of exporting: the trade mission. The prime minister was so inspired by the experience that he enthused on his return about Britain's need for 'merchant venturers, not merchants of gloom'. But are trade missions of any relevance to the smaller business or are the merchant venturers only to be found in larger companies? The deals which are trumpeted are usually multi-million pound construction, engineering or defence projects. Nigel Grainger, founder of Offspring International, a two-year-old, Droitwich-based export agency supplying products and services for the offshore, petrochemical and power-generation industries, is proof that the small business can make use of trade missions. Grainger, who has one other full-time employee, one part-timer and a projected turnover this year of Pounds 300,000-Pounds 350,000, spent eight days in Yemen in December with a mission arranged by the London Chamber of Commerce. He says he made useful initial contacts though he did not expect people to place orders. The Yemen trip was not without incident. Rioting prompted by the rising cost of living prevented a lunch appointment in Sana'a with a visiting British minister, says Tracey Dorrell, manager of the mission. A cancelled airline flight led to a six and a half-hour drive through the mountains from Aden in taxis which would probably not have passed a conventional test of roadworthiness. It is difficulties like these which prove the value of trade missions, says John Dorrell, head of international services at the London chamber. 'Missions to countries which involve some discomfort or uncertainty tend to be oversubscribed,' he says. 'People want the support of the group and the backing of the local embassy. If there are unlikely to be problems, who needs a trade mission? There are none to European Community countries.' Missions are normally organised by either a chamber of commerce or a trade association and typically consist of between 10 and 30 members. The Department of Trade and Industry subsidises most missions but recently modified its policy to make the programme more cost-effective. It raised travel grants by between 5 and 25 per cent but placed a limit on the number of missions a business could join. There is an overall limit of 10 with a maximum of three to any single country except Japan, where the maximum is five. The past three years have seen a fall in the number of DTI-funded missions but an increase in the number of businessmen and women travelling. In 1990-91 1,725 participants went out on 133 missions. By 1992-93 there were just 123 missions but 2,350 participants, the DTI calculates. To encourage small and medium-sized companies to join missions it normally requires 60 per cent of participants to be from businesses employing fewer than 500 people. Although the organisers usually like to have a mix of participants from both large and small companies there are particular benefits for the smaller firm: The chore of booking flights, hotels and making local travel arrangements is removed. Advice on local market conditions and the practicalities of doing business is available from both the organisers and more experienced exporters. A briefing meeting is usually held before the mission leaves and on arrival in the foreign destination. The local embassy or high commission will produce lists of contacts though it normally makes a charge. A programme of receptions and visits is arranged. Participants are not obliged to take part in these events but they can provide valuable introductions. 'Don't just treat the mission as the chance of a cheap trip,' says Tracey Dorrell. Companionship. 'There is no substitute for travelling with other people,' says Nigel Bateman, sales manager of Euro-Tech (Export), a Croydon-based exporter of electronic components with 16 employees and sales of between Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. Bateman compares a recent visit to Saudi Arabia on a London chamber mission with an earlier three-week visit to the Gulf states. 'Spending a lot of time on your own can sap your enthusiasm and means you are less effective. The companionship of a mission is a big plus.' Support when things go wrong. The organisers or the local embassy can help with problems with visas or changes in travel arrangements. Women face particular difficulties in many countries in the Middle East. Three women on the Saudi mission were initially told they needed police approval to stay at one hotel, though this demand was subsequently dropped. Cost. Government subsidies do reduce the cost though some organisers think the sums involved are not significant enough to affect a decision to participate. The London chamber charged participants in its 10-day Saudi mission Pounds 1,269 with a Pounds 350 rebate from the DTI payable on return. The chamber advises participants to allow a further Pounds 50 a day for taxis, meals and incidentals. But the prospect of a cheap trip should not be a significant factor, the experts say. Most important is whether the company's products or services are likely to find a market in the country being visited. Once this has been established the would-be exporter needs to check that he can repatriate the proceeds of any sales. Will he be able to obtain insurance cover on the commercial and political risks of that particular destination? The exporter also has to be prepared for the extra business which may be generated by the trip. Janet Crawford, managing director of London-based Angel International Recruitment, calculates she won Pounds 120,000 worth of business from her trip to Saudi Arabia. She says she was surprised by the volume of business she obtained and estimates it will take a year to turn the 'orders' (for trained personnel) into cash. Participants should not necessarily expect to sign up firm orders on their first visit. Making contacts and establishing confidence is a slow process and regular visits will probably be necessary. 'Investigate the market on your first trip,' advises Bateman. 'Don't expect to come away with armloads of inquiries or orders. And don't be rushed into signing up exclusive agency deals.' A mission also requires careful preparation. Places must normally be booked three months in advance to be eligible for DTI subsidies and participants are advised to think about the trip well ahead of time. 'Some people don't do their homework beforehand,' says Peter Valpy, director of the British Knitting &amp; Clothing Export Council, which has five missions planned. 'Prepare good promotional material in advance and send it to the embassy for distribution ahead of your visit,' he says. A drawback of a trade mission is that it does require participants to keep to the general timetable. The London chamber's 10-day mission to Saudi Arabia involved three-day stops in Jeddah and Riyadh followed by a day of rest and then three days in the Eastern Province. Some participants may find they can generate most business in one location but have little to do in the others. This problem can be overcome by extending the visit, an option which is permitted by the DTI rules. Jean Morgan-Bryant of Sebvia, an equipment supplier to the oil and construction industries, extended her Saudi visit by three days before flying on to another destination. Grainger says he makes his first trip to a country with a mission but makes subsequent visits on his own so he can set his own itinerary. Missions organised by trade associations are normally only open to members. Chamber of commerce missions are usually open to members and non-members and to businesses outside the geographical area covered by the chamber.

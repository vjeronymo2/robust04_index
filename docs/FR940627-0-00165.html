			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tier 3 tests for specific endpoints could require the determination of a NOAEL. Depending on the endpoint under evaluation, consideration will be given to including a mid-duration examination in the case of chronic inhalation tests. A mid-duration evaluation will be useful for affirming the adequacy of exposure levels and, in some cases, might enable interim risk conclusions to be drawn which will avoid the need for further examination. Inhalation studies will generally make use of rodent species, but higher order mammals could be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While Tier 3 testing requirements will be targeted to critical areas of concern, EPA will also exercise its judgment to avoid the false economy of establishing overly narrow requirements. Just as requirements for too many assays would be wasteful of resources, requirements for too few assays might result in inconclusive findings, creating needs for still further testing at greater total expense than would have been necessary at the start. Similarly, EPA will consider the value of including secondary evaluations as useful and low-cost adjuncts to tests already required. For example, if the histopathology of a specified target organ was the primary examination required at the conclusion of an inhalation exposure, other organs could be weighed and saved in storage for a limited time period, at low incremental expense. If indicated, these other organs would then be available for subsequent examination, avoiding the possible need to repeat the chronic inhalation procedures to assess the effects on other organs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the specific health testing requirements which will be imposed in Tier 3 will be tailored to individual circumstances, precise test guidelines cannot be provided in advance. However, some examples of testing scenarios which might be required under Tier 3 are cited in &sect;79.54 in the accompanying regulatory text. Where possible, existing standard guidelines for these tests are referenced. It should be recognized, however, that such guidelines might need to be revised to accommodate emission inhalation requirements and/or to evaluate certain structures or functions which the current guidelines do not adequately address. Study parameters which might require modification include exposure routes and concentrations, species selection, number of animal subjects, examination procedures and frequencies, and analytic requirements. Furthermore, interim advances in the underlying science and testing technology may provide superior approaches which could be available for use by the time Tier 3 requirements are implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Special Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following sections describe special provisions included in the F/FA registration program to avoid duplication of effort, to alleviate the financial impact on small businesses, and to ease the burdens of the program on the regulated industry in general.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Experimental F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requested comments on the possibility of providing a temporary program exemption or deferment for experimental F/FAs. Eligibility for this special provision was to be limited to unregistered products (i.e., F/FAs which are not registered as of the effective date of this final rule) or registered products that had not been placed into wholesale or retail commerce prior to promulgation of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

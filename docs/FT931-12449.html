			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / US-EC clash over steel trade: British Steel hit by 109% duty  -Clinton angers trading partners THE NEW Clinton admin-istration and its largest trading partners, including the European Community, became embroiled in their first trade conflict last night when the US Commerce Department imposed stiff dumping duties on carbon steel products from 19 countries. The highest tariff - 109.22 per cent - has been levied on steel plate exported by British Steel. The EC attacked the decision, describing it as unwarranted and heavy-handed. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said he would raise the matter urgently in talks early next month in the US with Mr Mickey Kantor, the Clinton administration's trade representative. The action, Sir Leon, said was 'particularly unfortunate and inopportune at the beginning of a new US administration'. Japanese steel makers said they were surprised by the US decision and denied that they had been dumping steel in the US, where their market share has been in decline. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo said it was concerned that protectionist moves by the US could disrupt the international steel market. In an effort to defuse a potentially explosive trade conflict so early in the Clinton adminis-tration's term, Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, coupled the announcement with a statement distancing himself from the findings that steel was being dumped. 'They are not policy statements' although they are 'mandated procedures and are the result of exhaustive investigations', he said. Steel is the first in a queue of potentially serious trade conflicts between the US and the EC which includes vehicle imports, oil, aviation services and government procurement. Several powerful US industrial lobbies expect the Clinton administration to act more firmly than President George Bush in defence of US interests, and against 'unfair trade' by foreign competitors. The 19 countries affected are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden. Besides British Steel, the highest penalties - to be paid in the form of cash deposits or bonds equal to estimated 'dumping margins' - will be levied on companies in Brazil, Spain, Poland, Romania, Canada, Italy and Finland, and range from 109 per cent to 53.37 per cent. Mr Phil Wolfinden, for British Steel, said the company's sales of steel plate in 1991 totalled only 35,000 tonnes, less than 0.7 per cent of the US market. 'Our view is that the US steel industry's problems are not best served by the imposition of discriminatory and wholesale trade actions, which is how it looks from here,' he said. The anti-dumping duties are particularly resented by producers because they cover the period during which the EC and other steel exporters operated under a global 'voluntary' restraints agreement with the US. Sir Leon said EC steel producers had 'scrupulously respected' this agreement, which ran for 10 years until last March. 'The US wants two bites at the cherry . . . and is therefore breaking the spirit of its previous agreement with the Community,' The US move comes at a sensitive period when the Commission is leading efforts to cut capacity in the European steel industry amid falling prices and a flood of cheap imports from eastern Europe. A preliminary review is expected next week. Asked if the US action might encourage the EC to approve more state aid to its steel industry, a spokesman said: 'We will defend the Community steel industry.' Canada is expected to act against US steel producers tomorrow when Ottawa announces preliminary determinations against imports of cold-rolled steel from five countries, including the US. BHP, Australia's largest steel company, expressed 'supreme surprise' at being targeted. The group, which faces tariffs of up to 21.47 per cent, promised to defend itself 'most vigorously'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Asked to comment on U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's remarks describing the Greek measures against  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as  harsh and excessive, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos  said experience has shown that reasons may be misinterpreted.  Therefore, Greece had to express its views with actions. The  United States, the United Nations, and our allies must realize  that [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's government should be  pressured.    Venizelos added: Recent experience has proved that Skopje  misinterpreted the U.S. recognition, with Gligorov's letter to  U.S. President Bill Clinton being the most obvious example. The  spokesman said: All of these things forced Greece to adopt  these specific measures, although with a delay because it  expected its partners to put pressure on the neighboring state.  Venizelos said: With these measures, we expect to go stronger  into a dialogue under UN auspices    Asked to comment on the U.S. secretary of state's insistence  on calling Skopje Macedonia, Venizelos said: Christopher  probably does not remember that his government recognized  Gligorov's state a week ago under the name FYROM.</p>

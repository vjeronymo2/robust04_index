			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pegasus declines sharply to Pounds 620,000 PEGASUS Group has reported a sharp fall in profits and turnover, after a period of boardroom turmoil and depressed activity. In the 17 months to December 31 1992, the USM-quoted designer of accounting software recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 620,000, down from Pounds 1.51m in the year ended July 1991. Figures for the previous period were restated to comply with FRS3 accounting standard. Earnings per share were 7.7p basic (18.1p) and 7.3p fully diluted. The proposed final dividend is 2p (8.6p), payable July 10, for a 9p (12.1p) total. The latest pre-tax profit of Pounds 620,000 was after Pounds 297,000 of net interest income, a Pounds 1.27m gain on part-sale of a subsidiary, Pounds 369,000 write-off of assets and Pounds 646,000 for redundancies and extensive board changes. Continuing activities fell from an operating profit of Pounds 1.6m on turnover of Pounds 8.15m to a loss of Pounds 140,000 on Pounds 9m, while acquisitions added Pounds 126,000 of profits on Pounds 1.27m in the latest period. The results were not as bad as some analysts had feared, and its share price gained 5p, closing at 160p. Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, chief executive, said the launch later this year of Version 6 of Pegasus Senior, the company's core product, offered 'a solid basis for recovery'. Pegasus was also pioneering a new integrated management information system, Sequel, but was aiming to simplify its overall business and product range. Pegasus's market share in the modular accounting market remained stable at 36 per cent by volume. Mr Hubbard-Ford, reinstated as chief executive in a boardroom coup in December promoted by institutional investors, promised 'stability and consolidation'. All but one of the current directors joined the board in December 1992, when Mr Philip Sellers took over as non-executive chairman in place of Mr Derek Moon.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Exchange warned on Cadbury THE Stock Exchange should do more to enforce the code of practice proposed by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, the deputy president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has warned. Mr Roger Lawson, speaking at the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business conference in Bristol at the weekend, said he was personally 'disappointed' in the attitude of the Stock Exchange. He said the exchange had indicated that it was not willing to threaten to de-list quoted companies that failed to abide by the code. He said that Cadbury was a 'missed opportunity' as companies operating honourably were abiding by guidelines similar to those proposed, while others would always find ways round them.</p>

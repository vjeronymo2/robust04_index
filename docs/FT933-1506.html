			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: French retailing group in sharp six-month fall PINAULT-PRINTEMPS, the French retailing and distribution group, yesterday announced net profits of FFr189m (Dollars 33m) in the first six months of the year, a sharp fall from the FFr330m reported in the first half of 1992. The company, which includes the Printemps department stores and the Conforama furniture chain, also suffered a decline in operating income, from FFr1.38bn to FFr938m in the first half. Sales fell from FFr35.38bn to FFr30.88bn. The group described 1993 as a difficult year as a result of the recession in France. However, it said that retail operations had shown strong resistance to the economic climate and forecast an operating profit of more than FFr2bn for the year as a whole. Pinault-Printemps said that financial charges had remained relatively stable during the period. The company forecast that its debt would be reduced to FFr13bn by the end of the year because of an estimated FFr5bn in receipts from disposals. With respect to business strategy, the company said it would continue to focus on core activities and to reduce group debts. The sale of CICA, its car distribution business, to Jardine Matheson, earlier this month was described as an important step in this process. The group denied it was considering a sale of Prisunic, its food retailing operation, but a spokesman said the company was examining the possibility of an alliance with 'a large distribution group' in the sector to strengthen its food purchasing operations.</p>

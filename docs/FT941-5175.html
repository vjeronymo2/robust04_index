			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Arts: Dali, the myth unmasked - A revealing exhibition at the Hayward Gallery Salvador Dali: The Early Years is one of those comparatively rare exhibitions which properly challenges one's established view of its subject, and does so positively. If it does nothing for Dali the older man - that is to say Dali the poseur, self-publicist, self-mythologiser - it makes him, at least at first, more interesting, substantial and credible a figure. He was born at Figueres in Catalonia in 1904 and died not far away, at the little port of Cadaques, in 1989. This exhibition leaves us with Dali in 1931, at the age of 27 just teasing himself into his mature persona as an artist and on the brink of his brilliant, preposterous career. Of all the artists of our century, he alone stands with Picasso, the patronymic alone enough to summon up the very idea of modern art to a popular public, innocent of Matisse or Pollock or Andy Warhol. Yet while Picasso, for all his fame, remains still to a great extent an object of controversy and scepticism, Dali has always been truly popular, accepted and familiar quite as much in his work as in his gleefully public personality. Such is the nature of true celebrity, and it says a great deal indeed for the imaginative power of Surrealism that Dali should still be every schoolboy's favourite modern artist. Oh yes: but then, you say, he was always so brilliant a draughtsman and so wonderfully meticulous a painter. Just look at that immaculate technique, those soft watches and flaming giraffes, and that vertiginous Christ on the Cross. Clearly he was a genius, whatever that is, and we do respect a genius. Such is the myth of himself that Dali was so assiduous in promoting, and is here so usefully exploded. What we discover is no precocious and preternatural talent, but only a normally interested and sensitive, if unacademic, adolescent. Far from demonstrating any exceptional ability, the pages shown here of schoolboy illustration, based on the graphic conventions of contemporary comic journals, show the difficulty he had with anything but grotesque distortion and exaggeration - the staple of every school magazine there ever was. But the interest is certainly there, as well as a certain inventive energy and ambition. So from the schoolboy to the student painter at the local art school in Figueres, and again we find at first nothing exceptional, the work being fairly standard student stuff. Sometimes it is clumsy and ill-formed, but intelligent and engaged in its response to impressionism and symbolism and the more decorative aspects of expressionism. He begins to write a novel. He paints a number of self-portraits, romantic, self-dramatising images, long hair, broad hat, pipe in mouth, as moody as only a self-conscious 17-year-old can be. At 18 he wins a place at the Academy of Fine Art in Madrid, where he spends the next four years, for one of which he is rusticated for riotous indiscipline. And now emerges not yet the brilliant artist, but certainly the brilliant student. In a remarkable sequence of paintings we follow him as he comes to terms with the currency of the international avant-garde. He does so not with any profound originality, but with a steadiness and intelligence that does him credit. The paradox is that in his unselfconsciousness he is never less than true to himself. Picasso is his commanding interest at this time, and Picasso in all his aspects - cubist, proto-surrealist, the neo-classicist of the nudes on the beach and the realist of the portraits of his wife. And yet Dali is also looking elsewhere, and in a remarkable painting of a basket of bread, of 1926, the year of his final expulsion from the Madrid Academy, he pays direct homage to the great Spanish realist tradition and to Zurbaran in particular. He also looks to the modern Italian metafisici, to de Chirico, Sironi and, in one huge schematic still-life especially, to Carra. Most impressive of all are the portraits and figures - his sister, Anna Maria, at Cadaques; a girl in a white dress that may well be her, seen from behind; his father. All are solid, simple and unaffected in their realisation, rich in the paint and bold in the drawing, and yet seen with that febrile clarity that already hints at the obsessively microscopic precision of the work to come. And then, from around 1927, begins the slide, slow at first but speeding up over the next few years, into the mannerism, self-consciousness and formulaic eccentricity alike of imagery as of behaviour, upon which his global reputation still rests. Other surrealists, such as Bunuel, with whom Dali was associated, stand as considerable artists by the work they did. But for Dali it was the open embrace of Surrealism that did for him, with its essentially arbitrary and literary imagery, and infinite scope for more of the self-indulgent same, and same again. The irony is only that it was Dali the student who was the more interesting and truer artist.

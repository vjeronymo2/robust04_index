			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish on  4 March carries a 725-word report by Eva Lozano Estrella  entitled "Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] Postpones Sale of  Petrochemical Plants Due to Crisis in Sector."    The report begins by saying that "Pemex announced on 3 March  that the drop in the price of hydrocarbons on the international  market does not create the right conditions for the federal  government to place pretrochemical plants on sale this year."    The report adds that "Pemex believes in 1994 the oil sector  in general will experience the worst period in recent history  and predicts that both prices and profitability in the sector  could be even lower due to the high surplus already in existence  in international supplies, which will lower the final value of  plants."    Therefore, the report notes, "the government has decided  that  the privatization of the state-run petrochemical industry will  be the responsibility of the next government, as an increase in  the price of goods and services is expected by 1995."    After analyzing possible strategies Pemex could follow to  improve its financial situation, the article says government  officials have said "investments in the petrochemical sector  will continue normally," adding that "investments along the  lines of 135 million new pesos are planned this year, part of  which will be channeled to strategic projects."    Finally, the report cites official sources saying that "an  increase in the import of petrochemical products reflects a  tendency in world trade, as countries like Germany, the United  States, Japan, and France have become large importers even  though they are also the largest producers."</p>

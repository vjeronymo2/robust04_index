			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cashing in on conservation - Vardon's purchase of the Gweek Seal Sanctuary THERE are no fruit machines or fairground rides at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary on the banks of the Helford river at Gweek. But there are paying visitors - 200,000 of them a year, spending almost Pounds 1m between them. Last week, Vardon, the leisure group which owns the London Dungeon, the York Dungeon and the Sea Life Centres and which obtained a Stock Exchange listing in October, paid Pounds 1.8m to acquire the sanctuary. The deal highlights the increasing interest being shown by leisure companies in conservation which, in turn, reflects growing public concern about the environment and environmental issues. There is also a greater realism among some conservationists who appreciate that a commercial partnership can help provide a more stable financial framework for their operations. For example, London Zoo's latest survival plan, also unveiled last week, emphasises its research, breeding and conservation work in an attempt to attract visitors rather than the old Victorian-style menagerie concept. The Cornish Seal Sanctuary was founded by Mr Ken Jones, a former coal miner who in the mid-1950s ran a beach cafe at St Agnes on Cornwall's north coast. One day he found an injured baby seal pup and decided to nurse it back to health. The sanctuary started from there. Mr Jones continued to build on the work of the sanctuary, caring for injured and abandoned animals, but eventually outgrew his beach cafe site. So in the early 1970s, against considerable local opposition, he obtained permission to build the present sanctuary on a 35-acre site on the banks of the Helford in south-west Cornwall. The new centre was opened in 1975 and subsequently expanded through a Pounds 750,000 building programme to include a visitors' centre, cinema, aquarium, fully-equipped hospital, five seal pools and an exhibition about the effects of pollution. Most of the funding for the sanctuary was provided by Mr Jones himself, or from visitors' donations and a 25p entrance fee. However, in 1990 Mr Jones sold the sanctuary to a group of local and West Country investors and retired, something he now deeply regrets because of his fears that it has become too commercialised. When he heard a week ago that Vardon had approached the Seal Sanctuary with a view to buying it, he tried to raise the money to buy it back himself, but had insufficient time to do so. Since he sold his interest, the sanctuary has been run on a commercial basis by Seal Sanctuary Plc, although most visitors might not have realised it had switched from an amateur, charitable organisation to a business footing. Indeed, the sanctuary's new commercial owners did little to advertise their presence. Visitor literature and notices around the sanctuary thank customers for their 'support' and still invite donations. The fences surrounding the seal pools are covered with the names of families and children who have financially sponsored or adopted a seal. It is a moot point whether these funds would have been so available had the donors appreciated the changed status of the sanctuary. Today, the sanctuary charges an entry fee of Pounds 2.50 for adults and Pounds 1.50 for children. On Sundays, more than 1,000 people visit the attraction. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 124,000 after paying Pounds 251,000 in interest and non-recurring charges. Nevertheless, the sanctuary performs a vital conservation function. There are only an estimated 100,000 Atlantic Grey Seals in the world and two thirds of them are found around the coast of Britain. Until they were protected, the population was declining and only about 400 are thought to remain around Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The conservation work undertaken by the Gweek sanctuary will mesh closely with the work of the Sea Life Centres which Vardon acquired in October. Sea Life operates seven wholly owned and one 50 per cent owned centres around Britain. It is building another in Southend and one in Scheveningen, Holland. Despite the recession, in the year to December 31 the centres posted a profit of Pounds 2.15m, a 19 per cent increase on the previous year. The Sea Life Centre at Oban, in Scotland, already operates a scaled-down version of Gweek's rescue facilities. Volunteers from both Oban and Gweek worked together on a seal rescue programme in the wake of the Braer oil-spill in the Shetlands. All the centres have rescue and rehabilitation facilities and operate their own successful environmental programme called 'Sea Watch'. Mr David Mace, Sea Life's founder and managing director, says Vardon plans to open two new centres a year. However, as a marine biologist, he is also sensitive to the concerns of those who fear that conservation and commercial interests do not mix. He says: 'We are certainly not going to change the sanctuary's aims and ambitions'. He adds that conservation will continue to be pursued with 'vigour'. And already, the sanctuary's new owners have moved to reassure other sceptics like Mr Jones. 'They have told me they will run it the right way. I hope they will, but we will keep an eye on them,' he says.</p>

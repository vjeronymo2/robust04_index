			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 15 (BTA) -- Today parliament elected  Kiril Tsochev deputy prime minister and minister of trade, by  117 to 6 out of the 123 MP's in the 240-seat parliament present,  accepting Valentin Karabashev's resignation submitted on April  28. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) did not  take part in the vote. According to the parliamentary rules of  procedure, the proposed cabinet changes are considered accepted  by a simple majority of 50 percent plus one of the voting MP's.  "I will protect Bulgaria's interests," was the only thing Mr.  Tsochev when he was sworn in. Mr. Tsochev, former chief  executive of Electroimpex and president of the Bulgarian Chamber  of Commerce and Industry, now is the manager of a private  consultancy firm. Interviewed by a private radio station a  month ago, Mr. Tsochev said that though his business was good,  he was ready to work in the executive branch. Kiril Tsochev's  candidature was supported by the formerly Communist Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP).    "The cabinet's term in office is limited, its life is only  two or three months, that is why I'm making just the minimum  necessary changes," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said, presenting  Mr. Tsochev's candidature.    Kiril Tsochev, a diplomaed engineer who later took a  postgraduate course in foreign trade, was born in 1947. He  speaks English and Russian. He worked as an electrical  engineer, then as director of Energoproekt and Electroimpex, and  as a commercial representative in Tokyo. Since April 1992 he is  president of the Mikra private firm. He chairs the  Bulgarian-Japanese Economic Committee. He is married and has  two children.    The parliamentary group of the SDS, which has been  boycotting  the parliamentary sittings for some time now, today appeared in  the plenary room to take part in the debate and the vote on the  cabinet changes. Its floor leader Stefan Savov's motion for an  open vote was defeated by the Socialist MP's and the MP's of the  ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS). The  incumbent cabinet was formed on the DPS mandate. Although they  had the right to discuss the changes and ask the candidate  questions, the MP's directly proceeded with the ballot.    "Mr. Tsochev will not be able to do anything in two or three  months' time," ex-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade  Valentin Karabashev said in the lobbies of parliament. He  resigned because of the differences he had with Prime Minister  Berov on the mass privatization policy.    The Socialists, who asked the prime minister for structural  and personnel cabinet changes in order to give him their  support, now appeared to believe that this sole change was  enough. "Any changes are pointless, given that there will  probably be early elections in autumn," BSP leader Zhan Videnov  told a news briefing yesterday.</p>

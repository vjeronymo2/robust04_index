			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: EVERYTHING'S BIGGER IN MOVIES  </P> <P> Oops! Not all creative accounting in the motion picture industry is  premeditated, as followers of Cineplex Odeon Corp. have discovered.  </P> <P> Toronto security analysts recently asked the movie and theater company why its  1988 annual report alludes to tax-loss carryforwards of $100 million at the end  of 1987, when the annual report for that year said the sum was a mere $15  million.  </P> <P> No explanation for the $85-million discrepancy was offered in the latest annual  report. But Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky solved the mystery with a  shrug. The lower number, he said, was just a "typographical error."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Toons Baking Well  </P> <P> Melissa Thomas is looking for her fortune in cookies, and Cruella, Dumbo and  Snow White are showing her the way. Slowly. A junior at the University of  Southern California, she is the first person to receive a license from Walt  Disney Co. to put Disney characters on cookies. She has them baked in Seattle  in three-inch, white-cake circles, then iced with a hard, shiny glaze that  includes a remarkably colorful portrait of a character. The marketing major  said she has sold 50,000 around the country so far to movie theaters, which  sell them for 75 cents to $1.25 each. That's a good start, she thinks -- but  not enough to repay the $10,000 she borrowed from her family to get started in  business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Century City: Seat of Suitors  </P> <P> Rival suitors for Northwest Airlines -- billionaire oilman Marvin Davis and  investor Alfred Checchi -- are far from strangers. The two are master-minding  their separate takeover bids from offices just two floors apart in Fox Plaza,  the same Century City high-rise where former President Reagan conducts  business. Fox Plaza is owned by media mogul Rupert Murdock, who bought it from  Davis in 1985. Joked one Davis acquaintance, "Too bad he didn't wire it for  sound."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tailored to the Early Bird  </P> <P> Here's a case of the early bird getting the pinstripes.  </P> <P> Richard E. Sherwood, a prominent Los Angeles lawyer with the firm of O'Melveny  &amp; Myers, had a problem. He liked shopping at Carroll &amp; Co., a  traditional men's clothier on North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. But he felt  guilty leaving his busy practice in midday to go browsing.  </P> <P> When Richard Carroll, founder and owner of the 40-year-old store, heard  Sherwood's lament, he leaped into action. Starting Tuesday, the retailer will  open his doors at 8 a.m. weekdays instead of the usual 9:30.  </P> <P> "We think we're the first to do it," he said, acknowledging that "logistically,  it's a very big problem for us" because of the need to schedule extra tailors  and an early shift of salespeople. "I don't know how cost-effective it will  be," Carroll said. "I don't know if anybody will come in to buy anything, but a  lot of people will come in to get things fixed and have a cup of coffee."  That's coffee and two button-down shirts to go, please.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Students of Capitalism  </P> <P> The U.S. economy may face challenges from overseas, but foreign students still  flock here to learn the ABCs of capitalism.  </P> <P> Students from Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, France, Nigeria and other countries are  most likely to major in business and management while in American colleges,  according to a recent study by the National Science Foundation. In contrast,  engineering is the first choice of students from India, Iran, Taiwan, Malaysia  and South Korea.  </P> <P> Taiwan -- with 25,660 students in U.S. classrooms -- was the leading source of  foreign scholars here in 1986, followed by Malaysia, China and South Korea.  </P></p>

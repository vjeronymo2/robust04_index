[passage omitted]    During this inspection, he talked about future rural work.  He said: While the planned economy is transforming into a  market economy, our future rural work should focus on increasing  peasants' income. The peasants should be encouraged to make  every possible effort to increase their incomes. There is a  need to continue to adjust the production structure. In the  course of grain production, the acreage of crops should be  expanded. Efforts should be focused on comprehensive  agricultural development to improve agricultural production  capacity. In rural areas, township and town enterprises should  be developed and development projects should be selected in line  with local conditions. [passage omitted]    On how to expedite the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, Governor Tian Chengping said: We should  concentrate our efforts on studying the actual situation and  seek the main factors favorable to the formation of markets.

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOSCO TECH TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> LANCERS FALL AFTER SHOTS DON'T, 82-76  </P> <P> Chris Loll rolled toward the hoop on a breakaway in the first quarter of  Thousand Oaks High's championship quarterfinal game of the Bosco Tech  tournament Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Cruising toward the basket down the left flank, the 6-foot-5 forward cocked the  ball in his left hand as he considered whether he wanted to attempt a dunk or  kiss the ball off the glass.  </P> <P> His indecision forced him to settle for something in between, a half-dash dunk  that barely crawled over the lip of the rim and rattled through.  </P> <P> There would be darn few good rolls for Loll or Thousand Oaks thereafter,  however, as the Lancers were held to a season-low point total in an 82-76 loss  to Downey at Bosco Tech High in Rosemead.  </P> <P> "It definitely wasn't pretty when we shot the ball," Thousand Oaks Coach Ed  Chevalier said.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks (4-1) will face Hoover tonight at 8:30 in a fifth-place  semifinal.  </P> <P> The Lancers, who entered the game averaging 89.5 points a game, jumped to a  19-8 lead after one quarter. From then on, though, Downey offered no quarter  and the Lancers couldn't heave a dime in the ocean.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the shooting was the problem, Chevalier said as he perused a rather  sobering team statistics sheet. "And it was a collective effort."  </P> <P> Other than Loll, who came within one point of his season average by scoring a  game-high 25 points, Thousand Oaks threw up a thousand bricks. The Lancers made  just 28 of 73 field-goal attempts (38.3%) and were held to one field goal over  the first 5 minutes 38 seconds of the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks led, 37-31, at halftime before Downey's tandem of Ron Brown and  Stieve Boyd took over.  </P> <P> Brown, a 6-foot-3, 255-pound forward who definitely will not be confused with  the National Football League speedster of the same name, scored a team-high 22  points off the bench for Downey (5-2), including 14 in the second half.  </P> <P> "Their big guys took over and ours didn't respond," Chevalier said. "Our inside  play is crucial to any success we're going to have."  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks starting center Dusty Lysobey had 11 points and reserve center  Shane Graham had three.  </P> <P> "I think their big guys came to play," Loll said.  </P> <P> Ditto the little dudes.  </P> <P> Downey made a head-spinning 21 of 29 shots (72.4%) from the field in the second  half and quickly pulled even.  </P> <P> The Vikings scored on nine of their first 11 field-goal attempts after halftime  and took a 49-48 lead with 3:15 left in the third quarter. Boyd, a 5-11 guard,  scored 10 of his 18 points in the third quarter, which ended with Downey  holding a 55-54 lead.  </P> <P> The fourth quarter was misery in microcosm for Thousand Oaks, which was  outscored, 9-1, before the Lancers called a timeout with 5:52 to play.  </P> <P> The T.O. T.O. didn't help sway the momentum a bit.  </P> <P> "As the game went on, Downey started to gain confidence," Chevalier said. "And  we lost ours."  </P> <P> The Lancers didn't score from the field in the quarter until Andrew Borg scored  on a layin with 4:05 left to bring Thousand Oaks within 68-60.  </P> <P> Borg and backcourt mate Brian Capella, who entered the game averaging 10.3 and  14.8 points, were held to five and seven points, respectively.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks resorted to fouling as the game wore down and closed to within  76-70 when Loll scored inside with 1:02 left. Downey's Mark Rand made both ends  of a one-and-one opportunity with one minute left to give the Vikings an  eight-point lead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In other quarterfinal games:  </P> <P> Burbank 65, West Torrance 57 (2 OTs) -- Jon Warner scored a team-high 19 points  to lead Burbank (4-4) into a semifinal-round game Friday night at 7:30.  </P> <P> Burbank will play the winner of today's game between Eagle Rock and El Modena.  </P> <P> With 19 seconds left in the second overtime, Burbank's Spencer Klocki made both  ends of a one-and-one opportunity to give Burbank a 63-55 lead.  </P> <P> Mike Palaski scored 18 points for Burbank and made five of seven free throws in  overtime.  </P> <P> Long Beach Poly 71, Hoover 47 -- Junior center Gabe Alvarado had 17 points to  lead the Tornadoes. Ten of his points came in the first half and helped Hoover  to a 27-23 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> But Long Beach Poly tied the score at the start of the second half and broke  open the game midway through the third quarter with an 11-0 run.  </P> <P> Hoover's strategy of packing five players into the key and begging Poly (7-2)  to shoot from the outside worked -- for half the game.  </P> <P> Hoover led by four at halftime as Poly was ice cold from the perimeter.  </P> <P> In the second half, however, Poly poured it on and poured it in. The  Jackrabbits outscored Hoover, 20-6, in the first six minutes of the third  quarter and led, 47-36, entering the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Poly's third-quarter run was led by Tyus Edney, a 5-11 senior point guard who  has signed a letter of intent to play next season at UCLA. Edney scored nine of  his team-high 18 points in the quarter.  </P> <P> Junior guard Dave Ulloa added 11 points for Hoover.  </P></p>

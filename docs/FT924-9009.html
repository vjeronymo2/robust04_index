			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Philosopher who found a silver lining - A woman who found she had a knack for working with silver PHILIPPA Merriman taught philosophy at Keele to a jeweller who had no grant to cover his studies. 'I saw him all right for books,' she says, 'and he taught me the basics of his trade. I always reckoned I got the best of the deal.' She was not particularly interested in jewellery, but says: 'I realised fairly early on that I have a feeling for silver. I moved towards things that people hold, and that led to table pieces.' She is from a family of engineers and was fascinated by the working tools available. 'I learned much of what I know by reading the tool catalogues. I'd once toyed with the idea of being a dentist and dealing with the precision tools.' Now she works as a silversmith which, after philosophy and probation work, is her third career. She was a probation officer for 16 years. 'I think there's a limit to how long you can be a practising social worker,' she says. 'It's quite stressful and it's rapidly changing.' She has been selling her silverware since 1985 when a confident friend from New York told her she should. She marched into a store on Madison Avenue and displayed it. 'They referred me to another store. So the first collection I made was for a store on Madison Avenue. That began to convince me that silver was the right thing to do. It was not just my friends being polite.' She has a university job, sorting out placements for social-work students. But she borrowed from the bank to make silverware her main business last year when she set up a partnership with Janet Ford, also embarking on a third career after medical physics and running a victim-support scheme. Janet is a woodworker, and both have workshops in the Merrimans' big old house on Lancaster Marsh. Philippa's husband, Dr Marcus Merriman, is a senior lecturer at Lancaster University. The combination of silver and wood gives Philippa and Janet a market niche and also enables them to fight the recession by making items more cheaply, since wood is a cheaper material. 'When Liberty's is saying that the optimum price per item is about Pounds 30, that really makes it very difficult,' says Philippa. 'We make wooden bowls with silver decoration, silver serving pieces with wooden handles. We have moved into silly things like dice with silver spots. We have some wood and silver cutlery which is very popular. A number of people are prepared to fork out Pounds 450 for a place setting. 'There are one or two things that go and go: silver chopsticks with wooden knobs, tea strainers, salt dishes. What tends to happen is that people say: 'That's nice. I would like it done a bit differently'. 'It has been stimulating working with somebody else. Sitting by yourself can get tiresome.' They do not need to keep a stock of silver because they can get an order delivered within 24 hours; but they have to keep some completed work to show clients. 'We're stuck between two stools. We want to get rid of our work as quickly as possible but we need something to show people.' They have found four stores in New York that sell their products, one each in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Edinburgh, two or three in London. Philippa is making a plate for the National Silver Collection, which supplies British embassies. Merriman reckons that they can only make goods worth about Pounds 30,000 in a year without going over to factory methods 'and that is not what either of us gave up our other jobs for.' They were going on nicely until, a few months ago, one or two customers went out of business, owing them money. 'Janet has been our salvation with wood because it cuts down the cost of materials. We are able to produce things of good design and quality and individuality and within a price range that seems acceptable at the moment. 'We are hanging in, waiting for better times.' Philippa Merriman, Westfield House, West Road, Lancaster LA1 5PE (0524-382323).</p>

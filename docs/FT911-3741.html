			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Abta warns of delay in refunds when tour companies collapse SCHOOLS which had booked holidays through companies that later collapsed may have to wait up to three months for a refund, according to the Association of British Travel Agents. Mr David Hurst, Abta's head of public affairs, said schools should apply to Abta for their money and then book their trips again, rather than assign their refunds to other companies. Some schools are confused about how to respond to other companies, some non-Abta, offering to take over trips which had been booked with failed operators. Abta has so far received 200 claims from customers of Adventure Travel International (ATI), which ceased trading at the end of March, and a similar number for Adventure Express, an un-related company which has also ceased trading. The failure of Sun Living, a school tours group that went into liquidation in February, has led to 1,000 claims. The Earl of Scarborough High School at Skegness, Lincolnshire, has been caught in the failures of two tour companies since February, and is awaiting more than Pounds 20,000 in refunds from Abta. ATI's receiver has written a letter saying the school remains 'principally liable' for a further Pounds 7,625. According to Abta, the school will eventually receive its refund and should not have to pay anything to the receiver. Mr Jim Whittaker, the school's headmaster, said he planned to veto future group holidays. The school had booked three holidays with Sun Living. Within an hour of the announcement that the company had collapsed, Mr Whittaker received a call from ATI offering to take over the planned trips on identical terms and without further payment. With one group due to leave at the end of that week, Mr Whittaker instructed Abta to pay the refund direct to ATI. Although the holiday took place, it was 'substantially defective', he said. The other two parties never boarded their coaches. In spite of its previous undertaking, Mr Whittaker said, ATI asked for additional cash if the trips were to proceed. He had to get an emergency payment of Pounds 13,066 from Lincolnshire County Council. Mr Whittaker said ATI assured him on March 28 that the groups would leave the next day as planned. He learned three hours later that the company had ceased trading. 'We have incurred considerable administrative costs in organising holidays and dealing with cancellations for which there is no compensation,' Mr Whittaker said .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jalal al-Mashtah: "Russia Agrees To Write Off 80 </F> Percent of Syria's Debts"]    [Text] Moscow -- AL-HAYAH learned yesterday that Moscow has  agreed to write off 80-90 percent of the debts Damascus owes to  it. Gulf states will pay the remaining sums, provided that $500  million worth of Russian military equipment is purchased and  paid for in cash.    A source close to the premiership office told AL-HAYAH that  an agreement to this effect was reached during the recent visit  to Damascus by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and  head of the military-industrial complex in Russia.    AL-HAYAH has learned that the agreement, whose details have  not been revealed, stipulates Russia's agreement to write off  80-90 percent of the debts accumulating from previous contracts  with the Soviet Union and then Russia. These debts are  estimated at more than $10 billion. Two Gulf states are  expected to pay the remaining sum, which it is believed will be  transferred to the Central Bank of Russia, which will finance  the purchase of Syrian commodities to be exported to Russia as a  means of paying the debts.    It has also been learned that the agreement provides for the  purchase of military equipment worth $500 million to be paid to  Russia in cash. Moscow considered this step "a new chapter" in  relations between the two countries. Details of the military  agreement have not been revealed. However, it is understood  that Moscow "took account" of concerns conveyed to President  Boris Yeltsin by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who urged  the Russians not to sell to Damascus aircraft the Israelis  regard as "a disruption of the security balance."    It is also understood that the Russians pledged not to  implement previous contracts, especially with regard to  exporting spare parts for weapons the former Soviet Union had  supplied to the Syrians.    A Russian expert familiar with details of the agreement  stressed that it could cause "embarrassment" for Moscow when  dealing with other indebted countries. He mentioned in  particular Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. He said that these countries  could demand a similar treatment and the writing off of part of  their debts, which he estimated at about $20 billion.</p>

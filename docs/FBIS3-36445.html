In his opinion, "people are unlikely to  be persuaded to support even Boris Yeltsin," it should have done  two years ago. As Poltoranin remarked in an interview with  Interfax on Friday, "the last coach of this train has already  gone."    Nonetheless, he urged setting up a formidable democratic  party, which, as he believes, could comprise not only "Russia's  Choice" but also Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's bloc, the Unity and  Concord Party, and the "Democratic Russia" movement.    "We need to nominate for the next presidential elections a  single candidate capable of rallying the people around him,"  Poltoranin stressed. However, he declined to name such a  nominee and only said that "a few candidates are being  considered."    He also voiced fear that during the debate over the  president's amnesty decree the leftists would secure the legal  release from Lefortovo prison of ex-Vice President Aleksandr  Rutskoy and nominate him for the Russian presidency in 1996.    He recalled in this connection that the democrats did not  have a stable majority in the Duma and for this reason  participants in the October events in Moscow had a chance of  getting on the list of persons subject to pardon.    Poltoranin thinks it's possible for Rutskoy to collect  enough  votes at elections as "Russia loves martyrs."</p>

Had the bomb exploded, it would have caused significant damage.  Police spokesmen indicated that the attack was aborted as a  result of capturing six subversives who were preparing a 20-kg  bomb a short distance from the building where the Florencia  justice courts operate. Florencia is the capital of Caqueta  Department.    The guerrillas, apparently Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia members, were captured after the police defused a car  bomb at the airport in the southwestern city of Cali last night.  According to General Jose Reyes, commander of Cali's  metropolitan police, the car bomb, manufactured with 14 kg of  dynamite, was parked near the "Alfonso Bonilla Aragaon" airport  by urban guerrilla cells.    Beginning a month ago, subversive groups increased their  terrorist actions to impede next Sunday's parliamentary  elections, specifically by kidnapping mayors and congressional  candidates, ambushing soldiers and police, and attacking towns.</p>

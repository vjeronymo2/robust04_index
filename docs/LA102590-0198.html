			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC PULLS PLUG ON 'HULL HIGH'  </P> <P> "Hull High," one of the two new musical series on network television this fall,  has been canceled, NBC confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Disney-produced show became the second series to be canned this season.  </P> <P> CBS had previously canceled the drama "E.A.R.T.H. Force" while also placing the  comedy "Lenny" on hiatus.  </P> <P> "Hull High," which had primarily employed non-singing actors who lip-synced the  musical numbers, ranked 86th among the 98 prime-time series that have been on  the four networks this season. The show had been cursed with the 7 p.m. Sunday  time slot against CBS' perennial ratings champ, "60 Minutes."  </P> <P> A permanent replacement was not immediately named. This Sunday, NBC will move  the medical series "Lifestories" to 7 p.m. and air "Sunday Night With Larry  King," a celebrity special, at 8 p.m. On Nov. 4, the network will broadcast  "The Story Behind the Story" at 7 p.m. and move "Lifestories" back to its  regular 8 p.m. slot.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the other musical series, ABC's "Cop Rock," continues to flounder in  the ratings as well. Airing Wednesdays at 10 p.m., the singing cop show is the  74th-rated series so far this year, averaging only a 14% share of the audience  on one of ABC's best-rated nights. STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

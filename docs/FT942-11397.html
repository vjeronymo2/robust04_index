			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (25): Focusing on official funding - Multilateral aid for technical assistance projects in areas such as the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe offer considerable opportunities for international consultants / Consultancy contracts Multilateral development agencies are a critical source of funding in regions where commercial finance is difficult to obtain. Technical assistance (TA) is a vital component of the multilaterals' operations, generating an annual volume of financing estimated at Dollars 12-15bn by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). TA provides support for physical investment and for the institutional development the World Bank and other agencies now see as their priority. 'We bid all the time for World Bank contracts and try to get our pricing right,' says the operations manager of a leading French company. 'What we are finding is we must also try to understand the wider developmental context, to meet the more refined requirements now demanded by agencies.' The World Bank calls TA for infrastructure contracts 'hard technical assistance'. The bank's Annual Report 1993 says that 'almost all investment projects now contain a technical-assistance component for institutional-related issues.' This links conventional project finance with 'soft TA' support for institutional reform. Projects are increasingly being structured to mix hard and soft TA, according to the World Bank. Thus in Laos, hard TA, to provide computerised planning for rural electrification, was coupled with soft TA for training in accounting systems and financial systems for the state power company. Countries with a hard TA tradition of consultant engineers and strong financial sectors to exploit the newer soft TA opportunities dominate the market. World Bank data shows that in the year to 30 June 1993, US companies were paid Dollars 108m, French firms Dollars 92m and those from the UK Dollars 91m for consultancy orders financed by the bank. The US took 16.1 per cent of total consultancy contract payments worth Dollars 672m. German and Japanese consultants received payments of Dollars 49m and Dollars 29ms respectively in fiscal 1993. Japanese firms received only 4.2 per cent of consultancy orders, but 15.2 per cent of a total of Dollars 4.1bn equipment payments, worth Dollars 618m. In contrast, UK firms took 13.5 per cent of consultancy contract payments, but only 8.8 per cent of equipment disbursements. For larger contracts, international competitive bidding (ICB) is the norm with companies presenting sealed bids for public opening. Because of the nature of the projects, TA generally involves smaller orders and these contracts are usually placed under restricted tendering procedures, involving bidding by companies which are specialists in the areas concerned. Fundamentally important are monitoring projects and tenders in specialist publications such as the World Bank's Monthly Operational Surveys and registering for prequalification on restricted tendering lists such as the European Commission's central consultancy registers. Facilities such as the EU's Phare programme for eastern and central Europe have evolved decentralised decision-making. 'In countries like the Czech Republic and Hungary we are little more than an audit office,' says Phare official Patrick Worms. Projects are proposed and implemented by project management units (PMUs) in the recipient countries, usually run out of state bodies. 'For anyone interested in Phare contracts there is really no way to avoid going to the country and getting to know the PMU head,' Mr Worms says. Agency officials recommend: Focusing on a defined market or markets where information can be gathered and contacts made on a systematic basis. Random bidding for a wide range of contracts can waste resources for all but the largest firms. Providing a clear view of technical capacity - which can be as important as pricing. The EU's Tacis programme, which provides TA for the former Soviet Union, awards contracts after a system of evaluation in which technicals factors account for about 70 per cent of the scoring and financial factors account for only 30 per cent. For companies that are looking towards eastern Europe - where donors have concentrated on providing TA - the World Bank and its agencies, the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the EU's Tacis and Phare programmes for central and eastern Europe all offer considerable potential. The pace of EBRD financing for TA is accelerating, with recent examples including a Ecu479,971 order for Belgium's Transurb for railway studies in Slovenia and a Pounds 38,977 order for the Hampshire-based Gaffney Cline &amp; Associates to carry out fuel supply contracting assistance in Armenia. Tacis has a Ecu460m budget for 1994, pending European Parliament approval of the programme's tendering procedures. Phare has a Ecu990m budget allocation for 1994. Competition to access these funds is high. One Tacis contract for military conversion work saw 200 companies apply for prequalification. A growing trend is for consultants in a recipient country to bid for contracts, often in the form of a joint venture. This practice is encouraged by agencies, to keep more of their funds flowing in recipient countries. The World Bank is supporting training for domestic consultants. The EU's Tacis programme gives bids that include a local consultant a bonus in its evaluation procedure, Tacis information officer Dr Gerlinde Niehus says. Out of 1,150 contracts awarded by Phare in 1993, 76 went to eastern European firms, 6.6 per cent of the total. This compares with only 4.4 per cent in 1992, reflecting progress. But there is a long way to go before the US, UK and French consultancy industries lose their grip on the global TA market.

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Optimism on UK rate CAUTIOUS optimism that European interest rates will be cut has dominated money markets all week, and this was the note on which trading closed yesterday, writes James Blitz. There is now a clear expectation in the sterling market that UK base rates will be cut in conjunction with Thursday's autumn statement. Dealers only differ over the scale of the cut. Some argue that it will be as small as 1/2 a percentage point, and others, more daringly, punt on a 2 per cent fall in base rates. Whatever the differences, the optimistic mood brought 3-month money down 3/8 per cent on the week to a close of 7 5/16 per cent offered yesterday. The December short sterling contract closed 20 base points up from last Friday's close, at 93.54 yesterday. This prices 3-month money in December at around 6 1/2 per cent, a level compatible with 6 per cent base rates. The downward trend in money market rates is almost certain to continue in the early part of next week. One commercial bank dealer expected 3-month money to be at around 7 1/8 per cent, or even 7 per cent, by Wednesday. In the French and German markets, too, there is a growing feeling that rates will be cut soon. The 25 basis point cut in the French intervention rate on Monday gave an upward boost to French cash rates and futures all week. Three-month money closed at 9 5/16 per cent offered yesterday, some  3/8 per cent down on the week. The December franc contract reached a high of 91.00 yesterday, some 20 basis points up from Tuesday's opening level. But, the French markets are expecting rates to come down slowly because of the currency's membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Yesterday's close for the December contract prices is only 25 basis points off the intervention rate this year. Dealers will be watching the Bank of France's repurchase operations on Monday and Thursday for official movement. The French market's caution is explained by the Bundesbank's recent statements. The German central bank has hinted strongly that it will be watching how the German government targets the budget deficit and the public sector pay round in the next few weeks, before cutting the discount rate.</p>

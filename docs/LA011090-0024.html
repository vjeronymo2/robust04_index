			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RADIOACTIVE DEVICE STOLEN FROM TRUCK  </P> <P> A soil-testing gauge, containing possibly dangerous radioactive isotopes, was  stolen from a parked pickup truck in Sepulveda, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The gauge, used for measuring moisture in soil and asphalt, could be hazardous  to health if it is broken into, said David Murray, radiation safety officer for  Foundation Engineering Co., the Tarzana geo-consulting firm that owns the  device.  </P> <P> It was stolen between Saturday evening and Monday morning, when a company  employee who parked the white truck outside his residence near Nordhoff Street  and Sepulveda Boulevard noticed it missing, Murray said.  </P> <P> The 1-foot-long device was locked in a 2-foot-long orange-colored box bearing  the international radiation warning symbol, he said. The handle that activates  the device and exposes its radioactive component had also been padlocked, but  the key to its lock apparently was in the box and also stolen, Murray said. The  gauge and its container weigh between 60 and 70 pounds, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES UP A STEEP 0.9%, PACED BY CARS, FOOD, GAS  </P> <P> Wholesale inflation came roaring back in May after a two-month lull, rising a  steep 0.9% as prices soared for gasoline, fresh vegetables and cars, the  government said today.  </P> <P> For the first five months of the year, wholesale inflation for goods one stop  short of the retail level was running at a 9.4% annual rate, more than double  the 4% rise in 1988 and quadruple the 2.2% 1987 gain.  </P> <P> The Labor Department's producer price index troubled economists earlier this  year, when it soared 1.1% in January and 0.9% in February. But moderate rises  of 0.4% in both March and April had been seen as a sign that inflation had  retreated at least a bit.  </P> <P> In advance of today's report, many economists were predicting a  moderate-to-brisk 0.5% gain.  </P> <P> Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, attributed most of the  inflation so far this year to the "special factors" of energy and food and  predicted better numbers ahead.  </P> <P> "We want to remain vigilant against inflation. We expect inflation to stabilize  in the second half of the year and decline thereafter," Boskin told reporters  at a White House briefing.  </P> <P> Energy prices in May rose 3.3%, a steep increase but less than half April's  30-month record of 7.2%. For the last six months, energy prices have surged at  a 43.3% annual rate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gasoline Prices Soar  </P> <P> In May, the increase was propelled by a 5.2% jump in gasoline prices, which  followed a 13.4% jump in April. Natural gas prices rose 3.4%, while heating oil  costs declined 7.7%.  </P> <P> Food prices, which had posted a rare 0.6% decline in April, rebounded 0.8% in  May. The price of vegetables skyrocketed 26.4% as celery and tomato prices  doubled and cabbage prices rose by one-third.  </P> <P> There were also significant increases for eggs, rice, pasta and chicken. Prices  for beef, pork and fish declined.  </P> <P> For the last six months, food prices have risen at an annual rate of 7.3%. But  analysts expect that trend to moderate, barring a repeat of last year's  drought.  </P> <P> The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, often taken  by analysts as a truer reflection of underlying inflationary pressures, rose  0.5% last month following an unusual 0.1% decline in April.  </P> <P> The increase in May was largely driven by a 1.8% rebound in auto prices  following a 2.8% decline a month earlier. The April drop was produced by  manufacturers' incentives to bolster sagging sales.  </P> <P> Traders in financial markets were looking to today's report to provide an  indication of how far and how fast the Federal Reserve Board will lower  interest rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fed Lowers Funds Rate  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the Fed nudged the key federal funds rate -- the interest  charged banks for overnight loans -- down by a quarter of a percentage point to  near 8.5%.  </P> <P> Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, said today's  report means the Fed likely will wait at least a month before loosening credit  further.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's going to be any further easing by the Fed until we . . .  get some good inflation numbers for more than one month at a time," he said.  </P> <P> Still, analysts were optimistic that inflation reports eventually will improve.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A BLACK HOLE ON THE SAN DIEGO THEATER SCENE;  </P> <P> EVERYBODY LOSES WHEN ACTORS CAN'T FIND ROLES  </P> <P> Where can you go these days to see gifted black San Diego actors perform?  </P> <P> Los Angeles. New York. Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Increasingly, the answer is anywhere but San Diego.  </P> <P> That is distressing for both aspiring black actors who need a stage to practice  on and for the black director in town, Floyd Gaffney, who has been trying to  put together a professional black theater company in San Diego for 18 years.  </P> <P> "Maybe we can catch people on the way up," Gaffney said. "You go out and, if  you're lucky, you'll get someone talented who's moving through, like Hassan  El-Amin, but soon he'll be gone again."  </P> <P> It is a Catch-22 in which nobody wins. Without professional black theater  artists, there can be no resident black theater company. Without a black  theater company, there is no source of income that will allow professional  black artists to make a living here.  </P> <P> In the absence of theater about the black experience, black audiences -- who  are still not in the theatergoing habit -- don't show up. Without black  audiences coming to mainstream theaters, theater companies will not see such  programming as in their interest when planning a season schedule.  </P> <P> Although leading theaters such as the Old Globe Theatre and the La Jolla  Playhouse may feature black actors in August Wilson plays (at the Globe) or  original works like "Shout Up a Morning" (at the Playhouse), their shows are  usually cast from New York or Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In the case of the Wilson plays, the casts come intact from the Yale Repertory  Theatre. As one observer who sympathized with the practice of casting elsewhere  confided, "I couldn't find the quality of black actors I would need to cast in  town."  </P> <P> The closest thing San Diego has to a black theater troupe is the Southeast  Community Theatre, which produced "Williams and Walker," which just closed at  the Lyceum Space on Sunday, and plans to present "Black Nativity," a gospel  Christmas play at the Educational Cultural Complex in November.  </P> <P> The Southeast Community Theatre is the place where Cleavon Little, a Southeast  San Diego native, and Whoopi Goldberg performed in their years here. But the  status of the Southeast Community Theater, which, after 25 years, has yet to  find a home or scrape together enough money for more than two plays a season,  symbolizes the precarious nature of black theater in San Diego as a whole.  </P> <P> The homelessness of the Southeast Community Theatre is a sore spot for the  black theater community.  </P> <P> Another painful subject is the collapse of the Southern California Black  Repertory Theatre, which flourished in the late 1970s under a variety of names  including the Wing and a Prayer Repertory Company and the Rainbow Repertory  Company. The short-lived company collapsed not long after two of its founders,  actors James Avery and John Wesley, left to pursue their careers in San  Francisco and then Los Angeles, where they continue to work in television and  film.  </P> <P> When that organization went, black actors had to again leave San Diego if they  wanted to find work as professionals.  </P> <P> El-Amin, born and raised in Southeast San Diego, remembers looking up to Avery  and Wesley as role models. El-Amin just finished playing the legendary Bert  Williams in the poignant Southeast Community Theatre production of "Williams  and Walker," which Avery and Wesley returned home to see.  </P> <P> It was a part that hit close to home for El-Amin, Avery, Wesley and the scores  of black artists who attended, but never managed to fill, the 200-seat space.  Opening night brought fewer than 10 people into the theater; by the end of the  four-week run, about 100-150 were in attendance.  </P> <P> Williams was a turn-of-the-century black vaudevillian who managed to break the  color barrier at the Ziegfeld Follies, but only by agreeing to put black  greasepaint on his face and chalk up his eyes and lips a glaring white. That is  how the audiences expected blacks to look, whether they were being played by  white or black performers.  </P> <P> Williams longed to play Hamlet but was limited to the stereotypical roles  epitomized by the blackface make-up.  </P> <P> El-Amin, who will leave San Diego in September to pursue his master's degree in  classical acting at the University of Delaware, would also like to play Hamlet  someday, but he realizes that it is unlikely that a black actor in America  would be offered such a part.  </P> <P> "As far as the limitations of the parts you can do as black actors, things  haven't changed a lot," El-Amin said.  </P> <P> "The situations are similar. I'm going to  </P> <P> school to become a classically trained actor, even though I know my ability to  do these classical parts is limited. I understand the obstacles before me, but  I want to be trained, I want to be prepared. And hopefully, a change will come  about." Most of those who stick around San Diego waiting for the changes are  those anchored here by other jobs or their family.  </P> <P> Equity actress Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson is cultural affairs director for the  Education Cultural Center (ECC) and vice chairwoman of the San Diego Commission  of Art and Culture.  </P> <P> Actress Veronica Henson-Phillips, who most recently played the maid in the  Gaslamp Quarter Theatre production of "The Little Foxes," is a native Southeast  San Diegan who stays here because of her family. She gets most of her work in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Actress Anasa Briggs-Graves has been limiting her acting to her television show  on KPBS-TV.  </P> <P> Thompson is now playing a part that calls for a black actress, the nurse in the  Gaslamp Quarter Theatre production of "The Day Room." It is her second play in  three years here, a fact she blames on the lack of roles for black actors in  San Diego.  </P> <P> "I came here in the latter part of 1983, was in one play at the (now-defunct)  Fiesta Dinner Theatre and produced a play by Athol Fugard at Southeast,"  Thompson said. "I understudied at the Old Globe and didn't do another play  until the job at the Gaslamp came up. Am I frustrated? You better believe it."  </P> <P> For Bonnie Ward, assistant managing director of the Southeast Community Theatre  (not to be confused with Bonnie Ward, the co-artistic director of Starlight  Musical Theatre), "Williams and Walker" is sadly analogous to the black theater  experience today.  </P> <P> "It's a painful period, and yet it is like what life is like in America for the  African-American today. There isn't much space for the artists to perform  because the parts are limited. There isn't much space for the new playwrights  who have yet to be, and the old playwrights who have work yet to be discovered.  We have put in a lot of hard work, blood, sweat and tears, and we have not yet  scratched the surface."  </P> <P> Ward's efforts right now are concentrated on finding the Southeast a permanent  home, or at least an office to call its own. Avery and Wesley, close friends  who now live in Los Angeles, find steady work in movies and television. Wesley  -- who changed his name from John Huston to John Wesley so as not to be  confused with the late director of the same name -- just finished a miniseries  called "A Family of Spies" and a film, "Spooner," starring Robert Urich. Avery  has performed in "Fletch," "8 Million Ways to Die," "L.A. Law," "St. Elsewhere"  and "Beauty and the Beast."  </P> <P> When Avery and Wesley came back to town to see "Williams and Walker," they said  it was like looking back in time at themselves. The co-stars of the show, El  Amin and Damon Bryant, evidently agreed. They told Avery and Wesley after the  show that they had been inspired to work in the theater because of seeing their  work at Southeast and at the Southern California Black Repertory Company. That,  according to Avery, made him feel that "There is a God."  </P> <P> "That's essentially what our whole thing was, to let people know that there are  arts in the community, and that they are for everyone. That was part of our  dream and I hope it happens again."  </P> <P> But it looks as if it will take fresh blood to do it because most of those who  leave, don't come back.  </P> <P> "You can't pay the rent if you can't work at your profession, and, if you're  not white, you can't find the work in San Diego," Wesley said. "I'd love to  come home to my community and be a part of helping those youngsters who don't  have the opportunity to get into mainstream. I've been trying to come to San  Diego since 1985. I auditioned for the Globe and the Gaslamp and the Playhouse,  but I can't come back just to carry a spear."  </P> <P> Most black artists who remain have other jobs that pay the rent. Wesley  describes his mentor, director Gaffney, a professor of contemporary black art  at UC San Diego, as the force that keeps what black theater there is breathing  in San Diego.  </P> <P> Gaffney is the one theaters such as the San Diego Repertory Theatre call on  when they produce "The Colored Museum." Gaffney is the man the Southeast  Community Theatre relies upon to direct its shows. And Gaffney is the man who  nurtured talent such as Wesley, Avery, El-Amin, Briggs-Graves and  Henson-Phillips.  </P> <P> Part of that nurturing involves getting work for black actors.  </P> <P> "Most of the time a black actor works in San Diego is if there's a specific  part for a black actor -- which is unfortunate -- or if Dr. Gaffney is  directing a show," El-Amin said.  </P> <P> And part of it involves helping actors find a reason to pursue that work --  despite the inevitable rejections.  </P> <P> "Dr. Gaffney made me love acting," Wesley said. "He was able to see qualities  that I didn't even know I had and convinced me that I had potential and would  have a future in this business. He taught me values. There is no black theater  outside of Dr. Gaffney -- not a physical or a mental space. I'll love him  forever for this."  </P> <P> But, as Gaffney himself is the first to admit, he is getting tired after years  of trying to develop black theater in San Diego. He just turned 59, and he has  abandoned his original goal of founding a black theater company in favor of  getting a black and multi-ethnic theater off the ground, possibly with Latino  directors Jorge Huerta and William Virchis and progressive white director Steve  Pearson, who is known for his San Diego Public Theatre.  </P> <P> "I get frustrated because, every time you get actors who are trained at the  professional level, they leave town because there's no opportunity here. Then  you start again. It makes it very difficult to build a company," Gaffney said.  </P> <P> "The biggest frustration though is not having a technical staff that would  allow you to come in and function as a director and not have to do everything  else as you do in a community theater. I'm used to it, but I'm getting old for  that."  </P> <P> Three professionally trained black actresses who remain in town express similar  frustrations.  </P> <P> Henson-Phillips said she remains only because her family lives here, but she  still thinks about moving to Los Angeles, where she gets most of her acting  jobs. Thompson stays because of her job at the Educational Cultural Complex.  And Briggs-Graves is a senior producer at KPBS-TV with her own television show.  </P> <P> All three, however, are working for change. Briggs-Graves and Thompson believe  there is a black and/or multi-ethnic theater in San Diego's future and they are  trying to make it happen. Henson-Phillips is working with script development at  the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, where she is assisting managing director, Kit  Goldman, with Goldman's dream of producing "The Debutante," a retelling of the  Pygmalion myth in black turn-of-the-century Philadelphia, as a starring vehicle  for Cleavon Little.  </P> <P> Goldman's commitment to "The Debutante" project, the Old Globe Theatre's  success with playwright Wilson's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "The Piano  Lesson," the San Diego Repertory Theatre's success with "The Colored Museum,"  the La Jolla Playhouse's ongoing commitment to portraying the black experience  in works like "Shout Up a Morning" and "Big River" and Starlight Musical  Theatre's inclusion of "Dreamgirls" on the season schedule suggest to some that  the times, they are a'changing.  </P> <P> But Rufus DeWitt, managing director and one of the co-founders of the Southeast  Community Theatre, cautiously contents himself with more modest indications of  change.  </P> <P> He points to the fact that theaters are now sending out audition notices to his  organization asking for actors -- not just black actors.  </P> <P> "I think there is a change in the way they are opening the door to  auditioners," DeWitt said. "I don't know if it's just lip service, but it is a  change."  </P> <P> Goldman credits the flyaway success of the Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning  Wilson and his exposure at the Old Globe as an impetus to address the black  experience.  </P> <P> "Wilson's helping to create a broad audience for plays that deal with black  culture or history or subject matter. It's making it fashionable," Goldman  said.  </P> <P> Thomas Hall, the Old Globe's managing director, said his theater has told  Wilson that the Globe is interested in producing whatever he writes. Next year,  the Globe hopes to have the new Wilson play on its boards, making that Wilson's  third production here in three years.  </P> <P> "It's a challenge to do theater here," Briggs-Graves said. "But most things  that are worth having come with a challenge. If local theaters are wise,  they'll see we have lot of middle class people who are thirsting for theater,  music, jazz and art.  </P> <P> "The best thing for us to do is to seize the opportunity when it arrives. I  hope that will be soon."  </P> <P> El-Amin, for example, has no illusions about opportunities in San Diego. He has  had more work in Minneapolis and New York than he has been offered in San  Diego.  </P> <P> When he completes his master's degree in three years, it is still his dream to  come home and assume the artistic leadership of the Southeast Community  Theatre.  </P> <P> "There are still talented people here yet to be discovered. I think they should  have an artistic director who makes sure there is an ongoing season. I want to  get my professional training and pursue my career, but this is my home. These  are my roots. And I want to give something back."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the struggle for black playwrights, actors and directors to find a  place in the San Diego sun continues. Who will produce the August Wilsons  before they become August Wilson? Who will present the James Earl Joneses  before they become James Earl Jones?  </P> <P> The Southeast Community Theatre is preparing for its 25th anniversary  celebration in August by asking its alumni who left the city to come back and  show solidarity with the organization.  </P></p>

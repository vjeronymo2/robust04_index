Protection Force (UNPROFOR) logistics  base in Pancevo over a month ago for the Nordic battalion will  not go to the Moslem enclave of Tuzla in northern Bosnia. The  tanks will be sent back to Scandinavia by the end of January.    Following the Bosnian Serb authorities' refusal to permit  any  heavy weaponry passing through their territory, UNPROFOR and the  Yugoslav army agreed that the tanks would be returned by rail to  a Nordic country -- either Denmark, Norway or Sweden, reported  the Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Wednesday.    The Yugoslav committee for cooperation with UNPROFOR said  the  decision was only to be expected as peace in Bosnia cannot be  established with tanks even though some U.N. sources claim the  Leopards are not offensive weapons and would only be used for  patrolling.    After two months of talks and accusations that Yugoslavia  was  obstructing passage of the tanks to Tuzla, international factors  have finally perceived that they made a political as well as a  military mistake, said Yugoslav army sources.    The sources said it was made clear to UNPROFOR  representatives that Yugoslavia was forced by international  pressure to play host to the Nordic battalion and its 11 Leopard  tanks, and that UNPROFOR had no grounds under any U.N. documents  to send heavy weapons to Yugoslavia or Bosnia-Herzegovina.    U.N. resolutions and documents state that all moves must be  made with "the agreement of all interested parties," which on  this occasion was withheld by the Bosnian Serb Republic, wrote  VECERNJE NOVOSTI. It added that almost the entire Nordic  battalion with over 1,000 troops and 200 vehicles had been  transferred from Pancevo to Tuzla.    The U.N. peacekeeper's role in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the scene  of a fierce civil war for the past 20 months, is primarily to  ensure delivery of humanitarian relief to the civilian  population. UNPROFOR's mission, however, has been abused on many  occasions to supply the Moslem side with arms. Evidence on this  exists and has been presented to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.</p>

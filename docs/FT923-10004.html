			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Books: Pasolini - the theorem completed / Welcoming a fresh insight into the director's life THE LETTERS OF PIER PAOLO PASOLINI: VOLUME I 1940-1954 edited by Nico Naldini, translated by Stuart Hood Quartet Books Pounds 25, 526 pages OUTSIDE Italy, Pasolini is known chiefly, if not exclusively, as a film-maker, and beyond any question the dozen or so films he made bear the unmistakable imprint of his vital, iconoclastic, tormented mind. But for Italians - and, I think, for Pasolini himself - his writing, his poems, novels and essays, represented the truer, more complete expression of that mind, that exceptional personality. His letters, too, are self-revelatory, and the collection painstakingly assembled and cogently introduced by his cousin, Nico Naldini, forms a fascinating document, not only about Pasolini but also about the Italy of his time (he was born in 1922 and died, murdered, in 1974). Son of an army officer and a school-teacher, he spent his early youth in various northern Italian cities, then remained for most of the war in his mother's native area, Friuli, whose dialect became one of the first serious vehicles of his poetry. His younger brother was killed in the Resistance. Shortly after the war's end, accused of corrupting the young, Pasolini was driven to leave Friuli for Rome. He arrived there in the early 1950s, broke, virtually unknown, branded. But he soon had a circle of admiring, helpful friends, including older and influential poets such as Attilio Bertolucci and Giorgio Caproni, and several perceptive critics. It was then that, through Caproni, I met him, and like the others I was immediately impressed. From the first moment, something about him - the intensity of those bright eyes in that hewn, almost hard face, the quiet assurance of his soft voice with its (to me exotic) northern accent - told you there was a special quality about this shy young man in the ill-fitting suit and the frayed shirt. A book of his poems (he says in one of these letters that he considered it his 'first book') in Friulan dialect had just appeared; I read it, not without a linguistic struggle, and the first impression was confirmed. I also read a haunting poem in Italian, 'The Appenine', and turned it into English: it was his first translation into any language. By then we had become friends: a curious friendship in which his total seriousness always made me feel frivolous, and his steel determination to be a writer (and, it was clear, a famous writer) contrasted with my own aimless uncertainty about a future direction. Rome in the 1950s seemed a city of aspiring writers, assailing the bulwarks of the establishment: the state radio, the respected magazines, the flourishing cinema. Through his friendships (and, of course, his talent), Pasolini was soon on the inside track. He began winning prizes, contributing to reviews like Paragone, directed by the awesome Roberto Longhi and his formidable wife Anna Banti, frequenting the parties of another crucial couple, Alberto Moravia (who was to be his lifelong friend) and Elsa Morante. But then, at a certain hour of the evening, he would slip away to his other life, a hidden Rome, where he found not only sexual satisfaction but also literary inspiration. In the capital's literary salons, he sometimes seemed the ambassador from another, very foreign world. If he made powerful friends, he also made powerful enemies, and with both he could be excoriatingly sincere. Some - too few - of the 425 letters in this first volume have an aggressive frankness that must have taken the recipients aback (the correspondence with the rather stuffy senior critic Enrico Falqui has lost none of its sharpness). There are very few 'confessional' letters, but those to his perceptive friend and confidante Silvana Mauri portray a vulnerable, self-critical youth in pain: these are the letters of a real writer. Other letters - many other letters - introduce us to the less admirable aspects of Italian literary life, the canvasing for prize-jury votes, the requests for recommendations and introductions, the reciprocal reviewing and, on occasion, the flattery. Pasolini himself regretted the necessity of these manoeuvres, and - it must be said to his great credit - he wrote as many or more letters on behalf of others as in his own interest. Still, these time-consuming machinations make slightly unpleasant reading today; and, ironically, a great number of such letters survive while, one suspects, many others, perhaps more personal and more engaging, have been lost or destroyed or not made available to the editor. Letters, usually written only for one reader, are hell to translate; in facing this immense volume Stuart Hood has worked with insight and sensitivity and, as a whole, his achievement is considerable. Some problems are insoluble, such as salutations and closings: 'Carissimo' can indeed be very affectionate, but not always, and similarly 'un abraccio', while it does indeed mean 'a hug', somehow sounds more physical in English. In a few moments perhaps of weariness, Hood succumbs to the lure of faux amis (governante is not 'governess', inchiesta is not 'inquest', attuale is not 'actual,' and an accelerato, God knows, is not a fast train). But the feel of the letters is there, and the figure of Pasolini emerges. Not wholly, of course. To understand him fully, the reader must turn to the poetry, the prose, the cinema. This book - and the companion volume we can presumably expect - will be invaluable supplements to the real work. For, as he knew from the beginning, Pasolini was, before anything else, an artist.</p>

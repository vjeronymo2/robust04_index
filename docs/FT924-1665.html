			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Israel to bail out IMI THE ISRAELI government yesterday agreed to bail out the financially stricken Israel Military Industries in an attempt to keep afloat one of the mainstays of the country's big state-owned defence industry, which has been hard hit by falling world demand for military products. The cabinet voted to back a recovery plan for IMI - best known as the maker of the Uzi sub-machine gun - which includes an injection of Shk750m (Pounds 190m) in government funds and a 2,500 cut in the present 7,500-strong workforce. Previously, the government had pumped Shk250m into IMI to staunch losses which approached Dollars 250m (Pounds 164m) last year on sales which fell 20 per cent to Dollars 520m. Aside from IMI, the government is also being asked by Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest company, for more than Dollars 150m in emergency aid to help it cope with falling sales.</p>

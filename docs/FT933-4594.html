			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Loss at Cambridge CAMBRIDGE Group, the Dublin-based asset financing group, has reported exceptionally heavy pre-tax losses of IPounds 35.4m (Pounds 33.4m) for the 15-month period to May 31 1993, resulting from IPounds 37.17m in provisions and asset write-downs made by the company's new senior management team. The result has wiped out shareholder's funds on the balance sheet. Cambridge made a pre-tax profit of IPounds 5.02m for the year to February 28 1992, but in May this year the board became aware of 'doubtful debts' and this was followed in June by the resignations of a number of the group's executive directors. A review of operations was then carried out by the new management. A company statement said: 'The board is currently in discussion with the group's bankers regarding a possible financial restructuring of the business.' An extraordinary general meeting is to be convened to discuss the company's future.</p>

We are not blocking our market,  but you are not good enough to crack it." Earlier this week,  however, these familiar words lost some of their persuasiveness,  and the reason is called "Motorola."    This company is the world leader in mobile telephones;  Motorola phones are beeping from Andorra to Cyprus. For exactly  10 years now, the U.S. company has been trying to gain a  foothold in the Japanese market, but it has only managed to get  a 4-percent share of the market so far -- in spite of three  solemn agreements in 1987, 1989, and 1992. Special Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor says it is "wrong and dishonest" to  maintain that Motorola does not have anything decent to offer or  does not make an effort.    Incidentally, Kantor's appearance (mobile phone in hand)  took  place in the wake of a much more serious rift between the two  allies. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Hosokawa himself had  come to Washington to find a way out of the looming trade war,  together with Bill Clinton. The Prime Minister came, saw -- and  did not conquer. For the first time, the Americans seem prepared  to use the guns. Clinton "does not want to rule out anything,"  and Kantor only wants to grant a 30-day grace period. Unless an  agreement is achieved, Washington might retaliate -- with  countervailing duties of up to 100 percent.    Of course, the issue is not just telephones, but a  persistent  $50 billion trade deficit. Washington wants to punish Japan's  sin against free trade by a sin of its own. Tired of the  endless debates on opening markets, the United States does not  want to lay down rules, but results: a certain number of market  shares for U.S. products by a certain date. The euphemism is  called managed trade; it is directed against the spirit and the  laws of GATT, which disapproves of bilateral agreements and  preaches universal trade regulations. On the other hand,  Motorola shows that the problem is not visible trade barriers,  but the way in which Japan's "market" is organized. Duties are  low, but foreign exporters are caught in a network of official  and unofficial cartels that bind local wholesalers and retailers  to domestic producers, and thus prevent competition. Both  Japanese consumers and European exporters would benefit from the  United States breaking through this barrier. The only question  is whether a society can be changed from outside.    Yet, the Americans are unlikely to give in again. For  decades, Washington withdrew its guns, because geopolitics in  the shadow of a powerful Soviet Union was more important than  the balance of trade. But today the USSR no longer exists and  the United States can choose among a number of partners in the  Pacific Region. Hosokawa is not in an enviable position.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Tokyo claims advantage in numerical targets battle / Examining the differing perceptions in the US and Japan on the future of the framework trade deal JAPANESE officials yesterday presented the weekend trade framework agreement with the US as a turning point, mainly because they believe it marks the first success of a more assertive Japanese approach to the US. Japan will claim that it came out best from the main dispute which has dogged the negotiations since they started in April: whether numerical targets should set goals for Japanese policies to open up its markets to imports and reduce its current account surplus. The Japanese approach on this issue marks a break with the past. In previous trade disputes, the Japanese have started by talking tough but eventually backed down. This time they started by publicly resisting numerical targets and did not back down when the US applied pressure. Japan will claim that because the agreement does not explicitly mention numerical targets, it has won the day. The reality is that this central dispute over targets will continue, but on a different footing. Tokyo has successfully resisted US demands that it should set its economic policies with the target of halving its current account surplus. However, this does not mean Japan's powerful Finance Ministry has had it all its own way. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in spite of his weakness in the run-up to next weekend's elections, has forced the powerful bureaucrats to concede for the sake of the agreement. The Finance Ministry had proposed saying that it would promote domestic growth, which would in turn 'contribute' to reducing the surplus by increasing demand for imports. The wording of the agreement is substantially tougher than Japanese bureaucrats wanted. The agreement says Japan will 'actively pursue' strong and sustainable demand-led growth, which is 'intended to achieve over the medium term a highly significant decrease in the current account surplus'. The short-term implications for Japanese fiscal and monetary policy are clear. The upheaval in Japan's political system means that for weeks, if not months, the politicians will not be in a strong enough position to force the Finance Ministry to consider a further shot of government spending to revive the economy. But the likelihood of a further pump-priming package in the autumn or early next year is now much higher. As fiscal policy is so politically constrained, in the short term the agreement will increase pressure on the Bank of Japan for a further cut in interest rates, which are at an record low of 2.5 per cent. Japan has also resisted numerical targets for policies to open the domestic market to imports, especially vehicle parts, high technology goods and financial services. The agreement says policies to open markets will be assessed using sets of 'objective criteria', a phrase introduced to the talks by the Japanese. The content and role of these 'criteria' is almost certain to be the subject of further rows between the two sides. The US has backed down from its earlier call for Japan to accept as a goal a 33 per cent increase in its imports of manufactured goods over the next three years. The agreement does not commit Japan to making sure a share of its domestic market in particular sectors, such as autumotive components, is taken by foreign products. The Japanese did not get everything they wanted. Tokyo wanted a US commitment that the 'criteria' would not be interpreted as targets. The US has resisted this demand, so it is open to Washington to try to turn the criteria into goals to guide Japanese import promotion policy. So the framework does not settle the central dispute about whether targets should be used, it merely puts the argument on a different footing.</p>

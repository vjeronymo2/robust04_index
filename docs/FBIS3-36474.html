			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "In Brief" column] </F>   [Text] Latvia's Foreign Affairs Minister Georg Andreyev  said that the Latvian delegation to the talks with Russia should  agree to the plan which will probably be proposed by the Russian  side in the course of the next round.    Russia's intention to seek compromise, which came as a  result  of a meeting in Moscow between Russian Government  representatives, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and the Latvian  delegation led by Andreyev, was announced in Washington by U.S.  Administration officials. Under the new plan, the radar station  in Skrunda will operate for another four years and will then be  dismantled within 18 months.    At present, however, Russia's position adopted during the  previous round is still valid at the current Latvian-Russian  intergovernment negotiations, whereby the operation of the  Skrunda radar will be extended for five years. Officially  Russia has not as yet advised Latvia about a change of position.    According to Andreyev, it is still not clear how this issue  will be decided. The Latvian delegation's mandate may be  changed only after this issue has been studied by the  leadership, for example, the Saeima's Interfactional Council.  The minister said that to prevent an indefinite delay in its  resolution, this question should not be discussed at a plenary  Saeima session.</p>

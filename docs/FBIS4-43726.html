			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by `deu': "Scharping Announces New `Eastern </F> Policy'"]    [Text] With a new "Eastern policy," the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] wants to extol the private initiative of  citizens more strongly and support their social commitment. At  a meeting in Bonn with several hundred representatives of  private civic groups that are rendering practical assistance to  East Europe, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping criticized the  government for limiting itself to the organization of transfers  of money. "The result of this is that rich advisers are staying  in poor countries," he said. Scharping pointed out that to  eliminate the vicious circle of escape and deportation, "East  Europe must not be wasted away economically, socially, and,  above all, philanthropically. My party's aim is to strengthen  the involvement of private citizens in the Federal Republic."    The representatives of the private aid initiatives  complained  about the government's bureaucratic obstacles to their work.  Some of these obstacles have actually induced a few charitable  organizations to discontinue their work, it was said. There are  new customs and tax rules all the time, and even applications  for a reimbursement of the costs of transporting aid are brushed  aside in Bonn. "In the GDR, old vehicles are rusting away that  are urgently required in the south of Europe," was another  complaint from a participant in the meeting. For six months,  some of the charities have been waging a "private war" with  ministries in Bonn to acquire a well-worn ambulance to send to  Romania. "There is a lot we could do, but we cannot do anything  without the proper infrastructure," one woman complained.  Scharping mentioned the possibility of deploying the Bundeswehr  to deliver aid to East Europe. Apart from that, the Bundeswehr  should make out of date equipment available for East European  aid. Finally, in every recipient country there should be  coordination units to relieve the charitable organizations of  the burdens of bureaucracy.    SPD Bundestag Deputy Gernot Erler complains that the  government was doing next to nothing in the elimination of  nuclear and chemical weapons in Russia. "The destruction of  these weapons agreed to in the treaty is not possible on account  of absent technology. While the United States has offered the  Russians 1 billion marks [DM] in aid for the process of  disarmament, Bonn has offered them all of DM10 million," says  Erler.</p>

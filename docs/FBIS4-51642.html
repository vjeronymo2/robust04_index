			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- The Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI) on Monday blasted the latest U.S.  report on Japanese trade barriers as hampering global free trade  activity. The 1994 National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade  Barriers announced by the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) at the end of March found Japan guilty of  unfair trade practices in many industrial sectors.    The latest USTR report on foreign trade barriers is  "significantly different" from those prepared in past years in  that it is aimed to pave the way for invocation of a retaliatory  trade provision known as Super 301, MITI said. Unilateral trade  measures like Super 301 constitute violations of the recently  signed global trade accords under the Uruguay Round sponsored by  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), MITI said.    "Such steps are global targets of criticism as they erode  free trading systems," MITI said in a statement.    The statement dismissed U.S. claims that Japan's markets are  closed while its trade surplus, traced to the closed nature of  the markets, helped deprive Japan's trade partners of  opportunities for employment and production.    Japan's global trade surplus has been derived not from its  market conditions as if it were closed but from macroeconomic  structural problems, the statement explained.    MITI also argued there is no ground to support the claim  that  Japanese markets are more closed than other countries. An  average tariff on industrial and mining products is only 2.2  percent in Japan against 5.4 percent in the United States and  5.7 percent in the European Union (EU), MITI explained.    Under the recently reinstated Super 301, Washington will  seek  to identify foreign trade barriers using the USTR findings. The  U.S. would then have until Sept. 30 to pinpoint priority  countries that are engaged in unfair trading.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTD TO OFFER FREE RIDES ON TARDY BUSES  </P> <P> Patsaouras has got to be kidding. He wants to speed up the bus service by  offering free rides if the bus is behind schedule.  </P> <P> How many of us have been rudely and dangerously shoved aside by a  smoke-belching RTD bus controlled by an egotistical maniac?  </P> <P> What I foresee evolving from this dumb idea is a madhouse competition among bus  drivers for their share of the glory.  </P> <P> Hopefully, the other board members have retained their senses and realize that  things are out of control in Los Angeles. No half-baked promise will change the  traffic conditions on our city streets. No half-baked promise will solve the  RTD's credibility problem.  </P> <P> ROBERT BEALL  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

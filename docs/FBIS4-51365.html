			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 26 (XINHUA) -- This major financial  center in southern China has reported one financial institution  for every 3,000 residents thanks to the booming banking business.    Guangzhou has been listed as one of the five cities in China  to experiment with financial reforms. To step up such reform,  the city has worked hard to establish financial institutions and  markets at various levels while developing the insurance market.    By the end of last year Guangzhou had established altogether  2,100 financial institutions, among which eight are trust and  investment companies, two are accounting firms and 43 are urban  credit co-operatives set up only in the past few years.    Meanwhile, seven foreign banks have set up branches in this  economically prospering city, and another 23 foreign banks have  offices here. In addition, some 130 securities offices have  been set up.    Now, the city boasts over 100 billion yuan in financial  assets, leading all the other areas in southern China. By the  end of last year Guangzhou had 99.5 billion yuan (about 11  billion U.S. dollars) in bank savings accounts, an increase of  24.33 percent over the previous year.</p>

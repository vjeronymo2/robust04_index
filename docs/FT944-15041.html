			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: Insolvency faces challenge of privatisation / A look in detail at the Stoy Hayward report into contracting out the work of Official Receivers The Stoy Hayward report on the future of the Insolvency Service has created considerable excitement among UK accountants, not least because the word insolvency concentrates the mind of the profession wonderfully. Stoy's were asked last year by the Department of Trade and Industry to study options for privatisation of the service, which is a DTI agency dealing with financial failure and tackling fraud in insolvency. The conclusion of the report, to contract out part of the service to the private sector, if backed by ministers and sanctioned by parliament, will determine the future of insolvency practice and contribute to the debate on contracting-out in government services. The lather generated over the 'publication' of the report has been exacerbated by difficulties in obtaining the document and the understandable anxieties of those whose livelihoods may be at stake. The report has been lodged in the House of Commons library and is now being considered by the Department of Trade and Industry. Meanwhile, the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill, which would enable the contracting-out option identified in the report to go ahead, is being debated by the Lords. While the government may well see this as an example of due process, others harbour suspicions that the die has already been cast. Indeed, Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has instructed officials to prepare the ground for the preferred option. That option is simple. The report recommends that the private sector, in the guise of Licenced Insolvency Practitioners (IPs), should take on cases normally dealt with by Official Receivers after a court order has been made - in other words at the start of the process. The arguments for contracting out are strong. They centre on the need to improve efficiency by cutting costs, and the desirability of shifting so-called clerical duties away from the Official Receiver. This would leave the service free to pursue malpractice and fraud, and protect the public. Stoy's estimates that opening up the business for competition would, under the preferred option, mean putting out tenders for work which currently costs the Insolvency Service Pounds 31m a year. IPs already deal with the more lucrative voluntary liquidations which make up about 60 per cent of all failures. There are about 2,000 licenced IPs and most are accountants. The Licenced Practitioners Association estimates that 600 of these form an active core group. There are between 100 and 200 firms scattered across the country with an IP partner, while an average Big Six accountancy firm might have 45 IPs. Stoy's admits that the preferred option is a 'challenging option'. It does in fact contain inherent potential problems. For example, its most vital element, the level of fees charged, will have to be tested in a pilot tendering scheme. The report concludes: 'Definitive testing can only be achieved by proceeding to a formal tendering exercise which involves the preparation of detailed specifications and the issue of invitations to tender.' It recognises that taking the preferred option would mean IPs becoming involved in the preparatory work of cases which might end in prosecution. How effective would investigations be if started in the public sector but finished in the private sector? Stoy's conclusions are blunt: 'If this interface does not work well, the investigations of the OR would be impaired.' The report also notes IPs would have a 'substantial role' in setting standards and monitoring them even within their 'clerical' duties. As one IP points out: in the eyes of many who have spent their careers working in insolvency, this would be like privatising part of the judiciary. At the heart of the report is the issue of fees. Unfortunately two volumes of information collated by Stoy's have not been published with the main report. This is, understandably, due to the sensitive competitive nature of the information. But there are plenty of clues. Stoy's approached 78 potential clients and obtained quotes from IPs which were close to the costs currently incurred by the service. 'In discussions some IPs expressed the belief that they could get below the Official Receiver's current costs. This gives confidence that, under formal tendering conditions in an open market, fees per case could be driven down to levels which would deliver value for money,' says the report. Under the preferred option Stoy's estimates that in a company failure in London the insolvency service's remaining work on the case would cost Pounds 1,449 - leaving the cost of the work left to contractors at Pounds 2,746. In the provinces the costs would be Pounds 1,357 and Pounds 2,259 a case. Many smaller IPs are worried that if they could not undercut bigger rivals, especially from the Big Six firms, during the first tendering round, they might not have the staff or resources to enter the battle when contracts are again put out for tender. Because the fees would be on a per case basis, volume is crucial. There are also worries that a per case culture would reduce the ability of the service to spot fraud and malpractice. At present the Official Receiver faced with a heavy case load can choose to divert resources to cases which appear to merit attention. While this is said to be an example of a flexible system based on judgment, some argue that a standard fee per case system in which all cases would be given equal time would be more equitable: especially to the creditors who might get some return from the liquidation. The problem here is that the Official Receiver can shuffle the case load and keep overall costs down. A system based on standard per case fees would become extremely costly if the case load went up. When tendering begins the government would have to set out its criteria and the resolution of the quantity/quality argument would be crucial. One other issue requires clarification. Many IPs want to know whether, if involved in original casework, they would be barred from acting as liquidators in those cases where companies were found to have significant assets. The Stoy Hayward report says: 'There may be charges of an unfair advantage for contractors in cases which are found to have significant assets.' There is as yet no news from the DTI about what direction it intends to take. Its initial response suggests a strong commitment to carry reforms forward into a pilot tendering process at the very least. Those who are likely to lobby against the preferred option do have a vested interest. The Insolvency Service and its 1,500 employees are suspicious of the proposals and union representatives predict job losses and closures. Independent and small firm IPs so far see the option as providing an opportunity for the Big Six to move in on the new business, and gain a position which might threaten their existing business. The government will have to judge the benefits of contracting-out and in particular the increased effectiveness of investigations undertaken by the Official Receivers. It has promised to canvass all Official Receivers. Although normally reticent, they have an opportunity to speak and their response will be crucial.</p>

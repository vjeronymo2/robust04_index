			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The guest of our news broadcast this  evening is Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.  Good evening, Mr. Silajdzic. We have seen what the  humanitarian situation in our country is like. [passage omitted]    News has reached us from Croatia on the announcement of some  kind of military intervention by the Croatian Army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warns  that, as he puts it, the continued offensive by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in central Bosnia could call into  question the continuation of the peace negotiations scheduled  for 18 January. What do you think about that?    [Silajdzic] Unfortunately, the Croatian Army has already  been  intervening in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is well known to us and  to international circles, to those who are interested in the  truth. The Croatian Army is indeed present in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in central Bosnia. The  Croatian armed forces, including people and resources, have been  present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for a long time. But even so, we  are surprised by the openness of Croatian diplomacy regarding  the preparations for the new intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    They want to achieve two [as heard] things: They want to  justify the intervention already under way, they want to justify  possible future actions, and they want to distract the attention  of the world public from the notorious fact that the Croatian  extremists, with the help of some circles from Croatia and the  Croatian Army, have committed a genocide, particularly in  Herzegovina, starting in Prozor, against the Bosnian [word  indistinct] population. This is an attempt to divert the world  public's attention from that fact and from the fact that Croatia  is intervening in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    I think that [word indistinct] intervention....[pauses] I  have information about a large-scale mobilization, that it will  certainly not allow the preace process [words indistinct].    [Announcer] What is your message for those who are watching  or listening to our program who are on the threshold of a new  war year in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is less than four hours  away?    [Silajdzic] A new year is usually connected with wishes and  greetings. My wish is for us to have peace next year, and I  would like to extend greetings to all of you for all the  achievements. I think that we have achieved a miracle and that  we are achieving a miracle which the whole world is talking  about. Greetings especially to our [word indistinct] who are in  their (?trenches) this evening defending their country for their  children and for all of us against the well armed enemy who  keeps getting help, and who has enjoyed the support of [words  indistinct] so far.    The world community has intervened in Bosnia-Herzegovina in  favor of the aggressor. The world community has failed to  fulfill its promise as far as the victim is concerned and we are  rightly asking ourselves, or better still we are asking those  who make decisions in the world community: What right have they  not to allow us to defend ourselves?    To all the others in these countries we wish peace and a  year  of [word indistinct]. [passage omitted: greetings to families  who lost their nearest and dearest; Silajdzic says it is an  honor to die for one's country; mentions five victims of  Sarajevo shelling today]    To all in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which there will always be  room for everyone, as before -- regardless of nationality and  religion -- and to those outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, I wish  peace above all.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / MPs to meet SIB chief over Lloyd's inquiry LLOYD'S OF London will come under political pressure again next week when a party of MPs visits Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, to discuss his inquiry into alleged malpractices. The authorities at the insurance market faced intense scrutiny earlier this year when MPs said Names working in the market were benefiting at the expense of Names outside. Names are the individuals whose assets support underwriting. The MPs will seek assurances that Sir David is gaining access to all the information he needs for his inquiries. The party is expected to include Mr Paul Marland, the Conservative MP for Gloucestershire West, who is also a Lloyd's Name. The credibility of the inquiry is critical to Lloyd's as it seeks to rebuild confidence in the face of its difficulties. Losses in 1989 are expected to amount to more than Pounds 1.35bn, with some recent estimates putting the figure as high as Pounds 2bn. At the time of Sir David's appointment in February, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, commented: 'I needed a man who was so white that snow-white looked dirty.' Mr Marland is also expected to be at the forefront of calls for a fully fledged Commons debate on Lloyd's. He is understood to have written to Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior trade and industry minister, to request a meeting with him and other interested parties. In a separate development, Lloyd's has received a legal opinion from Mr Jonathan Sumption QC that it can admit corporate members without any alteration of the Lloyd's Act, which provides for the market's self-regulation. The opinion potentially clears the way for more rapid implementation of the proposals made by the Rowland report in January to bring corporate capital to the market. It had been assumed that changes in the act would be needed. However, Lloyd's will still need to talk to various regulatory bodies, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, about the reforms. Potential investors may be encouraged by the findings of Mr Chris Hitchings, an insurance analyst with Hoare Govett, the securities house. Lloyd's has consistently outperformed both UK composite insurers and US insurers in terms of both its profit margins and the strength of its solvency margins, says Mr Hitchings in a report that analyses financial data from Lloyd's and the UK and US insurance industries on a like-for-like basis. Between 1950 and 1989, Lloyd's reported average annual profits (as a percentage of net written premiums) of 6 per cent, compared with 3.9 per cent for UK companies and 2.9 per cent for US insurers. Lloyd's losses for 1989  - which the market reports next month  - are likely to be much worse than those experienced by the UK companies, partly because of its heavy exposure to natural catastrophes. However, had UK companies accounted on the same basis as Lloyd's, their results for 1989 would have been worse, says Mr Hitchings in his report. Many of the companies' 1990 and 1991 losses occurred because of the need to make provisions for claims made on policies underwritten in earlier years.</p>

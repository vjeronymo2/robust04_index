			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Government urged to increase number of unitary authorities for Wales THE GOVERNMENT is being urged by Welsh district councils to increase the number of unitary authorities for Wales under its plans for local government reorganisation, Roland Adburgham writes. The Welsh Office has set out in a white paper its intention to have 21 authorities by April 1995, replacing the two-tier structure of eight county and 37 district councils. The Council of Welsh Districts argues in its interim response that the number should be increased to 27 to improve the community basis of the new authorities.</p>

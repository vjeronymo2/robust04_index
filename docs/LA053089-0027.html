			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Singer Connie Francis, whose meteoric career in the 1950s and '60s crashed in a  series of personal tragedies, returned to the Las Vegas stage last weekend and  thanked fans who have stood by her over the years. "You've always let me know  you were there, in good times and bad, and for that I'll always love you,"  Francis, 50, told a cheering crowd. The audience at the Aladdin Theatre gave  her several standing ovations. In 1974, Francis was raped and terrorized at  knifepoint in her motel room. In 1977, she underwent surgery that ruined her  singing voice until the problem was corrected years later. Career problems,  three failed marriages and the death of her brother, who was gunned down  outside his New Jersey home, led to emotional problems that required  hospitalization on occasion until six months ago.

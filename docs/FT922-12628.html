			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Swedish broker plans 'junk' bond markets ONE OF Sweden's largest brokers plans to develop a market for zero coupon bonds of sub-investment - or 'junk' - grade. The bonds - known as 'Jobs' or Junk Obligations - could be used to convert non-performing loans to the troubled real estate sector into more easily tradeable forms of debt, according to Ohman, a family-owned Swedish brokerage. Nordbanken, one of the Swedish commercial banks controlled by the Swedish state, said it was looking at the securities as one possible way of dealing with the non-performing real estate loans in its portfolio. The use of such bonds has been limited so far. Ohman is close to finalising details for the conversion of non-performing loans to Allhus, a Swedish real estate company which made losses on property investments in London, into SKr300m of sub-investment grade zero-coupon bonds. The bonds will replace non-performing bank loans. The banks have agreed in principle and will own the bonds, although Ohman hopes to act as market-maker and sell bonds to investors, including speculators gambling on a recovery in the real estate market.</p>

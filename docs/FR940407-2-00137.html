			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exceptions may be made to this policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular attention to the following factors: Whether an exception is warranted by overriding U.S. foreign policy or national security interests; whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and, whether other compelling circumstances exist which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States, and which do not conflict with law enforcement concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A person named in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request for reconsideration of the suspension/denial decision to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration should be supported by evidence of remedial measures taken to prevent future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR and other pertinent documented information showing that the person would not be a risk for future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will evaluate the submission in consultation with,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and other necessary agencies. After a decision on the request for reconsideration has been rendered by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, the requester will be notified whether the exception has been granted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert L.

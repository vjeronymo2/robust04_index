			<p>BFN     [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] President  Afonso Dhlakama gave assurances yesterday that his party will  take part in elections scheduled for October this year, even if  the money donated by the international community is not enough.  Dhlakama said that Renamo's electoral campaign will not require  a lot of funds, adding that "what we want is transportation to  be able to move about."    The Renamo leader, who was speaking at a well-attended news  conference, said during his visit to the United States he  informed UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali about this.  Afonso Dhlakama also said that during his meeting with  Butrus-Ghali, they also discussed the peace process in  Mozambique, the confinement and demobilization of troops, the  training of a single and nonpartisan army, and the difficulties  that "we are facing." He also said he held meetings with  members of the UN Security Council during which they discussed  the issue of the "trust fund." He said there were problems  because the figures allegedly announced by the media are not  correct. Afonso Dhlakama said, however, that "modalities are  being studied to find a solution to this issue of the trust  fund."    Dhlakama, who described his first official visit to the  United States as successful, stressed that Renamo is ready for  the October general elections, "although we do not possess  material resources." He said: "We cannot say that we will not  take part in elections because of lack of material resources".    According to Renamo leader, the United States promised to  contribute $1 million for his movement's "trust fund". Asked  whether he was happy with the U.S. contribution to his movement,  Afonso Dhlakama said yes. He stressed however that the money  was not enough but then said "a donation is never little."    The Renamo leader still advocates the establishment of a  government of national unity and said that he had presented his  proposals to the U.S. Administration. "They said it was a good  idea, and they even promised to convey the message to President  Joaquim Chissano," Dhlakama said.    On the disappearance of 12,000 troops from the government  army, the Renamo leader said the U.S. Administration accepted  his request for greater monitoring of the situation and the need  to "warn the government led by the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] Party." He said the "disappearance" of these troops  was a "serious" issue and not a problem of arithmetic "as the  government tries to explain it."    Dhlakama said his movement thinks these troops were  transferred to the Police Force, since a similar situation took  place in Angola, where the Government led by the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola diverted 80,000 troops to  the Police Force.    During his recent visit to the United States, the Renamo  leader was confronted with accusations that his movement used  children during the war against the Mozambican Government. In  reply, Dhlakama said he told Americans that in Africa it is a  common to use children in war. As examples, he said liberation  movements such as the African National Congress, the South-West  African People's Organization, the Zimbabwe African National  Union, and Frelimo also used children during war. Afonso  Dhlakama clearly admitted for the first time that his movement  used minors during its war against the government led by  Frelimo, when he said that "all parties use children."    At the news conference, the Renamo leader also referred to  the voter registration process now under way in the country. He  said foreigners have already been detected registering as  voters. Dhlakama said that in Cabo Delgado Province two  Tanzanians were detained by police for trying to register as  voters.    The Renamo leader also said he was going to register as  voter  in Maputo today and then leave for Inhambane Province, where he  will preside over a conference of Renamo cadres. He also  revealed he will visit the provinces of Sofala, Manica, and Tete  beginning 20 June.</p>

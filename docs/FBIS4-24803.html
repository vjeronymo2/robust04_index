			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 (CNS) -- Top officials from some  ten ministries and commissions participated in the first  conference on comprehensive coordination of the economy  sponsored by the State Economic and Trade Commission. They had  discussions on new features of the market economy in order to  strengthen comprehensive coordination of the economic operation.  A decision made in the conference stated that a system is to be  set up for the holding of conference to achieve such an end.    Following analysis and review of the current economic  situation in China, participants pointed out that much work  should be done with emphasis on "comprehensiveness" and  "coordination". The national economy should be kept at  continuous, rapid and healthy development through means of  timely regulation of the economic operation.    The conference concluded that work should be done to  strengthen and improve comprehensiveness and coordination of  economic operation. First, establishment of the socialist  market economy system is necessary. It is rather complicated in  the economic operation during the transition period when the new  system replaces the old one. Old problems resulting from the  planned economy system were uncovered while new ones appeared  under the new situation, all of which should be seriously dealt  with. A large workload to cover so many sectors with emphasis  on coordination is expected. Quality of such coordinated work  is directly related to the reform and development as a whole.    Second, it is necessary to have macro-economic regulation  further strengthened and improved. Serious fluctuation in the  economic development can be prevented by means of implementation  of policies on timely regulation of economic operation.    Third, problems facing the current economic situation  involved such fields as production, transport, internal trade  and foreign trade as well as many departments. It is difficult  to get them solved just by one individual department, and  comprehensive and coordinated efforts have to be made to solve  them.    Officials from Ministries of Metallurgy, Coal, Electronics,  Machine-building, Chemistry, Geology and Mineral Resources,  Railways, Communications, Internal Trade as well as Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation plus the China Light Industry  Council, the China Textile Industry Council, the State  Administration of Taxation and the State Statistical Bureau, the  General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party  of China and the General Office of the State Council attended  the conference.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee of Chief Justices commented that it is the exclusive province of the state supreme courts to construe state disciplinary rules and to determine whether this regulation falls within the ``authorized by law'' exception to these rules. The Department has simply expressed its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> intention <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to fit communications made pursuant to these rules within the ``authorized by law'' exception to state and local federal court rules, and its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> belief <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that this regulation indeed constitutes legal authorization for such communications. The Department notes that it would seem to require a very strained reading to conclude that a regulation duly promulgated after notice and comment and within the scope of its delegated authority does not also constitute ``law.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cf. Chrysler Corp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 441 U.S. at 295&hyph;96 (1979) (``It has been established in a variety of contexts that properly promulgated substantive agency regulations have the `force and effect of law.'. . . It would therefore take a clear showing of contrary legislative intent before the phrase `authorized by law' in [18 U.S.C.] &sect;1905 could be held to have a narrower ambit than the traditional understanding.'' (citation omitted)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Department recognizes that situations may arise in which the power of this regulation to displace state rules will depend on its preemptive force under the Supremacy Clause. Such situations may arise in several forms: where the applicable ethics rule has no ``authorized by law'' exception; where this regulation is deemed not to constitute ``law'' for purposes of such exception; or where a communication is held to violate the applicable ethics rule and not be ``authorized'' by this regulation. Therefore, an important feature of this regulation is its express intention to preempt and supersede the operation of state and local federal court rules as they relate to contacts by Department attorneys, regardless of whether such rules are inconsistent or consistent with this regulation, absent a finding of a willful violation of these rules by the Attorney General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preemption of state regulation of contacts with represented persons, except when the Attorney General has found a willful violation of the federal regulation, was an integral feature of this rule as proposed earlier. The proposed rule reflected the Department's belief that preemption of state and local rules, which have been unevenly applied, is necessary to ensure that government attorneys' conduct respecting  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contacts is subject to uniform and predictable standards. The Department has made minor revisions to section 77.12 to clarify that the Department's intent is to displace even purportedly consistent state regulation in this area (or, as it is commonly phrased, to ``occupy the field'' of reviewing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contacts by Department attorneys). The rules and this commentary now state in more express terms the Department's intention to preclude any state regulation of government attorneys respecting the subject matter of these rules, unless the Attorney General first finds a willful violation of these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments suggested that the Attorney General lacks the authority to preempt state disciplinary rules, absent an explicit Congressional authorization to do so. These comments misconceive the power of a federal agency or department to preempt state regulation. Congress may, of course, expressly preempt all state regulation in a particular field,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see Rice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sante Fe Elevator Corp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 331 U.S. 218, 247, 255 (1947);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> accord Jones <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rath Packing Co <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 430 U.S. 519, 536&hyph;37 (1977), and, in proper circumstances, a federal agency similarly ``may determine that its authority is exclusive and preempts any state efforts to regulate in the forbidden area.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of New York <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FCC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 486 U.S. 57, 64 (1988).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See generally Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> De La Cuesta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 458 U.S. 141, 153&hyph;54 (1982) (``[f]ederal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes'' under the Supremacy Clause);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hillsborough County, Fla. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Automated Med.

A federal agency may preempt state regulation whenever the agency, in doing so, is acting within the proper scope of its congressionally delegated authority.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Louisiana Public Serv.

Thus, contrary to the commenters' suggestion, ``[a] preemptive regulation's force does not depend on express congressional authorization to displace state <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> law . . . .''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 458 U.S. at 154.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In promulgating this regulation, the Department is acting within the scope of its discretionary authority. The ample consideration given to this regulation and its earlier versions reflects the Department's effort reasonably to accommodate the relevant policies concerning law enforcement and professional conduct, and, as discussed in the previous section, there is no basis for concluding that the Department has exceeded its statutory authority. Moreover, the purpose of these rules, as defined in section 77.1, is to ``ensure the Department's ability to enforce federal law effectively and ethically'' and so fulfill the Department's statutory responsibilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crisp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 467 U.S. 691, 700 (1984) (authority to regulate extends to all regulatory actions necessary to ensure the achievement of statutory responsibilities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``presumption against finding preemption of state law in areas traditionally regulated by the States,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> California <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ARC America Corp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 490 U.S. 93, 101 (1989), and the traditional state regulation of legal practice and lawyers' ethics,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flynt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 439 U.S. 438, 442 (1979), does not foreclose the Attorney General from concluding that it is appropriate here to displace those state rules that regulate the conduct of federal officials in the performance of their law enforcement duties. Here, the presumption against preemption is overcome by this regulation's express preemption provision, which is fully effective even in matters traditionally occupied by the states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, under the intergovernmental immunity doctrine, states may not directly regulate or punish federal officials for acts undertaken in their official capacities, or otherwise substantially interfere with the lawful functions of federal officials.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hancock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Train <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 426 U.S. 167, 178&hyph;79 (1976);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M'Culloch <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maryland <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 316, 437 (1819); Ethical Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op.

Contacts covered by this regulation fall within the scope of federal attorneys' duties to carry out the law enforcement activities of the United States. The application to those attorneys of state ethics laws prohibiting such conduct therefore would constitute interference with the activities of the federal government forbidden by the intergovernmental immunity doctrine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

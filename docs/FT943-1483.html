			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's lowers debt rating of IBJ to A1 Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, yesterday lowered the long-term debt rating of Industrial Bank of Japan, a leading Japanese long-term credit bank, to A1 from Aa3. The agency said the bank faced continued weak profitability due to larger-than-expected asset quality problems and the bank's weak retail base. Moody's said it expected the bank's profit margins to remain low, constraining its ability to solve its bad loan problems. IBJ is regarded as one of Japan's leading wholesale banks, and retains a strong influence on companies. Moody's decision is likely to hurt an already weakening investor confidence toward Japanese banks, which have been severely hit by mounting bad loans. Moody's said although the bank held large unrealised gains on securities holdings, which could be used to offset the low profit margins, the volatile Japanese stock and bond markets could hamper attempts to realise profits on its portfolio. However, the agency added that IBJ still held a wide range of clientele, and would benefit from deregulation in the financial sector, which would allow banks to move further into the securities business.</p>

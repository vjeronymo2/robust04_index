			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH WILL VETO RAPE AND INCEST ABORTION BILL, WHITE HOUSE SAYS  </P> <P> President Bush will veto a bill allowing federally financed abortions in cases  of rape and incest after giving up efforts to find a compromise, his spokesman  said today.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the provision, part of a  spending bill already approved by a House-Senate conference committee and the  full House, will be vetoed once it wins final Senate approval.  </P> <P> The White House had previously hinted that a veto was likely. Today, Fitzwater  said it flatly.  </P> <P> The White House abandoned the bid for a compromise after Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu met for a second day Monday with leading anti-abortion congressmen.  </P> <P> "We talked to people on all sides of the issue. . . . We couldn't find any  flexibility," Fitzwater said today.  </P> <P> Bush last week he said he was seeking "room for flexibility" to avert a veto.  </P> <P> Congressional Democratic leaders have already conceded that they do not have  enough votes to override a veto of the measure, which has already passed the  House.  </P></p>

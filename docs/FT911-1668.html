			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Sir George Pollock, an architect of the CBI: Obituary SIR George Pollock, QC, one of the principal architects and founders of the Confederation of British Industry, has died aged 90. Sir George, who ran away from school to join the merchant navy, later worked as a journalist while he studied for the Bar. He took silk in 1928 and in 1938 made legal history when he successfully defended at petty sessions a woman on a murder charge. Previously, people charged with murder had always been committed for trial at the assizes. Sir George had a distinguished service record during the second world war, which included a period preparing teams of saboteurs intended to operate if Germany successfully invaded Britain. After the war, he served in North Africa and Italy as a colonel on the general staff and as chief judicial officer to the Allied Control Commission. In 1946, he became recorder of Sudbury but in 1954 left the Bar and began a new career as director of the British Employers' Confederation. In 1965, he was one of the guiding lights behind the merger of the Confederation, the Federation of British Industries and the National Association of Manufacturers into the Confederation of British Industry. He later served as a senior consultant to the CBI on international labour affairs and acted as the representative of British employers on the governing body of the International Labour Organisation. He was a member of the Donovan Royal Commission on Trade Unions' and Employers' Associations from 1965 to 1968. He leaves a son and daughter from the first of two marriages.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 1627): </F> "Fourth Plenary Session of 14th CPC Central Committee To Be  Held in Second Half of This Year"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- As disclosed by  authoritative sources here, the Fourth Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee is scheduled for the second half of  this year. The Fourth Plenary Session will make a decision on  the issue of macroregulation and control of socialist market  economy; and the issue of large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises and agriculture will also be the main topics at this  plenary session.    It is said that the other day, the central authorities  pooled  personnel from relevant departments and formed a group which  shall be responsible for writing the plenary session's documents  and, in accordance with the relevant decisions made by the  top-level CPC authorities and on the basis of full procurement,  analysis, investigation, and study of the various situations at  home, will draw on the relevant experience of other countries  and draft reports for the session.    It was revealed that the CPC top echelon believes that to  practice socialist market economy, it is necessary to study the  issue of implementing macroregulation and control in the context  of a market economy. In exercising macroregulation and control,  an overall framework should be produced and fundamental measures  recommended, just like the decision made at the Third Plenary  Session. The CPC top echelon also thinks that the  macroregulation and control exercised in the context of market  economy should concentrate on the use of economic levers and  legal means. Administrative means are necessary under certain  circumstances, but as far as the overall macroregulation and  control are concerned, it should not be used as a chief mode of  regulation and control.    The authoritative sources said that the theme of the Fourth  Plenary Session recommended by the CPC top echelon has positive  and immediate significance and considerations. The Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed a  structural frame for the socialist market economic system. What  the Fourth Plenary Session will seek to solve are new issues  concerning management under this new structure. Recently,  several standing committee members of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee went to various places around the  country to conduct investigation and research. For instance,  General Secretary Jiang Zemin went to Shanghai, Premier Li Peng  to Jiangsu and Shanghai, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to a number  of provinces and municipalities. All of them went on those  inspection tours with the same goal in mind, to obtain  first-hand material.</p>

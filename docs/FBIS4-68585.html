			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Malyshkov, deputy mayor of the </F> Government of Moscow and chief of the department of consumer  services and the market, under the rubric "Trade: Analysis,  Projections": "The Shops Have Been Privatized: The Entire Sense  of the Privatization of Trade Is To Serve the People"]    [Text] Privatization of the trade sector has opened the  gates to the path of the development of market relations in our  country. Denationalization should be viewed as a process of  transition to a variety of ownership arrangements, new forms of  economic operations, and entrepreneurship, as a means to bring  dynamism to our entire economy by enhancing labor incentives.    Why did the trade sector advance to the forefront of  privatization, where particularly decisive actions are needed?  Because simply no advancement toward a market economy is  possible until the system of bureaucratic distribution of the  manufactured product is broken down. For many years there was  concern about how to distribute "properly," from whom to take  things and to whom to give them. It was precisely this system  for distributing anything and everything that was one of the  pillars of the command economy, and of the shadow economy that  complemented it.    Time has indicated the intrinsic inability of the state  trade  sector to provide real incentives to producers, to animate  transactions between urban and rural areas, and to stimulate  activities in the acquisition of goods. The economy was  structured on the basis of the laws of direct distribution,  without effective feedback for the entire set of parameters in  the national economy. However, the quality of products,  abundance of merchandise, and integrity of trade cannot be  ensured by dictum but are rather shaped by economic conditions.  The customer, the buyer has one eternal inalienable right--the  right to choose in the marketplace by "voting" with his wallet.  This is an important feature of the political freedom of the  individual.    At the same time, the distributive system turned out to be a  quite costly activity associated with maintenance of a huge  apparatus for the distribution of goods at all levels and within  all organizations (within planning organs, ministries, soviets  at all levels, and so on). It is proper to note that the  distributive system is congenitally conducive to abuse,  speculation, and corruption. Speculation itself is the blood  child of the state monopoly on the production of and trade in  consumer goods. It is also exceptionally important that a market  economy make it possible for the country to become an integral  part of the world economy and take advantage of a division of  labor of this kind. To this end, common rules for  entrepreneurship, the freedom to trade in goods, a stable  currency, and most importantly, a rule-of-law civic society are  needed.    Along with other measures, privatization of the trade sector  is called upon to change the situation fundamentally: to  eliminate the administrative superstructure, to usher in  competition, and to overcome merchandise shortages which, even  if they did not occur naturally, were generated artificially.  Shaping a social market mechanism and a free trade sector  capable of keeping demand and supply on the market in balance is  a means rather than an end. The social role of the trade sector  is being enhanced. Defense of consumer interests is the  strategic path of its development. Trade is the sector in which  the quickest and most radical changes in ownership arrangements  and a high degree of privatization can be expected.    More than 90 percent of shops and public catering and  consumer service enterprises have been privatized in Moscow.  This is a lot, considerably more than in any other region of the  country. The process of "minor" privatization has become  irreversible; apparently, it will be virtually over shortly.    As is known, Moscow proceeded to privatize enterprises in  the  service sector virtually from scratch: There was still no  regulatory foundation. Much has been accomplished. It is never  easy for the trailblazers. All aspects of "minor" privatization  Moscow-style have drawn criticism: what has been accomplished  hastily, what has not been accomplished yet, and the manner in  which things have been accomplished.    Have mistakes been allowed to occur? Yes, they have, and  major, fundamental mistakes at that. However, the criticism that  is still being leveled is not necessarily well-argued,  substantiated, and convincing at all times. There is a lot of  extraneous politicking in such criticism. It is written and said  that privatization in the sector has accomplished nothing, that  trade outlets are "getting fat," and that customer services have  deteriorated.    We learn by comparison. Let us recall the fall of  1991--complete disintegration of the market, empty stores,  humiliating lines, a feeling of hopelessness. There were a great  many predictions of famine, cold times, and rebellion. These  projections have not come true; the market is being restored. It  is an elementary truth that we should proceed from the fact that  the daughter (the trade sector) is like her mother (the economy)  in order to understand correctly what happened and is happening  in the trade sector and to evaluate privatization in a  substantiated manner. The trade sector is a snapshot of the  condition of society, its barometer. There is no reason to  attach hopes to a "correct" barometer when the weather is bad.  Past ills and present-day miscalculations afflict the trade  sector perhaps more than anything else.    Now it is already possible to say that there is a light at  the end of the tunnel. His Majesty the Merchandise is the main  player in the market. A shortage of consumer goods was a  "birthmark" of our entire history when the  command-administrative system existed. In terms of theory and  practice, dogma was adopted to the effect that consumer demand  must continuously outstrip the production of goods and their  supply to the population. In short, demand cannot be met under  socialism, and the tired word "deficit" is eternal.    The notion of "real income" has long become a convention  because it is impossible to name a class of merchandise for  which demand was met in full. According to approximate  estimates, in the prosperous year 1970 (for which some people  are still nostalgic) 20 percent of the increment of savings, and  in 1978 as much as 53 percent--was generated due to pent-up  demand.    In the years that followed, the "infusion" of money not  backed up by goods became cataclysmic and ultimately finished  off the trade sector. The hope that the consumers would be able  to buy inexpensive goods, albeit at the price of standing in  lines, was less and less justified. Quite a few people could not  buy such goods, and the money issued to the population was  patently depreciated.    The monetary income of citizens consistently exceeded the  growth of the total volume of sales and paid services. At the  same time, the hidden growth of state retail prices occurred and  the quality of goods sold at old prices worsened. This entire  shortage of products was not due to the poverty of the country:  After all, the country was capable of being second to none in  terms of military might. Those were the fruits of a certain  choice, of an ideology, in a word--of the implementation of  postulates to the effect that, unlike under capitalism, demand  here should outpace the production of goods and push it along;  such was, allegedly, the advantage of our state. The crisis of  the system brought about a veritable free fall of production  which made for the most acute shortage.    As recently as one to two years ago the shelves of many of  our stores were, as the saying goes, a wide open space. Although  not everywhere, the counters are now filled with merchandise  which the customers hardly saw as being available for  unrestricted sale even in better times. Enterprises have  appeared which are not inferior to the best contemporary models  in terms of saturation with merchandise, techniques and  organization of trade, and customer service. The following have  become the most characteristic signs: full economic independence  of enterprises, direct contacts with suppliers, abandonment of  the practice of quota allocation with its paper trails and theft  of funds and the time of a tremendous number of employees, and  finally the emergence of new stores reaching the level of world  standards.    Look at GUM [Main Department Store], which recently  celebrated its centennial. Its collective has taken the path of  creating a world-class trading house. No, this is not an attempt  to "sell GUM to foreigners lock, stock, and barrel," as some  "specialists" maintain. The purpose is different: The  shareholders are searching for and finding partners who will  redouble their efforts to organize a modern trade enterprise.  Large wholesale and retail associations such as Master-Leader,  Olbi, Roditi, Office-Club, and many others have made their  presence felt. Joint ventures with many countries are  successfully operating in the capital, including the  Moscow-McDonald's, the Moscow Pizza, the MOS-Dannone  Russian-French joint venture, the Russian-German venture  Taki-Moscow, and so on. The old-timer McDonald's restaurant and  its two younger "brothers" are particularly popular. Interest in  expanding joint commercial activities is apparent not only in  the capital but also in other cities. An improvement in the  standard of service and the introduction of new  technologies--naturally, on the basis of mutual interest and  advantage--are the fruits of such cooperation.    Would you like to see the stores that are the jewels of the  trade sector in the capital city on all scores? If so, visit the  Novoarbatskiy Delicatessen and the Tverskoy Delicatessen. They  have an extensive assortment of almost all fresh foodstuffs. The  stores have been converted to joint-stock format and work  without intermediaries. Therefore the proportion of the trade  sector in the prices of goods, for example, at the Tverskoy  Delicatessen is just over 11 percent--considerably less than  anywhere else. Having embarked on leasing four years ago, the  enterprise has been building up its sales, which amount to 1  billion rubles [R] per month at present. The delicatessen was  paired up with a bank as its co-owner. One more sign: Suppliers  from nearby and distant foreign countries trust the store with  their goods. Products sold on consignment, that is with  settlements with suppliers effected upon the sale of the goods  to the population, account for about 30 percent of sales.    There are many similar stores. However, there are still more  that unfortunately are a pain to behold, which operate on the  principle "I do as I please" and trample on the rules of trade.  Drunk with the freedom granted and the opportunities for easy  and quick profiteering, these trade "outlets," if you will,  practice abuse, taking no care of their own development. One  customer in two is cheated on weight or change at such  enterprises. They often sell inferior quality foodstuffs or even  those that pose a health risk. Of course, such are the  drawbacks, and we will restore order in this area.    However, let us go back to privatization. The picture would  be lamentable at present had Moscow not hastened to make this  effort and was still receiving goods in keeping with the "plan"  and allocated "quotas." State deliveries which were planned last  year and at the beginning of this year have, as the saying goes,  failed miserably. The capital city received, and still receives,  less than one-half of the promised deliveries. About 55 percent  of the foodstuffs used by Muscovites have been purchased and  already shipped in by new entrepreneurial structures. Almost 100  percent of the products are procured in this manner in the case  of many manufactured goods. These are the first fruits of a  pick-up in the trade sector, its contribution to provisioning  this city of many millions.    Let us look at another aspect of the issue--the social  structure of sales. It is changing rapidly and quite  substantially in terms of ownership arrangements. For the first  time, the shoppers of Russia left less money at state trade  establishments than at nonstate establishments. At present the  former account for just 46 percent. The proportion of private  trade comes to 40 percent, and that of consumer cooperatives to  approximately 14 percent.    Retail trade is the leader in the domestic economy in terms  of privatization: At present 40,000 stores, stands, cafeterias,  and cafes belong to private individuals. This accounts for just  8 percent and appears to be little. However, this small segment  of privatized enterprises has the same volume of sales as the  entire state trade, and even more if the sales of consumer  cooperatives are taken into account.    State shops are inferior in terms of not only merchandise  sales but also profit margins: They are 1.5 times greater for  private "outlets," and if measured by the effectiveness of  outlays (the ratio of profits to the cost of  distribution)--twice as large.    Of course, retail prices charged by private operators are  1.5  times higher than those in state stores. However, let us repeat  that the huge distributive apparatus associated with the  practice of quota allocation, the issuance of requisition slips  to pick up goods, and so on has been eliminated. As a result,  the total volume of sales in 1993 exceeded that in the previous  year by 4 percent. Please note that it went up rather than down.  The use of food staples in natural units--meat and meat  products, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, sugar, and  confectioneries--also increased.    However, let us be fair: Some problems are being solved,  whereas others are at an impasse, and new problems are also  developing. As a rule the former state and municipal enterprises  have privatized in the capital city in the form of the property  of labor collectives. At present, only 30 percent of them have  sale-and-purchase contracts and certificates of property rights.  This means that almost two-thirds of privatized enterprises are  "suspended" between the earth and the heavens, between being  state-owned and being private. Virtually not one of them has a  legally valid land-use document (for the place where the trade  outlet is located).    Therefore, on one hand, most stores are listed as having  owners while, on the other hand, their collectives, strictly  speaking, act as hired labor. Naturally, such "owners" do not  take the risk of investing funds in sales expansion and  development of their physical plant. Their interest lies in  pumping profits into their own wages as quickly as possible.    Regulatory documents permit only two types of sales--at  auction and through "rigid" competition in the form of tender by  invitation. However, other more efficient techniques are known  in world practice, for example, directed sales to those who will  offer better conditions for the operation of a trade outlet  rather than to the one who pays more. As we see it, it is  feasible to incorporate a new notion into the state  privatization program: public bidding with fixed conditions.  This would become a formidable obstacle to those fond of  behind-the-scenes deals. We can say that at present the most  effective forms of sale fall outside the domain of our  operations.    Incidentally, it is worthwhile to mention that in the  relatively well-to-do East Germany plants were frequently sold  at the conventional price of... 1 mark, against an investment  commitment. The federal government spent tens of billions of  marks to upgrade enterprises to be sold instead of lapsing into  rosy dreams about some kind of fabulous profits from the sale of  its own losses.    Analysis of the data on the progress of privatization  indicates convincingly that enterprises of the former state  trade sector are increasingly becoming the collectively shared  property of the labor collectives. Such enterprises include the  largest department stores, restaurants, shopping centers,  self-service stores, and wholesale warehouses. Despite the short  duration of operation after privatization, many of them have  proven that, having become owners, they operate successfully and  compete against private operators and commercial structures,  retain the specialization of enterprises, boost sales volumes,  and enhance the level of social guarantees for employees.    Statistics that reflect the choice of a particular mode of  privatization also merit some thinking. Auctions have not become  very widespread, despite support for them from an unceasing  propaganda campaign. To this day the practice of buying out  leased property is favored, especially in the sphere of retail  trade. On one hand, this is a concession to the interests of  labor collectives. On the other, this is a statement of fact:  Real competition in the market of trade-sector property is  absent. It turns out that actually it is not all that easy to  find other owners who are prepared to invest their money in  primitive counters and dilapidated buildings with an engineering  "filling" that has long since become obsolete. We cannot fail to  notice a sad fact--a sharp slowdown in the development of the  material and technical facilities of the sector.    Auctions are the most common form of sale, but not the only  one. An opportunity to conduct competitive sales is envisioned.  The advantages of holding a competition are obvious. At issue  are primarily the interests of the population. One owner will  open a disco bar instead of a bakery, while another would also  open a bakery at the Bread store. Besides, retention of  specialization (commodity mix, level of sales, services) for  three years is a compulsory condition for competitions. These  commitments must be included in the contract during the  subsequent resale of the facility if such occurs before the end  of the three-year term.    Unfortunately, "minor" privatization has its own problems,  too. Profits received by trade enterprises do not ensure their  financial stability. According to various calculations, the  amounts of withholdings reduce eventual profits by one-half.  Subsequent payments to the budget and the payment of numerous  taxes and fees reduce the remaining one-half by that much again.  The residual, which, as is known, is not necessarily "sweet," is  very small: It is not even enough to buy merchandise. The  federal budget does not envision funds for the existence of  trade enterprises. Local organs of power are their only hope.  The need for investment is vast in the trade sector. As it is,  the spontaneous winding down of its material and technical  facilities is underway. For example, in 1992 the number of  stores fell by almost one-fourth.    Support from the state is vital in the course of a  transition  to market relations, especially at the initial stage. For  example, the upstart traders in foodstuffs are exempt from the  turnover tax and the profit tax for two years, and those selling  manufactures--for one year.    Let us sum up what has been said. Privatization of the trade  sector in Russia, including that in Moscow, is without precedent  as to scale and not comparable to the experience of any other  country of the world, even if we look at the enormous technical  difficulties with its forms, the voucher system, and the  appraisal of facilities to be privatized and their assets. The  privatization program approved by the Supreme Soviet of Russia  accords unjustifiably great preferences to labor collectives.  Obviously, it hardly makes sense to change the rules of  privatization while it is in progress at the risk of triggering  major social conflicts. Apparently the current stage of  privatization must be completed and the rules should be  perfected gradually by mutual accord rather than by way of  someone's dictate.    The main difficulty is found in the fact that property has  already been distributed, but active control over it by the new  owners is absent. In this instance the role of both the  management and the labor collectives is overstated. Therefore,  the task is to create effective owners, and to devise rules and  procedures for the redistribution of property, a system  counteracting all attempts at squandering property. It is  important to accomplish a transition from a system of handing  out property almost free of charge to the sale of property, from  unconditional privatization to privatization predicated on  additional investment and conditions that protect consumer  interests and rights.    It is now equally significant to reinforce the  accountability  of those who buy privatized enterprises. The conditions of the  purchase-and-sale contracts must be strictly complied with in  this instance. To this end, contracts should envision all the  necessary conditions for exemplary services to the population,  and effective forms of monitoring compliance with them and harsh  sanctions for violating such conditions should be envisioned on  our part.    The trade sector is called upon not just to sell goods.  Serving customers in an exemplary manner is an equally important  task. The lofty mission of the trade sector is to serve the  people. This is what the meaning of privatization in the trade  sector is all about.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / British Gas says it may have to cut 15,000 jobs BRITISH GAS could be forced to cut as many as 15,000 jobs or 20 per cent of its workforce in its core gas business over the next couple of years because of increasing competition and regulatory pressure. But Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the company's plans depend on the outcome of an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is due to make its report by the end of July. By the end of this year, British Gas plans to cut around 4,000 jobs in its UK gas business division - about 1,000 more than previously planned - and just over 1,200 among its headquarters staff. The cost-cutting move is being prompted by a squeeze on British Gas's profits from a price cap on household sales and the growth of competition in the industrial and commercial market. Competition and regulatory pressure led to a Pounds 75m reduction in first-quarter profits on sales in the UK, but this was largely offset by lower gas purchase costs and growth in British Gas's overseas operations. Overall, first-quarter profits slipped by Pounds 8m to Pounds 650m after the exploration and production division showed a Pounds 60m increase in profit to Pounds 175m. The UK gas business reported a drop in profit to Pounds 743m from Pounds 789m. Mr Brown said the MMC report would have an important effect on future profitability: 'The ability for the company to expand and prosper depends on getting a fair reward for investment. The alternative is a damaging squeeze on profits.' He said that if the household supply market were opened up to competition, some customers would gain price savings of as much as 15 per cent. But British Gas estimates that only 6m - a third - of its customers would gain and 12m households would end up paying more, some as much as 90 per cent more. In an effort to encourage competitors into the market for high-volume, low price sales - the so-called interruptible market - British Gas is discussing setting up peak sales trading. This would help rivals to balance supply and demand by providing a marketplace for excess gas where large users could buy cheap supplies. Legal action threat, Page 10 Lex, Page 22</p>

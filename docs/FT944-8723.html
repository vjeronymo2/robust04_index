			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK generators The British government initially had qualms over allowing the electricity generators to buy their own equity as part of its Pounds 4bn share sale next year. The Treasury feared such a move might compromise its goal of wider share ownership. But the Treasury's qualms were swept aside once it appreciated how buy-backs should benefit the exchequer. By cancelling shares, National Power and, possibly, PowerGen will enhance earnings per share, so increasing the price the government can demand for its stakes. That price should be further supported by the fact that there will be fewer shares flooding the market. From National Power's perspective, one cannot fault the principle of reducing its equity. In fact, the company should be spending more than Pounds 500m-plus to shrink its capital base. After the buy-back, National Power will still be able to spend Pounds 1bn on overseas investment and keep its gearing in the 20-30 per cent range. Another quibble is the method it has chosen. By buying direct from the government, no shareholders will enjoy a tax break. If instead it had issued a mega-dividend or bought shares through a tender, some investors would have benefited from the tax credit. Though the buy-back is positive for National Power, investors should currently be wary of buying either of the generators' shares. Brokers who are keen to be part of the Treasury's sale have in recent months been pumping out fat notes singing the companies' virtues. Such one-way publicity has arguably already inflated their share prices.</p>

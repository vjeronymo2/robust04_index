			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour braced for unfraternal debate - A look at today's meeting about the party's roots THE anguished debate about Labour's union links, which sputtered into life after the party's election defeat, looks set to run and run. The party's national executive is today expected to endorse a review of those links which will reach a climax at the party conference next year. Unfortunately for Labour, the possibility of the debate remaining objective and good-tempered is almost nil. The union link is an emotional issue going to the heart of what people think the party is for. Further, both wings of the debate - those who want a complete split and those who want little change - have powerful arguments on their side. Supporters of the link argue that without the block vote and the common sense of union leaders the party would merely reflect the passions of middle-class constituency activists and be even less electable than it now is. The unions give the party roots and cash and are therefore entitled to some say in its policy forums. If general affiliation was ended, it is argued, it would produce US-style 'pork-barrel' politics with unions picking and choosing between parties and politicians. Supporters of the status quo include influential union leaders such as Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, the biggest union affiliated to Labour. Those in favour of a complete break, including at least one Labour frontbench spokesman, do not deny that the unions have been a stabilising influence on the party in the past few decades. Unions, they say, may not be unpopular, but Labour's link with a declining lobby group for producer interests is unpopular with voters assessing a potential government. Supporters of a complete institutional break say Labour and the unions would continue to share broad policy objectives and values and see no reason why unions should not go on funding the party. Union leaders have expressed bitterness at the fact that they are being blamed for Labour's defeat. But equally the 'no say, no pay' rhetoric of some union leaders should not hide the fact that most recognise that a re-ordering of the link is required. The GMB general union, like several senior Labour politicians, is attracted by the idea of 'associate' Labour membership for the 4.5m union members who pay the political levy - many of them unwittingly. Such people would become local party members but would have only one third of the voting power of a full member. At national level the electoral college, on which the unions now have a 40 per cent vote, would be de-unionised. The block vote at conference would come down to 50 per cent from the current 90 per cent and would not be cast as a block. The 12 union seats on the 24-strong national executive - and reserved union seats on the national policy forum - might also be reduced. Unlike Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing party leader, Mr John Smith - the favourite to succeed him - does not like doing deals in smoke-filled rooms. He instinctively supports the widest possible move to one member, one vote at local level, but he is unlikely to want a complete split. Diluting the union role by raising the number of interest groups which have a say in party forums - such as those on local government or consumers - is being considered. That, however, will hardly improve Labour's chances of speaking for the general interest.</p>

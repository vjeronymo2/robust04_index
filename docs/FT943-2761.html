			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pearson ups Recoletos stake to 47% Pearson, the media and entertainment group, has increased its stake in Recoletos, the Spanish publishing group, to 47 per cent. The additional stake of 8 per cent cost about Pounds 12.4m, valuing the company, which publishes Expansion, the business and financial daily, at about Pounds 155m. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, bought a small stake in Recoletos more than five years ago when he was chief executive of the Financial Times. It was part of a policy of taking stakes in publishers of business and financial titles around the world. Since then Pearson has been building its stake in the group with the consent of the Spanish shareholders. It seems likely that Pearson will eventually take control of the group, which also publishes Marca, Spain's top seven-days-a-week sports paper. The Recoletos titles also include Telva, a women's magazine, and Diario Medico, a daily medical paper.</p>

The meeting was addressed by Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of  the Belarusian Council of Ministers. Focusing on economic  reform, he confirmed the government's unfailing devotion to a  market economy with well-considered changes excluding "shock  therapy," which proved to be the wrong course of action in other  states.    "Belarusian reforms will be continued," said the prime  minister. "Slowing them down is completely out of the question.  At the same time, our policy will be aimed at deepening our  economic integration with Russia. However, we will have the  actual result only after the unification of the two monetary  systems and the establishment of an exchange rate acceptable to  Belarus."    Concerning the practical side of the given issue, the head  of  the Cabinet of Ministers noted the positive progress of  negotiations. V. Kebich reported that a group of specialists  from the Russian Central Bank was working in Minsk. They were  finalizing the coordination of exchange rates for the national  currencies and the policy of issuing money.    The issue of balancing prices for energy resources imported  to Belarus from Russia also requires a resolution. According to  the Belarusian side, import prices must be unified and  approximated to local oil and gas prices for Russian enterprises.    The chairman of the Council of Ministers denied  categorically  the accusations from the Belarusian Popular Front directed  against the government regarding its "restrictions on the  sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Belarus."  According to V. Kebich, "the course toward the deepening of  Belarusian integration with Russia is a way toward the salvation  of its economic and national interests."</p>

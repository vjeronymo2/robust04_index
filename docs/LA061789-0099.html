			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISSIDENTS MAY STEER UAW CONFAB ON NEW COURSE  </P> <P> A loose-knit group of dissidents within the United Auto Workers, angered by the  union's increasing cooperation with auto industry management, is considering  forming an organized opposition union caucus that would operate independently  of the UAW's current hierarchy.  </P> <P> The dissident group, called New Directions, may use the union's national  convention beginning Sunday at the Anaheim Convention Center as the forum for  announcing a more structured opposition inside the UAW -- an organization that  would have its own staff and even collect dues from willing members.  </P> <P> If New Directions goes ahead with the plan, it would represent the most serious  challenge to the authority of the leadership of the million-member industrial  union in decades.  </P> <P> New Directions leaders and supporters say they won't decide until the six-day  convention is under way whether to create such an organization. But even  without a formal structure, New Directions has already shaken the union to its  foundations, forcing a union-wide debate on what direction the UAW and the  labor movement in general should take into the 1990s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stage Set in Spring Elections  </P> <P> The Anaheim convention, in fact, is likely to become the focal point for that  debate and is almost certain to go down as one of the most controversial UAW  gatherings in years.  </P> <P> The dissidents, holding perhaps as many as 200 seats in the 2,000-delegate  convention, seek to open up a floor debate on a wide range of procedural and  philosophical issues that they believe need to be addressed to make the union  more responsive to the rank-and-file.  </P> <P> "New Directions will be trying to bring democracy back to our union," said  Victor Reuther, the 77-year-old brother of the UAW's legendary Walter Reuther  and now a supporter of the New Directions group.  </P> <P> The stage for the Anaheim fight was set in regional union elections this  spring, when two of New Directions' leaders, Don Douglas and Jerry Tucker, ran  spirited, though unsuccessful, campaigns against the administration of UAW  President Owen Bieber and his willingness to cooperate more fully with  management on a wide range of shop-floor issues. Douglas and Tucker opposed  Bieber's acceptance of Japanese-style "team concept" agreements and related  labor-management programs now in dozens of U.S. auto plants.  </P> <P> In their campaign for positions as regional directors who sit on the UAW's  22-member governing executive board, Tucker and Douglas exploited the growing  frustration among the rank-and-file over such joint programs to mount serious  challenges against Bieber-endorsed candidates.  </P> <P> "There is more dissent in the UAW today because there is a lack of leadership  in the union on these issues," said Douglas. "The people are trying to let the  administration (of the UAW) know that we've got problems."  </P> <P> UAW leaders and auto executives say that "team" programs are necessary if the  U.S. auto industry is to remain competitive with Japanese car makers. But the  dissidents respond that such programs undermine the contractual rights of union  members and don't offer any real job security, pointing to instances in which  workers have accepted such programs only to be laid off later on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Lot of Rhetoric'  </P> <P> "Despite these joint programs, the problems we have had are not being  addressed," complained Frank Hammer, president of UAW Local 909 in Warren,  Mich., who supports Douglas. "To a lot of the members, this jointness is just a  lot of rhetoric, something that is not backed up with any change in the way  people are treated."  </P> <P> In the end, Douglas and Tucker narrowly lost their efforts to win enough  delegates to be elected at the convention as regional directors -- but not  before putting a scare into the UAW leadership. Douglas, a union local  president from Pontiac, Mich., won a series of landslides in a number of big  General Motors plants in his race for a Detroit-area regional directorship, and  only lost after the incumbent, Robert Lent, made a comeback at Chrysler plants  where he had spent much of his early union career.  </P> <P> Tucker, who won a court-ordered election for the St. Louis-area directorship  last year after a bitter fight with the UAW leadership, lost in his bid for  reelection after Bieber mounted a fierce campaign to unseat him. The UAW's  leadership demanded that every staff member of the international union  contribute $500 to a campaign fund to defeat Tucker; Roy Wyse, the  international's candidate, eventually won.  </P> <P> But both Douglas and Tucker won enough delegates to the convention, where the  actual election of regional directors and other union officers will be held  next Wednesday, to form a vocal minority on the convention floor. They will be  sure to use that voting power to raise their charges of election fraud against  the UAW leadership. New Directions charges that the international union abused  its power -- and got help from management, in some cases -- to defeat Douglas  and Tucker.  </P> <P> Although the two dissidents are likely to lose a credentials fight in which  they hope to challenge delegates supporting Lent and Wyse, they are almost  certain to take their charges to court after the convention.  </P></p>

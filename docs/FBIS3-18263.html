For decades there had never been any double-digit losses for  any party at German Landtag elections. The first time this  happened was at the elections in Bremen in September 1991, when  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] plummeted from 50.5  to 38.8 percent, a decline of 11.7 percent. Two years later the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] lost 10 percent in the  elections in Hamburg.    Now virtually devastating defeats are in the offing for the  CDU in eastern Germany. In all likelihood, it will sink like a  plane whose engines have failed at the Landtag elections there.    At the moment its losses, compared with the Landtag  elections  of 14 October 1990, are between 13 percent in Brandenburg and 21  percent in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, as a poll conducted by  the Bielefeld Emnid Institute for DER SPIEGEL at the beginning  of February showed. According to this poll, the CDU has lost  1.2 million voters.    In three laender the party lost half of its followers. It  keeps only meager remnants of 20 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, 17  percent in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and 16 percent in  Brandenburg. There is no western land where the CDU is as weak;  even in Hamburg it gets as much as 25.1 percent.    In Thuringia, too, where the CDU missed the absolute  majority  in the Landtag by only one seat in the 1990 elections, it has  now fallen behind the SPD. Only in Saxony, where in 1990 one  out of two people voted for the CDU and just one out of five for  the SPD, the CDU is the strongest party, according to Emnid.  However, the distance between CDU and SPD has shrunk from 34.7  percent at the previous elections to 8 percent now.    The reason for this debacle: Too many people trusted  Chancellor Kohl, who won the election campaigns in 1990 with the  promise that the former GDR would turn into "flourishing  landscapes within four or five years."    Already a few weeks later the mood sobered. At the beginning  of March the CDU had sunk to 24 percent in eastern Germany, and  even though there have been a few fluctuations since then, it  has never recovered from this low.    In Saxony Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf has not been  able to prevent his party's losses, only reduce them. And he  managed that only because he is one of the most popular German  heads of government.    Saxony's CDU voters revere him like their compatriots used  to  revere August the Strong [1670-1733, elector of Saxony]. He  reached plus 4.1 on the plus 5/minus 5 popularity scale -- more  is hardly possible, not even President von Weizsaecker gets such  excellent marks. Even Saxony's SPD voters like the CDU head of  government better than the head of the SPD opposition in the  Landtag.    For many Saxons the head of government is rather removed  from  everyday politics. If one asks about Biedenkopf's policy, far  more men and women express a positive view than if one asks  about the policy of the land government -- as if the  minister-president did not sit in government but rested on a  throne above it.    According to Emnid, the Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] declined from 8 percent in July 1993 to 5 percent in  October 1993 and to 3 percent now. However, even if it got into  the Landtag again, the CDU and the FDP together would not get  the majority. From today's point of view, Biedenkopf could only  enter into a grand coalition with the SPD; unless he allied  himself with the Greens -- which is more a subject for  soothsayers than for analysts at the moment.    In Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania a change of power will very likely take place after  the elections.    In Brandenburg, where Manfred Stolpe is as popular as  Biedenkopf in Saxony, the SPD won so many new followers that it  will probably no longer need two partners for a majority but can  choose between the Greens and the FDP.    Not only in Saxony is the FDP worse off in 1994 than it was  in 1990. Apart from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and  Brandenburg, it has lost strongly everywhere. While it seems to  be certain that it will remain in the Bundestag (currently 8  percent each in east and west), it must struggle for survival in  at least two Landtag elections.    In contrast to general assumption, the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] does not have far more followers than in the  past all over the former GDR but only in Brandenburg. The  Greens have improved their position and can hope for  double-digit results in all laender. It is also new that the  Republikaner are slightly below or above 5 percent in four  laender.    Polls such as the current one -- with 2,500 people polled,  distributed equally and representatively across the five laender  -- do not allow for precise forecasts for smaller parties.  Therefore, 3 percent does not mean the certain end of the FDP  in Saxony, and 5 percent for the Republikaner in Thuringia and  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania does not mean certain success.    Some results of the poll even permit the conclusion that  the Republikaner have more or less exhausted their potential and  will, in the end, fail in all five Landtag elections:    Only a few isolated followers of other parties cited the  Republikaner, when they were asked which party they like "second  best." Large majorities put it in "the last place." Apart from  their own followers, only a very few of those polled would  "welcome" the success of the Republikaner. And, in the east,  the PDS is the protest party; it collects many dissatisfied and  disappointed people, in addition to ultrareactionaries.    The only alarm signal: Among the younger voters between 18  and 30 there are far more followers and sympathizers of  Schoenhuber's party than there are among the older voters.    The election campaign has not yet begun in the five laender.  The Landtage will be elected in Saxony-Anhalt on 26 June, in  Saxony and probably also in Brandenburg on 11 September, in  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Thuringia (just a the  Bundestag) on 16 October.    However, things will probably not change very much until  then, because "right now there is not the slightest indication  of new developments," Emnid expert Klaus-Peter Schoeppner notes.    For many months unemployment has been the main topic in the  east; in contrast to the west, no other problem -- such as the  large number of asylum-seekers -- has been accorded similar  importance.    And for quite some time it has not been the CDU but the SPD  that is considered to be the party "best able to combat  unemployment."</p>

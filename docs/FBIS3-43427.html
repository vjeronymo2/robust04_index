			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The peace talks between the government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  should have resumed in Lusaka this afternoon after they were  interrupted on 24 December. The government negotiating team and  the group of observers in the peace process are already present  in the Zambian capital on the date set for the resumption of  talks -- 5 January. There is no confirmation of the presence in  Lusaka of the UNITA negotiating team, however. Faustino Muteka  from the government delegation who left for Lusaka yesterday,  accompanied by his colleagues, said on departure that the  government delegation has powers to negotiate everything.    UN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye has concluded  his visits to some African countries and left for the Zambian  capital today. Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon,  and Zaire are the countries whose presidents were contacted by  Alioune Blondin Beye during the break in the peace talks.  Before leaving for Lusaka, Alioune Blondin Beye gave assurances  that the peace talks would begin this afternoon. Alioune  Blondin Beye focused his statements, however, on contacts he  held in the countries mentioned above.    [Begin Beye recording] The objective was as usual aimed at  making use of the exceptional advantages that these countries  possess. As you know, the delegations from the government and  UNITA are already in Lusaka. I am very happy with this  situation because the news media organs gave other reasons for  the break in the peace talks. Fortunately, the government and  UNITA acted differently. I have, therefore, held contacts with  the heads of state of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe,  Gabon, and Zaire. There were two objectives for these visits --  first to brief them on [words indistinct] support for the peace  talks. [end recording]</p>

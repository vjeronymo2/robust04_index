			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The news agency DDP/ADN is to be  transformed into a workers' cooperative. The main shareholder  in DDP/ADN, Bolko Hoffmann, told the press in Berlin on  Wednesday [27 January] that the shares in the business are to be  transferred to all DDP/ADN workers on the model of the workers'  shares in the Hamburg news magazine DER SPIEGEL. This should  ensure the long-term existence of the company with its 250 or so  full and part-time jobs.    Hoffmann made it clear he had planned originally to time  this  step differently. However, the latest offer of a three-year  contract from the Federal Press Office (BPA) seriously  disadvantaged DDP/ADN in comparison with other competitors on  the news market. He did not want to sign this contract "because  it would have long-term effects of over a decade or longer."  Whereas no other agencies had to accept any cuts in their  subsidies, payments to DDP/ADN were to be reduced by almost 20  percent both in 1995 and 1996. This meant DDP/ADN was standing  "at a crossroads." Hoffmann said, "the editor in chief and the  editors will have to fight the necessary battle with the Federal  Press Office without me." However, at the same time he stressed  that he will "quite clearly continue to be available to the  agency."    The main shareholder sharply criticized the fact that the  Federal Press Office did not open news services to public  tender, even though the law expressly demanded this. The entire  foreign budget of DM [German marks] 11.25 million was awarded to  the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA), in spite of the Federal Audit  Office's strictures that this involved payment for services not  provided. The Federal Press Office had paid DPA fees of DM17  million, which enabled it to offer discounts of up to 75 percent  in eastern Germany. The effects of this persisted, particularly  since drastic discounts were still being offered. This dumping  was a clear violation of competition, Hoffmann said. This meant  DPA was able to conduct a "devastating price war" against its  competitors.    Hoffmann also pointed out that the news agency AFP, which  already received an unlawful 48 percent subsidy from the French  state, had received an additional Federal Press Office grant for  1993 at the expense of DDP/ADN.    He had to "say with a degree of bitterness" this "is  evidently a fresh example of how the Kohl government envisages  the `Upswing East' in the long term," Hoffmann said. He said  the company had been "modestly in the black" during 1992 and  1993 and was "absolutely healthy." The company's nominal  capital amounted to DM1 million and had at its disposal over  DM1.2 million in liquid funds. The decisions to be taken now,  therefore, concern not the year 1994 but the future of the  agency and its staff.    Hoffmann, majority shareholder in Effecten-Spiegel AG,  Duesseldorf, acquired the former GDR state agency ADN from the  Treuhand privatization agency in May 1992. In December 1993 he  merged it with Deutscher Depeschen Dienst (DDP), which he took  over in 1983.</p>

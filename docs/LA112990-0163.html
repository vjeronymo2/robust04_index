			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / TOURISM  </P> <P> Dumbo flies again: After being grounded for seven months, a new and improved  "Dumbo the Flying Elephant" ride has again taken to the air at Disneyland's  Fantasyland.  </P> <P> The ride was reopened last week after being closed for renovation in April,  following an accident in which one of its metal arms collapsed and slightly  injured a 13-year-old girl.  </P> <P> The incident came a year after a similar one in which a metal bracket holding  one of the flying Dumbos gave way. That mishap resulted in scrapes and bruises  to a family of three.  </P> <P> And Dumbo fans will be pleased to know that the ride, which opened in 1955, now  has 16 elephants, up from 10.  </P> <P> "It's a great-looking ride," said Disneyland spokesman John McClintock. The  renovation "addresses not only the mechanical concerns but makes it more  convenient."  </P></p>

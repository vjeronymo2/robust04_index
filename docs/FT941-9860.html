			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Hungary bans Nato overflights by Awacs Hungary yesterday hardened its opposition to international action against the Serbs, saying it would bar overflights by Nato surveillance aircraft in the event of an air strike against Bosnian Serb positions. Awacs airborne radar aircraft have been flying over Hungary since late 1992, but the Budapest Foreign Ministry said yesterday that Hungary had agreed to overflights only for aircraft monitoring the no-fly zone over Bosnia. 'Awacs aircraft cannot be present in Hungarian airspace if it (an attack) takes place, that is natural,' Mr Peter Boross, the Hungarian prime minister, said yesterday. 'Hungary will not take part. We have to live with Serbia and the Serbian people for hundreds more years.' Mr Boross also said that sanctions against Serbia were ineffective, adding to bitter government complaints that the embargo had cost Hungary Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), for which the international community had failed to make compensation. Mr Boross's statement, which western diplomats described as a 'departure', coincides with a warming in Hungary's relations with Serbia. At the end of January, Mr Geza Jeszenszky, the Hungarian foreign minister, met President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade. Hungary said it was taking a 'pragmatic' approach to relations with Serbia, but Belgrade hailed the visit as a breakthrough in bilateral relations. Hungary maintains that its policy is unchanged and strenuously denies the suggestion that it is breaking ranks with the international community to conclude a separate tacit arrangement with Serbia. The Foreign Ministry said Hungary was seeking integration into western institutions and could not risk its 'clean record and credibility'. A rapprochement with Serbia, however, would ease the plight of the 400,000 ethnic Hungarians in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Hungary fears they are vulnerable to 'silent ethnic cleansing'. Budapest has also asked Serbia to allow shipping to travel unhindered down the Danube to guarantee landlocked Hungary's vital waterway access to the Black Sea.</p>

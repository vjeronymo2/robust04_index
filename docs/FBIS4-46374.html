			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] The Shin Bet several days ago uncovered an  assassination attempt against Jibril al-Rujub, head of the  Palestinian preventive security service. Al-Rujub, who was in  Tulkarm that day, was informed he had better cancel a planned  visit to Nabulus because he can expect an unpleasant surprise  there.    The tension between the Palestinian police and Hamas  [Islamic  Resistance Movement] in the Gaza and Jericho autonomy areas is  increasing.</p>

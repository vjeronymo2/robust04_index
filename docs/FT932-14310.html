			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Many ADB projects 'failed' MORE than 60 per cent of Asian Development Bank projects scrutinised by bank staff last year either failed or were only 'partly successful', according to the ADB's 1992 annual report yesterday. The ADB said the average success rate for its aid projects had declined over the last five years, largely because the projects had become more complex and because more of them were directed at poorer member countries where they were more likely to fail. Last year, the ADB approved a total of Dollars 5.12bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in loans and investments, with the energy sector - power stations and transmission lines - taking the largest share and accounting for about 29 per cent of the total. Most of the projects evaluated by ADB officials in the course of 1992 dated back to the 1980s. Of the 28 projects chosen for evaluation, 11 were classified as 'generally successful', 12 as 'partly successful' and five as 'unsuccessful'. However, the definition 'partly successful' is controversial. For example an engineering education project in the Philippines was defined as 'partly successful' although, by the ADB's own admission, the facilities provided remained largely unused, the quality of engineering education had not improved as expected, and the examination pass rates for graduates of engineering schools under the project had in fact declined. Some ADB staff have criticised the prevailing attitude to failed projects, accusing the bank's managers at headquarters in Manila of simply wanting to spend more money instead of listening to the ADB's own post-evaluation office and learning how to spend money more effectively.</p>

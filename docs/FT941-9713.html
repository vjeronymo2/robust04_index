			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Werewolf' steps in and out of the fright genre Ken Hill has written and produced another shocker from the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Panting at the heels of The Invisible Man is The Curse of the Werewolf (pictured above). It could be a whisker more frightening and a bound or two faster, but it makes wonderful entertainment. The plot matters little for this horror-comedy-musical; setting is all. Take one Bavarian castle and people it with a mad scientist, a smooth German baron, four silly English aristocrats and a sinister Chief of Police, and the show appears to run itself. The fine set (Sarah-Jane McClelland) benefits from excellent lighting (Gerry Jenkinson), producing the requisite mix of moonlight and shadow. Hill's Invisible Man kept farce at bay by stepping in and out of the fright genre; the same will happen with Werewolf once the production settles, but it does risk camping up the action and losing the ripping story in a series of stagy set pieces. The show has a strong cast, some catchy tunes, and suits the friendly atmosphere of the theatre. Best of all, of course, are the moonlight transformations of Baron 'I must go and change' von Heilman. From the twitching of the hair on the back of his hands to the screaming of the heroine as he carries her off it is unremitting excitement. Elsewhere there is a ruined church, a super ski-run, the inevitable laboratory, a wolf grotto (certainly cave lupem) and plenty of deep Bavarian gloom put over in cod German and punctuated by the ululating wolves. 534 (Until March 19. 081 534 0310)</p>

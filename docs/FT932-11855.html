			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Tivoli gives Danes more than their share of fun THE typical shareholder in Copenhagen's Tivoli gardens, the world's oldest amusement park, owns just nine shares, the minimum number required to obtain free entry. Now entry costs DKr35 (Dollars 5.80), whereas nine shares have a stock market value of around DKr25,000. Why do people pay so much to save so little? 'It's inexplicable,' said Mr J. Birger Larsen, Tivoli's finance director. But it is not entirely so. Danes pay as an expression of their pride in, and affection for, Tivoli, a quintessentially Danish creation which this year celebrates its 150th anniversary. The shares are among the least liquid on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. There are just 155,000 A shares and 188,000 B shares, and they often become available only when one of the 11,200 shareholders dies. Boosted by the expectation that this year's 150th birthday will set a turnstile record, the shares have been selling at around DKr2,800 each, for a price-earnings ratio of 39. This puts a stock market value of DKr960m on Tivoli, in contrast to an asset value of DKr544m. Turnover last year was DKr253m and net profits totalled DKr24m. One of Tivoli's attractions is that it is on a prime site in the centre of the city, bounded on one side by the main railway station and the other by the City Hall. Last year, Tivoli purchased the site from the City Council for DKr234m, financed by a new issue. However, planning laws mean that the company can never use the site for any other purpose. Also, the city of Copenhagen has the right to reacquire the site after 100 years. Mr Orson Nielsen, public relations director, says that Tivoli ranks as the eighth most popular amusement park in the world by the number of visitors - just over 4m in a normal year. But the year consists of a season which lasts from mid-April to mid-September. Tivoli's popularity is based on its appeal to the Danes themselves. About 40 per cent of visitors are tourists. And its appeal? Among the firm principles on which the park is run are: no neon, no plastic and only live music. Add 876 trees, 134,700 spring bulbs, and thousands of bedding plants, and one begins to get an inkling of the charm which Tivoli exercises. There are rollercoasters, roundabouts, fruit machines and shooting galleries; and 28 restaurants cater for almost every taste and pocket. The open-air stage attracts many of the world's leading popular artists. There is a revue theatre and a jazz club. At the Tivoli Concert Hall, there are 134 concerts, mainly of classical music, in the course of the season. Unlike the Disneyland parks (Walt Disney dreamt up the idea of Disneyland while on a visit to Tivoli in the early 1950s), there are no restrictions on the sale of alcohol. The Carlsberg brewing group has a controlling interest through its holding of A shares, which have 10 times the voting power of B shares. There is considerable interest abroad in establishing amusement parks on the Tivoli formula. A subsidiary, Tivoli International, was set up a few years ago to design new parks. So far, only one park - 'a version, but not a copy' - is under construction. A DKr2.5bn, 82,000 sq. m. project in the Japanese city of Kurashiki is due to open in 1996.</p>

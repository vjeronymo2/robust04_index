			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / German office boom subsiding GERMANY'S office rent boom is running out of steam. The cost of space in Frankfurt, for example, is now only 3.5 per cent higher than a year ago, the RDM property agents' association said yesterday. During the previous year rents in Germany's main banking and business centre had risen by up to 16 per cent. The overall slowdown was less marked, thanks to strong demand in Berlin, Munich and Cologne. But average business rents still rose by only 8 per cent, compared with 15 per cent a year earlier. There is a danger of a build-up of unlet space in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Munich, the association said. Further slowing in rent rises is expected this year, because of economic uncertainty. Even so, there was no shortage of takers for best-quality, city-centre space, and the RDM viewed the outlook with cautious optimism. Average monthly rents in Frankfurt are now DM60 (Pounds 20.60) a square metre. Top rates of around DM90 compare with DM70 in Munich. New orders to west German manufacturers fell in June for the fourth month in succession, the Economics Ministry said. Drops of 3 per cent in domestic orders and 1.5 in export demand produced an overall seasonally and price-adjusted decline of 2 per cent.</p>

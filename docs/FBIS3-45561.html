			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Yearend special article" by ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE </F> correspondent Zhao Haiyan (6392 3189 3601)]    [Text] Beijing, 24 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Relations  between China and ASEAN countries this year have moved ahead on  all fronts; in particular, bilateral economic cooperation and  trade have been upgraded so rapidly and developed so steadily  that they have become a mainstay cooperation between the two  sides.    Analysts summed up cooperation between China and ASEAN this  year as follows:    One, steady growth in trade and investment volume.    Data shows that trade and investment volume between China  and  ASEAN this year continued to grow at a rate of 30 percent. Trade  between Singapore and China alone hit $4 billion. ASEAN  countries such as Singapore and Malaysia now rank as China's  most important trading partners.    Investment by ASEAN businessmen in China topped $2 billion,  while China has undertaken engineering projects, developed labor  cooperation, and opened 100 joint ventures in ASEAN countries.    Two, cooperation has become wider in scope and deeper.  Against the background of extensive cooperation, regional  cooperation is becoming a trend.    Economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN  countries extended to entertainment, retail, manufacturing,  petroleum, chemical, metallurgical industries and financial  business. Cooperation has been strengthened in wholesale land  development and infrastructural projects. Banks from ASEAN  countries closely followed their businessmen into China and  injected vitality into bilateral economic cooperation and trade.    Linglong [3781 3891] Incorporation of Malaysia, which made  its entry into China only this October, has expressed interest  in the development of China's coal-powered electric plants and  highways. Apart from an industrial garden in Suzhou, Singapore  has participated in the wholesale land development in Yintan  City, Jiangxi Province. The Philippines are also involved for  the first time in wholesale land development in Shishi City,  Fujian Province.    Cooperation centering on the "Lancang Jiang-Mekong River  Economic Circle" between Yunnan of China and South East Asian  countries, such as Thailand, is in full swing, prompting  regional cooperation between China and ASEAN countries. More  wishes for cooperation have been witnessed between Thailand and  Sichuan, the Philippines and Indonesia and Fujian, and Singapore  and Jiangsu and Shandong.    Three, the appearance of joint-investments, a new form of  investment.    This year, economic cooperation and trade between China and  ASEAN countries changed from the "isolated duels and solo  fighting" pattern, into joint investment. There are  Thai-Singapore joint-venture investments in South East Asia and  south China; Indonesia and other countries play a part in the  joint-investment in a Thai-China satellite joint venture. Talks  are underway between Germany and Singapore for joint development  in Shandong and Wuxi; France is interested in joining  Singapore's Suzhou Industrial Garden project. Joint investment  integrates capital and technology in a better way and  strengthens investment spending and, therefore, boosts its  effect.    Four, officials' active attitude, encouragement, and  guidance  for bilateral economic cooperation and trade.    There were frequent visits between Chinese and ASEAN state  leaders this year. Many of them accompanied by business people,  signalling a strong wish from both parties to strengthen  economic cooperation and trade. It was as if each visiting  state leader was playing the role of the "best salesman."    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, Philippine President  Ramos, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, and concerned  Thai officials all stated, in public, their full support to  their businessmen in pursuing cooperation with China, suggested  learning the Chinese language, laid the groundwork for  telecommunications, and urged Chinese businesses to enter the  ASEAN market. Chinese government officials also stated, more  than once, their support for Chinese firms to invest in ASEAN  countries and moves to make it convenient for ASEAN business  interests to develop in China.    Several things merit special mention: The first official  ASEAN delegation visited China for talks on economic, trade, and  technological matters; Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was  invited to sit at a conference of ASEAN foreign ministers; ASEAN  officially agreed to set up a special committee to coordinate  and promote economic cooperation and trade between China and  ASEAN countries. Without a doubt all these positive moves have  increased business confidence and will certainly have a positive  impact on bilateral economic cooperation and trade.    Five, mutual promotion and common prosperity are the  consensus between the two sides.    China and ASEAN countries share the wish for cooperation,  preserving differences, and seeking common grounds so that the  entire region will prosper. Hartarto, Indonesian coordinating  minister for industrial and trade affairs, once stated that the  countries should reinforce each other economically to achieve  common prosperity. He said that Indonesia is determined to  become a newly industrialized nation in 25 years. Aside from  its own efforts, it needs cooperation with other countries. An  editorial in Singapore "LIANHE ZAOBAO" [United Morning Post]  pointed out that the Singapore Industrial Garden project in  China is a significant turning point for Singapore in its effort  to internationalize its economy, while China has for its part  consistently upheld the approach of developing economic  cooperation and trade with ASEAN countries in a mutually  beneficial manner.    Concerned experts believe steady economic cooperation and  trade between China and ASEAN countries will continue next year  and feature new elements. Cooperation between Chinese private  enterprises and their ASEAN counterparts will become an  important means of economic cooperation and trade between China  and ASEAN countries.</p>

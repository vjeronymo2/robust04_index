It crashed at 7:03 a.m. in a field  about three miles northwest of the San Luis Obispo Airport, Federal Aviation  Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell said.  </P> <P> The cause of the crash was not immediately known.  </P> <P> Minutes before the crash, the pilot reported that the craft had passed the  airport's outer marker and was headed for a landing.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Sgt. Leon Cole said four people were confirmed  dead.  </P> <P> Searchers spent several hours looking for a fifth person originally reported to  be aboard. It was later determined that the person did not board the plane,  Cole said.  </P> <P> Wreckage from the Citation, a jet that can carry as many as a dozen people, was  strewn over a wide area east of Madonna Road. Firefighters put out several spot  fires that erupted in some parts of the wreckage.  </P></p>

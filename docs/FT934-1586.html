			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances 1.7% as region sets further records The Japanese government's decision to extend the current parliamentary session by 45 days encouraged investors, and the Nikkei average advanced 1.7 per cent on buying by arbitrageurs and foreign investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index rose 300.13 to 17,789.28, while the Topix index of all first section stocks put on 21.86, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,474.21. The Nikkei opened at the day's low of 17,514.35 and rose to a high of 17,911.99 during the morning session. Overnight strength on the Chicago futures market spurred buying on the Osaka exchange, which in turn prompted arbitrage buying. Overseas investors were also seen purchasing export-related stocks. However, profit-taking by institutional investors prevented the index from rising past 18,000. Volume totalled 338.4m shares, against 237m. Advances overwhelmed declines by 963 to 100, with 105 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.67 at 1,216.16. Late on Wednesday night, the seven-party coalition, which has a slim majority in the lower house, forced a vote to extend the parliamentary session. The supplementary bill, which incorporates a large amount of the fiscal package announced last September, was subsequently passed. Investors who had been inactive due to worries over political turmoil came back as buyers. Foreign investors were seen in pursuit of automobile stocks, Nissan Motor climbing by Y13 to Y730 and Honda Motor by Y40 to Y1,550. Electronics issues continued to rise. Sony moved ahead Y70 to a year's high of Y5,500, while Matsushita Electric Industrial advanced Y50 to Y1,520 and Aiwa Y50 to Y1,880. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y13,000 at Y761,000, posting its sixth consecutive gain, and East Japan Railway ended Y19,000 higher at Y438,000. Bank shares, which have been weak recently on index-linked selling, gained ground. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y50 to Y2,900 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y10 to Y1,810. However, profit-taking depressed regional banks, with Musashino Bank falling Y400 to Y6,000 and Aichi Bank Y100 to Y10,300. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 441.03 to 19,666.20 in volume of 59.9m shares. Konami, a electronic game maker, moved forward Y320 to Y3,700. Roundup Record-setting performances featured again in many of the markets around the Pacific Basin. Bombay remained closed for the third day because of the brokers' boycott in protest at the ban on carry forward deals. HONG KONG resumed its advance after the two-day consolidation and the Hang Seng index rose by 394.40, or 4 per cent, to a record 10,339.66. The index also hit an all-time intraday high of 10,353 in late trading as foreign institutions concentrated on domestic factors such as the better than expected results from Wednesday's land auction, and overseas prospects, as reasons to resume buying blue chips. Dao Heng Bank Group's surge contributed much to the buoyant sentiment. The bank, on its Hong Kong debut, was up to HKDollars 36.75 from its HKDollars 21.70 offer price, after touching HKDollars 38. SINGAPORE finished at a high, although profit-taking amid talk of brokers reimposing tighter trading conditions dampened speculative trade in the afternoon. The Straits Times Industrial index was finally 14.75 stronger at 2,285.99, after setting an intraday peak of 2,294.50. TAIWAN overcame bouts of profit-taking to remain at a 22-month high in hectic trade, extending a rally that has taken the market up 28 per cent since the ruling Nationalist Party's election victory on November 27. The index gained 170.07, or 3.3 per cent, at 5,331.87 in turnover of TDollars 100.43bn, against Wednesday's TDollars 129.65bn. KARACHI closed at another new high, the KSE 100-share index climbing 31.81 to 1,987.72 as Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, pledged to improve credit facilities for textile exporters. SEOUL disregarded South Korea's change of prime minister and closed at a year's high on demand for blue chips. The composite index moved up 4.86 to 870.72, surpassing the previous closing high of 866.88 on December 11. JAKARTA posted a record close, the market index adding 9.52 at 553.36 in active trading as local investors bought selected stocks heavily. NEW ZEALAND finished firmly, with some end-of-year book-squaring seen, and the NZSE-40 capital index put on 9.92 at 2,099.22. Fletcher appreciated 10 cents to NZDollars 3.43 as speculation that there would be a pre-Christmas placement by the government of its 6.7 per cent holding looked less likely. MANILA looked ahead to the prospects for 1994, decided the omens were good, and the composite index rose 47.14 to a high of 2,614.97. KUALA LUMPUR was easier on profit-taking, sentiment soured by talk of restrictions on contra trading. The composite index lost 3.50 at 1,112.59. BANGKOK saw a round of profit-taking during the late afternoon when the SET index failed to break through the key 1,550-point level. The index finished 6.40 down at 1,512.66, having turned back from a day's high of 1,547.96.</p>

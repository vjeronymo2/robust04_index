			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Creditanstalt seeks 55% stake in Slovenian bank CREDITANSTALT, Austria's second largest bank, is taking a major stake in a Slovenian bank, its first significant foothold in the region. Creditanstalt's chairman, Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, said the bank wanted to buy at least 55 per cent in Ljubljana-based Nova Banka. Slovenian press reports said the deal would be worth Ecu37.8m (Dollars 30.7m). Creditanstalt's acquisition of Nova Banka is the first investment of a foreign bank in Slovenia since the republic broke away from Yugoslavia last summer. The move highlights Slovenia's growing dependence on Austria for economic and financial support. The country has a population of only 2m and few monetary reserves to back its new currency. Mr Schmidt-Chiari said the transaction was part of his bank's strategy to expand in the former communist countries bordering Austria. It already operates branches or joint ventures in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Two-year-old Nova Banka is one of Slovenia's leading experts in foreign trade financing. The bank, with assets of about Ecu15m and 50 employees, was the first in Slovenia to issue shares to the public. Creditanstalt said it would buy the interest by financing an increase in paid-in capital.</p>

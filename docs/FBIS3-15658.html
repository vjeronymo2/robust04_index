While the [Azerbaijani] Defense Ministry announced that  Armenians have been using various weapons to shell Azerbaijani  positions for the past three days, high-ranking officials at the  Presidential Office are indicating that there is only a verbal  agreement on a cease-fire.    It is being suggested that the protocol signed by the  Azerbaijani and Armenian defense ministers in Moscow with the  mediation of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is not being  implemented, because it was not approved by President Geydar  Aliyev.    An official at the Presidential Office who did not want to  be  named noted that there is no formal cease-fire agreement with  Armenia and that the existing agreement is only a verbal one.  The same official added that there can be no cease-fire unless  the Armenians withdraw from part of the occupied land. [passage  omitted]</p>

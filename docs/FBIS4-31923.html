			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Andrzej </F> Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of  Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Good morning to you, Sir.    [Pawlak] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.    [Woyciechowski] What is your assessment of the first nine  months of your term as prime minister? Are you satisfied,  happy, or tired?    [Pawlak] The first months were spent working on the budget,  and, as everybody knows, the budget solves a whole range of  issues but not all of them. So now, after this period, now that  we have reached midyear, we are presenting the "Strategy for  Poland" program, which is oriented toward the future, primarily  the next three years, but, on many issues, the program stretches  out much further into the future. I think that demonstrates the  entire dynamics of the government's proceedings. If we take  some specific issues--I mean issues that especially affect those  people whose lots were the most difficult in the recent time  period--one must say that, effective 1 January, there was a  valorization and an increase in the minimum retirement pensions  and other kinds of pensions, whereas, effective 1 June, a second  valorization was carried out, which was quite substantial. The  same applies to salary increases in the budget sector and in the  production and industrial area. We have been witnessing a very  positive phenomenon of an increase in production, which this  time around is a result of our work and our capital potential,  as well as of foreign investments. The increase is definitely  not the result of governmental credits or of administrative  involvement in the economy. This is great cause for joy because  it creates a stable basis for optimism.    [Woyciechowski] But what about you personally, Mr. Prime  Minister? Are you happy, are you satisfied? I mean you  yourself, personally. Or, maybe, is the situation not quite  what it was supposed to be?    [Pawlak] Personally, I am a bit tired because the tempo has  really been very fast, and one must watch oneself the whole time  so as not to lose pace and [hesitating] to keep up with the rate  of events we have to solve. I think that, apart from long-term  issues, there is a whole list of issues that are of an immediate  nature, there are obstacles and problems--these constitute a  permanent aspect of operating on this level. This applies to a  wide variety of issues, and I think that....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When you say immediate  problems, you must certainly also mean the strikes in the  metallurgy industry that are now taking place. Yesterday and  the day before that, you said something that caused some big  excitement, especially among the Western press--namely, you said  that, in your view, the strikes are caused by foreign factors.  What did you mean? Did you mean that....    [Pawlak] You know, this is exactly the difference between  information and interpretation. I did not talk about such  foreign connections. All I said was that it is an  extraordinarily amazing coincidence, and, if reporters could  only prove that I really meant something more than that, I think  it would be very interesting. But such interpretations are a  little too farfetched. It is beyond dispute that, as far as the  world market goes, and especially the European market, there are  big surpluses in steel production....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, it may be in  the interest of somebody out there for Poland to be going  through these strikes?    [Pawlak] I would put it in different terms: Others are very  happy to see the strikes in our country because thanks to them  they can sell their products with greater peace of mind, they  have jobs, employment, salaries, and incomes guaranteed for  them--for both employees and owners of steelworks.    [Woyciechowski] So, if my understanding is correct, what you  did is appeal to the sense of patriotism rather than accuse  imperialism of conducting strikes in Poland?    [Pawlak] You know, I can see you are going back to some  notions from the previous era in Poland, and that is amazing to  me. But, first of all, one must keep in mind that, in any game,  it is mighty important not to score in your own goal, and, when  it comes to the issue of the strikes, we are scoring quite  effectively not once but several times in our own goal, and we  thus give up on the rest of the game. As far as the resolution  of such disputes or conflicts is concerned, it is definitely  easier to solve those disputes when there is a lot of emotion  involved, rather than with tough and concrete negotiations.  Such an agreement was indeed concluded at the Katowice  Steelworks. It also included salary raises, and it was signed by  all of the trade unions except the one that initiated the strike  in the first place, but it had relatively few members in the  steelworks....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean the August '80  trade union?    [Pawlak] Exactly. What is also interesting is that, a few  weeks before that, the steelworks obtained guarantees for a  major modernization investment concerning a continuous steel  production unit and....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But it can almost be concluded  from what you are saying that this is indeed a political strike  and that somebody wanted to spite the government and the  coalition.    [Pawlak] You know, the situation there was very weird  because, apart from all the seriousness and....[pauses] What is  a difficult situation down there, there are some aspects that  are quite amusing: In the steelworks, which is an enterprise  for which these people have been working for many long years,  there is this very amazing situation where the steelworks'  management is in one building, there is a protest committee in  another building, and there is Sejm Deputy Zajac of the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] shuttling as an envoy between  these two serious institutions. This looks quite amusing. It is  as if the parties involved could not find a way of communicating  with one another. After all, given that they fail to come to an  agreement at the level of the steelwork, what could be the use  of an outside observer or mediator? After all, these are issues  related to the metallurgic industry and of the particular  enterprise in question. The point on the one hand is not to lead  the steelworks into ruin, and, on the other, to secure the  possibilities of obtaining higher incomes for the people. Last  year, the steelworks achieved an overall positive financial  outcome, which is very important and very positive after a few  years of quite difficult times. But now the steelworks are  getting in trouble on their own request.    [Woyciechowski] How will this all end? Will you decide to  close down the Katowice Steelworks if they continue to lead  themselves into bankruptcy?    [Pawlak] Remember that there is no central management  anymore....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] It is not up to you to close  the steelworks down?    [Pawlak] The people down there are really building a future  for them on their own, and they themselves are creating the  conditions for the enterprise to either score success or to lose  on the market and drop out of the race.    [Woyciechowski] Concerning Kolodko's "Strategy": Do you  already know at this stage, or do you understand why the  opposition walked out of the Sejm hall?    [Pawlak] Well, I cannot possibly imagine what the reasons  could have been because, as I recall my parliamentary  experiences, there were different types of times. There were  times when we were up against the wall, or even high up the  wall, but we never tried to leave the Sejm hall altogether.  Well, that is....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean SLD members walked  out, but members of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] have never  walked out? Or has it happened at any time in the past?    [Pawlak] No, PSL members have never walked out of the Sejm  hall. Perhaps our situation was a bit more fortunate because  there have not been speeches that would be so sharp and  addressed to us. But that....[Pawlak pauses] As far as issues  such as governmental programs, budget laws, and other similar  debates are concerned, even though they were hard for us at  times, we tried to participate to the best of our ability and to  influence either modification or changes, or we voted against  when we could not have counted on changes, but this is tough  work that must be done, and the absent simply do not count. It  is important for us to be able to concentrate on issues we have  to face. Regardless of these different maneuvers in the Sejm  hall, the issues remain to be resolved, anyway, and one must  simply address them eventually.    [Woyciechowski] Was there a small element of an election  campaign in the decision to present the "Strategy for Poland,"  which was made right before the elections? Or was it just a  coincidence?    [Pawlak] Partially it was a coincidence; if my memory serves  me well, the elections were supposed to be held on about 29 May.  However, the Sejm obliged us in the budget law....[Pawlak  pauses] The resolution adopted when the budget was passed  obliged us to present a long-term strategy in June. Thus, we  simply followed the Sejm's order; we wanted to present a  prospect for several years; primarily, we wanted to put the  coalition's decisions and agreements in a compact form, which  would deal with the main issues, the main problems that the  state and the society are facing. The activities of the  government or of several high-ranking state officials are not  enough to put this strategy into effect; what is needed is the  work and activity of many different milieus. Therefore, we are  counting on a good substantive discussion in this area, as well  as on activeness in the practical implementation of this  strategy.    [Woyciechowski] What do you think of the statement by  Primate Jozef Glemp? When he was commenting on the decision by  the Sejm concerning abortion, he said that the Sejm was born at  a time of the state's sickness, and today such a fetus within  the state is not healthy. You never commented on this in public.    [Pawlak] And I do not intend to. This happens to be an area  where you journalists can show off, and I am not going to do the  journalists'job here.    [Woyciechowski] Sejm Speaker Oleksy protested because he  interpreted the primate's comment as a statement referring to  himself and the SLD. Do you think the cardinal also meant the  PSL, and is that why you have not commented on that?    [Pawlak] Well, you know, let us allow those to whom  statements are addressed to deal with them. Every person who  listens to such statements, who analyzes such situations, should  evaluate this issue himself. I am not going to comment on  statements made by others; everyone has his own opinion, and I  think the listeners can form their own opinions also. Such  issues are often decided in the people's own conscience and in  the behavior of each of us. There are great differences,  depending on people's individual value systems. Let us leave  this to the people. Let us allow everyone to evaluate this  situation... [Pawlak pauses] Because I think it all concerns the  situation that developed in the Sejm, and not just this  particular statement. Let us allow everyone to evaluate whether  the issue is so important that the Criminal Code should be  applied or that we should rather speak about education and  schools because this is where the key to resolving this issue  lies, not in the Criminal Code.    [Woyciechowski] Do you think the problem of abortion may  have political consequences? Can it, as some people say, result  in the weakening of the coalition and in its disintegration?    [Pawlak] I do not think so. It is stated clearly in the PSL  regulations that issues concerning conscience and belief cannot  be a subject of political discipline....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that every Sejm  deputy will vote just as he thinks?    [Pawlak] Just as his conscience tells him to vote.    [Woyciechowski] Now, what about the concordat? Is the  concordat an issue that may weaken the coalition? Can this  bring about any negative effects?    [Pawlak] I do not think so. However, this issue is entirely  different. It is not a problem of detailed legal solutions  concerning the internal law. It is an international treaty. I  can only say that recently we have had far more treaties that  entailed much more serious consequences, especially economic  consequences, than the concordat.    Now, if the issue of the concordat is approached in a very  substantive and precise way, many doubts can be dispelled. The  discussion that has been held within the government has allowed  us to submit it to the Sejm for ratification--with no  objections. I hope that the debate we will witness in the Sejm  will be based on a serious and substantive analysis; there is no  room for emotions or for simple political gamesmanship. Now,  from the viewpoint of broader and long-term interests, I think  we must correct all of the mistakes resulting from a certain  haste when the concordat was being signed. However, this can be  done in an atmosphere of peace and responsibility.    [Woyciechowski] Mistakes were made by the Suchocka Cabinet,  if I understood you correctly. In other words, the coalition is  doing fine. You do not fear a conflict within the coalition.    [Pawlak] Well, I do not fear a conflict; however, I do not  deny that there will be various issues that will give rise to  heated and serious discussions in the coalition. This is  because we are not going to sacrifice our views simply not to  step out of line or to achieve unanimity. We will have serious  discussions concerning which solutions are best. I believe this  will help us avoid making mistakes. In this respect, the  coalition is rather dynamic. There are various issues: In some,  our views are quite similar; however, there are also issues in  which we must try to work out a compromise; there are also  issues where we respect each other's uniqueness and  independence, and we are not going to change each other in this  area. We believe that, in those issues, both parties have the  right to maintain their subjectivity and identity.    [Woyciechowski] Is there now any conflict with Kwasniewski?  The press was full of articles about it some time ago.    [Pawlak] I do not really know. That is, you know, if a  topic must be supplied, we can have a quarrel with Kwasniewski  about some important issue to make....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] To help newspapers increase  their circulation?    [Pawlak] To make it credible. We can do something like  that; I believe that Mr. Kwasniewski will agree on such a  solution. However, as I have said, there are issues where we  differ, but there are also areas where our views are similar.  If we take a look at the coalition agreement, it includes  various issues that have been agreed upon. I believe that this  is the foundation for the coalition's activities.    [Woyciechowski] You are speaking about it with great  self-assurance. This must mean that you are certain this  coalition will survive at least three years.    [Pawlak] I have....[Pawlak pauses] I hope we will be able  to consistently implement the tasks we have taken on; time is an  important factor here that allows us to stabilize the situation  and to resolve a number of problems.    [Woyciechowski] What is going to happen in a year and a  half, when the presidential elections are held? It is already  known that the list of candidates for president will include  Lech Walesa. There will also be either Kwasniewski or Oleksy.  Will the name of Pawlak be on the list?    [Pawlak] I think we have many good candidates in the PSL.  Therefore, a slightly different solution will be implemented.  My colleagues will be able to prove themselves.    [Woyciechowski] That means that the PSL will field a  candidate?    [Pawlak] It certainly will.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Pawlak] Thank you.</p>

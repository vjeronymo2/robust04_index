			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Information and Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service requests information and comments on (1) the status of ginseng throughout its range or in any portion of its range; (2) the proposed findings that the export of ginseng from any of the 22 States with programs to be approved will not be detrimental to the survival of the species; and (3) the status criteria used. Information and comments also are requested on the criteria and procedures and their implementation for determining (1) that exported specimens are accurately declared as wild or cultivated; (2) that the ginseng (roots) originated in a particular State; and (3) that the ginseng is not collected in contravention of laws for its protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service also requests information on environmental or economic impacts and effects on small entities (including small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) that would result from findings for or against export approval. This information may aid the Service in further evaluating the conclusions stated below. This proposed rule is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; 87 Stat. 884, as amended), and was prepared by Mark R. Albert and Carol L. Carson, Office of Management Authority, and Charles W. Dane, Bruce MacBryde, and Wayne L. Milstead, Office of Scientific Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effects of the Rule and Required Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has determined that these proposed findings are not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347), and therefore the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. For the 1994&hyph;96 harvest seasons, the Service analyzed the impacts and again concluded that the 3-year rule will not have significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities as outlined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Exporters normally derive their product from ginseng roots harvested in a number of States. Therefore, the approval or disapproval of wild ginseng export from any one State would not significantly affect the industry. Moreover, because the proposed rule would treat exports on a State-by-State basis and proposes to approve export in accordance with State programs, the rule would have little effect on small entities in and of itself. The proposed rule would allow continued international trade in ginseng from the United States in accordance with CITES, and it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It also has been determined that this proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Endangered and threatened species, Exports, Imports, Plants (agriculture), Transportation, Treaties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Regulation Promulgation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=3 --> PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accordingly, Part 23, Subpart F of Title 50 (Chapter I, Subchapter B) of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed for amendment as set forth below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

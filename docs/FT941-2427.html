			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Italy's election Which of two starkly contrasting versions of Italy's future will emerge from the elections due in less than a week's time? One version is the Italy of political confusion, where an old order has collapsed and politicians trade slogans over how to replace it. The other is the Italy of economic reform - of curbed budget deficits, low inflation, rising exports and privatisation. Will the election herald political as well as economic renewal, or will it intensify political uncertainty and thus risk undermining economic progress? Probably it will do neither. The election is unlikely to deliver a clear-cut result that would break with the past of corrupt coalition politics. But nor need the ensuing turbulence derail economic reform. More likely, it will lead - after a period of party horse-trading - to formation of a government committed to the sensible reformist path charted by its two predecessors. Plus ca change . . . To suggest that the new order will not be so dissimilar from the old might seem odd. Italy is experiencing an unparalleled upheaval, with most of its former political class discredited by scandal. For the first time, voters appear to have a genuine choice between politicians preaching social democracy and others espousing conservative and economically liberal values. But neither side seems likely to secure an absolute parliamentary majority. The hybrid electoral system may well produce a parliament just as fragmented as the last, while the alliances of left, right and centre will splinter as soon as the campaigning is over. At least as important as the electoral arithmetic will be the economic constraints facing a new government. They are so severe that, in practice, the voters' choice may well turn out to be a mirage. In the past two years, the technocratic governments of Giuliano Amato and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi have made great strides towards reducing the budget deficit, curbing the relentless rise in government debt, and encouraging wage restraint. Their efforts have brought a fall in interest rates and a devaluation-led surge in exports. But the virtuous circle they have created remains fragile, and the financial markets are on the alert for signs of back-sliding. It is in this context that the politicians' sometimes extravagant campaign promises must be judged. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the businessman leader of the Forza Italia movement, tantalises Italians with the prospect of a lighter tax burden without troubling to explain how it might be achieved. Translating this into government policy, however, would produce an instant lira sell-off and a rapid rise in interest rates. Most informed Italians know that the real choice they face is between persevering with economic change and being ejected from the mainstream of European integration. The benefits of reform are already evident. If the politicians throw it off course, they will reap a bitter reward.</p>

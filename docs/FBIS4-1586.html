			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton  administration said here today that China has taken "important  steps" to fulfill "most of the obligations" that the country  incurred in 1992 agreements with the United States.    The National Trade Estimate Report, the ninth of its kind  and  released here today, said that by the end of 1993, "China had  committed to substantial improvement of transparency" of its  import approval process.    "Permission to import products now subject to quotas or  quantitative restrictions appears to be considerably simple and  more transparent than it was in the past," the report said.    China, the report said, had streamlined its import approval  process for industrial goods, and eliminated "a substantial  number of industrial products -- particularly in the machinery  and electronics sectors."    The 280-page annual report, compiled by the office of U.S.  Trade Representative (USTR), listed a wide range of trade  barriers maintained by 39 U.S. trading partners.    In its special 14-page chapter on China, the report called  the U.S.-China trade consultations in 1992, which covered  implementation of market access agreement, intellectual property  rights enforcement and market access for services and textile, a  success.    According to the USTR, U.S. trade deficit with China in 1993  was 22.8 billion U.S. dollars. U.S. merchandise exports to  China were 8.8 billion dollars last year, up 1.3 billion dollars  from the year before.    The stock of U.S. direct investment in China was 469 million  dollars in 1992. Pledged U.S. investment in China in 1993 stood  at seven billion dollars. Actual on the ground committed  investment stood at three billion dollars.    In 1992 agreements with the U.S., China agreed to dismantle  almost 90 percent of its non-tariff import restrictions in five  years and to publish either the quantity or value of any  products subject to quantitative restrictions.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: Paradox in performance Why is it that theatre directors who can be so strong on detail make such sweeping statements about politics and society when it comes to writing a book or making a speech? One thinks of Richard Eyre, the director of Royal National Theatre, who wrote in Utopia and Other Places about his fears that Britain might become a fascist state. Then came Sir Peter Hall, constantly demanding ever increasing government subsidies for the arts, in his autobiography, Making an Exhibition of Myself. A similar question arises in Peter Brook's extended essay, There Are No Secrets: Thoughts on Acting and Theatre (Methuen, Pounds 12.99, 120 pages). How is it that a man who seems so liberal, so civilised, so much a seeker after truth, can emerge as utterly intolerant of others? Brook makes the point himself inadvertently in a story he tells about his early days as a director. He allowed a student to attend rehearsals of a Shakespeare play. All went quietly until he found the student in the local pub explaining to the actors how they should play their scenes. Almost never again were outsiders admitted. Yet the interesting questions about that story are how did the student hold the actors' attention, what did he have to say them, and why did Brook not have a talk with him? Such questions did not occur to the director. Instead he reacted with a ban of the kind which, if practised by governments, presumably he would disapprove. There are other examples. Brook writes that he is sometimes asked about the relation between The Tempest that he did at Stratford 30 years ago and his more recent production at the Bouffes du Nord. 'This question is absolutely ridiculous]' he comments. Yet 50 pages later he is discussing the question himself, and is very revealing on the subject. One also wonders what Harley Granville Barker, or even George Bernard Shaw, would have made of his remark that 'the theatre is in no way a discussion between cultivated people'. Brook thinks that it all a matter of 'enlightenment' which 'can't be taught, though it must always be encouraged when it appears'. There is a paradox here. Brook writes very well about the search for communication between audience and actors. Indeed he is one of the few directors to stress the importance of the audience. 'In the millisecond long instant when actor and audience interrelate, as in a physical embrace,' Brook says, 'it is the density, the thickness, the multi-layeredness, the richness - in other words, the quality of the moment that counts.' But the moment of truth can sometimes last an entire scene: see, for instance, Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea. Of course, the audience is crucial. But it is perverse for a director to turn so sharply against the cultivated classes: they can sometimes be useful. The production of Harold Pinter's Moonlight before an educated West End audience is actually much better than the original at the Almeida. Still, Brook is effective in explaining the way he works, and for that his book is worth reading.</p>

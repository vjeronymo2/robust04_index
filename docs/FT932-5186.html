			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Transatlantic takes stake in Sun Alliance TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the financial services group owned jointly by French and South African interests, yesterday announced the acquisition of a 'strategic' stake in Sun Alliance, one of the UK's biggest insurance groups. Transatlantic, which already owns 50 per cent of Sun Life, the life insurer, bought 400,000 shares on Wednesday, increasing its stake to more than 3 per cent and making it one of Sun Alliance's largest shareholders. Stock exchange rules make disclosure of stakes of more than 3 per cent obligatory. Mr Donald Gordon, the South African entrepreneur who is chairman of of Transatlantic, said: 'We see this as a strategic investment in embryo. We will obviously give it more attention than before.' Mr Gordon compared the investment with more than a dozen built up by Liberty Life, the South African life insurance group, which owns 50 per cent of Transatlantic. 'We've often done that. These stakes are selected very carefully after much thought and attention.' He said that Transatlantic's involvement in Sun Life had begun in a similar way in the mid-1980s. Observers predicted that Mr Gordon would soon move to increase his stake. 'If I was Sun Alliance I'd feel nervous now. Donald Gordon takes a long term view,' said one merchant banker. Union des Assurance de Paris, the French state-controlled insurer, which owns 50 per cent of Transatlantic, is also thought to be keen to expand into the UK general insurance market. In spite of suffering heavy losses in recent years, Sun Alliance had an 'the highest solvency ratio, an excellent portfolio and a lot of potential,' said Mr Gordon. The group was well placed to benefit both from recent rises in insurance rates and from the appointnment last month of Sir Christopher Benson as its new chairman. Like Mr Gordon, Sir Christopher, formerly chairman of MEPC, shares a background in the property sector. 'I have great confidence in Sir Christopher. I know him well,' said Mr Gordon. He was sure that Sun Alliance had 'taken precautions' which would avoid the kind of losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business which have dogged the group in recent years. A legal dispute between Capital &amp; Counties, the property company owned by Transatlantic, with Sun Alliance over the Harlequin shopping centre development in Watford had not influenced the decision to increase the stake, added Mr Gordon. Sun Alliance and Capital &amp; Counties developed the complex together but argued over the way in which net property income from the project was to be shared. Transatlantic took legal action last year.</p>

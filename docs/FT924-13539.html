			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Maternity seen as handicap MANY WOMEN with prof-essional or managerial jobs feel their career prospects are damaged after taking a break to have a baby. The finding comes in a survey covering nearly 800 women, published today by Sussex University and carried out on behalf of leading employers including Marks and Spencer, Barclays Bank, the Treasury, Shell (UK) and the Wellcome Foundation. Before taking a career break, 84 per cent of women were very satisfied or satisfied with the way they were promoted at work. After returning to work, that dropped to 64 per cent. Ms Wendy Hirsh, co-author of the report, said women felt employers were taking an increasingly positive attitude to providing career breaks. 'However, they are much less sure about their future career opportunities. Many feel their careers have to take a back seat, at least for a while, and that their line managers see them as less promotable once they have become mothers.' Evidence of discrimination in promotion was not established by the survey. Only 9 per cent of the sample returned to a job at a lower level than before the career break; a third had been promoted within a short time of returning to work and substantial numbers had made sideways moves. The researchers had no comparable figures for men. Beyond the Career Break. IMS report no 223 by Wendy Hirsh, Sue Hayday, Jill Yeates and Claire Callender.

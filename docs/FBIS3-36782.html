			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political expert Aleksandr Iskandaryan: "Geydar </F> Aliyev Needs Victory at the Front in Order To Begin Peace Talks"]    [Text] Tank fighting comparable in scale with medium-sized  battles of World War II has been continuing for nearly two  months on the North Nagorno-Karabakh plain. At the same time  pitched battles are under way close to Azerbaijan's border with  Iran. Why is this happening right now, when both sides have  little hope of resolving the conflict by military means?    A few months ago Armenian troops won such convincing  victories that it seemed that Azerbaijan had no army left at  all. Nonetheless since mid-December the Azerbaijan troops have  been making successful advances despite powerful resistance.    President Elchibey's unsuccessful attempts to leave Russia's  zone of influence and to appeal to Turkey have ended in the  realistic Geydar Aliyev coming to power and to Azerbaijan  joining the CIS. The latter event is of a partly paradoxical  nature since Azerbaijan believes its opponent in the Karabakh  war to be not Karabakh as such but Armenia and the CIS thus  becomes the only alliance of states of its kind in which two  members are at war. This state of affairs automatically assigns  Russia, as the nucleus of the CIS, a stabilizing role in the  conflict. By the very fact that it has joined the CIS  Azerbaijan is unambiguously claiming what is already due to  Georgia in the light of its treaty with Russia -- the  consolidation of its national army.    Five conditions are being set at the secret talks between  Russia and Azerbaijan. They include the protection of  Azerbaijan's foreign borders by forces of the Russian border  troops, the presence of Russian military bases on Azerbaijani  territory, the creation of a 12-mile Azerbaijani maritime zone  on the Caspian oil shelf instead of the 50-mile zone on which  Baku is insisting, recognition of Russia as the only mediator in  the Karabakh conflict, and Azerbaijan's recognition of the  Nagorno-Karabakh republic in one form or another. These  speculations are partly confirmed by the statement made by  Grachev in Tbilisi to the effect that Russia will have military  bases in all three Transcaucasus republics while there is no  public agreement with Azerbaijan on this score. Russia's role  could prove very constructive if only because Russian troops,  expelled by Elchibey, will appear on Azerbaijan's territory.    Something else is also undoubted: Such steps would be  extremely unpopular inside Azerbaijan and only a leader with  very strong positions in his own country would venture to take  them. At present Geydar Aliyev does not have such a credit of  trust with the population. The leadership of this country at  war can effectively enhance its popularity rating by only one  means: successes at the front.    In that case Baku's strategy is as follows: to achieve a  "limited" military victory with a view to strengthening Aliyev's  prestige. He thus gets carte blanche for concessions and steps  toward peace. Actually, it should not be forgotten that on the  other side of the front line are the field commanders of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, who have no time for big-league  politics. They have no intention of strengthening Aliyev's  reputation, do not agree to a "limited" military defeat, and are  ferociously defending every meter of Karabakh land.</p>

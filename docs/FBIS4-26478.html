			<p>BFN     [Text] Jiamusi, June 21 (CNS)--The Sino-Russian border  trade which has been slack for nearly two years is now rising  again. With China and Russia having had their economic policies  in place, the Sino-Russian border trade is expected to be  prosperous once again.    Since summer this year, trade talks between China and Russia  have become more active. In an international economic and trade  conference held in Jiamusi City in Heilongjiang Province in  early June, the trade volume increased to RMB 5 billion  [renminbi] from several hundred million made in such trade talks  held in the past years. The recovery of the border trade was  seen as one of important reasons.    The official in charge of the border trade in the City  attributed the recovery of the Sino-Russian border trade to the  following factors:    First, China and Russia have mutual-complementary market  demands. Despite of Japanese and South Korean products pouring  into the Russian market, it is hard for the Russian consumers to  accept due to their high prices. Russians still prefer the  Chinese products which are of good quality but sell at lower  prices. On the other hand, China also needs Russian-made steel  products, timber, glass, cars and machines as well as the  advanced and new technology in particular.    The Chinese side and the Russian side have imposed strict  inspection over passports held by their economic and trade staff  and a ban on speculators to enter and leave their countries.  The two sides have also reached the relevant agreement on  development of the border trade. All these have created relaxed  circumstances for the Sino-Russian border trade.    The Chinese customs and the foreign trade departments have  strenghtened inspection over the exports to prevent counterfeit  and low quality products from flowing out of the country. They  have also hosted various kinds of exhibitions of Chinese  products of high quality to raise confidence of the Russian  consumers in the Chinese products.</p>

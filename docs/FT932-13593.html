			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Shangri-La looks to China THE Shangri-La hotel group, one of the largest hotel groups in Asia, plans to list its Shangri-La Asia company on the Hong Kong stock market later this year to raise funds for projects in China. The Shangri-La group is ultimately controlled by Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese businessman who made his initial fortune in the commodities trade and is known as Asia's 'Sugar King'. Mr Kuok is believed to have interests in several hotels in China and last month purchased a 510-room hotel in Xian in central China. It is understood that Shangri-La Asia will be used to buy Hong Kong and China hotels from Mr Kuok.</p>

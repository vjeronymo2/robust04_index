			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Combat Aircraft's Maiden </F> Flight"]    [text] The first prototype of the European Fighter Aircraft  Eurofighter-2000, the French Rafale's rival, took off for its  maiden flight on Sunday, 27 March, from the test field in  Manching, Southern Germany. According to the manufacturer, the  German DASA group, the 45-minute flight went without hitches.  Scheduled for last fall, this first flight had to be delayed due  to difficulties encountered in fine tuning the aircraft's  electric controls. Seven prototypes will be assembled.    Financed by Great Britain (37.5 percent), Germany (30  percent), Italy (19.5 percent) and Spain (13 percent), the  Eurofighter program met with significant vexation, and, when set  against the originally established goals, it has been delayed  two years owing to technical, industrial and political  disagreements between the four involved European countries.  Series production is slated to begin only in 1996 or 1997. The  global cost (development and production) of all the four hundred  crafts ordered is evaluated at $47 billion (i.e., 268 billion  French francs).    At the time of the program's launching, the four countries  had announced their intentions to buy more than 760 Eurofighter  planes. But the cost of the aircraft had forced Germany to tone  down its ambitions, going as far as to quit the program  altogether if the price of an aircraft could not be reduced by  30 percent. Italy and Spain are in the same mind frame. Only the  United Kingdom, for which this is a unique military aircraft  under consideration, let it be known that it could buy more.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Takeshita under pressure to quit MR Noboru Takeshita, former Japanese prime minister, was yesterday facing mounting public pressure to resign from parliament after his second appearance to testify over allegations that an organised crime syndicate was involved in his 1987 campaign for the premiership. Mr Takeshita is deftly denying the charges that he knew a crime boss acted as an intermediary to halt an embarrassing right-wing street campaign against him. In two hours of testimony to the parliament's upper house he reiterated that he would not resign because it would be seen as an admission of guilt. However, Mr Takeshita is under pressure because of inconsistencies between his evidence and that of other politicians involved in the incident. He was forced to back-track on earlier testimony and admit his office might have arranged two meetings with Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, former president of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin courier company who is alleged to have enlisted the help of gangsters to quell the right-wing campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, is due shortly to announce a cabinet reshuffle. It is thought to be a key test of how well Mr Miyazawa can handle the party and parliament without the backing of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party king-maker who resigned from parliament in October after admitting accepting an illegal donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. It is thought likely that Mr Michio Watanabe, an advocate of opening Japan's rice market, will remain as foreign minister. Mr Tsutomu Hata is expected to launch a new LDP faction if, as expected, he is replaced as finance minister.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Thorny questions for pension group: The issue of surpluses is taxing the review body A SURPLUS in a pension fund might be compared to the rise in the value of a house, Professor Roy Goode, chairman of the committee reviewing pensions law, suggested yesterday. And a bank should no more be expected to surrender some of the value of its collateral than a member of a pension scheme should be expected to surrender some of the value of his collateral, he suggested. Such a surplus could be seen as the employees' guarantee that the promised pension-fund benefits would be delivered, he said. 'When a scheme is ongoing, is not the surplus the security for future pension payments?' Prof Goode asked. The comparison was made during public hearings yesterday when the committee questioned Sir Brian Corby, president of the Confederation of British Industry. Prof Goode's remarks may offer some insights into the line the Pension Law Review Committee could take in tackling two of the thorniest questions facing government policymakers. First, how far should the law go towards protecting the expectations of scheme members? Second, once contributions have been made to a fund, to whom do they belong? The CBI has indicated that employers will resist legislation preventing them extracting surpluses for their own benefit. The future willingness of employers to sponsor the kind of final-salary benefits which prevail in the best occupational pension schemes 'depends on the kind of recommendations you make', Sir Brian told the committee. But he indicated that the CBI saw merit in some of the complaints voiced by employee groups about the present legal framework for pension funds. For instance, he said, there was an argument for the view that scheme members had some right to surpluses. 'Employees who have contributed to a scheme should expect as a matter of good practice to participate in a contributions holiday,' he said, referring to the common practice of employers halting their contributions to pension funds when there are big surpluses. Moreover, he said, it was good practice for larger pension schemes to include employee representation on the board of trustees. But the CBI opposes legislation to impose either of these changes. Prof Goode said that the message received so far by his committee, both from pension-scheme members and plan sponsors, is that no one wants legislation which discourages employers from making pension provision. But the point at which employers will throw in the towel and cut off benefits remains unclear.</p>

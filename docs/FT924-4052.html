			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Turkey under pressure to cancel Armenian power deal Turkey is under growing pressure to cancel a power supply deal recently agreed with neighbouring Armenia after criticism from both Azerbaijan, Ankara's ally in the Caucasus, and Turkish opposition parties, writes John Murray Brown. The Dollars 16.5m (Pounds 10.8m) deal signed two weeks ago in Ankara envisages the transmission of Turkish power to Armenia through winter. But the contract has angered Azerbaijan, which has been involved in a four-year conflict over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey's main opposition party, the Motherland party (Anap), yesterday threatened a parliamentary vote to censure the government over the contract, which it claims is jeopardising Turkey's solidarity with the Turkic states of the Caucasus and central Asia. Ankara fears that, without the power supply, Armenia might restart its nuclear plant close to the Turkish border. The deal, under which Turkey is to supply Armenia with 300m kW/hrs of energy from December to April, is also part of efforts to restore full political relations and resolve a border dispute. Turkey has initiated several regional power projects in an attempt to win over its troublesome neighbours - despite projections by the Turkish electricity utility Tek of energy shortfalls by 1994.</p>

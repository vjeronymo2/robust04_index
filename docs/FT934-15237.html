			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Lloyd's faces race against time to settle out of court: Floodgates may open now Names have been told they can sue agents YESTERDAY'S JUDGMENT in the Commercial Court that Lloyd's Names can sue the agents who handled their affairs has underlined the importance of efforts by Lloyd's of London to reach out-of-court settlements. Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's, hopes to offer Names a deal before the end of the year. But if he fails to come up with an acceptable offer, Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - are now free to go ahead with their actions. Mr Justice Saville's court ruling means that members' agents are potentially liable for millions of pounds of losses. Several thousand Names are involved in actual or possible legal action. Almost all have targeted members' agents - as well as the managing agents who administered their syndicates - as defendants. The first case to go ahead - on 26 April next year - involves 3,000 Names, who were members of four Gooda Walker syndicates (numbers 164, 290, 298 and 299) between 1988 and 1990. The Names allege negligent underwriting and are seeking more than Pounds 550m in damages from 71 Lloyd's members' agencies. In October Mr Saville will hear a case brought by 1,650 Names, who were members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847 between 1988 and 1989. Feltrim Names are also suing for negligent underwriting, targetting 60 agencies, 59 of which are members' agencies in an effort to recover up to Pounds 600m in losses. A third large case could come to court early in 1995. Some 2,000 Names on Merrett syndicate 418 are taking legal action against 130 members' agents, the Merrett managing agency, the syndicate's auditors, Ernst Whinney, and Mr Stephen Merrett, the syndicate's underwriter, over losses registered in the 1985 year. The claim is estimated at about Pounds 350m. At least four smaller groups of Names also have actions that are well advanced: A case involving more than 320 Names on Pulbrook syndicate 334 in 1985 should come to court in December this year. The Names face losses of at least Pounds 80m. 310 Names on another Pulbrook syndicate, number 90, have served writs on 12 members' agents, the Pulbrook managing agency and Winchester Bowring, a firm of insurance brokers. They are taking action to obtain compensation for losses that could exceed Pounds 225m. Writs have also been served in an action by 470 Names, who were members of Poland syndicates 105 (in 1985 and 1986) and 108 (in 1985 and 1986). The Names are suing members' agents and the Poland managing agency and seek to recover more than Pounds 80m. More than 30 members of the Oakeley Vaughan syndicates between 1981 and 1983 are suing Lloyd's over its failure to regulate the market. Their case, which was lost in the Commercial Court, comes to appeal in February next year. Other Names who have formed action groups and who are at various stages of legal action include 850 Names on Bromley 475; 1,000 Names on Cuthbert Heath 404; 1,000 Names on Devonshire 216, 527, 833, 1137; 490 Names on Gresham 321; 861 Names on King 745; 850 Names on Rose Thomson Young 255; and 600 Names on Wellington syndicates 406 and 448.</p>

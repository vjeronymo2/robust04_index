			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Poor response to Argentine pensions plan Fewer than half of Argentina's estimated 5.8m pension contributors have opted to switch from the existing state scheme into the country's new private pension system, following the disorganised and confused launch of the scheme. The poor response comes as a disappointment for economy minister Domingo Cavallo, who had hoped the private pension fund system would simultaneously raise Argentina's low savings rate, reduce its dependence on foreign capital and provide long-term finance for industry. Employees had from May 1 to July 1 to decide whether to continue contributing to the state's pay-as-you-earn scheme or to choose one of 22 private fund managers to handle their individual pensions plans. Mr Francisco Cabrera, general manager of fund managers Maxima, estimates that about 1.8m people have entered the private system with about 2m remaining in the state scheme. A further 2m people have had their pension savings parked at a fund manager run by state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), following an order by Congress that the July 1 deadline be put back for 90 days. Mr Cavallo rejected the demand for a delayed deadline, but compromised by allowing pensions to be held at BNA for the 90-day period. Mr Cabrera said: 'We are disappointed by the successive changes in the rules of the game which have confused the public. But there is a good side to all this. The concept of private pensions has been established. This is a long-term activity and it is good that people should have plenty of (investment) choices.' He said he expects just under half the 2.0m accounts at BNA will eventually move into the private system and the remainder will return to the state. However, he still believes the private system can generate the originally forecast Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) annual cashflow. Under the original rules drawn up last October, contributors would have their pensions automatically transferred to a private fund manager unless they opted in writing to remain in the state system. Those who had joined the private system could not later return to the state system. Furthermore, Congress stated that BNA's fund must provide a government-guaranteed dollar-linked yield. However, President Carlos Menem vetoed this requirement in May. Later he decreed savers would be allowed to return to the state system until mid-1996.</p>

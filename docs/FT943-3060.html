			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton optimism Media group Carlton Communications stood out as the principal bright spot in the London market as the shares responded to reports of growing advertising revenue, as well as company presentations to analysts. Latest industry research shows that forward booking for advertising slots in October has increased by 6 per cent. The pressure is thought to have come from the emergence of some big advertisers such as Eurotunnel - ahead of the opening to the public of the Channel tunnel - and the National Lottery. There is also the traditional pre-Christmas pick-up. Analysts pointed out that as there is no need for production costs to rise the increased demand would translate directly into bottom line profits. Carlton is the UK's leading independent television group and the stock received additional support from company presentations ahead of the group's September year-end. The shares jumped 19 to 875p with turnover higher than average at 2.2m.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE TO UNDERGO SURGERY FOR SMALL BONE CHIP  </P> <P> Sunday Silence, whose recent victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic more than  likely clinched the 1989 horse of the year title, will undergo surgery Thursday  for the removal of a bone chip in his right knee.  </P> <P> The 40-minute procedure will be performed at the Hollywood Park Equine Clinic  by Dr. Greg Ferraro. The prognosis is for a full recovery, and for Sunday  Silence to be able to return to competition in about five months.  </P> <P> Trainer Charlie Whittingham had little doubt that Sunday Silence suffered the  injury in defeating archrival Easy Goer by a neck in the Nov. 4 Classic.  </P> <P> "We know he didn't have it going into the race, and yet the chip is so small it  didn't show until we'd galloped him two or three days after he got home,"  Whittingham said.  </P> <P> Ferraro described the injury as nothing out of the ordinary.  </P> <P> "If he had to have a chip, this is the best kind to have," the veterinarian  said. "Unless something else is found, this type of chip has the best  prognosis."  </P> <P> Whittingham, who also owns 25% of Sunday Silence, is likewise optimistic that  his champion 3-year-old colt will come back to the races next year as good as  ever.  </P> <P> Besides his victory in the Classic, Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby, the  Preakness, the Santa Anita Derby and a record $4,578,454 in 1989. He ranks  third in all-time earnings behind Alysheba and John Henry.  </P> <P> Arthur Hancock of Lexington, Ky., owns 50% of Sunday Silence and Dr. Ernest  Gaillard of La Jolla owns the other 25%. Reached at his Stone Farm on Monday,  Hancock said he briefly considered retiring the colt to stud.  </P> <P> "From what Charlie told me, though, he'll come back 100%," Hancock said.  "Anyway, I think 4 is a little too young to send a horse to stud. They don't  really mature as a racehorse until they get to be 4 or 5.  </P> <P> "If everything goes all right, I'd like Sunday Silence to have a shot at  winning the Classic again next year," Hancock said. "Maybe even get the  earnings record. Racing needs stars, and he's certainly a popular horse."  </P> <P> Whittingham said he detected heat in Sunday Silence's knee late last week, a  few days after the colt's return to Santa Anita from his victory over Easy Goer  in the Classic at Gulfstream Park. Ferraro said that X-rays revealed a chip  about the size of the nail on an adult's index finger.  </P> <P> "It is located above the joint, and not on a weight-bearing surface," Ferraro  said. "That's why a horse can recover quickly and be able to run very well."  </P> <P> Said Whittingham: "I've had many horses come back better than ever from that  kind of injury. We took a chip out of Balzac's knee and look what he went on to  do."  </P> <P> As a 3-year-old in 1978, Elizabeth Keck's Balzac injured his knee while  finishing second to Affirmed in the Santa Anita Derby. He returned for  Whittingham the next year, won the Oak Tree Invitational and earned nearly half  a million dollars after his operation.  </P> <P> Spend a Buck was another high-profile thoroughbred who bounced back after knee  surgery for removal of a bone chip. He had that surgery in November of his  2-year-old season, then returned in the spring of 1985 and won the Kentucky  Derby and, eventually, was voted horse of the year.  </P> <P> "There's some people who would go ahead and train a horse with a chip still in  there," Whittingham said. "You can get away with it, but sometimes the chip  gets to grinding away at the cartilage, and you end up with worse damage. Just  as well to get it out of there and start fresh."  </P> <P> Plans originally called for Sunday Silence to get a brief vacation and be  pointed for the San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita in mid-January. The injury  will deprive him of a chance to run in the $500,000 Strub Stakes in February  and the $1,000,000 Santa Anita Handicap in March.  </P> <P> "That doesn't break my heart," Whittingham said. "If he wins a lot early in the  year, he ends up carrying too much weight in handicaps later on. Anyway, he's  still growing. A little extra time off will do him a world of good."  </P> <P> Sunday Silence was shipped from Santa Anita to Hollywood Park early Tuesday  morning with the rest of Whittingham's stable. The colt will remain at the  track during his recovery, and if all goes well, Whittingham said, Sunday  Silence could go back into training in about three months.  </P></p>

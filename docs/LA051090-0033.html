			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: INGREDIENT CHANGES, HINTS FOR 'BAKING' BETTER MUFFINS  </P> <P> People who claim muffins can't be microwaved have clearly used the wrong  recipe. Conventional recipes won't work because microwaves affect foods in  different, often unpredictable, ways and adjustments must be made.  </P> <P> Muffins, for example, rise faster and higher in a microwave than in a  conventional oven, so you must reduce the baking powder by about one-third and  fill the muffin pan cups no more than half full.  </P> <P> The recipes that follow have been especially developed for the microwave, and  if you follow them to the letter you should produce perfect muffins every time.  </P> <P> Finally, here are a couple of tips that will serve you well whenever you "bake  " or reheat muffins by microwave.  </P> <P> Here's the way to microwave just a few muffins at a time: Line one to six  custard cups (five-ounce size) with double thickness of paper liners. Half fill  each with muffin batter and arrange two inches apart, three cups in a triangle  and four or more in a circle. Microwave as directed. If you set three or more  cups on a plate, they'll be easier to rearrange, rotate and lift in and out of  the oven.  </P> <P> To reheat muffins, wrap room-temperature muffins in paper towels and microwave  on MEDIUM (50% power), allowing 15 to 20 seconds per muffin.  </P> <P> APRICOT-BRAN MUFFINS  </P> <P> 1 cup ready-to-eat whole bran cereal  </P> <P> 2/3 cup milk  </P> <P> 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour  </P> <P> 1/3 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon baking powder  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 2/3 cup finely chopped dried apricots  </P> <P> 1/3 cup oil  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> Combine bran and milk. Set aside to soak at least 2 minutes.  </P> <P> Sift all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together into mixing  bowl. Add apricots and toss to dredge. Make well in center of dry ingredients.  </P> <P> Beat together oil and eggs. Stir into bran mixture, then pour into well in dry  ingredients. Stir lightly just to mix (batter should be lumpy).  </P> <P> Line each cup of 6-cup microwave-safe muffin pan with 2 paper liners. Half fill  each with muffin batter.  </P> <P> Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Test for  doneness after 2 minutes by inserting wood pick in center of each muffin. Pick  should come out clean (moist spots on surface of muffins will dry on standing).  </P> <P> Remove outer liners at once and transfer muffins (in single liners) to wire  rack. Let stand 2 minutes before serving. Microwave remaining batter as  directed. Makes 1 dozen.  </P> <P> BUTTERMILK-WHEAT BERRY MUFFINS  </P> <P> 1/4 cup wheat berries  </P> <P> 1/4 cup boiling water  </P> <P> 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 3/4 cup unsifted whole-wheat flour (not stone-ground)  </P> <P> 1/4 cup oil  </P> <P> 2/3 cup buttermilk  </P> <P> 1/3 cup honey  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> Combine wheat berries and boiling water in custard cup. Cover with vented  plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 1 minute. Let cool, covered, 10  minutes, then drain well.  </P> <P> Sift all-purpose flour, baking soda and salt together into mixing bowl. Add  whole-wheat flour and wheat berries and toss well. Make well in center of dry  ingredients.  </P> <P> Combine oil, buttermilk, honey and eggs. Stir lightly into dry ingredients just  to mix (batter should be lumpy).  </P> <P> Line each cup of 6-cup microwave-safe muffin pan with 2 paper liners. Half fill  each with muffin batter.  </P> <P> Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Test for  doneness after 2 minutes by inserting wood pick in center of each muffin. Pick  should come out clean (moist spots on surface of muffins will dry on standing).  </P> <P> Remove outer liners at once and transfer muffins (in single liners) to wire  rack. Let stand 2 minutes before serving. Microwave remaining batter as  directed. Makes 1 dozen.  </P> <P> Note: Wheat berries are available at health food stores. In ovens of less than  600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

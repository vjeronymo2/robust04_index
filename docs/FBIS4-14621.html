			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 1 Apr -- According to Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, Russia will sign the NATO "Partnership for  Peace" program this month, as planned.    Answering journalists' questions at the airport while  meeting  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Andrey Kozyrev  indicated that there had been no changes in Russia's stance.  Referring to the statements made yesterday by the president's  press secretary to the effect that several months would be  needed to resolve this issue, Kozyrev said he was probably  talking about implementing the document rather than signing it.</p>

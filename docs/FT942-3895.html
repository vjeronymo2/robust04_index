			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Bi-Bop deluxe - Gizmos There are few things the French like better than techno-toys. Only a few years ago they were extolling the virtues of Minitel, the interactive information system that might be more of a bumpy B-road than an information superhighway, but is now a fixture of Gallic life. However, the techno-toy of the moment is the Bi-Bop, the portable phone launched last year by France Telecom. So far the Bi-Bop is only available in Paris and Strasbourg. But the cafe terraces and garden squares of those cities are already peppered with phoneaholic Bi-Bop owners chattering into their natty black plastic phones. The Bi-Bop has its drawbacks. It is not, after all, truly portable. It can only be used within reach of a borne, one of the transmission boxes that France Telecom has fitted to the Paris and Strasbourg lamp-posts. That said, so many bornes have been installed that there are few places in Paris or Strasbourg where you cannot use a Bi-Bop, and it can receive calls from - and make them to - anywhere in the world. Also, the Bi-Bop does have its advantages. One is its price. It only costs FFr990.00 (around Pounds 100) to buy the phone itself - plus FFr54.50 for monthly rental and FFr29.00 a month for access to an ansamachine - which makes it much, much cheaper than a conventional portable phone. The Bi-Bop also has the benefit of good design. It is small enough to be popped into a pocket: but not so small that the user risks falling into the trap of looking as though they are conducting a love affair - or clinching a business deal - by mumbling into the palm of their hand.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> HARVARD CLINCHES A SHARE OF LEAGUE TITLE  </P> <P> If Harvard High were to play all of its basketball games in a vacuum, Coach  Greg Hilliard might be the last to gripe. Reputation, Hilliard says, can be  detrimental.  </P> <P> The notion, therefore, that the Saracens took a step closer to legitimacy  Tuesday with their 71-60 victory over Notre Dame is somewhat unsettling to  Hilliard.  </P> <P> "It's nice to get recognition," he said. "But there's something to be said for  that unknown quality. Every time we show up, people think, 'I don't know if  they're for real yet.' "  </P> <P> Count Notre Dame among the believers.  </P> <P> The second-place Knights (10-10 overall, 4-3 in San Fernando Valley League  play) were in position to shave Harvard's commanding lead in the league  standings. Instead, they saw the Saracens (18-2, 7-0) run their winning streak  to 11 games and assure themselves of at least a share of the league title.  </P> <P> That is not to say Notre Dame was passive in defeat. The Knights surged twice  in the second half but were unable to take the lead.  </P> <P> With three minutes left, Notre Dame's Bobby DaCorsi made a free throw to trim  the deficit to 60-55. Earlier in the fourth period, he scored on consecutive  layups to bring the Knights within seven.  </P> <P> Harvard, using an uncharacteristically deliberate approach, pulled away in the  stretch with an 11-3 rally that included a decisive three-point basket by guard  Rick Osterloh.  </P> <P> Osterloh's spirit-snapping basket came with 1 minute 49 seconds to play and  gave Harvard a 67-57 advantage.  </P> <P> Osterloh, who sat out the first meeting between the teams because of the flu,  paced the Saracens with 20 points.  </P> <P> DaCorsi, a junior, scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, both game highs,  for Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Notre Dame trailed, 38-28, at intermission but trimmed the deficit to a point  less than three minutes into the third period. DaCorsi scored six points and  teammate Steve Colella made a layup and a pair of 17-foot jump shots to pare  Harvard's lead to 43-42. The Saracens answered with a 12-4 run to finish the  quarter.  </P></p>

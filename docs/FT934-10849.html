			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Earnings at NZ utility ahead 19% TELECOM Corporation, the New Zealand utility controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, yesterday announced a 19.1 per cent increase in earnings to NZDollars 251.4m (USDollars 139.5m) for the six months to the end of September. Dr Roderick Deane, chief executive, said the 'excellent' result was due to cost-cutting, 'well focused, powerfully driven marketing initiatives' and the benefits of the continuing restructuring. In February the company announced plans to cut the payroll by 5,000, and this process was running ahead of schedule, he said. The total employed had so far been cut to 10,360 from 12,338. Net earnings for the second quarter rose to NZDollars 133.2m, a 17 per cent rise on the year-ago figure. However, the company warned against the expectation of earnings continuing to rise at that rate. The dividend is being raised to 8.25 cents from 7.25 cents. Operating costs, excluding abnormal operating costs, fell by 4.8 per cent to NZDollars 797.5m.</p>

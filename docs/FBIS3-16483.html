A whole range of issues, touching  upon the development of Ukrainian-U.S. relations, were discussed  during the conversation. In particular, the possibilities and  specific ways of attracting U.S. private capital in Ukraine's  economy were discussed. Leonid Kravchuk informed the guest  about the political and economic situation in Ukraine and about  the progress of the reform. He pointed out that no matter what  credits are granted by foreign countries, Ukraine's economy  cannot be revived without solid investments. For its part,  Ukraine will do everything possible to create the necessary  conditions for the protection of investments, emphasized the  president. Ukraine's legislation, too, serves this purpose.    Richard Nixon extended Leonid Kravchuk the best wishes from  U.S. President Bill Clinton. He highly assessed the results of  the recent visit by the president of Ukraine to the United  States and the agreements achieved in the course of the visit.    The United States attributes great importance to relations  with Ukraine and to the consolidation of its independence and  regards it as a good partner in various spheres, emphasized  Richard Nixon. I arrived in Ukraine to obtain, so to say,  first-hand information about the situation in your country and  to report on everything I saw and heard here to Bill Clinton  upon my return to the United States.    Leonid Kravchuk asked Richard Nixon to give his best wishes  to U.S. President Bill Clinton and declared that he recalls his  visit to the United States and his meetings with the U.S.  President with great pleasure.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report of Makhmud Mamedov, chairman of the organizing </F> committee, at constituent congress of the ADSP on 23 April 1994:  "Equality Not in Poverty But Equality in Wealth"]    [Text] Esteemed Delegates and Guests of the Congress!    This is a notable day for us. The constituent congress of  the  Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners' Party [ADSP] has begun.    As of today one more political organization enters the  social  and political life of Azerbaijan. We are aware of how difficult  and responsible and at the same time honorable a mission we are  undertaking. We are firmly convinced that as a result of our  activity this day will be an important landmark in the history  of sovereign Azerbaijan. But serious efforts, the concentration  of intellectual potential, and the assertiveness of all members  of the party will be needed for this.    At this moment the situation in the republic is  extraordinarily complex. The economic, political, and spiritual  crisis, a ruthless war, which has lasted six years now, the loss  of thousands of young men and women in the struggle to liberate  our land, over a million refugees forced to leave their native  parts--all this is the reality of our present-day life. Various  political forces have come to power in recent years in  Azerbaijan and have attempted to extricate the country from the  crisis. Unfortunately, these attempts have produced no results,  and the crisis, intensifying all the while, has assumed  wide-ranging proportions. We value the activity of the forces  that contributed to the elimination of totalitarianism in  Azerbaijan and to the enhancement of the role of national  self-awareness. But we would like to note that the time has now  come for people who are creators far removed from destructive  activity and slogan-mongering. The period of revolutions is  over, the time has come for new thinking and fundamental  transformations.    The populism of past years must give way to professionalism  and specific constructive activity. Proceeding from the urgency  of new ideas for our republic, we deemed necessary the creation  of the Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners' Party. There can  be no doubt that our society can be rescued from the present  grim situation only by people in possession of the new way of  thinking. The future of Azerbaijan will depend on the extent to  which the idea of enterprise is realized. We are for this reason  laying the foundations of a party far removed from any  radicalism and extremes and intent on developing society by  purposive reforms.    What do we mean when we speak of new ideas and relations, of  new policies? The answer to this question may be gleaned from  the very name of the party. The definition "Azerbaijan"  symbolizes the party's devotion to the fatherland and its  sovereignty. The party will operate in Azerbaijan and in the  name of Azerbaijan. It will be based on the ideas of civicism.    The word "Democratic" in the name of the party is also of  great symbolic meaning. We believe that the majority of the  current problems have been engendered by the fact that we have  failed to reveal to the proper extent the very concept of  "democracy." Democracy is not anarchy, not arbitrariness. It is  the supremacy of the law over the state, over the citizens, over  political forces. Democracy is the political power of the  people. A multiparty system and freedom of speech are its main  attributes.    The supremacy of the law is a basic principle of our  activity. And it is essential for this reason to replace with a  new one the current constitution, which reflects the principles  of the basic law of the Soviet period and which has undergone no  fundamental revision.    The concept of a party of "Property Owners" reflects the  directions of its activity. In our opinion, a property owner is  not simply an owner of property and an estate but the true  master of them, as, equally, of his knowledge, capabilities, and  intellect. In this sense each citizen of Azerbaijan should be a  property owner. And it is in this direction that our party will  undertake wide-ranging activity. The ADSP will propagandize new  ideas and a new attitude toward the means of production and  property and the need for enterprise and proprietorship for  society under the conditions of the market economy. And the  entrepreneur will be preoccupied by a single goal, a single  desire--manufacturing a product that is competitive, conforms to  world standards, and corresponds to public requirements. Success  in the market economy will in the majority of cases depend on  man's creative, constructive capabilities and entrepreneurial  experience. For this reason the "enterprise" and "property"  concepts could consolidate all citizens, all strata of society.    We wish to see as property owners and masters the worker and  the peasant and the professional. The ADSP will create all the  conditions for the conversion of enterprises into stock  companies, the distribution of the shares among the workers free  of charge, and their enlistment in entrepreneurial activity in  this way.    The main task for us at the present time is not a struggle  for power but the concentration of the entire potential for the  extrication of the republic from the present profound state of  crisis. The economic situation in the republic is very grim at  this time. In Azerbaijan, with its generous natural resources,  splendid climate, and enormous production resources, the living  standard of the people is declining by the day and the social  protection of the citizens is deteriorating. National income is  falling rapidly. In 1993 this indicator constituted 27.5 percent  of that of the previous year. Twenty-five percent less basic  industrial commodities were manufactured than the year before.  Inflation is rising, and compared with 1992 the issue of money  by the National Bank increased by a factor of more than 29.6 and  continues to grow. The production of all types of industrial and  agricultural commodities continues, in fact, to fall. The main  reason for this is the severance of economic ties to the  republics of the former Union.    But the state of crisis in which the economy has found  itself  has a number of subjective factors also. Thus, although the  Azerbaijan Republic has acquired political independence and  become a full member of the international community, its  economic independence is still under serious threat.    Our republic has opted for the market economy path, which is  characteristic of the majority of the world's developed  countries and based on economic logic. But the measures  pertaining to the adoption and engagement of a new economic  mechanism are only being implemented slowly; the mechanism of  the former economic system, now in its death throes, continues  to operate. Owing to the counteraction of many highly placed  retrograde persons cherishing a dream of "everything, perhaps,  going back to what it once was," transition to the market  economy is being impeded and artificial barriers are being  erected. The failure to adopt the corresponding laws on the  market economy, the absence of a working mechanism for some laws  which have been adopted, but which exist merely on paper, and  the activity of state and executive authorities not brought into  line with the new conditions are graphic testimony to this.    In sum, economic destabilization has reached the point at  which the economy has become the main factor of political  instability. The indifference to the fate of the economic  reforms and to the transition to market relations regulated by  law represent a serious threat to the sovereignty of Azerbaijan.  An acceleration of the reforms and the elimination of the  asystemic approach in the shaping of the market economy are  essential, therefore. The solution lies in the speediest  establishment of the economic system proven by world practice.  This means:    --denationalization of the economy;    --privatization;    --the development of enterprise;    --formation of the market and market infrastructure;    --the use of progressive methods in the creation of business  relations;    --the elimination of administrative-command methods  contradicting the market economy;    --price liberalization based on the evolved supply and  demand  ratios;    --the correct pursuit of financial, credit, and monetary  policy;    --refinement of the customs and tax systems;    --an alleviation of the difficulties of the transition to  the  market economy by way of the creation of a system of guaranteed  social protection.    The enumerated comprehensive measures encompass three  stages:  a halt to the decline in production, an immediate transition to  the market economy, and provision for the development and  protection of this system. A halt to the decline in production  is connected with denationalization and the implementation of an  anticrisis policy. Unfortunately, privatization and fulfillment  of the conditions of the transitional period are being  undertaken extremely inadequately, and an economic structure  adapted to the new realities is not being created. For this  reason many state-owned enterprises of the republic are standing  idle. And this, in turn, is causing a decline in production, a  shortage of goods, unemployment, a deterioration in the  well-being of the public, and a disruption of normal monetary  circulation. Privatization should be effected in the quickest  way possible, it being necessary first and foremost to privatize  facilities of trade, public catering, consumer services, and  small production enterprises.    Fundamental reforms are needed in the financial, banking,  and  customs systems and in the sphere of foreign economic relations.  The absence of the former in these spheres is impeding the  transition to a market system, hampering a halt to the fall in  production, and causing increased inflation.    The state's financial policy is still being implemented by  the former bureaucratic methods.    This applies particularly to the work of the state banks.  The  activity, or rather inactivity, of the National Bank, which has  become a stumbling block in the way of the development of  enterprise and the formation of a market economy, is bewildering.    Speaking of the obstacles put in the way of the activity of  private structures and entrepreneurs, mention has to be made of  the flaw in the customs and tax systems. The red tape, relapses  into bureaucratism in the customs system, and the high customs  duty are by no means serving to develop the market economy and  enterprise.    The party believes that it is necessary to elaborate and  adopt new laws aimed at the democratization of the said spheres  and to remove the shortcomings in them as quickly as possible.    The lagging of the agrarian reforms in the republic and the  fact that a number of the adopted laws and decisions are not  working are accelerating by the day the slump that has  encompassed agriculture. It is more than two years now since the  draft Land Reform Act was published, but it has yet to be  adopted. The indifferent attitude toward the great public  property--our land--and inefficient and negligent land tenure  have caused the erosion of over 600,000 hectares of land.    Insuperable barriers have been erected between the land and  the peasant. Hollow speeches concerning its lease and the  creation of private farms are heard from time to time, but not  even the minimum of the conditions necessary for this are being  created. The peasant and, ultimately, the people are suffering.    The party deems essential the privatization of the land and  its unconditional transfer to those who cultivate it. Every  peasant should be the master of his land and foster in his  children the feeling of a proprietary attitude toward it. Whence  the conclusion: It is necessary to restore historical justice,  give back to the peasant the land, which was taken away from him  70 years ago essentially in the guise of nationalization, and  thereby restore it to its rightful owner. But the intolerable  procrastination over the reforms is leading to the loss of  agriculture's material and technical resources. In the past  three years alone there has been a steep decline in the numbers  of livestock on the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and the indicators  of yield and productivity have fallen two- and threefold.    The harvests of cereals, cotton, vegetables, grapes, and  other agricultural products are declining rapidly. Confirmation  of this may be seen in the example of Shamakhinskiy and  Dzhalilabadskiy districts. The grape harvests in Shamakhinskiy  District fell from 243,000 tonnes to 6 tonnes, and in  Dzhalalabadskiy, from 250,000 tonnes to 10 tonnes! Are these not  terrifying facts?! Can Azerbaijan be extricated from the  economic crisis by such mismanagement? Of course not. No sector  of agriculture is operating profitably. The bankruptcy of the  kolkhozes and sovkhozes is on the doorstep. Agriculture remains  the most laborious part of the economy, the pay in it is the  lowest, and the peasantry is the most socially unprotected  stratum of our society. To emerge from the crisis we need first  and foremost to seek the development of peasant enterprise.    Among the congress delegates there are many peasants who  encounter daily the difficulties and problems connected with  enterprise. Their speeches and proposals will be taken into  consideration and will help refine our further activity.    We are drawing up specific proposals connected with a  resolution of the above-mentioned economic problems with regard  to the transition to a market economy and the development of  enterprise, and this package of proposals will be presented to  the government within the next few days.    Attaching great significance to science and education, the  ADSP considers a solution of the problems in this sphere a most  important task. We will contribute to an improvement in the  material and technical resources of science and an improvement  in scientists' work conditions and a rise in their living  standard and thereby stimulate the development and progress of  all sectors of the republic's economy. For an economy deprived  of new scientific achievements is incapable of producing  effective results.    The party believes that for the accomplishment of the  impending tasks in the period of transition to a market economy  there will be a need for personnel that have attended a school  of private enterprise. A certain amount of work has been  performed in this sphere in the republic, and dozens of  institutes and centers of education have been created. But  instead of ensuring conditions stimulating the activity of these  private centers of training and introducing the young people  being taught there to world science, they are being subjected to  groundless pressure.    We believe that a state that has announced a transition to a  market economy should not be demonstrating biased selectiveness  but displaying concern also for this educational system, which  is new in the life of Azerbaijan.    Each member of the party should know that a society that is  indifferent toward science and education is poor both materially  and spiritually. We will aspire to the cooperation of scientists  and entrepreneurs and to the implementation of their specific  developments.    The ADSP, appreciating on its merits the important role of  culture and art in an enhancement of the living standard of the  people, will contribute to the extrication from crisis of  cultural institutions, whose physical resources have in recent  years been undermined appreciably. Facilitate increased  attention to figures of culture and art of the republic and to  the creation of the necessary conditions for their creativity.  We must revive the traditions of such patrons of the arts as  Hajji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev and Musa Nagiyev and we shall call on  all entrepreneurs and business people to take specific steps in  this field.    Our party will perform a great deal of work on the  protection  of monuments of culture and art and also on the return of our  national treasures taken overseas.    Azerbaijan is a multinational country. Representatives of  various nationalities have lived on its territory as good  neighbors of the Azerbaijani people for many centuries. The ADSP  urges protection of the rights of the national minorities and  ethnic groups and a solicitous attitude toward their customs,  traditions, and language.    The ADSP is for the mutual noninterference of religion and  the state in each other's affairs. By virtue of the fact that  the ancient culture of our people is closely linked with the  Islamic religion, the party will exert efforts for the  affirmation of a respectful attitude toward this religion and  contribute to the study at the proper level of religious  sources, the opening of religious schools, and the restoration  of the mosques. The party will display respect for other  religions also and adopt a solicitous attitude toward their  religious structures. The ADSP considers religious intolerance  impermissible.    A legal basis for preferential conditions of the use of  economic factors in health care, specifically, the channeling of  capital from the private sector to this sphere, is a command of  the times. A transition to health care for which a partial  charge is made and the insurance medicine connected with it  would undoubtedly bring our health care into line with today's  economic system. The party believes that the treatment and  improvement of medical services for persons who have been  wounded and maimed in fighting to liberate our land should be  the most important task of today's health care.    We will endeavor to direct our domestic policy toward social  assistance to the population. Needy families, including the  families of refugees, martyrs, the handicapped, participants in  the war, retirees, and large families will sense our concern.    Speaking of social protection of the population, I would  like  to mention particularly the neglected state of housing  construction and transport services in the republic. The  profound crisis of the economy is being reflected increasingly  palpably in this sphere.    The steep decline in housing construction in recent years  has  engendered particular strain in the satisfaction of the public's  housing requirements. This is explained by the fact that  approximately 1 million of our compatriots have as a consequence  of the Armenian aggression been forced to abandon their native  parts and make their home in tents, hostels, sanatoriums,  schools, and other nonresidential facilities. Many of them have  poured into Baku, where great social strain has arisen in this  connection.    Attaching great significance to housing construction in the  republic, the ADSP will endeavor to make full use in this sphere  of the forces both of the state and the business world. It is  necessary to this end to create the conditions for the  entrepreneurs, allocate them the necessary plots of land, and  make credit available to them.    We will at the same time operate actively in the direction  of  an improvement in mass transit services and the removal of the  problems that exist in this sphere.    The extent of employment and joblessness is one of the main  problems greatly worrying us today. The ADSP believes that the  further development of enterprise, the emergence of new  production divisions particularly, would signal a turning point  in the resolution of this problem.    I would at the same time like to mention that the  unemployed,  as a reality of our present life, must receive assistance and  sense concern not only on the part of our business people but of  the state also.    We intend to display particular concern for the youth and  adolescents. The defense of their rights and assurance of all  the necessary conditions so that they might become worthy  members of our society will always be at the center of the  attention of the ADSP.    I would like to make particular mention of one further  problem. The lessening of concern for our future, children,  inadequate teaching and educational work with them, and the  inattention to them. This was undertaken more or less in the  bygone Soviet period by, aside from the family, such public  organizations as pioneer and Communist Youth League groups and  clubs. The ADSP believes that it is necessary to increase the  attention paid to children on the part of the state and to  prepare and implement comprehensive measures in this sphere. We  will make use of all our opportunities in this cause.    The ADSP believes that a primary and sacred task currently  confronting the whole Azerbaijani people and the state is the  liberation of our land from the Armenian occupiers.    Thousands of heroic sons and daughters of the Azerbaijani  people have been wounded and maimed in battle and have died the  death of the brave in this struggle. Today also the sons and  daughters of our people are fighting heroically for their native  land and wholeheartedly believe in the victory of the just  cause. At the same time we are seriously alarmed by the fact  that the state cannot secure fundamental changes in this sector  and that the current shortcomings are not being eliminated in  timely fashion.    We believe that the leaders of the Azerbaijan state should  create an army in which strict discipline rules and mobilize the  people in the name of victory over the accursed enemy. Our party  would render all possible assistance here. It is our profound  belief that at a fateful time for Azerbaijan all political  forces should unite in the struggle against the Armenian  aggressors.    The ADSP believes that the machinery of state should  primarily be perfected and restructured on democratic  principles, an executive mechanism conforming to the  requirements of the market economy created, and the  bureaucratism and red tape hampering our development removed for  the accomplishment of the set goals and tasks. And the  legislature, executive, and judiciary should primarily for this  be delineated fully.    We believe that the National Assembly does not represent the  people to the full extent and has exhausted its historical  mission. It is necessary, therefore, having secured stability in  the republic as quickly as possible, to hold new elections to  the supreme legislative body.    Persons who put the interests of the people above personal  interests, who would serve to build a strong state, and who are  capable of independent decisionmaking should be represented in  parliament.    The executive should be formed from people who are creative,  businesslike, just, and humane, who possess the new thinking,  and who are capable of engaging in politics at the level of  today's requirements.    The supremacy of the law and an understanding of the  irreversibility of progress along the path of the market economy  should be the main yardstick in the activity of the executive.  We will strive for the restructuring of the executive  authorities in accordance with these demands, an improvement in  their structure, and the abolition of duplicative components.    It is necessary to carry out fundamental reforms in the  administrative authorities and form the judiciary as the third  branch of power in the true meaning of the word and ensure its  complete independence.    Each citizen of the republic, regardless of the position he  holds, should have the right to appeal to the judicial  authorities with a demand for the restoration of his violated  rights.    The law must not allow the groundless interference of the  police and procuracy authorities in the activity of the private  sector. It is necessary to clamp down on all factors leading to  bribery, corruption, and arbitrary action in the administrative  authorities.    The ADSP believes that the successful accomplishment of the  impending tasks and the correct management of personnel policy  are very important. In all areas, personnel need to be chosen  only in accordance with businesslike and professional qualities.  Unfortunately, these criteria were for many years disregarded in  the selection of personnel, which permitted the principles of  nepotism and personal devotion to come to the fore.    As a result positions in the managerial structures went to  incompetent people devoid, at times, of the necessary moral  qualities, which, as a whole, damaged the common interests of  the Azerbaijani people and harmed the principles of its  statehood.    The ADSP emphatically condemns the selection of personnel  for  directive positions in accordance with family and protectionist  criteria and notes the impermissibility of this approach.    The party's activity in the field of foreign policy shall be  based on international rules of law, the UN Charter, the  principles generally accepted in the international community,  and the constitution and the laws of the Azerbaijani state.    Taking as a basis national interests and statehood, the  international activity of Azerbaijan should serve peace,  security, and mutually beneficial cooperation. The party deems  essential the creation of direct diplomatic relations with  states of the world and supports the territorial integrity and  sanctity of the borders of all countries, their noninterference  in one another's internal affairs, cooperation and peaceful  coexistence, and the solution of all conflicts within the  framework of international rules of law exclusively by way of  negotiations. It proceeds from the provisions of UN documents  defending human rights and liberties.    The ADSP will endeavor to create close ties to overseas  parties of a democratic persuasion and will broaden all-around  cooperation with them in the interests of Azerbaijan.    In the sphere of economic reform the ADSP will strive to  ensure that the experience of the world's progressive countries  be studied and applied in Azerbaijan and will create closer  contacts with Azerbaijani businessmen living abroad.    The party will facilitate the establishment of relations  with  all Azerbaijanis who live outside of the republic and also with  the societies that unite them, support their activity in the  interests of Azerbaijan, and contribute to the creation and  development of the Azerbaijani diaspora in foreign countries. We  call on other parties also to join in this initiative. We  believe that there is now an even greater need for Azerbaijan to  convey to the world community the voice of truth in the defense  of its land.    Together with bilateral relations in foreign policy the  party  notes the significance for the Azerbaijani state of multilateral  relations, particularly the need for cooperation with regional  and international organizations, and believes that it is  necessary to take advantage of their strength and authority to  have Armenia, which has occupied land of Azerbaijan, recognized  as the aggressor.    Esteemed delegates and guests of the congress!    As a result of the purposive activity of the organizing  committee of the ADSP action groups have in a short space of  time been formed in 23 districts of Azerbaijan. This process is  continuing rapidly, and the number of the party's supporters is  growing by the day. This is reason for us to conclude that the  ADSP will shortly be a most authoritative party of the republic.    The draft program and rules of the party will be presented  to  you today. Your proposals, complaints, and criticisms will help  perfect these documents.    Ours is a democratic, parliamentary-type party. Members of  the party will work in a creative atmosphere affording an  opportunity for a display of initiative. Granted all this, there  must be discipline in the party. Our principle is discussion of  the party's decisions until they have been adopted. An adopted  decision is law for all party members. The party will defend the  interests of each of its members. And they, in turn, are called  upon to strive to enhance the party's prestige by their activity.    In view of the fact that ours is a constituent congress, we  have not made it our purpose to express in the report our  attitude toward all areas of the party's activity.    The directive party authorities, which will be elected  today,  will together with the organizations being formed in the regions  involve themselves in an improvement of the party's strategy and  tactics at the current stage.    We entrepreneurs must show graphically the benefit of our  activity, implementing our ideas and striving for actual  achievements.    In the Soviet period the people's consciousness was poisoned  by malicious communist propaganda to the effect that  enterprising people are exploiters profiting at the people's  expense, that they are to blame for the poor life of society,  and that they are building their prosperity on the misfortunes  of poor people. The useful work and noble accomplishments of  creative, active entrepreneurs, who themselves knew how to live  and afforded the people an opportunity to work and earn, were  slandered. Back at the start of the century forces of occupation  under the banner of revolution wiped out the genuine  entrepreneurs and did unprecedented damage to the spirituality  and economy of Azerbaijan. Thus was the principle of general  ruin and the equalization of all in poverty realized.    The party that we have founded advances the polar-opposite  principle--equality not in poverty but equality in wealth. Its  purpose is realization of the idea that all citizens are  entitled to be and should be masters in the full meaning of this  word. A nation that has failed to foster its own entrepreneurs  will be forced to serve the entrepreneurs of other states.    In this sense we must ourselves become the masters of our  national wealth. And for this reason it is the sacred duty of  each of us to propagandize extensively the idea of enterprise  and to create all the conditions for the development of market  relations. We need to unite all efforts in the name of the  elimination of the obstacles in the way of the development of  the market economy and enterprise, fight jointly against  conservatives and, ultimately, build an independent state and  wealthy country with strong authorities.    We emphatically declare that only the entrepreneurs, that  is,  all of us, will liberate the republic from the present grim  situation, from the economic crisis. The main purpose of our  party is to achieve this and to act in the name of a strong and  free Azerbaijan.    I call on all of you to struggle for these national  interests  and, of course, for the expulsion from the territory of  Azerbaijan of the accursed enemy.    I thank you for your attention.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW MANY GERMANYS? IN WHAT SORT OF EUROPE?;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION WILL DEPEND ON NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> Thinking about what the sudden changes in Eastern Europe might mean to the  "German question" and the whole of Europe brings to mind the Peter Ustinov play  "Photo Finish." An old man, returning to life, meets his grandson and during a  long conversation asks him about the family's coal mines. "Oh, sorry, we have  been nationalized," he hears. The ancestor, struck by surprise and happiness,  exclaims, "So we still are a nation!"  </P> <P> We know very little about the possible outcome of glasnost and perestroika,  either in the Soviet Union or in the other member states of the Warsaw Pact. In  fact, nowhere in history do we find a precedent for a deliberate and  fundamental change from communism and a centralized, rotten economy to a  pluralistic society and a successful market economy. There is a rather short  path into communist dictatorship: Just apply a sufficient amount of  revolutionary force. But the other way around, from bankrupt communism to  fruitful freedom, from Marx to market, this is a path not taken before. We do  know one thing for certain: Reform in Eastern Europe means the recovery of  nationhood long subjugated to Soviet influence.  </P> <P> So, some of these changing states might be asking, "Are we still a nation?"  </P> <P> In Poland and Hungary, where reform is taking place at astonishing speed, and  in Czechoslovakia, where reform lags, if you take communism away, you still  have nations with deeply rooted traditions that have not been exterminated by  Moscow's predominance. Take communism away from East Germany, however, and not  much is left. The German Democratic Republic does not have any raison d'etre  aside from its ideology. The huge number of citizens leaving the German  Democratic Republic by way of both Hungary and the more cumbersome, difficult  legal emigration channels demonstrates clearly the lack of political cohesion.  </P> <P> We can concede that the G.D.R. is the single East European state whose economy  is in a relatively effective shape, although on a low -- and declining -- level  compared to the West. The East Germans even enjoyed an unintended glasnost over  the decades, courtesy of West German TV and radio. Millions of visitors have  crossed the German-German border in both directions, exchanging their  experiences. But this modest openness in the end intensified the problem it was  designed to solve.  </P> <P> As long as the East Germans seemed to be imprisoned forever, many of them were  resigned to coping with what they had. But nowadays it costs them "only" four  or five years of waiting and state harassment before they can leave their  country behind, through legal channels. Instead of reconciling the remaining  population with the regime, this opening to freedom by departure further  delegitimizes the state authority.  </P> <P> Now Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, with his call for swift reform, has  put the East German Communists under even more pressure from their own  population. They are caught in a double bind: If they reject the concept of  reform, they alienate themselves still more, not only from their own people but  from the other East European states as well. If they giveway to political  pluralism and a market economy, they eventually provoke the question: What's  the difference between the two German societies that could justify two separate  states?  </P> <P> So it seems quite natural that West German politicians, mostly conservatives,  speculate in public about new chances for German reunification stemming from  the changes in Eastern Europe. I have my doubts about this. We have to learn  from history that the division of Germany is not the consequence of communism  but the result of Hitler's war against Europe. And even if the communist  ideology fades away, the reasons for the division of Germany will not  disappear. Bismarck's German Reich, founded in 1871, never fit into the  European framework properly. Even today a united Germany would, economically  and politically, overwhelm the other European countries. As in Bismarck's days,  they would have to try to set up a coalition, to which Germany would have to  react by looking for counter-coalitions. It would be the old game once again.  </P> <P> The real German question is not the existence of two German states, but the  vast differentials between them in terms of liberty and welfare. If there were  a real chance to trade unity for freedom for the East Germans, we should have  to consider the bargain.  </P> <P> But whether the question is resolved with one or two Germanys, no final  solution is feasible without a new European confederation or treaty  organization, that includes East and West Europe. There must be a framework in  which it does not matter how strong either a divided or united Germany is,  because the obligations and liaisons among all the European partners would  counterbalance any disparity of size and weight. Call it, with or without a bow  to Gorbachev, a common European house.  </P> <P> We have to complete this house, with the consensus of all prospective  inhabitants before we can ask how many Germanys we need. Then, however, the  question would not matter any more.  </P> <P> Capitalizing now on the convulsions of communism by speculating about German  unity would be extremely counterproductive -- not only for the reformers in  Poland and potential reformers in East Germany, but for Bonn's politics towards  the West as well.  </P></p>

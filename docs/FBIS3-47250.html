			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Cho Chae-hyon] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Korea [BOK] has expressed concern over  the impact the surging foreign money inflow will have on its  monetary management for this year.    Kim Yong-tae, chief of the central bank's Monetary  Department, said yesterday [7 January] that the foreign capital  influx will hit a record high this year.    Kim said that foreign capital totalling 8-9 trillion won  (10-12 billion dollars) will flow into Korea this year.    The BOK said that it plans to supply about 15.5-18.8  trillion  won in liquidity during 1994.    Accordingly, the foreign money inflow will account for about  50 percent of the total money supply growth this year. It means  half of this year's additional money supply will be set  depending on the foreign capital inflow.    The total money supply growth which peaked at 21.4 percent  in  last October has shown signs of declining since November and  reached 17.4 percent in December on an outstanding monthly  average basis.    M2 increased by 1.78 trillion won in December from the  previous month to 110.76 trillion won on an outstanding average  basis. M2 includes currency in circulation and demand, time and  savings deposits.    The central bank is poised to tighten its reign on money  growth in order to reduce inflationary pressure which has been  building up since the beginning of the year led by rises in  public services prices.    The most important challenge facing the central bank is how  to hold down consumer prices, Kim said.    In that context, the rising foreign money inflow is emerging  as a big burden to the central bank's fight against inflation  because it will result in fanning prices.    In order to offset the rise in money supply in the foreign  sector, the BOK will have to tighten its control on money growth  on the domestic side.    As the central bank released huge amounts of money last year  in the name of cushioning impacts following the implementation  of the real-name financial transaction system, the overflow of  funds has become a key factor for the current downward trend in  money growth.    The central bank did not fail to point out positive impacts  of foreign capital.    The BOK said that although total money supply growth will  continue to decline, the liquidity conditions for enterprises  will be in good shape because the capital inflow will boost the  stock market and give companies more chances to increase their  reliance on direct financing like issuing bonds and stocks.    For January, the central bank said it set its monetary  growth  target at 17-17.9 percent, compared with 17.5 percent growth a  year ago. It will release about 2.5-3.3 trillion won during  this month.    In the meantime, money market rates, as measured by  three-year corporate bond yields, remain stable at about 12  percent at present, compared with 13.35 percent in December 1992.    Reflecting the good liquidity conditions in the market,  inter-bank short-term call rates also are hovering at the 12  percent range, lower than the 14 percent a year ago.    Market analysts agree that interest rates in the money  market  will not rise at least till the beginning of the second quarter  when firms's fund demands are likely to rise because they are  expected to activate investments from April.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Brazil's deficit undermines IMF pact hope BRAZIL'S Congress approved the federal budget for this year late on Wednesday, after the most tempestuous negotiations of recent times. But government officials are forecasting a budget deficit of the equivalent of Dollars 10bn, which would destroy hopes of a new accord with the International Monetary Fund or any early reduction of inflation, now at 27 per cent a month. The Treasury showed a deficit of Dollars 400m last month - the first for more than two years and underlining the parlous state of the country's finances. Also, the Dollars 234bn budget, formulated last August, includes no provision for a court-ordered 147 per cent increase in state pensions, for a newly approved 33 per cent wage rise for government employees, or for President Itamar Franco's declared campaign on poverty. The main expense is service of the government's Dollars 136bn domestic debt. This will consume 65 per cent of the budget. Analysts say that the primary surplus of 2.1 per cent of GDP last year was achieved largely by deferring such as public sector pay rises, pension increases and infrastructure repairs. Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a consultant and former finance minister, says there is 'no longer any disguising the fact that the state is bankrupt. Compulsory expenses alone consume more than revenues.' Under the 1988 constitution, the federal government has little leeway, 90-95 per cent of the budget being consumed by compulsory transfers of taxes to the various states and municipalities, and federal employees being protected by guarantee of tenure. New taxes seem to be the government's only recourse, although a newly approved tax on cheques has already been weakened and is expected to raise only Dollars 4bn - less than half original predictions. Mr Eliseu Resende, the new finance minister, says he expects no reduction in inflation until October, when he hopes for a constitutional amendment to allow fiscal reform.</p>

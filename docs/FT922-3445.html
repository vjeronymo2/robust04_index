			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Delors calls for more open EC to head off critics The European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, yesterday called for a more open, less complicated European Community as an antidote to growing scepticism about European union. He was speaking at the first sitting of the European parliament since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last week. Mr Delors blamed growing scepticism about closer European union on the EC's failure to explain itself to a wider public. Mr Delors is clearly worried about the gathering criticism of the Commission and the community. In his address on the proposed EC budget - which has come under attack from member states - he emphasised how much Ireland benefited from EC funding. The Irish referendum on Maastricht takes place next week and polls published yesterday indicated increased opposition to the treaty. Members of the European parliament glimpsed the impact of the Danes' implicit criticism of the Commission president's style when Mr Delors reacted angrily to accusations that he wanted to 'sideline' the community's smaller member-states. 'That is totally false, totally wrong,' said Mr Delors, unexpectedly interrupting the emergency debate on the Danish referendum to respond to specific accusations levelled at him by Ms Nel van Dijk, a Dutch Green MEP. 'I protest very strongly and I think if you say something like that you have to come along with supporting evidence,' he said. Rumours that Mr Delors favoured giving more executive power for the Commission and large member-states in an enlarged community damaged the pro-EC cause in Denmark in the weeks before the referendum. Mr Delors had opened the debate on the Danish vote with a calm speech, tinged with contrition, laying out his views on the impact of, and reasons for, the Danish vote. He reasserted his view that the process of ratification of the treaty in the other 11 member states should continue. But he added that clarity of legislation, transparency of decision-making and a particular emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - the devolution of powers to the most appropriate authority - should be the hallmarks of Community institutions and governments. In Paris, however, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, described as 'rather worrying' a UK plan to explore the possibility of limiting the Commission's powers to intervene in national affairs. Mr Dehaene said his view was shared by French President Francois Mitter-rand. Mr Delors said that after January 1 1993, the target date for the implementation of the single European market, the volume of Commission-generated legislation was bound to diminish. 'We mustn't, for fear of being unemployed, make new laws just for the fun of it,' he said. The parliament voted by a large majority to urge member states to continue the ratification process 'without delay.' Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the socialist group in the parliament, rejected the option of reopening negotiations on the treaty.

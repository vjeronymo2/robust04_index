			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat seeks time from creditors GREYCOAT, the property company whose future is in doubt after share and bondholders last Friday rejected a rescue bid from Postel, faces a crucial test today if it is to keep creditors at bay. The company and NM Rothschild, its advisers, will this morning ask the Law Debenture Trust, trustees for holders of Greycoat's zero coupon bonds, for more time to find a way to avoid being put into default. If the trustees choose not to waive their rights to issue default notices, Greycoat's bankers are likely to take control of their security and the company would go into receivership. Greycoat's advisers expect to be granted a 30-day extension to find a way to reduce the company's high gearing that triggered the default on the zero coupon bonds. NM Rothschild and Greycoat would then have 'a fortnight to get something creative going', an adviser said. If no new rescue plan or bid emerged Greycoat's directors would be in danger of becoming personally accountable for allowing an insolvent company to continue trading. After the rejection last week of Postel's Pounds 120m rescue bid, one observer described the hush over the weekend as 'something of phoney war'. Since Postel announced its package, two blocks have emerged of share and bondholders who have a significant interest in a rescue being patched together. The UK Active Value Fund, advised by corporate financiers, Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, owns 18 per cent of the ordinary shares; while Gruss Partners, of the US, and Goldman Sachs hold 14 per cent and 8 per cent respectively of the preference shares. Greycoat will only avoid default on its zero coupon bonds in one of two ways. Either it will devise a more conventional restructuring with its shareholders and bondholders that would include a rights issue. A Rothschild adviser said yesterday 'there had been some conversations since the poll (of share and bondholders on Friday) but it is still early days'. Alternatively, a third party could make a bid for the company. Rothschild said yesterday it had not received any bids.</p>

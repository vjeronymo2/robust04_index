			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY URGES MEMBERS TO RUN UNDER REFORMS  </P> <P> The Polish Parliament on Friday approved laws introducing radical political  reforms, and the banned Solidarity union swiftly called on its members to  contest elections liberalized under the changes.  </P> <P> Leaders of Solidarity, which will be legalized under the reforms, said in a  statement: "We expect that activists of our union will be on the lists of  candidates."  </P> <P> The statement issued by Solidarity's National Executive Commission said: "We  deem it necessary that all the union's structures and all the union's members  agree that Solidarity enters legal public life during the electoral campaign."  </P> <P> The 20-member commission, Solidarity's top body, met in Warsaw after Parliament  passed six laws containing constitutional and political changes agreed to by  the Communist government and the Solidarity-led opposition in talks that ended  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Solidarity, the Communist world's first independent trade union, has boycotted  all parliamentary elections since it was suppressed under martial law in 1981.  </P> <P> It had previously said it was undecided if it would contest the elections, set  for June.  </P> <P> The 460-member Sejm (Parliament) overwhelmingly approved the six laws after a  brief debate.  </P> <P> Under a political deal at the talks, the opposition will have 35% of the Sejm  seats and freely contest for seats in the Senate.  </P></p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Thai banks show benefit of wide margins on lending First results from Thai commercial banks for 1994 suggest that the sector is continuing to increase profits by maintaining wide spreads between deposit and lending rates. Siam Commercial Bank announced yesterday that net profit in the first quarter rose by 20 per cent to Bt1.41bn (Dollars 56m) from Bt1.18bn, while the smaller Bank of Asia more than doubled its net profit to Bt265.9m from Bt129.9m. Bank of Ayudhya reported a 24 per cent rise to Bt800.7m from Bt647.8m. Full details have yet to be released, but bank executives said their cost of funds had remained low in the first quarter - a situation which is unlikely to continue throughout the year - while some lending rates had risen. Serm Suk, bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products in Thailand, reported a 72 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit to Bt97.3m from Bt56.4m. PepsiCo is planning to increase its stake in Serm Suk from 28 per cent to 42 per cent and use the company as a vehicle for expansion into other markets in the region.</p>

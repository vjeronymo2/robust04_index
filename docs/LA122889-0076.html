			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL UPHOLDS FIRING OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTY  </P> <P> The county Civil Service Commission on Wednesday upheld the firing of a  sheriff's deputy who failed to tell superiors he was asked to smuggle cocaine  to an inmate at County Jail near downtown Los Angeles or that he was dating the  inmate's sister.  </P> <P> The panel voted 3-0 to sustain the Nov. 23, 1988, dismissal of John R.  Anderson, an eight-year Sheriff's Department veteran. Anderson denied that he  supplied drugs to inmate Mike Fields in 1987 and insisted that he thought he  was being asked to bring Coca-Cola to the jail.  </P> <P> Although a sheriff's investigation cleared Anderson of cocaine smuggling,  hearing officer Richard C. Wulliger concluded that the deputy "could be as pure  as the driven snow with regard to drug smuggling and still be guilty of not  reporting a solicitation to bring drugs in." Wulliger also concluded that  Anderson failed to inform his superiors he was dating Fields' sister, whom he  married in July, 1987.  </P></p>

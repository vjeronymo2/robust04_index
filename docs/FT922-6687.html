			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: National Australia Bank net profits ahead at midterm NATIONAL Australia Bank, one of Australia's four major national trading banks, has reversed two years of falling earnings to achieve a 12.3 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 405.6m (USDollars 307.2m) for the six months ended March, 1992. The Melbourne-based group, which is holding its interim dividend at 22 cents a share, says doubtful debt charges fell from ADollars 455.7m to ADollars 412.6m. Mr Don Argus managing director, points to 'some tentative signs of economic recovery'. National's report was in marked contrast to Wednesday's half-year results from Westpac, Australia's biggest trading bank, which declared a ADollars 1.67bn loss following huge property portfolio write-offs. The major point of contrast was the performance of the two banks' finance offshoots. National's Custom Credit turned a ADollars 68.7m loss into a ADollars 6.4m profit, but Westpac's Australian Guarantee Corporation incurred a ADollars 719m loss, mainly as a result of property exposure. National's UK and Irish banking operations acted as the main brake on earnings with a contribution declining by almost 28 per cent to ADollars 120.1m. The operations include the Clydesdale, Northern Yorkshire and National Irish groups. National's Australian trading and savings banks incurred a modest 0.3 per cent earnings fall to ADollars 279.8m following a 3.1 per cent rise in bad loan charges to ADollars 212.1m. The UK and Irish banks bore the brunt of the bad loans with write-offs rising from ADollars 97.5m to ADollars 201.4m. The biggest contributor was Yorkshire Bank where charges jumped from ADollars 62.9m to ADollars 156.2m. The most tangible sign of pessimism in National's result was an increase in problem loan provisions from ADollars 3.86bn to ADollars 4.25bn on the widest definition. But Mr Argus did address the matter of property valuations in the wake of the Westpac shock. He said the continued decline in property values in Australia remained a major influence on the group's provisioning and write-offs. Mr Argus indicated that National's Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 7.9 per cent at March, against a reserve bank minimum requirement of 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mas'ud Khales commentary: "An Eye for an Eye"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The recent "kidnapping" is not  the first such act by the Zionist regime; it will possibly not  be the last. In view of the time at which this incident took  place, there are some important points that should be stated and  some lessons to be learned. [passage omitted]    The most optimistic assessment of the silence by the West  and  international forums on Israel's "state terrorism" is that this  silence stems from their confusion over the actions by the  Zionists ruling occupied Palestine; and if their silence does  not mean confirmation, they should prove this by their deeds.  It seems a new opportunity has emerged for all the governments  that are accused of terrorism to question the U.S. policy of  double standards on terrorism. Although propounding this topic  in international organizations will be confronted with America's  veto as usual, it will be an effort by the accused to put forth  a new interpretation of terrorism and its limits. [passage  omitted]    With this act, the Zionist regime showed that it has not  given up its efforts to advance its aggressive objectives under  any condition and that world public opinion and reaction is  worth nothing to it. If this is so, then those whose territory  is occupied by the enemy will be entitled to reserve the right  to set limitations aside to defend themselves and to oust the  enemy and to choose the time and the venue for their  confrontation with the enemy. According to Hizballah, no part  of Lebanon is safe for the Muslims. Under such circumstances,  rendering every area insecure for the Zionists and their mentors  within the framework of the policy of retaliation is a just act  that should not be protested. Any protest should be aimed at a  usurping government that supports terrorism and attaches no  value to public opinion.</p>

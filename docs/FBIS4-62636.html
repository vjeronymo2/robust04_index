			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] Moscow takes a positive view of Baghdad's  cooperation with the UN in the field of disarmament and hopes  that this trend will consolidate, Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russian  president's special Middle East envoy said at a briefing in  Moscow Tuesday.    He said that this kind of cooperation would make the lifting  of international sanctions against Iraq a real possibility. He  said that it was essential that Iraq made up its mind about  disarmament, allowed international observers in and recognized  Kuwait's independence and borders.    Posuvalyuk said that the Syrian-Israeli settlement was at  the  moment the decisive element of an overall Middle East solution.  He took note of the fact that the Syrian demand that Israel  leave the Syrian territory captured in 1967 was difficult to  reconcile with the Israeli demand that the border situation be  normalized and security provided first.    He said that this issue was under discussion both in direct  negotiations and through mediators and that hopeful signs were  visible.    Posuvalyuk also said that he would go to Damascus shortly  for  consultations with officials of Syria and other Middle East  nations involved in the peace process.    He said that 696 Russian nationals had been evacuated from  Yemen before May 15, notably 453 from the north and 249 from the  south. A total of about 400 Russian remained there, notably  those who stayed on business and Russian women who had taken  permanent residence there.    Posuvalyuk said that some of them did not bother to register  with Russian offices in the country.    He called on the leaders of the two parts of Yemen to stop  the fratricidal war. He went on to say that the calls had had  no effect but Russia continued a dialog with Yemeni officials.  He added that Russian diplomats were in continuous contact with  the Yemeni leaders.</p>

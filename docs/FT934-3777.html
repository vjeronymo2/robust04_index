			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (8): The scourge of sloppiness - Householders' heat costs are in their own hands A brief moment of importance comes out of the blue when the phone rings or a clipboard-clutching figure darts out of a shop doorway. Could you contribute your views on a vital issue? Of course, of course (looking earnest). Are energy costs important in choosing a home? Certainly. Would you pay more for an efficient home? Ermmm ... How efficient is your existing home? Have you improved the insulation? Well ..Panic sets in. You begin making up 'right' answers before rushing off with some lame excuse about a pressing appointment. Energy-saving is the most politically correct of issues but principles are often lost in a morass of muddled thinking and expediency. Ordinary homes could make an enormous contribution as they produce more CO than cars or factories and make up 30 per cent of the UK's fuel consumption. But the figures keep rising. Homes soak up 17 per cent more energy than in 1973, when the oil-price shock brought in fuel-saving. Even the recession has failed to stop this trend; consumption went up 3.75 per cent between 1988 and 1992, according to the Digest of UK Energy Statistics. This is partly due to the growth in central heating and household appliances but apathy is also a big factor. Most home buyers still put prices before running costs, and existing owners turn up the heat rather than insulate the attic. One argument for imposing VAT on domestic fuel next year - though there are serious doubts whether it will work - is that higher bills may change these priorities. Annual energy bills for an average three-bed semi will rise by Pounds 175 by 1995. Housebuilders make great play that new homes will become even more environmentally attractive. They average seven out of 10 on the National Energy Foundation efficiency scale compared with a miserable national average of four. Laing even managed a perfect 10 through extra measures such as low-energy light bulbs. The industry as a whole is not entirely convinced, however. Wimpey Homes is a third of the way through building the company's first low-energy estate. The 32 homes on the outskirts of Newcastle, are based on an idea developed with the Building Research Energy Conservation Support Unit (Brecsu) in the 1980s and boast scores of more than nine on the NEF scale. But building to this higher standard costs an extra Pounds 1 a sq ft, according to Euan Cresswell, Wimpey's regional director, averaging around Pounds 1,500 per home. Buyers will not pay this premium over traditional homes. 'These measures will cut heating bills by 40 per cent but people still appear to look at capital outlay rather than future revenue savings,' he says. Others are more optimistic. Admiral Homes says it has been overwhelmed by demand for a simple energy-saving package which involves saving Pounds 2,500 by doing without a chimney and spending the money on extra insulation. That required a leap of faith. 'We always thought an open fire was essential to sell a family home,' says David Holliday, the chief executive. Now he knows otherwise. Brecsu is also convinced that extra costs should be marginal. It points that housing associations, which lead the field in energy efficiency, figure on as little as a couple of hundred pounds extra per home. But many builders argue that this does not allow for extra overheads involved in one-off designs and special materials. Some sites also demand compromises in the siting and internal layout required for high energy scores. South-facing homes, for instance, consume vastly less energy but you cannot follow this rule when trying to cram in enough homes to make a highly priced site viable. Better energy efficiency will be led by improvements in building regulations rather than market demand, insists Mr Cresswell. Latest revisions have raised insulation standards by 20 per cent since 1990 and are due to step up again by a similar amount by 1995. Every new home will also require an energy rating, which should help raise awareness among buyers. The Newcastle scheme is a test-run for building to these specifications. But all this is a drop in the ocean of older property which consumes the vast bulk of domestic fuel, as new homes make up a mere 1 per cent of the country's stock. Owners have an easy solution to higher VAT bills at their fingertips, says Megan Flack of the NEF. Draught-proofing and better insulation would more than outweigh tax increases by cutting the running costs of an average home to Pounds 660. Taking into account the extra VAT burden, that produces a total saving of Pounds 400 a year. A typical Nottingham semi on the Foundation's files required work worth Pounds 2,300 to reduce annual energy costs from Pounds 1,248 to Pounds 756, so it would take five years merely to break even. But 1,500 of this went on a high-efficiency condensing boiler. There is plenty of scope for cheaper jobs which have a significant impact on bills; insulating the cavity walls for around Pounds 400, for instance, would pay for itself in two years. But owners, just like new home buyers, have to be persuaded that it is worth spending money today for savings and comfort tomorrow. Ms Flack believes the ratings on new homes will put everything on to a level playing field. Selling an old home will be difficult without an energy score because buyers will want to know where they stand. Therefore owners will have to fork out for insulation and an NEF inspection. One hole gapes through that argument. Only a minority of buyers currently bother with a structural inspection; if they are happy to risk the roof falling in, it seems logical they will put up with draughts. In fact, running costs hardly come into the equation. In spite of dutiful answers to pollsters, overall price and location remain the major influence on buyers and some of the most sought-after homes like country cottages would be lucky to get on to the NEF score sheet. For all its unpopularity, a tax on fuel appears a potent way of making inroads into the Pounds 14bn bill run up by UK housing. The chancellor is feeding back some of the tax income into higher benefits for pensioners and disabled people, who often live in the least efficient housing. An extra Pounds 100m will also go into grants under the home energy efficiency scheme over the next three years. But campaigners would prefer more widescale incentives towards insulation and super-efficient condensing boilers. In the harsh world of political reality, however, cutting the public spending deficit will take priority over raising housing standards to a level enjoyed in other parts of Europe for more than 50 years.</p>

Noting that labor relations at three strike-plagued Hyundai  Group Companies -- Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Precision and  Industries and Hyundai Heavy Industries -- in 1993 are being  examined by the Korea Labor Research Institute, Nam said the  government would see to it that they improved their labor  relations on the basis of the recommendations to be made by the  institute.    Companies in four booming sectors -- automobiles,  shipbuilding, steel and electronics -- will be encouraged to pay  special bonuses from their profits in shares, not in cash.    Easing of rules barring employees from selling shares  obtained in employee stock ownership plans for five years is  being discussed with the Finance Ministry, Nam said.    Under the proposed changes, the ban will be shortened so  that  employees in the four sectors may sell their shares after a year.    The four sectors will be induced to peg pay hikes at the  level set by wage guidelines to be agreed on between the  Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Korea  Employers' Federation (KEF) and to invest their profits in  research and development and expansion of welfare facilities for  employees.    The government will ensure that collective pay bargaining is  finished according to the FKTU-KEF guidelines by April or May in  all industrial sectors.    Nam recommended that Kim call a government-labor-management  meeting to celebrate and promote industrial peace after  collective bargaining is completed.    He said his Ministry would study when and how labor-related  laws should be amended after pay negotiations are settled in all  areas.    Illegal labor disputes, especially involvement of a third  party in a labor dispute, will be dealt with strictly by law,  Nam said.</p>

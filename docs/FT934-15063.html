			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (6): Finding a way into difficult markets - By relieving the supplier of the risk and taking the debt off the manufacturer's hands, this form of financing provides a solution to an exporting problem in heavily indebted countries / Forfaiting IT IS nothing new to exporters that some of the most heavily indebted developing countries of the 1980s are now begining to re-emerge as private sector-driven markets in the 1990s. Latin America is back as a market for capital goods. New markets are emerging in Asia and elsewhere with a hunger for equipment - and the financing needed to pay for it. The problem is how to exploit new opportunities when the financing capacity of banks and credit insurers is often low and few companies can afford to take big financial risks or tie up their cash flow. Forfaiting may offer a solution. The risk/cashflow problem was confronted directly by a UK-based manufacturer of aviation equipment which in the early 1990s secured an estimated Dollars 13m contract to provide capital goods to the Brazilian navy. For two years, the order was stalled due to lack of financing. The buyer was unable to provide the five-year credit terms required by the purchaser. The supplier, who did not want to be identified, found the solution in a specialist forfaiter who could provide credit for the buyer and ease the manufacturer's cashflow by taking the debt off its hands. Forfaiting gives the exporter 'non-recourse' financing, taking the risk off the supplier's hands by buying the exporter's debt at a discount. The exporter therefore receives cash up-front. The forfaiter often then sells-on all or part of this debt in the secondary market to spread the risk. Until recently the prospect of finding five-year commercial financing for Brazil - whose debt problems made it a semi-exotic market - would have been impossible. In an improving climate for Latin American risk, the London-based Indosuez Aval was able to do so in a specially structured deal. Indosuez and other leading players in the market - including London Forfaiting Company (LFC), the largest UK specialist forfaiter, and West Merchant Bank (WMB) - now offer three-year or five-year terms for Brazil, reflecting the return to financial credibility of South America's largest economy. An additional problem in the Brazilian deal was that manufacture of the goods would take more than two years, extending the risk period when five years was the maximum credit on offer. Over a year of negotiations a deal was structured in which the supplier arranged for immediate payment to be made. This kept the main risk to five years. In return the parent of the supplier and Indosuez Aval put up performance guarantee bonds, and to secure the deal Banco do Brasil came in to back a letter of credit. Concluding the deal was difficult and protracted with final approval required at the highest level in Brazil. But drawdown of the financing has taken place and manufacture has begun. Forfaiting, as a banker close to the deal puts it, 'provided a solution to an exporting problem'. The return to financial acceptability of previously heavily indebted non-OECD markets and the arrival of some newcomers is widening the market. 'I've never known a time when so many different risks have been acceptable to the market,' says Stephen Rothwell of LFC. The fortunes of the forfaiting market are linked to trade flows and country credit risk. Forfaiters report that demand for the product is strong in Italy, where according to Denis Keenlyside, a WMB director and forfaiting expert, 'exporters are more adventurous and are used to the product'. For the first time in years, forfaiters have cause for optimism about prospects for financing Latin America, much of Asia, eastern Europe and the Middle East. There are clear signs the market is recovering from the collapse in payments of its big clients, Iran and the ex-Soviet Union. Financing 'semi-exotic' risks such as Brazil and China is becoming widespread. Deals involving such 'exotic' risks as Vietnam, Peru and Romania are reported. Flexibility is important in deals. Forfaiting transactions may not only involve the pure forfait deals on which the market developed, but also a range of secondary market and other financing techniques. Forfaiters' profits are made on the margins of discount, which in difficult (or exotic) markets such as Peru can be high, but in such areas other forms of trade finance may be impossible to secure. 'No-one pretends this sort of finance is cheap,' says Mr Rothwell. As margins become tight forfaiters can be less keen to do deals. Once a risk is seen as acceptable margins may remain high for some time. Forfaiters were attracted to the Iranian market, which boomed in 1990-91, because it was seen as a good risk and offered margins of 7 to 8 per cent. As memories of the debt crisis in Latin America recede, investment banks are again making headlines with bond issues, parastatal corporations are being privatised and export credit agencies are prepared to back large-scale contracts 'in the national interest'. But 'in many cases forfaiters were there first, providing commercial financing before other bankers would move in', says Mark West of LFC. Forfaiters are helping open up new capital goods markets. A case in point is sales out of non-OECD emerging markets. LFC has financed deals as diverse as the sale of Russian cars to Cyprus to Slovenian buses to Egypt. China is emerging as a big forfaiting market. Forfaiting techniques have caught on for Chinese operations, especially in Italy, which is making a concerted push into the Chinese market. Companies with traditional links with the Chinese market are also investigating the technique. For example, a joint venture with Hong Kong partners has forfaited a deal for the Dollars 18m contract for installing a plant to make paper pulp from wheat straw in Feicheng city, Shandong province. They forfaited the deal through WMB, which was able to sell down the deal backed by the guarantee (or 'aval') of Agricultural Bank of China. Limits on how much risk will be taken on in 'difficult markets' depend on the nature of the risk and the local bank providing its aval for the deal. WMB will cover up to three years risk for Vietnam, but only for smaller deals. 'We wouldn't do Dollars 10m on Vietnam but we would on Mexico or Brazil,' Mr Keenlyside says. As the Vietnamese market matures, this view can be expected to change. Levels of business are growing. LFC reports trading income rising by 43 per cent to Pounds 15.5m in the six months to 30 June 1993 due to increased activity. WMB reports an annual volume of forfaiting business in excess of Dollars 1bn. Mr Keenlyside says that in 1992 it arranged some 300 purchase transactions in 33 countries. And newcomers are emerging far beyond the forfaiting markets centres of London, Zurich and Frankfurt, even though these remain the world's forfaiting centres. For active markets such as Italy, forfaiters may market their products through local subsidiaries while the deals themselves are more likely to be structured in London than Milan. But new players are slowly emerging away from the forfaiting market's traditional centres. Tunisia's largest commercial bank, Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB), has, according to its chairman Abdellatif Jerijeni, 'started offering forfaiting services to our clients, many of whom are looking to export more'. STB decided to establish forfaiting operations to mark its position as a bank offering the services needed in an exporting economy,' he says. Forfaiting is evolving and its advocates believe the technique has a role to play everywhere that exporting is developing as a way of life.

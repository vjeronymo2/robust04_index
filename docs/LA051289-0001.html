			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A judge in Oakland sentenced a man to 54 years to life for his part in an  assault rifle attack on a security guard hired to drive drug dealers from the  city's crime-ridden Acorn Housing Project. Shawn Garth, 23, of Oakland, was  convicted of two attacks in October, 1988, that killed one security guard,  wounded two others and wounded an 18-month-old girl in the leg. Garth is  believed to be one of four men who sprayed the housing project's security shack  with gunfire after the guards broke up an illegal dice ring. Two weeks later,  Garth sprayed another Oakland house with gunshots, wounding the baby. "These  crimes were vicious and were committed without regard to human life, including  the life of an 18-month-old child," said Alameda County Superior Court Judge  Sandra Margulies.  </P></p>

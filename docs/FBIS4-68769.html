			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Janis Adamsons by Ieva Stale: "Border Guards </F> Have New Commander"]    [Text] On Thursday, Defense Minister V. Pavlovskis signed  an order appointing Command Captain Janis Adamsons, the present  Deputy Commander of the Naval Forces to the position of Border  Guards Brigade Commander. Thus, control of the land borders will  be overseen by a Navy man. In this connection, "Labrit" is  offering a brief short-order interview with the new Border  Guards Brigade Commander.    [Stale] Did you agree to this position willingly?    [Adamsons] I am an officer, and in the Army it is assumed  that the orders of a higher ranking officer are to be followed,  regardless of whether they concern changing over to another post  or retirement. I was satisfied with my present post and also  with the work I had contributed in forming the Naval Forces. The  actual offer to become the Border Guards Brigade Commander was  unexpected, although I am a professional coast guard.    [Stale] How did you become a coast guard by profession?    [Adamsons] I studied at the Russian Naval War School. For 13  years, I served in the Far East in various leadership positions  as a coast guard. I was last stationed in Russia at the Coast  Guard Training Center in Nahodka, where I served as deputy head  of the training center.    [Stale] In your opinion, what is the weakest point in the  present overland border protection plan?    [Adamsons] I will be able to answer this question one month  from now, after I have familiarized myself with all overland  border problems. I guarantee that the information will be  available to the press.    [Stale] What are the main activity objectives of the new  Border Guards Brigade Commander?    [Adamsons] To strengthen overland border control, protection  and defense, involving the participation of those people who are  serving in the Border Guard at present. The main objective is to  organize regular cooperation among the state institutions  involved with border control -- the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, National Guard, Customs. Until now, while serving in  the Naval Forces, there was good cooperation among these  institutions. I hope the situation continues.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS NEAR NOW-SILENT SIRENS DON'T MISS AIR RAID ALARMS OF OLD  </P> <P> The Canoga Park Community Center museum has a relic that it doesn't want.  </P> <P> It's a 1950s-style air raid siren -- a memento of the days when San Fernando  Valley residents received regular Cold War reminders that Soviet bombers or  intercontinental ballistic missiles could be on their way at any time.  </P> <P> The siren is perched atop a rickety wooden tower above the Owensmouth Avenue  building. It is strategically placed so that its mournful wail can alert a  nearby neighborhood as well as the Canoga Park business district.  </P> <P> But the cone-shaped siren doesn't work. And neither do the 400 other air raid  warning devices scattered around Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The emergency warning network was unplugged in 1985 after officials discovered  that more than 30% of the sirens were broken and would be useless if a nuclear  attack was imminent.  </P> <P> Most of the Valley's sirens remain in place, however. Los Angeles city  officials say it would be too costly to remove the estimated 75 sirens that are  spaced at about one-mile intervals between North Hollywood and Chatsworth.  Citywide, there are about 200.  </P> <P> "The decision was made to leave them where they are," said Karen Patterson, the  city's disaster preparedness coordinator. "It was determined it would be very  expensive to take them down. They weren't hurting anybody. So they just left  them up."  </P> <P> For about 40 years, air raid sirens were a prominent fixture in the lives of  virtually every Valley resident.  </P> <P> The sirens were tested in unison at 10 a.m. on the last Friday of every month.  In the 1950s and early '60s, neighborhoods were clustered in pockets across the  Valley -- each within earshot of sirens typically placed atop tall fire  stations or attached to 30-foot steel poles.  </P> <P> At the end of each month's test, residents could hear the distant echoes of  sirens miles away shutting down long after their own community's alarm had  quit.  </P> <P> By the 1970s, however, the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles had grown to  where residents of some new neighborhoods couldn't hear the sirens. A 1983  study indicated that even if all the sirens worked, only 42% of the county's  residents were within hearing range.  </P> <P> When the county Board of Supervisors ordered an end to the monthly tests in  early 1985, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn explained that the sirens were giving  citizens "a false sense of security. . . . There's no defense against nuclear  missiles with a warning time of as little as eight minutes" when launched from  submarines.  </P> <P> The end-of-the-siren-testing order was music to the ears of some.  </P> <P> "It was a good idea to stop using them. I was very happy," said Elan Dorriz,  who for 15 years has operated his Tarzana hair salon next to a siren that is  mounted on a pole above a Clark Street sidewalk.  </P> <P> "It was a very ugly sound. It was very scary. Everybody would jump out of their  skin when the siren came on."  </P> <P> Reseda repair shop owner Gary Gulessorian said his customers were often jolted  by the piercing shrill of the siren that still towers above his Sherman Way  garage and office.  </P> <P> On one occasion, Gulessorian recalled, a friend who had just come from Lebanon  where air attacks were common hit the floor when the siren went off.  </P> <P> "He said, 'What is that?' I kidded him, and I told him the Japanese were  attacking. He said, 'What should we do?' "  </P> <P> Studio City resident Margie Johnson remembers the siren that still stands a few  hundred yards from her home of 42 years as being loud enough to awaken her from  her soundest sleep -- although it never went off at night.  </P> <P> When the siren was bolted to the top of a 15-foot tower on the roof of a city  fire station near Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in the early  1950s, residents were warned of the monthly tests so they wouldn't panic, she  said.  </P> <P> Newcomers to the Valley -- those who weren't around when the monthly tests took  place -- were surprised to learn that the sirens have been disconnected.  </P> <P> "I never heard it go off, but then I can't remember us having an air raid since  we moved here a year and a half ago," said Woodland Hills resident Marc  Sardella, who has a view of a Canoga Avenue siren from his front door.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Count on It'  </P> <P> "I'd always figured that if we were in a war situation, I'd be able to count on  it," he said.  </P> <P> Neighbor Gloria Andreae was equally shocked. "I've looked at it as a protection  the 3 1/2 years I've lived here. They don't work? Great. They're no good if  they're disconnected."  </P> <P> Chatsworth resident Jo Ann Suzukawa said she has all but forgotten about the  Corbin Avenue siren behind her house. She said that when she first moved into  her Tuba Street home 10 years ago, visiting friends would ask what the  hat-shaped object was.  </P> <P> "I don't even notice it now. A tree in the back yard pretty much hides it," she  said.  </P> <P> Trees also partially screen a siren from nearby homes on Parthenia Street in  Winnetka. In Encino, a 30-foot-tall siren is hidden among high-rise office  buildings that have sprung up in recent years at Gloria Avenue and Ventura  Boulevard.  </P></p>

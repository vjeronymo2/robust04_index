			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena -- Salvadoran President Armando Calderon  Sol on 14 June in Cartagena urged his colleagues meeting in the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government to  form a common front to defend the legitimate right to  development of the region's peoples.    He said that strengthening representative democracy,  promoting human rights, and achieving economic and social  development should be the great goals of the 21 Ibero-American  leaders.    President Calderon, who is attending for the first time the  meeting of Ibero-American leaders, a group that has already met  on three occasions, added that now that nearly all peoples of  the region are enjoying democracy, it is crucial that we direct  our efforts toward improving the living conditions of our  people. He called for an expanded discussion among the  presidents on the integration issue, not just on trade  liberalization. Calderon pointed out that our Central American  countries are making enormous efforts toward integration.</p>

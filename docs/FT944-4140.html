			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Institutions contribute to MPE fund-raising Montagu Private Equity has raised Pounds 170m from four UK and continental European institutions and Pounds 250m from HSBC Group, its parent, for investment in unquoted companies. Montagu intends to raise Pounds 500m in what it is calling a Private Equity Partnership Scheme. HSBC is committed to invest at least as much as each co-investor in every deal. This is the first time that Montagu Private Equity (MPE) has raised this amount of capital from institutions other than its parent and signals HSBC's intention to increase its presence in private equity investment. The move confirms MPE as one of the UK's three largest providers of private equity capital. The new funds will add to the weight of new money raised by UK venture capital and management buy-out financiers recently. The British Venture Capital Association says that in the eight months to August, UK fund managers have raised over Pounds 2bn - more than three times as much as in the whole of 1993. MPE's investors committed the funds for five years, but Mr Ian Forrest, its managing director, said he hoped to develop a long-term investment partnership with this small number of investors. Mr Forrest said these institutions had not been significant investors in private equity before. MPE has invested about Pounds 100m a year recently and intends to continue to invest at a similar rate. 'We are saying we have a lot of money for this class of asset and the ability to be a long term partner (with businesses),' Mr Forrest said. 'HSBC is saying this is a core businesses for investment banking.' The fund raising not only increased MPE's management fees, but also provided the firepower to underwrite the total equity requirement of any transaction.</p>

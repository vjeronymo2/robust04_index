			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement </F> for a Democratic Slovakia and former Slovak prime minister, by  unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The Path  I Followed Was the Right One"]    [Text] Not even after having been removed from his position  as prime minister for the second time does Vladimir Meciar feel  defeated. For he has no doubt whatsoever that, after the early  parliamentary elections in the fall, he will come back  victorious at the head of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] to reclaim his position as prime minister. Much has been  written about this 52-year-old politician during the past  several weeks. But let us hear from Vladimir Meciar himself,  without whom, whether we like it or not, Slovak internal  political developments in the immediate future cannot be  imagined.    [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Mr. Chairman, how do you evaluate the  current political developments in Slovakia? Can the unanimous  vote to hold early elections be considered something that will  calm the situation here?    [Meciar] New elections will not resolve a single substantive  problem facing Slovakia. At most, they will succeed in changing  the representatives who are to solve those problems. The  elections mean postponing the threat of a possible confrontation  within society. It will take the present governing coalition a  long time to recover from the way we maneuvered it into voting  to shorten the electoral term. Before the vote, it was agreed  that Weiss's SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] will not join  the government if the new date for elections is not approved.  But it broke this agreement nevertheless, as it did many others  before, and the government was formed. At the same time, the  present governing coalition did not want new elections. It voted  in favor of the elections because it was convinced that we did  not want them and that the law therefore would certainly not  pass.    From the viewpoint of the internal political situation in  Slovakia, the present situation is very bad. The continuity of  all of the processes that were successfully under way was  interrupted. Moravcik's government will be doing nothing for at  least a month but searching for a new program or looking for  mistakes of the old government for the sole purpose of giving  the appearance of being better. The former, or, if you will, my  government, was a minority government, but it came out of the  democratic elections a winner. The present government is again a  minority government.    Represented in it are both the SDL and the KDH [Christian  Democratic Movement], as well as two steering committees of  parties that are still in the process of being formed. Also  represented in it is Knazko's Alliance of Democrats, which no  one elected to the parliament. The coalition is a minority that  is dependent on the support of Hungarian political parties. The  same as in Jan Carnogursky's government, the Hungarian political  parties presented their bill to this government, which it will  have to pay willy-nilly.    Nor were relationships within the parliament resolved. The  disintegration that followed the democratic elections,  particularly in our movement because of our mistakes as well as  external pressures, be it from the president or the then  opposition parties, resulted in there now being 24 deputies in  the parliament who were originally elected as representatives of  different parties. They are now "programless" and Prime Minister  Jozef Moravcik is "unattached"; he has no political party behind  him. The makeup of his character allows, of course, for  obedience in the relationship between the president and the  prime minister....    An interesting situation developed in connection with the  fact that, in a manner unheard of in the history of democratic  countries, the president, who does not have the right to control  the activities of the government, utters criticism of the prime  minister although he knew that the entire government will fall,  and makes his own function in the government hang in the balance  because the prime minister has different views on some matters.  This is a case without precedence in the world. Many problems  are related precisely to Slovakia's efforts to halt the overall  pace of economic decline. But this situation will last for some  time and its impact will be deeper. The desire for power with  which a few people in party leaderships, even those who are not  in the government today, became intoxicated was greater than the  feeling of responsibility toward the citizens for the  consequences. That is bad. Slovakia is also undergoing a crisis  of personalities, a crisis of political entities, and these  political entities have a negative impact on the country.    [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] While you were prime minister you were  often criticized for centralizing power and for your  controversial character. What do you think of such criticism,  criticism that comes not only from the president.    [Meciar] To talk about centralization of power is to show a  great lack of understanding of how, in fact, the power spheres  of a state work. The HZDS never had a majority in the parliament  and was always dependent on the support of somebody else. So  what is this about centralizing power in the parliament? A  minority that centralizes the majority?! That is indeed  ingenious nonsense. Who then wants to talk about concentration  of power? And that I became prime minister on the basis of  democratic elections. That is, after all, normal.    I have never once lowered myself to using administrative  instruments or power to conduct public policy. Today even many  of my friends blame me for being too democratic, for having too  liberal an attitude toward everybody. But even so, I think that  the path I followed was the right one and that power is used  only by those who do not know how to govern any other way.  Moreover, the talk about centralization of power was heard  mostly at the time I held the post of minister of privatization.  I did not privatize anything for myself, my family, or  relatives. I placed those who thought they had priority rights  to everything in line according to importance, the same as  everybody else. The slogan "Stand in line and wait to see if you  are better" was felt as a threat by many. That is why they began  spouting nonsense.    We all have a certain character makeup, and political  personalities in particular cannot be such that they suit  everybody. In all of us there is something good, something bad.  Show me a person who is ideal.... It simply cannot be a flesh  and blood human being. But I am glad that it is mostly my  character traits that are being criticized because that means  that no faults are being found with my work.    After everything I experienced during the four years of my  political life, and obviously will yet experience during these  six months, I think that each of us writes his references  through his own work. Whether people want a certain politician  must be decided precisely through elections, not by the person  who sits next to me and thinks I should play second fiddle or by  someone who holds another position and thinks his function is  more important, maybe in just one power structure, and someone  else would suit him better. If you do not have a majority in the  parliament, the president is in opposition to you, the courts  are independent, and so try to talk about concentration of  power. Lord, forgive those who do not know what it is!    [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Constant attacks on President Michal  Kovac are incensing the crowds. People have a feeling of  uneasiness, which will probably end only after the new  elections. Are such attacks on the president necessary, and will  they be part of your election campaign?    [Meciar] There is a good passage in the Bible that says woe  to those with whom scandal originates. I do not think at all  that the president is being attacked. Rather, I believe that  Michal Kovac's actions are engendering a justified anger among  the citizens. The point is that the president does not have the  right to step beyond the constitutional sphere of activities and  powers the Constitution accords him. When he goes beyond the  scope of his powers, the citizen has not only the right but also  a duty to protest.    The president simply cannot ignore the political will of the  citizens, the president cannot intrude into political parties  and try to break them up, the president cannot engage in  intrigues--whether openly or covertly--against a government that  was formed on the basis of democratic elections. But, if he does  that and thinks he is justified in staying in office, he is very  much mistaken. The only decent solution is for him to resign in  the interest of the stability and purity of national life.    I do not believe we need to stoop so low as to mount some  kind of attack on Mr. Kovac, who, by the way, used to be my  deputy in the HZDS. After all, he will take care of everything  himself.... Everyone is the architect of his own good fortune or  misfortune. I, too, proposed him for president of the Republic.  Today, I must admit, I should not have done it.    [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Eighteen people have already left the  HZDS deputies' club. According to our information, there are  still a number of people in the movement who have social  democratic tendencies or lean toward other parties of the  center. Do you suppose that in the preelection period a further  splintering will take place within the HZDS?    [Meciar] The HZDS meets Slovakia's needs by its stable,  strong, centrist position. Therefore, no turn to the right, no  turn to the left, but straight ahead! That is why the HZDS also  had mass support among the voters. This movement could not be  broken up from the outside--only from the inside. Pressure  could be applied from the outside, but, without allies on the  "inside," the objective would not have been achieved. The first  signal for departure was Knazko's signal, with whom seven people  left. He failed as a politician, he failed as a government  official. Naturally, he blames his failures on somebody else.    The departure of another group from the HZDS was connected  with Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik. True, their work came under  extremely critical scrutiny in my government. They felt  themselves personally threatened, and they reacted by trying to  break up the club, taking with them eight persons. They created  the so-called alternative, but, basically, even before they  created it, they talked with the opposition about forming a new  government.</p>

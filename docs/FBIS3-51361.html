According to the diplomat,  the Onusal mandate will continue past the March elections.    [Begin Ramirez Ocampo recording] Onusal's obligation is to  verify the peace agreements, and therefore Onusal's duration is  determined by compliance with the agreements. [end recording]    Ramirez Ocampo said the concern some political sectors have  over the limited number of party representatives on department  boards has been resolved by a bill that the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal presented Monday to the Legislative Assembly.    According to the Onusal spokesman, the bill states that all  the parties, including the coalitions, can have a party  representative in both the department and the municipal boards.    [Begin Ramirez Ocampo recording] It is obvious that no party  can be deprived of representation, but it is also obvious, I  believe, that there cannot be more than one representative.  This means that it is important that all contending political  parties are represented equally at the electoral department  boards. [end recording]    As Ocampo sees it, it must be guaranteed that the electoral  department and municipal boards function legally.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Ankara (CUMHURIYET BUREAU)--While the DYP [True Path  Party] looks coolly on the request to "implement Article 119 of  the Constitution" presented to President Suleyman Demirel by  businessmen Sakip Sabanci and Vehbi Koc, DSP [Democratic Left  Party] General Chairman Bulent Ecevit announced that he is  definitely opposed to such a move. Former Finance Minister and  DYP Deputy General Chairman Sumer Oral said that the situation  is not such as to require application of Article 119.    Sumer Oral pointed out that the president replied to the two  businessmen that "there is no need for such a move." He said, "I  do not see any need to invoke Article 19 of the Constitution  under the present circumstances."    Businessmen Sabanci and Koc presented a proposal to  President  Demirel that he exercise his constitutional authority to "chair  the Council of Ministers in serious economic crises" on the  rationale that Turkey is experiencing "a serious economic  crisis." Demirel, however, noted that there is a coalition  government in office and replied, "There is no need for this at  present."    The two businessmen's proposal to Demirel angered Finance  Minister Ismet Attila. He pointed out that the president "does  not act at just anyone's behest" and stressed that there is no  question of any "economic straits" such as to invoke Article 119  of the Constitution by reason of "economic crisis." He said:  "The situation the country is experiencing must not be  exaggerated. At any rate, it is not grave enough to invoke  certain consitutional provisions. There is a government, and it  has taken all necessary measures. Moreover, the place for  discussion and reaching consensus on topics like this is the  government, not business. This is a separate matter, of course.  Moreover, even if there were such a situation, the president  cannot act on his own. These things do not take place just by  someone's saying so. We took the necessary measures, all that  need to be taken, during the first three months."    Attila suggested that there are those who are trying to gain  an advantage from this by creating an atmosphere of panic and  said, "Those who have no love for the country or its people are  the ones doing this; our political rivals are doing this. They  are saying, `It will affect foreign exchange rates,' they are  saying, `Withdraw our money.' But I repeat, all necessary  measures have been taken. There is definitely no need for such  an emergency or anything similar."    DSP General Chairman Bulent Ecevit called a news conference  yesterday at which he said the following: ``I am definitely  opposed. I would hope that the report is not serious. I told the  distinguished prime minister: What ought to be done is to  convene the `economic and social council' that is a part of the  government program but has not been implemented to date.    ``With this council, on which workers, farmers, employers,  and the government would be represented, an approach must be  followed based on voluntary solidarity on overcoming the  problem.''    Article 119 of the Constitution authorizes the president to  proclaim martial law for six months "in periods of great crisis"  in the country. Article 119 reads: "In conditions of natural  disaster, dangerous infectious diseases, or serious economic  crisis, the Council of Ministers meeting under the chairmanship  of the president may proclaim a state of emergency, not to  exceed a period of six months, in one or more areas of the  country or nationwide."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi expressed his complete  satisfaction with the talks which he held yesterday evening in  Paris with his French counterpart Edouard Balladur. Sifi said  that France's view of Algeria takes into account the closeness  of existing Algerian-French and Algerian-European cooperation  and the situation in the Euro-Maghreban region. He explained  that cooperation, whether between Algeria and France or Algeria  and Europe, serves the interest of both sides.    In the economic field, Mokdad Sifi indicated that the  results  of his visits to France could be embodied in comprehensive  cooperation. In this regard, he said that the renewal of French  loans to Algeria, which amount to about six billion francs will  serve the interest of Algeria just as it will serve the interest  of French investors.    On the other hand, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, who was  received immediately after his arrival in France by President  Francois Mitterrand, announced that the latter had stressed  continuing French and European support [for Algeria] in the  political and economic fields.    Regarding his talks in Brussels, Mokdad Sifi told the press  before leaving Brussels for Paris that he has sensed the desire  among the European partners to bolster cooperation with Algeria  and provide their contribution so that Algeria can get out of  the crisis as soon as possible.    What can be deduced from this first foreign visit of Mokdad  Sifi in his capacity as prime minister is that Europe has  confirmed its readiness to release the loan of 200 million ECUs.  In principle this will take place next September or before the  end of December.    The satisfactory results also include the need to set up a  mechanism for swift negotiations with the aim of concluding a  new partnership agreement to take the place of the 1976  agreement. This will be an agreement aimed at establishing a  free trade area similar to what is currently under negotiation  with Morocco and Tunisia.</p>

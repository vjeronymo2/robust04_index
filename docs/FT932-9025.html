			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: Wanted: homes for sale: The market is picking up, says Gerald Cadogan, but agents are short of quality properties SPRING BEGAN early this year in the UK housing market as buyers decided that prices had bottomed out. Now the problem is that agents do not have enough good houses to sell. Vendors may expect houses of quality to achieve (or come very close to) realistic guide prices, and sometimes may exceed them. But 'realistic' may still mean 30 per cent in nominal terms below the heights of 1988-89. The hard times that let a buyer lop Pounds 50,000 off an asking price are vanishing fast, and the imbalance of demand and supply looks set to lead to a rise in prices. But how great that rise will be, and when it will reach different parts of the country, is debatable. In truth, the frosts that have nipped the green shoots of economic spring in the chancellor's garden for the past 18 months may still return. In this flux, the individual property matters far more than market trends. Shute House near Shaftesbury, in Dorset, with a magical garden designed by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, was on the market for just five weeks when it went for virtually the asking price of Pounds 1.25m after other, lesser, offers. The cuts in interest rates have made mortgage payments cheaper than rent - notably for first-time buyers, whom the building societies woo with special terms and who are most likely to benefit from the abolition of stamp duty on purchases below Pounds 60,000. Nationwide gives an average first-time price of Pounds 39,645 for the first quarter of 1993, and Halifax one of Pounds 44,289. This discrepancy may reflect differences of clientele seeking mortgages, from whom they draw the data for their indices. Both building societies note that first-time prices are significantly - 6.5 and 7.8 per cent - down on the same quarter in 1992. This new climate affects directly only younger Weekend FT readers, but it is relevant for all as first-time buying starts a chain reaction, pushing vendors a rung or two up the ladder. A recent survey by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors has noticed is starting to happen again. In all sectors, many have grown tired of living in rented flats and now, with mortgages cheaper than rent and incomes up, are eager for a property of their own. Nationwide computes a house price-earnings ratio of 2.85 for the first quarter of 1993, its lowest level since 1960, and estimates that taking into account prices, earnings, interest rates and mortgage interest tax relief, houses are now more affordable than they have been since 1966. At the top end, lower asking prices and the fall of the pound have brought foreign buyers to London, giving some lucky Londoners the wherewithal to buy good houses for bringing up the family in the country. Higher share prices are another plus. Perhaps the market would have turned last autumn, if Black Wednesday had not struck just when the new buying season was getting under way and clobbered everything from stately homes to new homes. Perhaps the mild winter gave buyers itchy feet. Whatever the reasons, there has been a change. From January to March, Savills' Guildford office sold twice as many houses as in all 1992, Tommy de Mallet Morgan reports. At Easter there was a pause, but now he detects a new wave forming as vendors decide to sell and make their long-discussed, long-deferred moves. Two preliminary valuations a day is a sign of the activity waiting to unfold. 'Just as Surrey led the way into the recession, so it is leading the way out,' he says. More activity can quickly translate into higher prices, and Morgan foresees a time not so far off when vendors may be tempted to ask for a heady 5 per cent more than the realistic price. In the present market, good houses sell. But if there are drawbacks (which are more obvious now that the Property Misdescriptions Act is in force), or if the house is overpriced, confidence is not yet so strong that any house at all will be bought, as happened in the late 1980s. Patrick Ramsay, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, is cautious. For him the demand has a slightly false bulge, as the eager but frustrated buyers include flat-renters and overseas buyers, neither of whom have property to sell. And spring last year and in 1991 turned out to be a false dawn. But the stock of houses for sale is now low as the supply has shrunk steadily over the last three years. Most of those that were on the market a long time are now sold, at much reduced levels. Some 'old chestnuts,' as Ian McConnel, of Savills in Banbury, Oxfordshire, puts it, are still stuck. They were too high three years ago and, even if they have followed the market down from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 220,000, they are still too high, and buyers avoid them just because they have been around so long. So it is a two-tier market. In houses new on the market we may see prices rise this summer, as country houses follow London's lead. But any rise, Ramsay thinks, will level off in the autumn and winter as supply and demand come into balance. It is a matter of when the vendors have enough confidence to sell. The shortage of top-class country houses shows many hanging on in the hope of a better price and aiming to ride out such woes as Lloyd's and compulsory early retirement. Some time over the next two years there should be plenty of houses to sell, perhaps even from this autumn. If the market does rise 10-15 per cent, supply and demand will sort themselves out. But prices will still be well below those of 1988-89. Next summer may be a good time to sell, in the third year of the current parliament. But who knows what new banana skins will be around by then? After all, it may be safer to sell now since a vendor can be certain that buyers will come to view, especially if the house receives national advertising. The handsome 1720s Much Hadham Hall, in Hertfordshire, rated Grade I and probably the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor, came on the market two months ago. Agents Mullucks Wells &amp; Associates had inquiries from Dubai, New York and Stockholm, and a dozen serious viewers, four of whom made offers. Contracts are expected to exchange shortly at a price close to the Pounds 950,000 guide price. The Georgian Old Rectory at Thornby, in Northamptonshire, shows the ups and downs of the market. In 1983 it went for Pounds 130,000. Restored and with more land, it came on to the market again at over Pounds 500,000 in 1988 and  -at the market's peak - went for over Pounds 550,000. This winter it was sold again, dropping to more than the Pounds 450,000 guide price - sold to an overseas company for whom it cost even less in foreign currency. Realistic guide prices for good properties make sense, while competitive bidding and premium prices remain rare and usually a reaction stemming from frustration. If anything is wrong or the price too high, buyers still walk away. How long they will remember the bruises of the past few years is uncertain. If the experience of the price collapse in the mid-1970s is a guide, memories are short and fear soon gives way to greed. Yolande Barnes, of Savills Residential Research, expects marked price increases between June 1993 and June 1994 - later in some areas - as vendors comprehend buyers' pent-up desire to move and settle. At the end we may see prices back to where they were five years ago in nominal terms, accompanied, perhaps, by inflation - and higher interest rates. In the meantime, if you are buying a house, do not overlook the old-fashioned repayment mortgage which reduces the sum outstanding month by month (although slowly at the beginning), rather than an endowment mortgage with its lure of a lump sum at the end. The life insurance companies have been cutting the returns on endowment policies. Conversely, anybody who has paid the old way for the last five years has probably cleared off any negative equity. Keep in mind, as well, that agents are still cautious about prices, having spent the last few years teaching vendors to think small. And there is a danger that in their desire to obtain houses to sell, they may overvalue them. It is a tricky market, and hard to foresee that it will ever return to a frantic boom. What is certain is that any good house put up for sale now will sell quickly.</p>

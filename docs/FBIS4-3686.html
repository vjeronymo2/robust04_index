			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng and Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov of Kyrgyzstan held  talks here this afternoon on expanding bilateral trade and  economic cooperation.    The meeting, covering a wide range of issues, proceeded in a  practical and in-depth manner, according to a Chinese spokesman.    Dzhumagulov said that Kyrgyzstan, which is carrying out  economic reform, attaches great importance to strengthening  economic ties with China and to learning from its experience,  especially in rural reform.    He said that over 70 Sino-Kyrgyz joint ventures in food  processing, leather making and other areas are operating  smoothly. He added that the two sides are considering  cooperation in public health, paper-making and other fields.    Dzhumagulov hoped that the two countries will explore the  vast potential existing for cooperation in energy, mining,  agriculture, communications and transportation.    He added that cooperation in these fields would not only be  beneficial to the two countries, but would also have a positive  impact on the economic prosperity of the region.    Premier Li Peng said that the difficulties facing Kyrgyzstan  are "only temporary, and through effort, will undoubtedly be  overcome."    Referring to the rapid growth of bilateral trade, Li said  "potentials still exist" and that the Chinese Government, and  the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in particular, would strive to  promote trade and economic cooperation with Kyrgyzstan. He said  that "there has been already a good beginning."    Li also said both sides need to create better conditions and  strive to resolve problems hampering the development of trade  and economic cooperation.    Experts in the two countries should make in-depth studies of  the large projects proposed by Prime Minister Dzhumagulov on  cooperation in mining and hydro-power generation, Li said.    The Chinese Government encourages Chinese enterprises to  participate in the economic construction of Kyrgyzstan on the  basis of equality and mutual benefit, he said.    During the talks, Li invited Dzhumagulov to visit China when  it is convenient for him, and the Kyrgyz premier accepted the  invitation with pleasure.</p>

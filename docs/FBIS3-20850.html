The budget totals about 5.2 billion German  marks [DM], DM1.5 billion more than in 1993. According to Prime  Minister Nikica Valentic, this is a "firm budget that must not  be expanded, not even by a dinar." To exceed the set parameters  could endanger the stabilization efforts.    Firm budget limitations have been set to reign in very high  public expenditures. Of the total DM5.2 billion, DM1.8 billion  is devoted to pension payments, DM1.3 billion to health  insurance, DM1 billion to local government expenditures. The  total public expenditures amount to more than DM9 billion, or 50  percent of the GNP, estimated to be DM18 billion, including the  "grey economy" and money transfers from abroad. According to  Valentic, there is reason for alarm when total public  expenditures surpass 50 percent of the country's GNP, even for a  country at war. This is why expenditures and the budget must not  be increased despite a series of justifiable requests. Saying  that without increased production there is no chance of covering  public spending, Valentic added that the government had taken  certain steps in this direction in the areas of construction,  shipbuilding, agriculture, tourism, and industry.

The tax reform continues with  the introduction of the excise tax on six new products (coffee  had already been taxed earlier). The next step is the  introduction of the value-added tax.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today  Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio reiterated his  confidence that legislative elections scheduled for 14 August  will be held accordingly. De Leon told the media that the  temporary suspension of the elections by a Supreme Court of  Justice resolution is "temporary," and that the Constitutional  Court will be the one to resolve the case definitively once it  is submitted.    De Leon did not make any comments on whether or not the  Supreme Court of Justice decision to protect Solidarity Action  Movement deputy Carlos Humberto Arroyave was a political one. "I  respect the autonomy of government branches," De Leon replied.    De Leon added that from an electoral viewpoint, the amparo  Arroyave filed charging that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  violated his rights by convening legislative elections on 14  August has political overtones since he is a congressional  deputy. De Leon indicated that those actions are allowed within  a system of legality and a de jure regime and that the Court  resolution shows that legal and democratic systems are at work  in Guatemala. De Leon expressed his confidence in the integrity  of Court magistrates, who convened elections based on legal  considerations and in accordance with constitutional reforms.    Political leaders, including retired General Efrain Rios  Montt, former head of the de facto government, and Francisco  Reyes, both of whom are members of the Guatemalan Republican  Front, maintain that the Court resolution was political because  the magistrates do not want to leave their posts either.    Following the election of a new legislative assembly, new  Court magistrates will be appointed.</p>

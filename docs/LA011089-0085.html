			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> BABY FOUND SAFE IN DITCH  </P> <P> A 10-month-old girl, believed to have spent two cold nights in a drainage ditch  after her mother was struck by a hit-and-run driver's car while trying to cross  Interstate 5 on foot with a group of illegal aliens, was in good condition at  Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista. The baby, apparently suffering from  mild hypothermia, was returned to Onecima Lopez, 30, who was in the hospital  with both legs broken. Lopez told police that another of the group was carrying  her baby and that she assumed someone would take the child to Los Angeles,  where her husband had applied to become a legal U.S. resident. The baby,  however, was found in the drainage ditch by other migrants, who stopped a cab  driver and told him to take her to police.  </P></p>

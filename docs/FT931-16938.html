			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Next steps in Somalia MILITARY intervention in Somalia was a necessary first step, but it was also the easiest. Now the hard part begins: finding a political solution that will restore peace to a country where violence seems endemic, and which has been without a government since January 1991. The United Nations chaired conference that opens in Addis Ababa today is a belated start to what will be a long and arduous process. But it is far from certain that the UN, deeply discredited in Somalia by the inept handling initially of the relief operation, has either the organisational capacity or the political credibility to play the role it has assumed. The conference opens under inauspicious circumstances. President George Bush's new year visit to Mogadishu left fundamental questions about US policy unresolved. The hostile reception accorded Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, in Mogadishu yesterday illustrated some of the difficulties he faces when presiding over today's conference, where he will be seeking to establish himself as a trusted mediator. From the beginning of the military intervention in Somalia, it has been clear that getting food to the starving citizens was not in itself enough. Food warehouses have to be guarded, convoys protected, distribution centres kept secure, the safety of aid workers assured and  - most difficult of all  -the warlords and their gangs either disarmed or disciplined. US role Only the US has the resources to mount and sustain an operation on the scale required, yet Washington's view of its role falls short of UN expectations, and the timetable and the full extent of its commitment is uncertain. Washington has refused to respond to Mr Boutros Ghali's call to intervene in the conflict by disarming the gangs of gunmen responsible for the pillaging of food. The sole function of the troops so far has been to ensure that food reaches its destination. All too often this has been a hollow achievement, for no sooner have the troops departed than gunmen move in. And the need to make conditions safer for aid workers was tragically underlined over the weekend with the murder of Mr Sean Devereux, while working for Unicef in the southern Somali port of Kismayu. Regrettably during his two-day visit Mr Bush gave uncertain signals about US intentions. At one meeting the president told aid workers that the US would not leave Somalia 'in the lurch'. A few hours later Mr Bush was reassuring US troops that Washington did not have an open-ended commitment to the country. That is not expected of him: but a clearer indication of US policy is overdue. As it is, his comments are incompatible, and reflect the ambivalence that has marked Operation Restore Hope from the start. No one now expects the outgoing US administration to clarify its position; but it must urgently be addressed when Mr Clinton take office later this month. Military commitment Only a firm long-term US military commitment to Somalia will concentrate the minds of the dozen political parties attending today's conference. Nothing in the record of the two dominating figures, Somalia's self-styled president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, and Mohamed Farah Aideed, suggests they genuinely have their country's interests at heart. Their fratricidal dispute has destroyed Mogadishu, and few Somalis have any faith that their handshake of reconciliation last month will be binding. When the warlords are controlled, the negotiating process set in train at Addis Ababa can become more representative. The existing participants represent too narrow a range of interests. A broader cross-section is needed, ranging from exiles to elders, academics and former politicians, many of whom are unable to leave Somalia or are reluctant to take part in politics while the gunmen hold sway. Only when legitimate political and community leaders gather round the conference table can reconciliation and recovery get under way. Unless Washington helps the UN rein in the warlords, the peace process will not get off the ground.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the close of the comment period, the General Accounting Office (GAO) provided to the Board a draft report on bank insider activities. The GAO reviewed banks that failed during 1990 and 1991 in order to determine whether insider practices contributed to the banks' failures. (The GAO did not evaluate any existing or proposed regulation in this area.) The GAO found that insider problems (which the GAO defined very broadly) were prevalent at failed banks, that banks with less than $100 million of assets were more likely than larger banks to be cited for insider problems, and that the most frequently cited violations were loans to insiders made in excess of lending limits and on preferential terms not available to the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the GAO report did not establish a causal link between insider problems and bank failures. Rather, the GAO appeared to conclude that insider problems, as broadly defined by the GAO, were correlated with poor internal controls and underwriting practices. The GAO was not able to measure the actual level of insider lending at failed or troubled banks, and therefore was not able to address specifically the relationship of the actual level of insider lending to bank failures. The major GAO recommendations were for increased monitoring of insider lending and more effective follow-up on violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has concluded that the concerns raised in the GAO report do not justify preventing qualified banks from utilizing a higher aggregate lending limit. If the higher limit should present safety and soundness problems at an institution, then the appropriate banking supervisor retains general authority to require a reduction in the level of insider loans. If problems should occur more generally, the Board retains authority to eliminate or reduce the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the 100 percent aggregate lending limit does not appear to be currently creating a widespread problem with credit or director availability, the Board has concluded that it does appear to pose important problems for banks in certain communities. Given the available data and the comments, the Board believes that the 100 percent limit is restricting the availability of credit and the recruitment of directors in communities where the proper certification can be made. In such circumstances, the Board believes that an eligible small bank should be permitted to establish a higher lending limit up to 200 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Each eligible bank's board of directors will still be required to certify that the higher limit is necessary to avoid restricting credit or to assist in attracting directors and is consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board emphasizes that, as was the case prior to FDICIA, borrowing by insiders will continue to be subject to scrutiny during the examination process, including an evaluation of whether such borrowing represents an inappropriate concentration of loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, the Board has adopted three modifications to the proposed rule. First, the Board has provided that to qualify for the higher lending limit, a bank must be in satisfactory overall condition as determined in the most recent report of examination of the bank, as well as being adequately capitalized, as was already required in the interim rule. Second, a provision has been added clarifying that a bank operating above the 100 percent limit that subsequently becomes ineligible for the higher limit may retain its existing insider loans but may not extend credit that would maintain aggregate insider lending in excess of 100 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. Third, banks are not be required to file the required resolutions with their primary regulator or the Board, as was required by the interim rule. The resolutions are to be made available for inspection during the examination process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Recordkeeping Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 215.8 of Regulation O currently requires that each bank maintain records necessary for compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Regulation O. Specifically, banks are required to maintain records (1) identifying all directors, officers, and principal shareholders of the bank and its affiliates and all related interests of those persons (collectively, ``insiders''), and (2) specifying the amounts and terms of all credit extended to these insiders. Section 215.8 further requires each bank to request on an annual basis that its insiders and insiders of its affiliates identify their related interests. The list of insiders is then used by the bank to identify all existing or proposed extensions of credit covered by Regulation O, to monitor the amount thereof subject to the individual and aggregate lending limits, and to ensure that all appropriate approval procedures are followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

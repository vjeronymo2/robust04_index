The prime minister instructed the  banking and finance sectors to provide immediate credit to  state-run companies so that they can purchase paddy from the  peasants, primarily from their winter-spring crop.    To help companies in rice-export localities and enterprises  that are efficient but financially strapped, the government will  use the Price Stabilization Fund to subsidize partially interest  payments to banks. The prime minister has requested that sector  and local leaders satisfactorily organize the procurement of  surplus paddy at reasonable prices so that peasants can make a  profit and private traders not take advantage of peasants.    He has also directed the comrade minister of agriculture and  food industry to form quickly a rice export corporation in the  Mekong River Delta so that state-run companies can dominate rice  procurement and export and to eliminate the number of  intermediaries. At the same time, raw material-based  investments for the state rice trading business in the Mekong  River Delta must be increased so that the quality of rice  exports will improve and state-run companies can better control  the rice market. This will help peasants to implement the  government's agriculture promotion policy. Now, the  agriculture, finance, banking, and pricing sectors are actively  implementing the prime minister's directive to organize the  winter-spring rice crop procurement in the Mekong River Delta  for the 1994 export target.</p>

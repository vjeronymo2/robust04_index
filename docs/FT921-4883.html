			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / BA sets up regional business after union deal BRITISH AIRWAYS is setting up a business to run its domestic regional services called British Airways Regional. This follows agreement with BA's unions to reduce annual staff costs on its regional network by Pounds 8.25m from the beginning of next month. BA said the cost-cutting package would improve profitability and safeguard about 1,000 jobs in its domestic regional services based at Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland. The agreement comes after several months of negotiations. It does not include BA's shuttle services between London Heathrow and Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as services between Heathrow, Newcastle upon Tyne and Aberdeen and transatlantic services from Manchester and Glasgow. British Airways Regional will operate 23 BAe One-Eleven jet aircraft at Birmingham and Manchester and 13 BAe ATP turboprops based in Scotland. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's director of marketing and operations, said the launch of British Airways Regional was a new phase in the company's short-haul operations which marked a further 'significant step in BA's determination to control costs'. Up to 500 staff at the Swindon headquarters of Galileo, the international travel booking network owned by a consortium of European airlines, could lose their jobs after the company's merger with its US equivalent Apollo. Mr Pieter Bouw, president of Galileo and chairman of KLM, the Dutch airline, said yesterday that most of the cost savings after the merger would be through job losses. He said that most of these would be in data processing at Swindon. Galileo said that 500 of the 800 staff at Swindon were 'technical'. The remainder are in marketing. The technical headquarters of the combined operation, which supplies on-screen travel booking to more than 25,000 travel agents around the world, will be in Denver, Colorado.</p>

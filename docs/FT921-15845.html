			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Commitment to better quality statistics Sir, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, makes some arguably valid points in his Personal View ('How to make the Budget a real budget', January 6) and in particular that relating to the need to ensure the independence of the Government Statistical Service. But he fails to make any commitment to introduce these reforms should he find himself the actual chancellor. This leaves one with the feeling that he wishes to keep his options open in the event of electoral success. Does he wish to be selective about the statistics he would present, and avoid full public debate on fiscal policy? Such an evasion is something for which he criticises the present government by innuendo. P A Manley, 1-3 North Road, London N7</p>

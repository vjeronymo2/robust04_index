			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] At the general meeting of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), Science and Technology Agency (STA)  Director General Eda proposed a system for the international  control of plutonium and sought efforts to ensure transparency.    At the general meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, Austria, on 27  September, STA Director General Eda reported on the status of  Japan's study of a system for international control of  non-military use of plutonium, and called for cooperation in the  international community. Japan is promoting the development and  use of nuclear energy built around the use of plutonium, and  because plutonium use under appropriate control is essential, we  will watch future responses with interest.    On the other hand, a symposium called ``Why Plutonium Now,''  which was co-hosted by the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum and the  nuclear energy data and information office, was held in Osaka  City on 25 September. The pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions  sat down together for the first time. The surfacing of plutonium  as the focal point of the development and use of nuclear energy  is a recent thing, and it is encouraging that the two sides  finally have come together in a debate on the pros and cons and  other problems of nuclear energy, where emotions have tended to  take precedence in the past.    The overall nuclear picture in the international community  consists of the United States, which touts nuclear  non-proliferation but wears the armor of global strategy which  is visible under its robe, China and several ``suspected nuclear  countries,'' which are defying the United States, and Russia,  which has been trying to dispose of nuclear warheads since the  disassembling of the former Soviet Union. The focus of this is  on plutonium.    The sole reason for such concern about plutonium is that it  can easily be converted to use in nuclear weapons. Unlike  uranium that requires enrichment, plutonium produced in a  nuclear reactor can be separated, extracted and used almost as  is for nuclear weapons, and this can be done with only basic  chemical knowledge. Enriched uranium can be mixed with natural  uranium to lower its concentration and make it difficult to  convert to nuclear weapon use, but in contrast, there is no  effective means to prevent the conversion of plutonium.    Furthermore, use of plutonium in nuclear power plants,  certainly in fast breeder reactors but even in light water  reactors and other types of nuclear reactors, is disadvantageous  in terms of economical operation; and it is difficult to say  that the safety of the technology has been verified fully. The  current environment is such that insisting on plutonium use at  this time would tend to create suspicion that there is an  intention to develop nuclear weapons.    It probably is true that this sort of suspicion is hidden  behind some of the domestic and foreign criticism. There are a  number of reasons and one big one is that the government has not  provided sufficient appropriate explanation to gain the people's  understanding. There is plenty to reflect upon, such as whether  the petitions and views of civic groups opposed to plutonium use  have been heeded with humility, or whether it was thought that  it would be sufficient to provide technical explanations that  were over the heads of residents with little expert knowledge.    Ensuring transparency in the use of plutonium is the most  important goal of international control. The statement Director  General Eda made at the IAEA general meeting probably resulted  from an STA study. International transparency is supported by  domestic transparency. It needs to be stressed that efforts to  gain domestic understanding will lead to understanding in the  international community.</p>

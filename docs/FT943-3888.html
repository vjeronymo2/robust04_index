			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Terms still to be decided: The issues that will determine whether the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is extended While delegates in Cairo wrangle over ways to deal with the world population explosion, another international conference, no less crucial to the future of the planet, is being prepared in Geneva: on extending the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The success or failure of such conferences depends in large measure on work done beforehand. Today's meeting of the preparatory committee for the NPT conference should begin to 'discuss seriously the agenda and content', according to a report just published by a group of specialised arms control think-tanks*. This means the bargaining positions of the main parties, nuclear and non-nuclear, should for the first time be clearly staked out. The conference, to be held in New York next spring, is prescribed by the NPT itself: it has to decide whether the treaty should 'continue in force indefinitely, or shall be extended for an additional fixed period or periods'. The treaty, signed in 1968, divides the world into nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon states, the former being those which had exploded a nuclear device before 1967. By that definition there were five nuclear-weapon states - the US, Soviet Union, UK, France and China - and the NPT aim was to freeze them at that number. Many non-nuclear states would have liked to abolish nuclear weapons altogether, but had to content themselves with a pledge to 'pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control'. One thing the signatories could not agree on was how long the treaty should remain in force. The nuclear powers wanted an indefinite treaty, while some of the non-nuclear wanted to keep a nuclear option open for themselves in case the treaty failed. So they left the matter to be decided at next year's conference, held when the treaty will have been in force for 25 years. The decision on extending the treaty must be taken by a majority of the parties, which on the latest count means at least 83 states. Most governments would prefer a decision taken by consensus, which would carry greater political weight. But few would want the treaty to lapse just because one or two states (such as Iraq or North Korea) refused to go along. So western governments are keeping open the option of a vote, to ensure that the conference reaches a decision. Many governments, including four of the five official nuclear powers, Nato, Japan and nearly all European states, favour indefinite, unconditional extension. China is thought to favour indefinite extension on certain conditions. Only Iran, so far, has come out clearly against an indefinite extension; but it is not alone among third-world states in thinking that extension for fixed periods would keep the nuclear powers under greater pressure to move towards disarmament. How exactly this would work is not clear, but it could mean the present exercise being repeated at regular intervals, perhaps every 25 years. Amendment of the treaty, everyone agrees, would be impossible, because the procedure is too complex. Nor is there any chance of it being scrapped and replaced by a new treaty - for instance, one with tougher and more binding obligations on the nuclear powers - before next spring, or any time soon. The existing treaty now has 164 signatories. No new one could quickly gain anything like such wide support. Many non-specialists believe that the NPT has failed, or was useful only in cold war conditions; that proliferation in the real world is rampant; and that extending the treaty amounts to little more than 'shutting the stable after the horse has bolted'. But such views are not shared by experts such as John Simpson, head of the non-proliferation programme at Southampton University. He points out that the world of 20 or more nuclear powers which seemed imminent in the 1960s is still far off; and that in several respects the situation has lately improved. Until 1990, he says, six countries which had not signed the NPT were 'threshold' or 'suspect' states, assumed either to have a nuclear weapon or to be actively developing one. That list has now shrunk to three: South Africa has scrapped its nuclear programme and joined the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state; while Argentina and Brazil have signed bilateral non-proliferation agreements and joined the regional Tlatelolco treaty, which makes all Latin America and the Caribbean a nuclear weapon-free zone. And Algeria, potentially a seventh 'suspect', has promised to join the NPT and accepted a safeguard agreement for its nuclear reactor. That leaves India, Pakistan and Israel. The India-Pakistan relationship remains tense, and this may be the region where the danger of nuclear war is greatest. But from a proliferation point of view the two states form a stable sub-system, with no other state in the region aspiring to emulate them. Israel's de facto nuclear status is more dangerous to the NPT regime, because of the asymmetry between it and the Arab states. Many Arabs cite this as a reason for not ratifying the convention banning chemical weapons; and they may refuse to support NPT extension unless the US presses Israel to denuclearise. Meanwhile the dissolution of the Soviet Union has confronted the NPT with a new problem: the division of one nuclear-weapon state into several, all of which could have claimed to inherit that status. An international consensus was swiftly reached that only Russia should be allowed to do so. All tactical nuclear weapons have been transferred to Russia from other ex-Soviet republics, as have strategic weapons from Belarus and Kazakhstan, which have joined the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states. Ukraine has agreed in principle to do the same, but has not yet done so. For the time being, strategic weapons remain on its territory, but they are being shipped out and, in any case, Ukraine could not target or fire them without Russian co-operation. Ukraine has also agreed to an audit of all nuclear materials on its territory by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the body charged under the treaty with verifying non-nuclear states' compliance. Proliferation within the former Soviet Union is now overshadowed by anxiety over the smuggling of plutonium and other nuclear materials from there to would-be proliferators elsewhere, as exposed by the recent interception of Russian plutonium shipments in Germany. Meanwhile, France and China - the two acknowledged nuclear powers which rejected the NPT in the 1960s - have acceded to it. Even Israel, India and Pakistan, which have not signed, pay the treaty a back-handed compliment by not declaring themselves nuclear powers (though last month Nawaz Sharif, former prime minister of Pakistan, embarrassed his successor by stating publicly that Pakistan does have a nuclear weapon). The NPT has made non-proliferation a universally respected norm. But is it respected in word only? The scope of Iraq's weapons programme, revealed after the Gulf war in 1991, shook many people's confidence. Iraq was the first of a new category of NPT 'renegades': a long-standing signatory of the treaty, it had allowed the IAEA to monitor its use of imported nuclear fuel. Yet neither the IAEA nor any national intelligence service detected its clandestine weapons programme. This discovery prompted nuclear suppliers to tighten their export restrictions, and to insist on much more intrusive IAEA inspections - though so far they have not endowed the IAEA with resources to match. The IAEA can monitor compliance, but only the UN Security Council, on whose order Iraq has now been disarmed, has the power and authority to enforce compliance: a distinction highlighted by the next 'renegade', North Korea. Here the IAEA did its job well, in that North Korea could only conceal what it was doing by refusing co-operation with IAEA inspectors. But the UN's ability or willingness to do anything about it is more doubtful. Perhaps the fear of UN sanctions helped change the late Kim Il-sung's attitude in June, when he suddenly agreed to 'freeze' nuclear activity during new high-level talks with US officials. But it is not yet clear how far this presages a real change in North Korean behaviour. And it is far from clear that sanctions would have worked, or even have been applied. China, which is North Korea's main trading partner, might well have vetoed, or simply ignored, them. Iraq was disarmed after military defeat. Theoretically, military action could be taken against North Korea, but it would be extremely risky. Probably, if North Korea remained recalcitrant, the world would have to settle for isolating it as far as possible, while trying to block any further proliferation from it to other potential renegades, such as Iran. Iran's case further illustrates the difficulty of seeking to prevent proliferation purely by restricting supply. Iran fulfils all its NPT obligations and yet, because nuclear suppliers are suspicious of its intentions, does not get the free access to peaceful nuclear energy it is entitled to under the treaty. This strengthens many third-world states' belief that the nuclear powers have not fulfilled their side of the bargain. Most non-nuclear states did not sign the treaty as a favour to the nuclear powers, but to enhance their own security. The treaty's main function is to reduce demand for nuclear weapons, by relieving each non-nuclear state of the fear that its potential adversaries will get them first. But this will not stave off proliferation indefinitely, unless nuclear powers do more to improve the security of non-nuclear ones - or so at least the latter argue. There are three kinds of thing they can do: 'Positive assurances': pledges to come to the aid of non-nuclear states if nuclear weapons are used or threatened against them. In 1968 the UK, US and Soviet Union gave such a pledge in a United Nations Security Council resolution. But such broad pledges are not very credible. 'Negative security assurances': promises that they themselves will not use or threaten nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states. These were only available in heavily qualified form during the cold war, because both sides reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances against each other's allies. But they may now be willing to go further. Last week Iran and 10 other states tabled a proposal for a protocol on security assurances to be added to the NPT. Progress towards general nuclear disarmament, as promised in the treaty. Many non-nuclear states have decided to judge the nuclear powers' good faith by their willingness to negotiate a worldwide ban on nuclear tests. The last conference to review implementation of the NPT, in 1990, broke up without agreement because the US and UK refused to commit themselves to such a ban. Since then, there has been spectacular progress towards disarmament in the form of reductions in the US and Russian nuclear arsenals; France and China have adhered to the NPT; and the Clinton administration, followed by a reluctant UK, has come out for a comprehensive test ban. Negotiations on this began in January, but progress has been slow, mainly because the UK, France and China are dragging their feet. A draft text was agreed last week, two months later than most delegates had hoped, and further talks are to be held at the end of the year. But the prospect of agreeing a test ban treaty by next April, when the NPT conference meets, is now thought remote. The nuclear powers, especially the western ones, are still prone to assume that the NPT's benefits are self-evident. They have perhaps not taken the full measure of third-world states' impatience with the post-cold war world order, and the need to convince them that general disarmament is a genuine, if still a distant, goal. *A Comprehensive Test Ban: Disappointing Progress, Acronym Booklet No 3, available from BASIC, Carrara House, 20 Embankment Place, London WC2N 6NN</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Piling jobs on the pyre YESTERDAY'S sharp rise in UK unemployment should not have come as a surprise either to the government or to City economists. Changes in unemployment always lag the economic cycle, as the chancellor was wont to observe last year while sniffing for shoots of economic recovery. But these shoots, if they ever really existed, have browned and died over the last few months, as the renewed acceleration in unemployment belatedly confirms. The result is that it is the Labour party, not the economy or the government, that now has a spring in its step. Talking up the recovery was always going to to be a risky strategy for the government. Last autumn's pick-up in confidence was neither reflected in higher spending nor rising output. The patience of businesses, their bank managers, and perhaps voters too, cannot last indefinitely. Little wonder that confidence has dived, to be followed by a new wave of redundancies. Unemployment has now risen by a hair short of a million since the recession began, similar in sum to the last recession but at a faster pace in its early stages. Why was the rise in unemployment unusually rapid early on? Hiring and firing is certainly easier in deregulated post-Thatcherite Britain, especially in the non-unionised service sector. But unemployment also rose more quickly in manufacturing. Perhaps exporters have taken on board the need to remain cost competitive within the European exchange rate mechanism. Manufacturing unit labour costs may still be growing faster than in other European countries; but they are growing at half their rate of June last year. Job-shedding Sadly, this adjustment to the ERM has so far occurred predominantly through job-shedding rather than lower pay inflation. Wage inflation remains stuck above 7 per cent, higher than in pre-recession Germany. Manufacturing (though not service) pay settlements do appear to have fallen further, though not far enough. Manufacturers, needing to reduce unit costs and apparently unable to reduce pay awards, have resorted to the only other means available: cutting jobs. Output per head has been on a rising trend since March of last year, a full quarter earlier than at the same stage of the cycle in 1980-81. It has risen, despite falling output, because employment has fallen faster. Nowhere is this Neanderthal approach to reducing pay costs more stark than at high paying, low productivity, loss-making, job-shedding, Ford UK. Squeezed margins Yet despite the pain, the adjustment to the ERM is not yet half complete. UK wage inflation remains twice as high as it must be if what remains of British industry is to hold its ground in Europe. Producer price inflation has fallen, but only at the expense of squeezed profit margins. Only when wage inflation has fallen below 4 per cent will full adjustment be in sight. Tragically for the long-run health of the economy, as well as the short-run health of many of its citizens, unemployment is the only mechanism that anyone is willing to use to get there. More rational solutions involving more co-ordination, synchronisation and discussion about sustainable rates of wage inflation have simply, and shamefully, been ignored. At least the current, southern-biased recession means that manufacturers of traded goods, and their ex-employees, are not bearing the full adjustment cost. The wider and deeper the recession, the swifter the adjustment to European rates of inflation and the better the prospects for sustained recovery. Yet this prolonged, and maybe even deepening, recession will damage the government's confidence in its election prospects. Recovery will not begin until affluent, southern consumers start feeling confident about borrowing again, something that Mr Lamont will no longer be willing to count on. That the Department of Employment felt the need, yesterday, to issue a new booklet entitled Jobhunting - A Guide for Managers, Executives and Professionals suggests the recovery may still be some way off.</p>

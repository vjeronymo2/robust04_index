			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Daily" column by Yalcin Dogan: "Democratization Scandal!"] </F>   [Excerpt] The southeast and consequently the "Kurdish  package" has been excluded from the democratization package that  was announced yesterday. About 20 days ago, the Social  Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] submitted a draft to the True  Path Party [TPP]. This draft included some rights "which were  supposed to be granted to the Kurds." The package announced  yesterday, however, does not incorporate these.    The SDPP first drafted a proposal for the democratization  package, to which it attaches great importance and to which it  links its very existence in the government. This draft was then  discussed at a meeting attended by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller,  SDPP leader Murat Karayalcin, as well as certain TPP and SDPP  deputies. During the meeting, Ciller described the proposal as  "very good, very appropriate" and the SDPP members were  ecstatic. Yesterday, however, those same ecstatic SDPP members  were very reticent.    What does this draft, which was reportedly "agreed upon" and  which was suspended yesterday, actually contain? These are the  details:    In the draft, the SDPP says: "The legal and de facto  obstacles that emerge during the expression of a cultural  identity will be eliminated." What are these obstacles? The  draft proposes "the introduction of Kurdish education, Kurdish  radio and television broadcasting, the elimination of the  difficulties encountered when people use their Kurdish names,  and the obstacles in establishing foundations." There are still  actual obstacles in presenting names and establishing  foundations. Moreover, the draft includes the practical  suggestion "to begin Kurdish television broadcasting with GAP  [Southeast Anatolia Project] TV."    The draft, which was approved by Ciller 20 days ago,  provoked  the reaction of TPP members last week and was subsequently  rejected.    What does this leave us with? We are left with amendments to  certain articles of the Constitution and various arrangements  which are not really related to democratization, such as  lowering the age to vote and be elected, making it easier for  deputies to switch parties, and controlling the annulment of  laws.    This is an insipid package, which does not need to be called  a democratization package. For example, it does not grant the  right to strike and conduct collective wage negotiations to  civil servant unions and continues to prevent university  teachers from joining a political party. It is merely a bunch  of decisions necessitated by current conditions. Therefore, let  no one attempt to publicize it as a "democratization package."    On the contrary, as stated in yesterday's news conference,  "the new provincial administration law will spread the state of  emergency conditions not only to the southeast, but to the  entire country." This is not what we say. During yesterday's  news conference, Ciller said the following in answer to a  question:    "The provincial private administration law must be enacted  before we can lift the state of emergency." Here, too, she  confuses the provincial private administration and the  provincial administration law. But, this is another matter.  Nonetheless, the so-called democratization package acquires a  "scandalous" nature because of the prime minister's own  statement. Ciller links the lifting of the state of emergency  to the enactment of the provincial administration law. In the  text she read earlier, however, she describes the "provincial  administration law as part of democratization."    In fact, the provincial administration law is the  alternative  to the state of emergency. Then, what is it doing in the  democratization package? Alternatively, since when has the  state of emergency been a part of democratization?    This draft law, which has been overlooked, in fact "spreads  the state of emergency to the entire country." So much so that  "the district official is the only ruler in the district and the  governor is the only ruler in the province." [passage omitted]</p>

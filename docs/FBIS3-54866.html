			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleksiy Mustafin: "Unity of National Democrats </F> May Result in Their Joint Defeat"]    [Text] Delegates and guests of the Fifth Rukh Congress had  a wonderful occasion to see an "unofficial" show. Following the  invitation of Vyacheslav Chornovil, political leaders who had  signed an agreement on forming the Council of Democratic Parties  and Organizations took the rostrum and ceremonially swore to put  an end to discord and join efforts for the victory of democracy.  That was a touchy scene, even though the Party of Democratic  Renaissance of Ukraine had reneged on its commitments to join  the council.    It is too early to announce the premature death of the  Council of Democratic Parties and Organizations, but there is no  doubt that the "child" is afflicted with a serious congenital  disease. The fathers of the council were too inharmonious and  there was too broad an incongruity between their slogans and  practical goals.    The council was formed at the initiative of leaders of the  Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] and the Democratic Party.  These parties have always demonstrated their loyalty to the  president and given preference to access to power rather than  the ephemeral unity of democratic forces. The URP has always  opposed all kinds of blocs and coalitions, and agreed to join  the latter only if was granted a leading position. Such  coalitions inevitably became URP delegations and "independent  players" quickly lost interest in their activities.    It is understood that Republicans' unexpected desire to  unite  was prompted by purely practical considerations. Republican  stakes in the upcoming elections are not very high and slogans  like "Unity above all!" may increase chances for victory at the  expense of possible partners. The URP remains loyal to its  former strategy and will try to gain control over the future  coalition.    Republicans need the council, both to gain additional weight  and neutralize its rivals. On the one hand, the URP cannot  compete with representatives of the "party of power"; on the  other hand, Republicans are trying to avoid competition with the  Rukh and other national-democratic forces. The "peaceful"  division of electoral districts between URP and the Rukh can be  achieved through the newly formed council. The URP dreams of a  situation in which its candidates could be nominated only in the  districts in which there are neither Rukh nor "party of power"  representatives, even more so if this could be done under the  camouflage of consolidating the democratic movement.    Having realized that the goals of the council are different  from its declarations, the more moderate organizations began to  back out. The example of the Party of Democratic Renaissance was  followed by the "Greens." The Rukh found itself in a ticklish  situation. Its leaders realized that they had been involved in  somebody's schemes, having no control over the situation. It  was not by coincidence that the URP-oriented Union of Ukrainian  Students was invited to join the council, why the  Rukh-affiliated Ukrainian Students' Association was not.  Neither was the newly formed Youth Rukh Organization. However,  the Rukh cannot abandon the council because in this case its  leaders could be blamed for splitting the "national democratic  forces."    Those claiming that the Rukh made a strategic mistake in  1992, are probably right. At that time, following a declaration  on opposition to the official power, the organization should  have emphasized socioeconomic reform rather than national and  cultural ideas. As a result of this mistake, forces  representing similar ideas (the Party of Democratic Renaissance,  the "Greens," and social-democrats) have not been included in  the coalition, while those who threatened to destroy "the  Chornovil movement" became its members.    Cooperation between the Rukh and the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists [KUN] is the only possible counterbalance to URP  domination of the council. Both parties have similar political  programs and oppose the current administration, considered by  them the successor of the Soviet nomenklatura. Finally, both  the Rukh and the Congress have a very "cautious" attitude toward  the Republican and Democratic Parties.    However, there exists a certain difference in views between  the KUN leadership and the rank and file, limiting the chances  for cooperation with the Rukh. The leadership of the Congress  is closer to the Rukh than its provincial organizations. Very  often, especially in West Ukraine, Rukh and KUN advocates find  themselves in two opposing camps.    As a rule, candidates for deputies will be nominated not in  accordance with their professional qualities, but in accordance  with their party membership. Reliable sources have reported  that in Poltava, for instance, URP will nominate its candidates  in every district in which a Rukh candidate is registered. A  similar situation may develop throughout eastern and central  Ukraine, reducing the chances of all democratic candidates.</p>

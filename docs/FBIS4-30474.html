			<p>BFN     [Text] Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], held a news conference on the  afternoon of 25 June and disclosed that the party plans to  promptly wrap up policy consultations between the ruling  coalition parties and the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ]. He indicated the party seeks to form a new coalition  government that excludes the Liberal Democratic Party before the  Naples summit which is to start on 8 July. Regarding the  framework of the new government, Watanabe said: "We would like  to treat with respect the feelings of the large majority of  upper and lower house members who voted for `Tsutomu Hata' [as  prime minister]." He thus expressed strong hopes for the SDPJ  and the Sakigake [Harbinger Party] to return to the coalition.</p>

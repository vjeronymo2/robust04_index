			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Radamec Pounds 0.35m in the black Radamec, the electronics and precision mechanical engineering group, continued its recovery through the second six months and for the 1991 year swung from loses of Pounds 396,000 to profits of Pounds 345,000. Turnover declined from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 10.3m but at the operating level profits pushed ahead from Pounds 153,000 to Pounds 645,000. Dividends are resumed with a proposed 0.5p. Earnings emerged at 1.9p (losses 1.8p). Directors said the improved figures reflected a substantially better result from Radamec Defence Systems and lower interest charges - down from Pounds 549,000 to Pounds 300,000. It was pointed out that the Gulf conflict had assisted the order book of RDS in the short term and that contracts from home and export customers 'should ensure the continuing profitable operation of RDS into 1993.' Gearing at the year-end fell from 62.3 per cent to 39.3 per cent.</p>

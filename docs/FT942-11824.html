			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / People: Crestcare Crestacare, the UK's third biggest private operator of nursing homes, has made some board changes, promoting James Ramsay, 35, to be group finance director. He joined the company in 1986, becoming group financial controller in 1989. He succeeds Geoff Crowe, who remains company secretary. The group now manages 37 nursing homes with 2,264 beds located in the north of England, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. The group has picked up recently, converting a 1992 loss of Pounds 1.58m to pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 in 1993, despite a number of managerial upheavals and withdrawing from property activities. Andrew Taee, chief executive, recently predicted the company 'will bloom' in 1994. The group is looking at all areas of long-term health care. Colin Brown has resigned from his non-executive directorship of the company.</p>

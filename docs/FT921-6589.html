			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Technology: Consultant's Critique TIME ZONES are the curse of international businesses. When the day is nearly over in the UK, Californians are just getting out of bed and the Japanese have already gone home. One benefit of E-Mail is in time-shifting. Like facsimile or the postal services, the E-Mail message is ready to be read whenever the recipient arrives at the desk. It combines the speed of the telephone with the off-line readability of paper-based messages. Sun Alliance has taken E-Mail outside the boundaries of simple intra-office communication by integrating its messaging system with its brokers. Brokers want to help their clients and will tend towards those insurers who can offer a wide range of services. Clearly, the timeliness of obtaining a quotation is an important part of the transaction. The integration with the brokers' systems is an important part of the success of this installation. Learning new methods is a barrier to acceptance of any new technology. Any technique that makes the new system appear to be a logical extension (or improvement) of the old will help overcome resistance by users. Forms are a metaphor that is familiar to office workers. Sensibly, the computer forms were customised so that they resembled the paper forms that the brokers were already using in other transactions. The result is a system that is simple for the uninitiated or computer-shy user. Electronic data entry has appealed to many industries for some time. However, it is only recently that companies considered making their data available to suppliers or customers. Generating invoices on computer and then posting them to customers, who re-type them into their own computers, is a waste of effort and money. It is also error-prone. Exchanging the information directly between the two computers seems more obvious. While the Sun Alliance system is not yet a full EDI (electronic data interchange) application, it has encapsulated the heart of the concept. In the 1990s companies will tend to do business with organisations which make their operations easier (or reduce their costs). Sun Alliance has shown considerable vision in opening its E-mail system up to its brokers. The author is a consultant with Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes</p>

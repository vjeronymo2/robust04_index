			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BUSH WILL MARK 66TH BIRTHDAY AT GOP BASH  </P> <P> George Bush turns 66 today and, like Barbara Bush, who turned 65 Friday, he  planned no family celebration.  </P> <P> But Republicans were set to give him a birthday tribute with a big fund-raiser,  the President's Dinner.  </P> <P> More than 4,000 people were expected to attend the $1,500-a-plate gala.  Proceeds will go to Republican challengers in this fall's elections, when a  third of the Senate and the entire House will be up for grabs.  </P></p>

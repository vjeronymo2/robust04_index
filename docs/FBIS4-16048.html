			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Madrid by correspondent Sergey Dorenko on </F> news conference given by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 12  April, including recorded extracts of Yeltsin remarks -- from  the "Vesti" program]    [Text] [Dorenko] Today President Yeltsin and Felipe  Gonzalez, chairman of the Spanish Government, summed up the  results of the Russian president's official visit. Gonzalez  thanked the visitor for interesting talks and reminded him that  the new treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and  Spain is a direct successor of the similar treaty of 1812. The  Russian president said that our ties should be expanded on the  basis of the treaty.    [Yeltsin] On the whole, we used to have abnormal relations.  Two big states with enormous possibilities have a general trade  turnover not exceeding 2 percent. This figure is smaller than  in any other European country. Why is it so? It is Spain,  after all.    [Dorenko] Staying in a NATO member-country, the president,  naturally, could not fail to discuss the aggravation of our  relations with the NATO bloc after the Bosnia bombings.    [Addressing Yeltsin at news conference] Boris Nikolayevich,  at the moment you are on NATO's south flank. If NATO continues  to bomb the Serbs while neglecting Russia's proposals, can  Russia put pressure not only on the Serbs? Can Russia make  others heed its views?    [Yeltsin] Yes, I think you have worded your question in a  very correct way. I already voiced my displeasure to Mr.  Clinton the day before yesterday and have told the Spanish  leaders here that to sign the Partnership for Peace document  while there is a kind of discrimination against Russia [changes  thought], for instance, we are still unable to sign an economic  agreement with the EEC. We have been eyeing this agreement for  a whole year but we still cannot sign it.    Have we got any any resources for changing the situation?  I think we have. We were the first to take the correct view as  regards influence on the Serbs. I am sure, nevertheless -- and  we have just been discussing it; the chairman, Mr. Gonzalez,  also agrees -- that the end there must come only through  political negotiation and not through force. The task there  cannot be accomplished by means of force. That will be an  everlasting war. When all's said and done, everyone should  understand that. If things worsen now, the blame will rest with  those who took the decision on those three bombing strikes. The  blame will rest with them.    I consider that the statement is very tough and, it must be  said, serious, including for the President of the United States  and for NATO. I think that it will change the situation.    The main thing now in the situation of Yugoslavia after  these  three bombing strikes is to hold the Serbs back from greater  confrontation and greater military action. And we are now  making such efforts. Our Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin is now  constantly with Milosevic. If necessary, Foreign Minister  Kozyrev will fly there the day after tomorrow to restrain the  Serbs from greater confrontation. If it proves possible to  restrain them and to switch once again to the negotiating track,  to the political level, the level of negotiation, that means  there will be no more bombing.    As regards the linkage with this European, NATO document,  Partnership for Peace, well, we are not so far making any direct  linkage. But neither are we in any hurry to sign.    [Dorenko] The president said that for him Spain was an  experiment in civic accord. And here is what Boris Yeltsin had  to say about the Memorandum on Civic Accord in Russia:    [Yeltsin] We intend to sign it on 28 April, and so far we  are  not changing this date. Leaders of the State Duma, the  Federation Council, and the government, as well as most  political parties and public movements support the memorandum,  although it is yet to be examined officially. Therefore I  believe most of them will sign it on 28 April, and after that  this document will be open for signing by anyone wishing to sign  it.    [Dorenko] And now the president's sensational response to  questions about the state of his health: Yeltsin invites all  journalists to attend his medical examination.    [Yeltsin] I could wish everyone such health as I have at my  age. A man who plays a rigorous game of tennis regularly for  one and a half hours at a time, with professional tennis players  for partners, a man who swims in the Black Sea in March, with  the water temperature down just to four degrees -- can such a  man be of poor health? A man who works 16-18 hours a day,  practically without weekends -- you can only envy this. The  communists, of course, are constantly spreading rumors. They  would like to put me in a bad mood, make up stories -- but all  this is not serious. Recently, when I read and heard about this  I said to my doctors: Let us carry out the full one-day medical  examination this year, in a clinic, witnessed by all the  journalists wishing to attend. Let as send my blood tests to  any laboratory, let them investigate how much of what I have in  my urine, in my [words indistinct due to audience laughter]. So  that, through all the stages of these clinical tests not just  Russia but the whole world will know what do I have inside me.    And so, I can assure you -- I am not going to Barcelona for  treatment. This is a planned visit. I will simply meet my  doctors somewhere in their surgery -- just to thank them once  again for the splendid operation they performed on me when I had  some trouble with my spine after a plane crash. It was a  splendid operation -- hardly anyone in the world could perform  such an operation as they did. Therefore I will just thank them  because I am not suffering any after-effects whatsoever.    [Dorenko] Tonight the president will meet with 200 Spanish  entrepreneurs. Tomorrow he will visit Barcelona and return to  Moscow.

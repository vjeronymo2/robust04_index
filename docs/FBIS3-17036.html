			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys by </F> Algimantas Zukas in Vilnius; date not given: "Treaty -- Only  Favorable Background for Relations"]    [Text] [Zukas] We have met to discuss the political  Lithuanian-Polish interstate treaty that has already been  prepared, but that remains to be signed. You just returned from  Germany. I think that the treaty, the preparation of which has  taken so much time, was also remembered there.    [Gylys] I realized that the news about a breakthrough in our  negotiations was received favorably. Germany's signing of the  state agreement with Poland was more painful. By the way, they  could speak about ethnic borders, as some people are fond of  saying in our country, not only with Poland but also, let us  say, with France. I think, however, that the future agreement  is a proper move in removing historical misunderstandings.    [Zukas] Let us try to assess this treaty from the  geopolitical viewpoint then. Do you think that this is an  overly high level?    [Gylys] No, your question is timely. We often reason in  categories of inner patriotism: How can I, as a Lithuanian,  agree that there are also Lithuanians beyond Lithuania's  borders, but not guarantee that they will be together with me.  When defending state interests, one must see not only domestic  events but one must also understand the surrounding world and  even the danger of finding ourselves under siege. We must  abandon the enemy image created by the opponents of the treaty.  This might seem like patriotism and the protection of state  interests, but it looks more like sabotage on second thought.  If we do not introduce order in our relations, we will not be  attractive to businessmen, and it will be difficult and unreal  to think about the integration with Europe. Talks on the  associate agreement with the European Union [EU] are beginning  in the second half of this year -- we must put things in order  by that time. The EU reprimands us for ethnic minorities [as  published], and the foreign army is absent from our country --  these are the great advantages. The only problem that remains  is the normalization of relations.    [Zukas] Does the signing of this treaty mean that General L.  Zeligowski's problem has already been solved, or that it will  reemerge in diplomatic and ruling circles?    [Gylys] We reached an agreement while negotiating that we  would be able to discuss this issue in the future, because we  are democratic states, or at least we are trying to become such.  Discussions will certainly not subside. They might involve  primarily historians. I suppose that we must resort to measures  and principles typical of modern times. Europe of the 21th  century will be different. Problems that are so important to us  now will probably look quite different then.    [Zukas] How then, could you explain the constant "friction"  with the opposition over this treaty?    [Gylys] I see two reasons -- the gnoseological and the  psychological, that is, how people understand this issue. I  think that most of these people really wish the state well.  They want Lithuania to make moves which, in their opinion, are  beneficial to it. No one can deprive these people of the right  to have their own views. However, the responsibility for  managing the state falls on the government. Each government has  problems. We must resolve the following dilemma now: Either we  have no treaty, or we have such an agreement that is possible at  the moment. In my opinion, the first option is worse.    [Zukas] Speaking about the gnoseological reason, that is,  the  one linked with the knowledge of specific details, however, you  should agree that no one has really seen the treaty. Nor have  those people, who are picketing at the ministry's entrance today  and who have promised to rally at other government doors in the  future, read it.    [Gylys] I discern another -- political -- reason here. I  understand that many ordinary people do not realize what issues  are present or absent in the treaty. However, politicians know  its contents quite well. Both sides have expressed the  essential items.    [Zukas] It would be important then to learn your opinion  on Mr. Ozolas' [Seimas deputy, leader of the Center Union]  statements concerning not only the treaty but also the Polish  ambassador [allegations of Widacki's possible cooperation with  former Polish secret services]. This seems to have caused  particular tensions, even though Poland did not react to Mr.  Ozolas' statements as seriously as it usually does.    [Gylys] I think that this was a politically irresponsible  move. I was simply shocked by Ozolas' article. He insulted not  only Mr. Widacki, but also Germany and Russia. Everything is  generalized -- the author speaks about nations. He berates the  West and the EU "a priori" only because they might back this  treaty. The author maintains that we have met most Polish  claims to Lithuania's sovereignty in its southeastern and  eastern regions. Why such a conclusion? R. Ozolas states  openly that we must claim the territories of the neighboring  states. The reason might be that some of our politicians have  become accustomed to acting without feedback, they have  criticized and struck since 1988. We know from cybernetics that  a system without feedback loses the link with reality.    [Zukas] I have a few specific questions. When will the  treaty be initialed? This seems to be your duty. Is talk about  President Walesa's visit to Lithuania to sign the ratified  treaty grounded?    [Gylys] The treaty will be initialed very soon, within some  10 days. During our visit to Warsaw, we expect to learn the  date of President Walesa's visit to the capital of Lithuania.  We are looking forward to his visit. I think that this will be  a very important and symbolic visit of the Polish leader to  Lithuania.    [Zukas] Do you not think that L. Walesa will be welcomed  with  posters, pickets, and all other "symbols of the sacred religion?"    [Gylys] We are a nation of peasants, and the majority of us  realize how important it is to get along with neighbors.    [Zukas] What should be the next move after the signing of  the  bilateral treaty?    [Gylys] We discussed this with Polish Foreign Minister  Olechowski. It would be very good to organize a "round table"  with the participation of politicians, businessmen, and bankers.  We would specify our relations and point out the "weak points."  I think that we must accomplish much in regulating our border  and customs services. The free trade agreement was drafted back  last April. In my opinion, Polish politicians sincerely seek  definite cooperation. While I was travelling to Budapest via  Warsaw, Minister Olechowski himself came to the airport,  although he had promised to send his deputy. The foreign  minister offered definite assistance in preparing for  negotiations with the EU on free trade: "We know the process of  negotiations and all the difficulties, and we are ready to share  our experience with you." I stress once again: A political  treaty means a favorable political background for definite  relations. Our current relations are definite but not perfect  due to the unfavorable background.    [Zukas] Thank you for the interview.</p>

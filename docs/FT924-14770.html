			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: Dazzling Disney - Cinema BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (U) Odeon Marble Arch WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP (15) Plaza ORSON WELLES' OTHELLO (U) Curzon West End AS YOU LIKE IT (U) MGM Tottenham Court Road, Barbican BLUE ICE MGMs West End Beauty And The Beast is Disney going Euro in the right way. The company's theme park invasion of France may have misfired, but this commando raid on French folklore has been its biggest animation success since Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Dollars 133m at the American box office; rave reviews; and learned articles in Sight And Sound about the sexual politics of fairy tales. SP creeps into everything today, so no wonder this movie's heroine, the lovely Belle, has a village suitor who is unmistakably a male chauvinist pig. You can tell from his beefcake narcissism and taste in macho decor. 'I use antlers in all my de-cor-A-TING]' he sings in his big number. So Belle decides to give him up, and to give herself up to the castle-dwelling Beast in exchange for her inventor father, held prisoner after straying innocently into his lair. Once confined, the girl finds the B and his castle ever more appealing and so do we. There is the all-talking, all-singing double act of the Maurice Chevalier-accented candlestick and clock with dial-moustaches, supported in tutti numbers by the cockney teapot and yapping canine foot-cushion. Then there are the monster statues lining the stairs, folk myth's equivalent of the family portrait. Then there is the B himself, a broody thunderous hulk swagged to the eyeballs in face-concealing cloak - until (violin music please) his guard drops and love begins to twitter on the horizon. It could have been the worst Disney syrup. Instead it is the best Disney blend of comedy and romance. We know we are in animation Heaven from the beginning, with the shifting-perspective vistas of forest and castle and the mock-Mediaeval stained-glass tableaux. The songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (of The Little Mermaid) break into this Arcady with wit and ease. And once inside the castle, the choreography of characters and camera has a dazzling virtuosity. Years ago I and other critics prophesied the death of paint-and-brush animation, condemned (we thought) by the modernist arsenal of animatronics, muppetry and video trickery. But the new styles have been outwitted by the old. Beauty And The Beast has a lived-in lyricism and a pictorial sumptuousness that none of the newer techniques could have equalled. * * * Could someone out there help me with the spate of slang in modern American cinema? 'The mustard's off the hot dog, you corn-fed mule, you]' barks black basketballer Wesley Snipes to white friend Woody Harrelson in White Men Can't Jump. What does he mean? And what about the last line of the movie: 'You can put a cat in the oven, but that don't make it a biscuit.' Why are these people putting cats in ovens? And what is the proverbial symbolism of hot dogs and mules? That we still enjoy Ron Shelton's comedy about confidence-tricking sportsmen, scamming their way from one street game to the next, pays tribute to its lickety-split charm. This is The Hustler for basketballers. Snipes is the dancing, bouncing human spider who 'sets up' the victims; Harrelson is the seeming chump pulled off the street as his partner, in game after game, to fool initially derisive opponents. Trouble starts when our two heroes set out to fool each other, and when their womenfolk take dim views of their down-market lifestyles. Harrelson's girlfriend (Rosie Perez) is a Latino hoyden with a dentist's drill voice, yearning for glory on TV gameshows. Snipes' wife (Tyra Ferrell) is a social climber whose spouse keeps dragging her back to base camp. Shelton wrote and directed Bull Durham, which did for baseball what this does for basketball: treated it as a trial of machismo for overgrown kids, in which men fool about with notions of virility while women attend to the real business of life. Ms Perez puts the ball-playing ethos in context. 'Winning and losing is all one big organic globule from which you take what you want,' she ear-splittingly muses, shortly before her own winner-takes-all triumph on a TV quiz show. Ah, but who says characters must be consistent. Shelton's skill as a film-maker is to capture life messy and on the move. Edited with a feral grace by Paul Seydor, White Men Can't Jump never pauses even to ponder its wry message of racial togetherness. (Whites and blacks can be chums, especially when given a common enemy to fool.) Instead the film is as fast, buoyant and full of feinting rubato as basketball itself. * * * Two Shakespeare plays turn up in strange guise this week. Orson Welles' Othello has been restored and revived 40 years after its first release. A masterpiece for some, 'Citizen Coon' for others, it stars a black-faced Welles in the lead role, stomping with cast and crew from one ill-funded location to another. The film took three years to make and shuttled between Rome, Venice and Morocco. Whenever the director-star needed more money he dashed off to an acting assignment (The Third Man, The Black Rose) while his own players sat around in the sun, twiddling their Arden editions. The result? Count me in the masterpiece camp. And camp masterpiece is the phrase juste for this soaring essay in movie baroque. We begin with Eisensteinian crowd geometries in a lavish funeral procession; we take a pinch of German Expressionism for Iago's hate-twisted tirades in twisty streets; we invoke Sternberg's l'erotisme voile for bedroom scenes; and we plunder Citizen Kane itself for the crazed low angles craning from floor to ceilings. Here Welles has one of his great inspirations. In two scenes a large oval trap is opened in the roof, silhouetting the nobles against a scudding Tiepolo sky as they gaze down on the Moor's gathering madness. But then inspirations stumble over each other here like geese at feeding time. Rodrigo's murder is staged as a black farce in a bath-house (Welles had run out of costume money); the grief-stricken Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) walks away over a tiled floor patterned like teardrops; the captive Iago (superb Micheal Mac Liammoir) is hoisted in a cage up a terrifying castle wall; and everywhere the plastic lighting patterns light up the text, from the eerily lucent skyscapes to the shadows wild as Jackson Pollock paintings for Othello's spasms of jealousy. As You Like It is a tamer affair, even though director Christine Edzard (of Little Dorrit) has dared to set Shakespeare's pastoral comedy in a modern-day London. Fleeing the City's temples of finance, where their elders are brokers and bankers, Rosalind and Orlando (Emma Croft, Andrew Tiernan) meet and woo in a Thameside wasteground. Jacques is James Fox in a jumble-sale coat. Touchstone is Griff Rhys Jones with a rictus grin. And Orlando's love messages carved on trees become hip-hop graffiti sprayed on the river wall. It starts to work half an hour from the close. Here fog wreathes the characters in gentle fantasy and the words begin to charm. Before that we feel like victims of a mobile theatre experiment, moving our camp stools from one daft venue to the next as we follow a bunch of under-rehearsed actors belting it out into the void. But the rubbish of the week prize goes to Blue Ice. In this thrill-free spy thriller directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander) Michael Caine plays a retired MI5 agent now running a London jazz club. He doesn't know much about music but he knows what he dislikes ('Schoenberg always struck me as being a bit of a wanker'). So he falls for the cooing cadences of US Ambassador's wife Sean Young, who gets him knee-deep in an international arms plot. Struggling to stay alert through the two hours' traffic jam of contrivances, we are honked awake by sudden outbursts of bloodletting, bad acting and Bob Hoskins (in a short but meaningless cameo). Mr C himself contributes some sleepy-lidded charm and cockney rhyming slang. But all told, I'd rather fall down the apples and pears and break both daisy farms than sit through it all again.</p>

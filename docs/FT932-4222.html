			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Letter: In control of directors Sir, The proposal by Postel to vote against the re-election of directors who are on rolling service agreements longer than 12 months is welcome ('Pension fund move to limit directors' contracts', June 5). However, voting such directors off the board would itself be a breach of many service agreements, so triggering the excessive pay-offs Postel's move seeks to deter. Short of new legislation or stock exchange rules, shareholders should ensure company boards are made up of a majority of directors prepared to take shareholder opinion into account before such agreements are entered into.

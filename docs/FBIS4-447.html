			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 8 Apr (AFP)--The installations of a  private cellular telephone company, which has for many years  replaced Kinshasa's public communications system, was the target  of "sabotage" by an eight-man commando unit, according to  reliable sources in the Zairian capital.    The commando unit attacked TELECEL's antennae field, located  in central Kinshasa, and cut communication cables, rendering  stations inoperative. In a press release, the company said that  it would not be capable of providing service until further  notice. The "sabotage" came 24 hours after a meeting to discuss  frequency allocation between the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications and enterprises hoping to use the  telecommunications network.</p>

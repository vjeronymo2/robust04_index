			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Steel TURNOVER in British Steel rose to 18m shares, making it the day's most actively traded stock as it came under further pressure, easing 3 to 46 1/2 p, after analysts began downgrading profits estimates further following a visit to the company's Teesside plant this week. Continued weakness in steel prices, with little prospect of recovery in the short term, was blamed for the downgrades. Mr Ian Lowe at Smith New Court, a long-time bear, is now predicting a current year loss of between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m, against his previous estimate of a loss of Pounds 125m. Another analyst was moved to say: 'The visit just confirmed our worst fears.' The latest round of downgrades reflects increased worries about the dividend and there are now suggestions that the final dividend may once again be reduced, or even omitted altogether. A line of around 10m shares was said to have been on offer early in the session, but heavy turnover in the ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) early in the New York session suggested that this stock might have found a home. Wimpey gloom The gloom overhanging the building sectors deepened yesterday as BZW disclosed a downgrade of the entire building materials area, and George Wimpey, the housebuilder/contractor, confirmed the market's worst fears by halving its interim dividend. Wimpey shares, under continuous pressure since May this year, when they reached 188p, plummeted to 65p yesterday before stabilising to close at 71p, down 6p or almost 8 per cent on the day. Most building sector analysts had expected Wimpey to record a loss over the six months and to cut the dividend. But there was general unhappiness at what was viewed as a less than forthcoming post-results briefing by the company. Fisons retreats Troubled pharmaceuticals group Fisons was one of the most heavily traded stocks in London yesterday. The shares showed the biggest percentage fall in the FT-SE 100 Index on gloomy consideration of the group's first-half results. Fisons dropped quickly after the start of trading and was off more than 30p well before the market began to slide. It eventually stood a net 24 down at 150p after very heavy turnover of 16m shares. The headline profit figure was predicted to be bad and at Pounds 40.4m, against Pounds 95.2m last time, was around the high end of expectations. However, the company's meeting with analysts after the figures were announced proved disappointing and most people came away to cut their forecasts. Agency broker James Capel was near the bottom of the range with Pounds 100m for this year, and Capel analyst Mr Robin Gilbert said: 'It was abundantly clear that there was no immediate solution to production problems.' Hoare Govett was more optimistic, coming down from Pounds 140m to Pounds 125m for this year but still around the top of the range. Forecasts for 1993 were also lowered, with one house predicting that Fisons would only make Pounds 120m. The series of swingeing reductions in profits estimates in the building materials sector by BZW cut the ground from under the sector's leading stocks. Analysts at the investment bank said they had lowered estimates to accommodate a more bearish macro review of the ecocomy. BZW cut its current year forecasts by 20 per cent and those for the next year by 15 per cent. The reductions encompassed Redland, RMC, Blue Circle, Tarmac and Evered Bardon, while steep downgrades at the so-called 'light end' of the industry included Meyer and Travis Perkins. RMC and Redland dropped 20 apiece to 419p and 348p, Blue Circle 6 to 149p, Tarmac 3 to 56p, Meyer 10 to 188p and Travis 16 to 108p. The appalling Wimpey figures spooked Taylor Woodrow, the shares taking the wooden spoon as the market's worst performer, falling 14 per cent, or 7p, to 43p, the lowest level for more than a decade, ahead of today's interim numbers. These are expected to see the company cut or even eliminate the dividend and post losses of around Pounds 3m, compared with a Pounds 25m profit last year. Both classes of BT shares came under pressure as the market responded to suggestions that a leading UK broking house was preparing a sell note. However, there was no evidence of any new bearish circulars, and specialists said the stocks had been depressed by sporadic bouts of profit-taking, inspired by speculation about the timing of the sale of the UK government's remaining 22 per cent stake in BT, equivalent to around 1.3bn shares. Analysts expect the government to sell its remaining shares around the middle of next year. BT 'old' settled 11 off at 335p, while the 'new' fell 10 1/2 to 234p. Turnovers were relatively low at 4.2m and 2.5m shares respectively. CE Heath, recently highlighted as a strong buy by County NatWest, outpaced the rest of the insurance brokers, closing 14 higher at 253p. Legal &amp; General dipped 4 to 308p, with the market fretting about the possibility that the company will have to top up its provisions against domestic mortgage indemnity losses. Condom maker and photograph processor London International Group suffered from a savage forecast cut. The shares fell 12 to 161p as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew knocked its current year estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 38m. Glaxo failed to benefit from good news that came out of an Imigran conference in London yesterday and the shares dropped 14 to 750p. The news had already been discounted, although one analyst suggested that the market should now be on 'red alert' for approval of injectable Imigran in the US. Bank note printer De La Rue, which is expected to enter the FT-SE Index after trading ends today, weakened 24 to 541p. Hoare Govett turned slightly more cautious, although it believes the company is fundamentally solid and has maintained its Pounds 95m forecast for the current year. Talk that the company's broker had cut forecasts on Reed International prompted the shares to slip 10 to 501p. The prospect of a visit for brokers and institutional investors to ICI's paint works in Slough on Friday did nothing for the shares, which retreated 28 to 1062p. Conglomerate Hanson was heavily traded, losing 5 to 193p on 8.4m turnover. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (7).

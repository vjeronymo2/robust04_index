			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Indian rupee plunges amid talk of reform THE Indian rupee yesterday fell to an all-time low on the foreign exchange markets amid growing speculation that the government will announce this month further liberalisation of the currency. Bankers believe Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, will publish sweeping new measures in his budget speech, due to be presented to parliament on February 27. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has done nothing to curb speculation, which has grown in the last 10 days. Mr R Janakiraman, deputy governor, yesterday declined to comment on the rupee's value. However, dealers judged as significant the entry into the foreign exchange markets of state-owned oil companies, which had obtained foreign currency at preferential rates directly from the reserve bank. The Indian currency has fallen 6 per cent against the US dollar this month and it closed yesterday in Bombay at Rs33.44 to the dollar, its lowest ever. Mr S Ananthakrishnan, executive director of the foreign exchange dealers' association of India, said exporters had pulled out of the market in anticipation of being able to change their foreign currency at better rates in future, while importers were rushing to cover their requirements. The rupee was falling so rapidly the market was 'illiquid', said Mr Ananthakrishnan. The rupee exchange rate was fixed until 1991 when the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, introduced partial flotation in wide-ranging economic reforms. Exporters and others bringing foreign exchange into the country were permitted to exchange 60 per cent of their remittances at free market rates and the remaining 40 per cent at a fixed (low) rate of Rs26.20 to the dollar. Bankers in Bombay believe the government could now either abolish the fixed rate altogether or cut the 40 per cent requirement to 20 per cent or so. This would act as an extra incentive to exports, which the government would like to boost so as to aid economic growth. The problem is that, until now, the foreign currency bought at cheap rates by the reserve bank has been used by state-owned companies for the purchase of key imports, including arms and fertilisers, as well as oil. This has enabled the government to subsidise energy and fertiliser prices. A move to free the rupee further would therefore either force the government to cut subsidies or try to raise other funds from its meagre resources. Finance ministry officials decline to comment on the budget's contents, but it is widely expected in Delhi that there will be cuts in subsidies. The budget is also expected to contain substantial reductions in import tariffs, with the maximum normal rate of import duty coming down from 110 per cent, perhaps to 70 per cent.</p>

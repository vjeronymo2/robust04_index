			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Job creation rate disappoints government The government is disappointed with the rate of increase in employment in the UK, a confidential cabinet briefing note prepared by the Department of Employment shows. The document, written by Mr David Fenwick. the department's deputy head of statistics, for Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, says that the rate of increase is 'less than we had hoped'. The document gives no indication of what figure the government had been expecting. It notes that 'much of the growth is among the self-employed and part timers'. Only one in five leaving the unemployment claimant total go to a full-time job and two out of five into part-time work. The document warns that critics may 'concentrate on some particular groups and present a 'bad' employment picture . . .I would suggest a robust approach to counter this'. Mr Fenwick says Mr Hunt and his cabinet colleagues ought to stress that 'part-time jobs are not all low paid and they are popular. Only 14 per cent say they worked part time because no full-time job was available. To dismiss such jobs is an insult to an important part of the workforce'. He argues that the most favourable feature of the labour market is that fewer people are losing their jobs. He points out that 325,000 people joined the count in February, the lowest figure since October 1990, while redundancy figures were 250,000 for the September-November period of last year, compared with 310,000 for the same period of 1992. Mr Fenwick says a continuing fall in unemployment would reduce the fear of unemployment 'with possible beneficial effects on confidence'. He suggests that Mr Hunt should encourage his cabinet colleagues to be 'bullish on the labour market' and take every opportunity to expose the 'false accusations about our unemployment figures' from Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary. Mr Prescott said the document indicated that there were 'still forces in the government more concerned with manipulating the unemployment figures than making an honest recording of those out of work'.</p>

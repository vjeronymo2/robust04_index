			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`hal'-signed report: "DIHT Sees No Reason To Criticize </F> Net-Payer Position"]    [Text] Bonn 17 May -- Despite Germany's hefty payments to  the European Union [EU], German industry is profiting greatly  from the European single market. The German Federation of Trade  and Industry [DIHT] considers it necessary to indicate this fact  in good time before the European elections.    "The waves of criticism vis-a-vis Germany's net-payer  position should not go any higher," DIHT's Peter Korn told  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in Brussels, where he and fellow DIHT  employees presented a report entitled "Germany -- the Paymaster  of Europe?"    The occasion for this report was the Bundesbank's November  1993 monthly report, which had led people to believe that  Germany was at a disadvantage because it was making excessive  net payments to the EU. These net payments are the difference  between Germany's contributions to the EU budget and the  services that Germany has already derived from the EU. In 1992,  this net payment amounted to 22.1 billion German marks [DM].  However, for 30 years now, German enterprises have been reaping  greater advantages from European integration than the  enterprises of other countries because they have always  maintained close economic contacts with foreign enterprises,  said DIHT business manager Franz Schoser. He admitted that the  advantages of the European single market for the national  economies of EU member countries are relatively difficult to  document. "However, the mere continuation of the EU's growth in  the 1980's and 1990's serves to emphasize the stimulating  effects of this single market," he said.    In 1991, German payments to the EU budget rose by 46.7  percent against 1990 and amounted to DM33 billion. In 1992 they  rose by another 8.2 percent, reaching DM35 billion. The  Bundesbank criticized this increase because, in terms of the  ratio between the GNP and average purchasing power in the EU  countries, united Germany has dropped to sixth place in the  European prosperity league. In its report, the DIHT points out  that the EU Commission used to apply a different method of  reckoning, and used the ratio between per capita GNP expressed  in ECU's on the one hand, and market prices of commodities on  the other hand, as a basis for assessing prosperity. By this  method, postunification Germany was in third place, behind  Denmark and Luxembourg. Altogether, therefore, the German net  contribution to the EU suits Germany's size and economic  potential. In 1991, financial refluxes from Brussels back to  Germany were 28.4 percent less than in 1990 and amounted to DM14  billion; in 1992 they sank by 2.9 percent and amounted to DM13.6  billion. The DIHT has no criticism of the refluxes, but is  critical of the distortions caused by the agrarian portion of  the European budget. Thus, German agriculture has received 14.6  percent of the resources of the Agrarian Fund, while at the same  time German agriculture only takes up 1.1 percent of the German  GNP.    What is decisive is that Germany is the main beneficiary of  free trade within the EU. The DIHT welcomes the fact that in  the meantime, the EU has recognized the eastern laender as a  top-priority aid region, thanks to which between 1994 and 1999,  the eastern laender received DM27.6 billion out of the  Restructuring Fund.    The DIHT doubts whether Germany will be granted a rebate in  its payments to the EU, like Great Britain. A limited German  rebate would only be expedient as a temporary measure. The main  objective of European policy must be to bring about a change in  common agrarian policy and to render the new laender appropriate  assistance within the framework of regional policy.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Coffee price at five-year record Shoppers may face further coffee price rises because of a surge on the international market. A squeeze in supplies pushed prices up on the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. Prices on the July futures contract rose a further Dollars 17 a tonne to a five-year high of Dollars 1,700. The increase this week alone is Dollars 134 a tonne. The benchmark price has risen by more than 40 per cent or nearly Dollars 500 a tonne so far this year. 'Clearly manufacturers will be looking with interest to see what they can pass on, but there will be a certain amount of consumer resistance to another price rise,' one UK retailer commented. The recent rise in the coffee market follows five years of low prices after an agreement between producers and consumers to set price levels collapsed in 1989. Producer countries have been strapped for cash to invest in new crops with the result that output in countries such as Brazil and Colombia has dropped by a third this year. 'Overall, producers' revenues have halved to Dollars 5bn a year in the past five years and they cannot afford to fertilise their crops,' said Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombian coffee representative in London. Coffee processors insist that they try to keep supermarket prices stable rather than respond to market fluctuation. Nestle said its January increase was the first for four years and that a 100 gram jar of Nescafe was 4p cheaper than five years ago.</p>

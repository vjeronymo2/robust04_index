			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOST PLUTONIUM COULD BUILD 7 BOMBS, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> Enough plutonium to build seven nuclear bombs has escaped into the air ducts of  the federal government's Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility here over the  last 38 years, federal officials said.  </P> <P> The 62 pounds of plutonium is spread throughout 6,000 feet of air ducts and  "does not pose a health risk to workers at the plant or to public health," said  Pat Etchart, a spokesman for the Department of Energy.  </P> <P> Etchart said Thursday that the plutonium in the ducts is less than might be  expected after 30 years of operations at the plant.  </P> <P> But critics of the troubled plant, which was raided in June by FBI agents  investigating possible environmental crimes, said the discovery raises even  more serious questions about the plant's operation.  </P> <P> "This is very serious when you consider that people in the nuclear weapons  business are concerned when grams of this stuff turn up missing," said Jim  Werner, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It also raises  serious questions about the accountability of the people in control."  </P> <P> The discovery contrasted sharply with an earlier estimate that from 10 to 33  pounds of plutonium had escaped into the ducts from "glove boxes" used to  shield plant workers handling radioactive material.  </P> <P> The lower estimate was made by a special team of investigators formed after the  FBI raid, which determined that workers had for years unclogged "prefilters" in  the glove boxes by punching holes in them with screwdrivers, federal officials  said.  </P> <P> Plutonium operations at the plant, which makes triggers for hydrogen bombs,  were halted in November until a contractor in charge of the facility can ensure  that safety concerns are met. The plutonium operations are expected to be  resumed this summer, federal officials said.  </P> <P> Times researcher Ann Rovin contributed to this story.  </P></p>

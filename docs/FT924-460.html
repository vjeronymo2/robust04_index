			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / How to Spend it: Scenting success in the gift stakes - Which of the profusion of after-shaves and toilet waters match those very individual men in your life? Lucia van der Post gives her guide ONCE UPON a time, when Henry Cooper was busy splashing it about on page and screen, Old Spice and Brut were about as exotic as men's fragrances ever got. With today's varied choice, modern man faces almost as grave an identity crisis as his female companion. Should he be a dynamic go-getter or quietly traditional? Should he be gentle, caring, '90s man-about-town or a country-lover at heart? Take pity on him. Help him out. Decide for him. It is, after all, Christmas Eve. And you still have not found anything for him. Like many others before you, you head for the eau-de-toilette and the after-shave. The desire to smell sweet and fragrant is not an exclusively female whim - even the most emphatically masculine of chaps tends these days to have a little hoard of lotions and potions that he dots and dabs about his person. There they lie, rows and rows of them on the glittering counters of our most glamorous stores and our most humble chains - alluring in their promise, overwhelming in their profusion, contradictory in their messages. In one of those packages lies perfect lotion for him. But which is to be? If you know he has a favourite, all is simple - buy him the biggest flagon you can afford. If in doubt, keep it subtle, mysterious, low-key. So here, for those still with presents left to buy, is a last-minute guide to which fragrance to give to whom. He is tall and dark and a bit of a rogue. He drives a Porsche and eats at San Lorenzo. His sport is polo, his drink champagne and his favourite accessory is a long-limbed blonde. He is a bit of a show-off so make him feel dashing and jet-set, international and swashbuckling and give him Pasha de Cartier. He will not be ashamed to display its gleaming silver and gold container on the bathroom shelf and it smells very dashing to boot. Pounds 49 for 100 ml spray. He is a man of the '90s - gentle, caring, and, if the truth be told, a little bit soppy. He dresses at The Gap, does his stint at the supermarket, cycles to work and his favourite holiday is walking in the Lake District. Ralph Lauren's new Polo Crest is just the thing - light, citrussy, natural, Pounds 36 for 100 mls. Or think about Armani Homme (Pounds 36) or Dunhill (Pounds 32). He is your favourite great-uncle and one of the old school. He lives in the country in a large but dilapidated house with lots and lots of land. His deepest affections are reserved for his garden, his gun-dog and his cellar. He only comes up to London for essential visits to his doctor, his solicitor, his barber and his tailor. It is much too late in the day to teach an old dog new tricks. Give him something deeply reassuring. Anything from Geo F. Trumper, 9 Curzon Street, London W1 but possibly he would like the classic Extract of Limes (Pounds 12.80 for 100 mls) best of all. If you cannot get to Trumper, then consider Floris, also a name with substance and a reassuring tradition behind it. Nothing new-fangled and fancy there. Give him the most classic of all - No. 89 at Pounds 22.25 for 100 mls. He is awfully big in the City and nothing but the best will do. Most weekday lunchtimes find him at his regular table at The Connaught or The Savoy. Weekdays are spent in town but Friday afternoons find him heading for his manor house in Wiltshire. He likes nothing too loud, too obvious or too avant-garde. Monsieur de Givenchy is discreet, refined and distinguished. Just what our City friend would like, Pounds 19.25 for 60 mls. Another grand old name to look out for is Chanel pour Monsieur at Pounds 31 for 100 mls or, from the Penhaligon's, there is Blenheim Bouquet (Pounds 24 for 50 mls). He is creative director of his own advertising company. He has a cool, white flat in Docklands, wears Hugo Boss but also knows that a pair of Levi's and an understated leather jacket will take him anywhere. He drives a Porsche 911, a Range Rover or, if he can run to it, an old classic, a Bentley for preference. More than anybody he is conscious that everything - from his tie to his after-shave - carries a message. When it comes to after-shave or eau-de-toilette, he displays a surprisingly conservative streak - everything olde and English is so a la mode. You would never, ever, scent him before you see him. No. 88 from Czech &amp; Speake (125 Fulham Road, London SW3, 10, Tunsgate, Guildford, Harrods, Selfridges and The Conran Shop, Pounds 36) is just the kind of classy, understated smell he likes. He is Graphic Man. He lives in a penthouse in Docklands. He is out of his matt-black phase (so '80s) and his flat is now all cool, airy and white with lots of rattan and strangely curved wrought-iron. Comfort does not, it seems, come first. He eats at The Blueprint cafe, his glasses are scaled-down tortoiseshell - very National Health to look at, very un-National Health price tag. He is addicted to that 'just-run-over-by-a-bus' look. He wears button-down shirts and no tie, baggy trousers and jackets that are at least two sizes too big. He never goes anywhere without his state-of-the-art briefcase and his disposable pen. No contest - Romeo by Romeo Gigli, this year's 'must have' designer fragrance. It is not just the bottle - smooth, cool, with its oh-so-original beer-bottle top opening - he actually likes the spicy, cinnamon smell. At Pounds 32.50 for 100 mls. He is healthy and hearty and tanned. He works out every day and plays squash at weekends. He shops at Blazer, holidays in Greece (all those water sports), drops into his local pub on Friday nights and drives a Golf GTI. When it comes to girlfriends, he likes to have more than one on the go. Nothing too fragrant, too floral or too heavy for our sporty outdoor type. There are lots of brands aimed obviously at the sportsman  - surprise him, give him Davidoff's Cool Water at Pounds 36 for 100 mls. He is a bit of a young fogey. He wears his father's old Jermyn Street suits or he shops at Hackett where he goes for the newly-fashionable, fusty, tweedy look and comfortingly hairy suits remind him that there are a few unchanging things in this uncertain world. He likes roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and comforting nosh that reminds him of school. He likes to eat at his club and is deeply convinced of the superiority of country life to town. His girlfriends wear sweet little shirts with frilled collars, long brushed cotton skirts, Alice bands and pumps. They are very, very nice, and so is he. As Hackett is his spiritual home (their store is at 137-138 Sloane Street, London SW1), you could always give him one of their straight classy potions. If you fancy a designer name, give him Aramis Classic and you cannot go wrong. (Pounds 30). He is in his early forties, he is your husband and you love him dearly. These days, he is looking a little tired and grey around the temples (even the most solid of professions are proving less than solid these days) but, though he may never set the world alight, he is always there when you need him. For treats, he loves opera or an evening at the National and at weekends nothing better than a good book at his own fireside. A new name from a classic house should do him proud - Guerlain's Heritage (Pounds 19.50 for a 50ml spray) is just the thing. Armani Homme or Givenchy Gentlemen would suit him, too. All the fragrances except for those from Czech &amp; Speake, Floris, Geo F. Trumper and Penhaligon's are available from Harvey Nichols and other big department stores.</p>

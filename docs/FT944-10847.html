			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / First works council formed United Biscuits yesterday became the first British company to establish a European works council, Richard Donkin writes. The voluntary agreement with UK and European unions is the first of what are expected to be a number of such agreements involving UK multinational companies in spite of the British government's opt-out from the European Works Council directive. United Biscuits said yesterday that the works council, which it was calling a European information and consultative council, made sound business sense. It said that leaving out its British employees, which it would be entitled to do under the opt-out conditions after the directive is ratified, would be 'counter-productive' for the business.</p>

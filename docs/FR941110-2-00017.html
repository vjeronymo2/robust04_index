			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with Timken. Section 778(a) of the Tariff Act provides that interest shall be payable only on overpayments and underpayments of ``amounts deposited.'' The CIT held in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timken Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 777 F.Supp. 20 (1991), that the words ``amounts deposited'' refer only to cash deposits of estimated antidumping duties upon entry, and not to other kinds of security, such as a bond. In considering Timken's appeal, the Federal Circuit held that ``the requirement to make cash deposits of estimated duties, under the duty order, triggers the interest provision. Without the duty order, the importer has no obligation to pay interest. The Court of International Trade did not err in upholding ITA's determination that NSK and Koyo Seiko are not liable for interest *&blank;*&blank;*'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timken Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Fed. Cir. No. 93&hyph;1312, &hyph;1455 (Fed. Cir., September 27, 1994)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proceeding concerns a 1976 finding, in which the statute required bonds, not cash deposits. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (the 1979 Act) did not allow the collection (or payment) of interest where the entry of merchandise was permitted under bond rather than by the cash deposit of estimated dumping duties. Further, the 1979 Act contained no provision for the conversion from bonds to cash deposits for existing antidumping findings, except through the administrative review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, because we required cash deposits for the first time on entries of merchandise manufactured by Koyo and NSK on June 1, 1990, interest will only be collected or refunded on under- or overpayments of cash deposits on entries after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken states that in its submission of October 8, 1991, it requested that the Department convert existing bonds, posted by Koyo and NSK as security for antidumping duties, to cash deposits. Since the Department has never formally responded to its request, Timken is renewing that request in its case brief for these administrative reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken maintains that the role of Customs in matters pertaining to antidumping duties is purely ``ministerial,'' requiring Customs to implement the instructions of the Department to the extent those instructions are not inconsistent with Customs regulations, citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diversified Products Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 6 CIT 155, 572 F.Supp. 883 (1983). According to Timken, the Department, therefore, has the authority to require Customs to collect cash deposits at this time, even if such deposits are nominal in amount. Timken argues that the conversion of existing bonds to cash deposits would permit the Department to collect interest on under-deposits of antidumping duties as required by section 778(a) of the Tariff Act. Timken contends that the Department should recognize that this proceeding is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sui generis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , at least with respect to Koyo and NSK, since the Department published a decision that cash deposits would be imposed on entries subject to existing findings as of the date of completion of the first administrative review (45 FR 1084, January 4, 1980). Timken points out that Koyo and NSK posted bonds for all of their entries during each of the PORs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Timken notes that the Department's ruling with respect to interest on Koyo and NSK entries was issued in June 1990 and is still pending before the Federal Circuit. Based on this experience, Timken states that it may take four years or more before assessment occurs. In order to safeguard the revenue during the inevitable appeals of the final results of these reviews, Timken urges the Department to require conversion of bonds to cash deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK argues that the Department has consistently followed its policy of not requiring cash deposits on entries covered by pre-1980 findings until the first administrative review has been completed under section 751 of the Tariff Act. NSK contends that Timken has cited no authority to suggest that the Department's practice is contrary to law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo counters that neither the Department nor the Customs Service possesses any authority to require the posting of cash deposits retroactively. Koyo remarks, citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Customs Service, HQ 222367  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (December 28, 1990), that the Customs Service has no authority to require posting of cash deposits on entries that have been entered and accepted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1980, the Department of the Treasury published a notice (45 FR 1084, 1980) stating that the 1979 Act contained no provision for the immediate conversion of existing antidumping findings from bonds to cash. Section 106(a) of the 1979 Act merely provides that outstanding antidumping findings would remain in effect and would be subject to review under section 751 of the Tariff Act. Section 751(a)(2) of the Tariff Act provides that the administrative review ``shall be the basis for *&blank;*&blank;* deposits of estimated duties.'' Thus, the legal basis for requiring cash deposits under the 1979 Act is a review under section 751 of the Tariff Act or an order pursuant to section 736 of the Tariff Act. Because this case is not governed by an order, the Department is without power to require the imposition of a cash deposit until the completion of an administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under U.S. law, where an affirmative dumping finding has been made, security must be provided upon entry of the merchandise into the country, and if the form of security is cash deposits, it must be paid no later than 30 days after entry (19 U.S.C. section 1505). Because the merchandise in question has already entered the country, the form of security cannot be changed retroactively. Similarly, since interest is only collectible on cash deposits pursuant to sections 737 and 778 of the Tariff Act, interest would accrue only from the time that the Department required a cash deposit and would not be retroactive to the time of entry under bond. The Department has followed this practice consistently and will continue to follow it for merchandise already entered into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

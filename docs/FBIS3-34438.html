The  Majles held an open session last Sunday, and deputies of  Shahreza, Mashhad, Maragheh, and Shabestar made speeches. Then  Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri made a speech about the birthdays of  his holiness 'Ali and his holiness Jesus, and then the Majles  went into session.    Then the credentials of Mr. Mofattah from Razan were  examined  and ratified. We to call your attention the details of the  discussions.  <H5>  Statements of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>   In his speech, Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of  the  Majles, offered his congratulations on the birthday of his  holiness, Jesus Christ, and asked all the Christians of the  world not to allow during these days the massacre of Muslims  such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the hand of false followers  of his holiness in the Christian world, contrary to the lofty  ideas of that divine prophet who was a prophet of justice and  humanity.    He added: In the Christian world especially, why do the  spiritual leaders of Christianity keep silent with regard to  such crimes in the world and pass over such horrible crimes with  indifference? Would Christ pass over so many crimes with  indifference if he were here?    In another part of his speech, the speaker of the Majles  offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali  to all the Shi'ites in the world and said: Rajab 13 is the  birthday of a revered human being who does not accept being a  caliph because he seeks justice and finally, if he accepts the  leadership of the Islamic nation, again it is because he seeks  justice. [sentence as published]    Pointing out that the pious offspring of the Commander of  the  Faithful in the policies of the Second Five-Year Plan that he  outlined follows the same goals (social justice) he said: It is  the same social justice [which he shows] in the general policies  that the grand leader of the revolution stated. We thank God  that if we were not fortunate to live at the time of his  holiness 'Ali, we live in the time of his pious offspring and  leader of the revolution, who thinks like him and defends the  suffering of history, and that we are in a Majles, which is the  manifestation of 'Ali's justice.    He expressed hope that we will take steps to implement  social  justice and support for the oppressed, especially in examining  the budget and the Second Five-Year Plan, which will soon start.  Also, in our speech, behavior, and speeches from our podium, in  our positions and in our meetings, we should observe justice and  human rights and try to make the Majles a manifestation of  'Ali's justice in the true sense of the word.    In conclusion, he offered his congratulations on the  birthday  of his holiness 'Ali to the [social] workers.  <H5>  Seyyed Mojtaba Hashemi, Deputy From Shahreza </H5>   In our country, most government subsidies are for  imported items.    The first pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the  Majles on Sunday was Mr. Hashemi, the deputy from Shahreza, who  offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali  and said: Reaching the stage of social justice for which the  true owners of the revolution are hungry and seeing their wishes  in the words of the grand leader, especially the lines of the  economic, cultural, and social policies of the Second Plan,  makes careful examination and thinking about the developmental  standards of the Second Plan of the regime a certainty.    The experience of developed countries can to some extent  draw  the curve and stages of development for us.    In continuation, he considered one of the most important  characteristics of the Development Plan the setting of the  financial and monetary framework of the regime and said:  Determining this axis is in the area of foreign borrowing,  raising the issue of privatization, controlling imports,  creating a proper tax system, and expansinf exports. If it is  uncoordinated with the financial system of the national economy,  it will act as a double-edged sword. Using the experiences of  developing countries and examining the causes of failure of many  of the Latin American countries and the factor of success in the  developing countries have made use of foreign borrowing  resources. [sentence as published] The use of such resources is  pursued with conditions, of which the most major expressed by  the lending establishments and countries are the free commercial  and economic markets of the borrowing country and securing  democracy. Political freedom is for creating a free commercial  system. On this basis, multinational companies that themselves  have taken advantage of these funds under very simple conditions  in raising this complex phenomenon, under the pretext of  attracting investments in the developing countries, procure all  their financial needs through the banking systems of the country  in debt along with the clear difference in foreign currency in  the region. [sentence as published] On the other hand, the  interests from the activities of the so-called foreign  investments within the framework of the progress of banks and  financial establishments causes the free exit of large amounts  gained every year through this system. In this manner, we see  that the so-called developed countries of Latin America have  about $400 billion in foreign debt today, whose annual interest  is about $40 billion annually. Hence, we see that the transfer  and escape of capital from these countries every year is about  $35 billion, whereas in the Pacific region countries, we see  that by creating an orderly banking system and using all banking  and monetary resources and ultimately severely controling  imports, large amounts of capital, especially in industrial  production and commerce, are employed. These financial resources  are mainly provided domestically and prepared from the savings  of the people in a suitable environment towards a philosophy of  export investment.    The deputy from Shahreza continued: The consumer model in  these countries (the Pacific region) is strongly controlled.  What we lack, despite the directions of the First Plan, are the  necessary restrictions on the import of luxury items and the  prevention of the capital outflow are handled with care in order  that the use of these resources achieve development. Hence,  absolute government power over the above-mentioned pivotal  points, as the main driving force along with necessary controls,  is one of the special priorities of a development program.    He added: A high percentage of these debts are paid under  transferring technology and creating coordination and  improvement of the monetary system to the borrowing countries.  For example, in 1987, Argentina allotted $400 million of the  loans it received to equip and revise its monetary system and  computerize its Central Bank.    The largest portion of these loans ultimately is used to  repay past loans. The creation of uncontrolled inflation due to  the increase in the rate of foreign currency and the devaluation  of domestic currency, failure to pay the interest on loans and  to pay debts or delays result in the escape of capital and under  special conditions when economic growth requires investment, it  will cause foreign banks to increase their interest rates.    In conclusion, the speaker said: Protective policies of the  lending companies, establishment of heavy taxes on the products  of developing countries, and other protective measures prevent  offerings and competition by developing countries. In our  country, most government subsidies are allocated to import  items. The question is, has foreign aid been effective in  economic development?  <H5>  Hoseyn Fattahi-Ma'sum, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>   The next speaker was Fattahi, the deputy from Mashhad, who  offered his congratulations on the blessed birthdays of his  holiness 'Ali and his holiness Christ and, honoring Agricultural  Development Week, said: Today, with the problem that so-called  civilized humanity is facing and also the problems facing our  Islamic country due to the cruel policies of global oppressors,  having a model and example for the perpetuation of government  and the life of people is very important and essential. The  human-creating school of Islam, due to its ideological content,  has offered clear methods and models in its practical dimensions  as well.    He added: These questions are at issue before all the  officials and people. If we claim to be Shi'ites and followers  of 'Ali, like Osman ebn Hanif who was a friend of the Imam, are  we not the target of the Imam's words and reprimands? Why do you  have aristocratic banquets and sit at the glittering tables of  aristocracy? If we truly consider ourselves the followers of  Imam 'Ali and followers of religious guardianship, let us show  with our sincere actions and with a national and general will,  as was the view of our sire, 'Ali, and the statements of the  grand leader, which have been all but forgotten, that we will  avoid luxuries, waste, festivals, aristocratic ceremonies,  experience seminars, and unnecessary travels abroad, and in  keeping with the method and ways of being a Shi'ite of 'Ali  implement simple living in all the offices, ministries,  institutions, organizations, and everywhere in the country.    Dr. Fattahi then continued: If the Islamic Republic of Iran  today cannot free itself through a general mobilization from the  claws of domestic and foreign problems, can it claim that it has  truly acted for the goals of Islam and followed 'Ali?    Why is it that with an annual foreign currency income of  more  than $16 billion it is unable to pay its debts on time? What  factor has caused society to be lead on this course?    Of course, the fundamental essential investments and the  efforts of the revered government officials and the president  following the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, which  was successful, must be remembered. Is the way to be free of  these economic problems to move towards more borrowing and the  creation of new obligations, or is it in preventing the futile  waste of the foreign currency revenues on unnecessary projects  and programs and avoiding various excesses of the organizations  and institutions that require government foreign currency and  the uncontrolled sale of foreign currency to the people?    Requesting that the officials supervise the uncontrolled  import of goods, he also asked all the officials who somehow are  responsible for supervising the current affairs of the country  to increase their investigation and supervision and deal  decisively, like 'Ali, with the violators, economic terrorists,  embezzlers, and bribery gangs.    He added: On the one hand, I request that the economic  planners of the country devise their course of action on the  path of raising production and revenues and conserving  expenditures and avoiding excessive waste in the offices. They  should not think that by raising prices and putting pressure on  the shoulders of the oppressed and downtrodden classes in  society we can follow the correct economic path. Has anyone  thought about who must tolerate all this economic pressure? Will  the increase in the cash flow of the ministries and companies  not be followed by excessive expenditures and waste?    Will this method not cause a small number to become rich and  a large number of low-income people to be harmed more than ever  before?    Continuing, Dr. Fattahi pointed out the issue of  self-management and the bill of general insurance, which is the  basis of the Plan: The spirit and basis of this bill was the  transfer and sale of nonteaching government hospitals to the  private sector or insurance companies, and the teaching  hospitals must be self-sufficient, as stated in Note 10 of the  budget bill.    The question is, is insuring people and providing general  insurance only possible through the sale of hospitals to the  private sector or collecting heavy treatment expenditures from  people in the educational hospitals?    The deputy of Mashhad then, in regarding the issue of oil,  referred to the policies set by the grand leader and, addressing  the related officials, said: Why do you not revise oil policies  in order to eliminate dependence of this important industry on  Western countries? Why should OPEC headquarters be in Austria?  Why should we not try, as a revolutionary country with the help  of other oil rich countries that are mostly in the Middle East,  to foloow the idea of the leader of the revolution and think  about honor and dignity through oil in the world?  <H5>  Mostafa Seyyed Hashemi, Deputy From Maragheh </H5>   When the response to the Majles deputies is issued  after one year by the ministries, how do they deal with the  letters and requests of ordinary people?    The third speaker was Hashemi, from Maragheh, who offered  his  congratulations on the birthday of the Commander of the Faithful  and said: Our people know that the Islamic revolution of Iran  has central and fundamental principles, which are molded with  the blood of the nation and have forever drawn the perspective  of domestic and foreign policy. This revolutionary and political  enthusiasm has been manifested in the slogans of independence,  freedom, and Islamic Republic. He then continued: We must know  that the struggle of the Iranian people against the United  States is not a slogan struggle, but our struggle is a Koranic  and principled struggle that has ideological roots.    The government must think about the unhealthy economic  relations, discrimination, poverty and unemployment,  bureaucracy, law breaking, creating jobs that are among the  effective factors in poverty and deprivation, addiction to  narcotics, smuggling, migration, decrease in agriculutural  production, and growth of false jobs. It must take steps in the  area of jobs and job opportunities for unemployed youth who are  at a critical age. For this purpose, the ground for investments  in industry and production must be prepared. Both in theory and  practice, we must think about education and the universities of  the country that are a fundamental and rooted principle for the  training of expert manpower. It should not be that our  high-school and college graduates do not benefit from scientific  learning and use of individual and social life without being  armed by any kind of skill, merely pursuing an education to  receive a degree. [sentence as published] In continuation, the  speaker criticized the system of bureaucracy left over from the  monarchical regime and said: We have a system of a Ministry of  Agriculture, Ministry of Construction Jihad, environmental  health, welfare, the Imam's Emergency Committee, and Ministry of  Post with 5,000 postal workers. [sentence as published] And we  have a parallel to the Ministry of Post in other organizations  with several times the above-mentioned people. Today, science  and 14 years of experience tell us that any parallel system, in  fact, rather than having a positive effect has a destructive  effect. Mr. President, the people are happy with the changes you  made in bureaucracy in terms of the issuance of passports,  drivers' licenses, birth certificates, etc. These steps were  necessary but not sufficient. When the response to the honorable  deputies of the Majles is issued by ministries after more than  one year, how are the letters and requests of ordinary people  dealt with?    He then said: You (president) know better than anyone that  administrative change must be at the top of the agenda and  programs of the government. The unprincipled behavior of some of  the organizations with clients must be investigated. As God is  my witness, if this continues, the people may get tired. We must  not stall the people. I swear to God, the people are noble.    In conclusion, he made reminders to the minister of roads  and  transport concerning the establishment of flights to Sahand  Airport, preparing division plans, and expediting people's  building permits to the Ministry of Housing.  <H5>  Hasan Aminlu, Deputy From Shabestar </H5>   Hasan Aminlu from Shabestar, as the last pre-agenda speaker,  offered his congratulations to the social workers of the country  and said: The Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] budget were presented to the Majles late.  This budget, which was supposed to be presented to the Majles on  15 Azar [6 December], was completed after a 15-day delay. A  cursory study of the above-mentioned budget shows problems and  weaknesses, and it is noteworthy that certainly on the days that  we shall have a discussion of the budget, we shall deal with the  details. Referring to Notes 25 and 29 of the 1373 budget, he  said: A cursory study of the chapters concerning social affairs  clearly reveals that divisions are not balanced. In this year's  budget, in social affairs, we had a growth of 22 percent. This  increase, when divided among various chapters, is unbalanced.    He continued: Of this 22 percent, 66 percent is allocated to  social security and welfare, 48 percent to training and affairs  of the youth, 41 percent to culture and art, 26 percent to  higher education, 25 percent to education, 24 percent to urban  development, 24 percent to the environment, 13 percent to rural  development and 12 percent to health and treatment [percentages  as published]. The least growth that exists in the 1373  developmental budget is the budget for health and treatment.    Aminlu then referred to the deputies' reminders to the  health  and treatment sectors and pointed out: With the ratifications of  the budget, when it is too late, reminders do not mean anything  anymore. If the deputies want to create just distribution in  these sectors so that later it would not be necessary to make  reminders, they must look at it when writing the budget.    Thirty percent of the budget growth of health and treatment,  if we take into consideration 22 percent inflation, means a  19-percent decrease in the growth in this sector. Hence, next  year in the developmental chapter, in our health and treatment  section, I warn you right now, we shall have an absolute  stoppage.  <H5>  Ratifications </H5>   The first item on the agenda of the open session of the  Majles on Sunday was examinating the credentials of Mohammad  Mehdi Mofattah from Razan.    First the report of the Investigation Committee concerning  his credentials was read as follows:    The election file of Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah from Razan,  which was referred to the Investigation Committee due to the  objection by Mr. Naqba'i, was examined in numerous sessions and  now the report is presented to the Majles. Based on the final  minutes of the lieutenant governor's office of Razan, the  election were held on 29/05/1372 [19 June 1993] with the  formation of 165 registration centers. The total votes were  29,762: of that Seyyed Abolqasem Hasani-Tabataba'i had 15,221  votes; and Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah, 14,183 votes. [figures  as published] As a result of eight objections made to the  Executive Committee and their being sent to the above-mentioned  Council of Guardians, on two occasions representatives were sent  to Razan electoral region, and a number of ballot boxes were  invalidated. As a result, Mr. Tabataba'i's votes decreased to  12,954. Hence, Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah, with 14,155 votes,  gained the majority of votes and was introduced to the Majles as  a Majles deputy. Due to Mr. Naqba'i's objection in the Majles,  the above-mentioned case was sent to the Investigation  Committee. After listening to the statements of Mr. Naqba'i and  also the reasons of the member of the Council of Guardians, the  committee sent a three-member delegation to Razan. The  above-mentioned delegation, after contacting the officials of  the election regions, the people of those areas, and also the  dispatched representative of the Council of Guardians, submitted  a detailed report to the committee. The Investigation Committee,  after hearing the delegation's report regarding the most  important objection of Mr. Naqba'i concerning the invalidation  of six ballot boxes, based on Article 20 of the law of the  supervision of the Council of Guardians over Majles elections,  considered the opinion of the Council of Guardians regardings  the invalidation of ballot boxes as the final opinion and the  matter was closed by them.    In other instances of the objections by Mr. Naqba'i, the  opinion of the committee is as follows: In Paragraphs 1 and 6,  the rejection of the competence of the candidates is determined  by the Council of Guardians. In regards to Paragraph 2, support  of executive elements for the elected candidate was not proved.  In regards to Paragraph 3, the participation of well-known  people in the campaign and the use of well-known figures, if  true, is not prohibited by law. In regards to Paragraph 4, there  are generalizations that have not been proved. And in regards to  Paragraph 7, the ballot boxes have generally been examined and  no violations observed.    It should be pointed out that there is no protest concerning  the competence of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah. Finally, the  committee, after hearing the statements of Mr. Mofattah and  holding six sessions, voted by secret ballot and announced the  following results:    Total votes, 11; supporting, 9; opposing, 1; abstentions, 1.  Hence, the credentials of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah were  ratified.    Then Naqba'i defended his objections and expressed his  objection regarding the credentials of the deputy from Razan.  Then Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah defended his credentials, which  were ratified by the Investigation Committee, and considered Mr.  Naqba'i's protest baseless.    It is interesting that then Mr. Mohassel-Hamadani defended  the credentials of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah and rejected the  objection of Mr. Naqba'i concerning the procedure of the  elections in Razan. Then his credentials were put to a vote and  ratified with 121 supporting votes by the Majles.    The next item on the agenda was the proposal to extend the  content of the law of landlords and tenants to the offices of  physicians that was returned from the Council of Guardians,  which was amended in the open session of the Majles on Sunday.    According to this amendment, two notes were attached to  Article 2 of the law of the relations of landlords and tenants  ratified in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984].    In Note 1, the collection of any sort of fee under the  heading of lock money in the rented offices and transfer of the  physician offices to others, if not mentioned in the text of  agreement between landlord and tenant, is prohibited.    Also, the use of residential places in places that in the  landlord and tenant agreement it is not stated to be used as a  physician's office is prohibited without the consent of the  owner.    Also in this session, the proposal exempting the  ratifications concerning the internal bylaws of the Majles from  the content of Article 2 of the civil law as very urgent was  presented to the Majles and its urgency was ratified.    It is interesting that according to the article of the civil  law, the law must be implemented 15 days after it is published  throughout the country. The next item on the agenda of the open  session of the Majles on Sunday was the proposal to amend Note 1  of the law of the employment status of the martyred,  self-sacrificing, and freed prisoners of war employees ratified  on 16/06/1372 [17 August 1993]. First, its very urgent status  was put to a vote. Prior to that, Mr. Gharibani, the deputy from  Ardabil, said: This proposal on the employment status of the  employees of the martyrs families was presented to the Majles  with more than 80 signatures. Our opinion is that this very  urgent proposal be ratified prior to the discussion of the  budget in the Majles, because if after the ratification of the  budget there is a financial burden, the gentlemen will not  succeed. Then, the very urgent status was put to a vote and not  ratified. Then an urgent status of the proposal was put to a  vote and ratified by the Majles.    The next proposal was the urgent amendment of Articles 16  and  20 of the law of documents and property records, which was  ratified by the deputies. It is noteworthy that Articles 16 and  12 concerning the period of protest in regards to property to be  registered, claims related to the protest to the boundaries of  the property requested for registration, protests by neighbors,  number of times of protest, the situation of protests after  notification, and the period..., respectively.  <H5>  On the Margins of the Majles </H5> <H5>  Bylaws Reminder of Mr. Hazrati, Deputy From Rasht </H5>   Mr. Hazrati, in the early moments of the open session on  Sunday, referring to Article 147 of the internal bylaws, made a  bylaws reminder and said: My question to the honorable minister  of interior was supposed to be discussed today in the open  session, and it was said that he was on a trip and whenever he  is free he is supposed to act on these bylaws. Mr. Nateq-Nuri  said: The day that the president spoke about the plan in the  Majles, your question was on the agenda of the Majles. But his  speech was long and you agreed that the Majles was tired. Today,  also, we had put it on the agenda of the Majles, but it was  reported that he is accompanying the president on a trip, and we  will certainly put it on the agenda for Tuesday.  <H5>  Bylaws Reminder of Mr. Noruzi </H5>   Engineer Noruzi, in a bylaws reminder concerning his  question  to the minister of industries, said: Since Azar [22 November-21  December], almost simultaneous with the question of Mr. Hazrati,  I posed a question. It was also published, but was not put on  the agenda. Now, in regards to Mr. Hazrati, due to the absence  of the minister of interior, there was no opportunity. But my  question has not been published in the weekly agenda, either.    The speaker of the Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, said in this  regard: According to the new bylaws, a question that is given to  me is given to the committee. The committee invites your honor  to speak there. The procedure that was acted on on the basis of  the decree of the Imam was made into a bylaw. After examination  in the committee it will be given to us. Now, we will  investigate to see whether or not the committee has pursued the  matter.</p>

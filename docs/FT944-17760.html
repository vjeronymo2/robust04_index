			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (1): High finance and independence - This diminutive country has never had it so good. But its wealth is the source of its biggest problems The tiny principality of Liechtenstein, wedged between Austria and Switzerland in the upper Rhine valley, must rank as one of the earth's most successful societies, writes Ian Rodger. Prosperity is high, unemployment is virtually non existent, the economy is well balanced between highly productive secondary and tertiary sectors and modern social problems are almost unknown. Indeed, the principality provides a case study of the economic virtuous circle taken to an extreme. Low taxation has attracted ever more investment in manufacturing industry and ever more business for Liechtenstein's trustee-lawyers who set up tax avoiding schemes for the world's rich. And their growth and productivity have prevented any need for tax increases for a long time. Individuals pay 8 to 10 per cent tax on their incomes, active companies 6 to 18 per cent on their profits. Neighbouring countries may complain that the principality's low taxes constitute an unfair competitive advantage, but the public sector is awash with money and would not know what to do with more of it. The national government has budget surpluses as a matter of course. The town of Vaduz, the capital, makes more money from investing its financial reserves than it does from taxes. The key to this paradise-like state, apart from reasonably good management, is Liechtenstein's Lilliputian size. With an area of only 160 square kilometres and a population of only 30,000, it does not have to grapple with the costs or complexities of big regional or income disparities. And the demands placed upon it by the international community are modest. The problems Liechtenstein faces are nearly unique - how to preserve its blessed state in the face of increasing integration in Europe, how to accommodate further economic expansion and how to prevent its democracy from being corrupted by a small but super rich elite of trustee-lawyers, bankers and industrialists. The biggest problem facing all Liechtenstein industry and commerce is manpower. The principality's economic structure has long since outgrown the ability of the community to provide sufficient labour. Foreigners now constitute nearly 40 per cent of the principality's 30,000 residents and, together with 6,500 commuters from Austria and Switzerland, 60 per cent of the 20,000 strong workforce. Political leaders say that these proportions are excessively high, provoking some disquiet among citizens. However, the statistics are not as stark as they look. Liechtenstein has a very mean policy towards immigrants, such that second and third generation permanent residents can easily be prevented from obtaining citizenship. Mr Mario Frick, the prime minister, wants to change the law, and thereby to reduce the immigrant population to a more tolerable 30 per cent. Still, the difficulty in finding qualified labour together with high wage rates have already driven many companies to set up factories in neighbouring Austria and Switzerland, and that trend will undoubtedly continue. As has occurred elsewhere, it looks as if Liechtenstein companies will try to keep their higher value activities plus research and development at home. Thus, growth prospects may be limited, but the principality will continue to advance around the virtuous circle. Liechtenstein has followed two strategies for securing its future independence, both paradoxically aimed at avoiding isolation. The first, championed by the reigning prince, Hans-Adam II, has been to join international organisations, such as the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The second has been to join the European Economic Area (EEA). Liechtenstein's industries exported goods worth SFr2.5bn (SFr83,000 per capita) in 1992, with more than half of them going to European Union countries. Thus, the principality could not be indifferent to the process of European integration. It did not want to join the EU itself, partly because it feared that EU financial directives would compromise its tax haven, but mainly because it does not have the manpower to carry its share of the administrative burden. The EEA, an expanded free trade treaty negotiated three years ago by the European Union and Efta countries, seemed to provide a middle way, especially as the principality succeeded in negotiating an exception to the freedom of movement of people requirement. Industrial leaders have enthusiastically endorsed the EEA agreement, making clear the consequences if Liechtensteiners do not approve it in a referendum later this year. 'If we do not join the EEA, industry will run down its manufacturing activities here,' says Willy Frommelt, director-general of the Liechtenstein Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, there are mixed feelings among the leaders of the powerful financial community, and the outcome of the referendum remains uncertain. Even if it succeeds, the future of the EEA itself is in doubt. If Finland, Sweden and Norway join Austria in entering the EU next year, the only remaining members of the EEA would be Liechtenstein and Iceland. The Liechtenstein government's hope is that the EEA can be given new life as a halfway house for some eastern and southern European countries wanting to join the EU. Another advantage of EEA membership is that it would require companies and financial institutions to adhere to EU regulations, thereby reducing their local lobbying power. Until now, political balance in this small and tightly knit community has been maintained in no small measure thanks to the unique position and powers of the reigning prince. The story is told that the only legislation ever vetoed by the previous reigning prince, Franz-Josef II, was a measure to limit hunting licences. He could see that it was a scheme put up by the super rich who knew they could outbid ordinary citizens for all the licences. 'The prince is very important. We have to have someone here who is independent,' says Peter Ritter, himself one of the most successful trustee-lawyers in Liechtenstein. Yet relations between the prince, the government, the parliament and the people are unusually tense these days. Two years ago, Hans-Adam II startled his subjects by threatening to dissolve parliament if it did not endorse his demand for a referendum on the EEA in advance of one in Switzerland. Last year, he had another confrontation with parliament. When it threw out Markus Buchel as prime minister, the prince dissolved parliament rather than let the 25 members name someone else as they wished. The prince, who insists that neither he nor a majority of the people would be satisfied with his having only a ceremonial role, has proposed constitutional changes to clarify everyone's roles. But it has been agreed to postpone discussion of them until after the EEA question and a clutch of niggling bilateral problems with Switzerland have been resolved.</p>

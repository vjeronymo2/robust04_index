			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Davos, Switzerland, 29 Jan (NOTIMEX)-- Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today concluded a working  tour in this city where he participated in the World Economic  Forum and where he met with political and business leaders from  around the world.    On his last day of activities, the Mexican president was the  main speaker at the forum's morning session. In his speech he  pointed out the need for greater North-South coordination in  matters related to technology, industrial production, and  monetary and fiscal policy.    He stressed that since 1990 the world has been changing,  and,  in turn, Mexico has decided to be bold in promoting its  international trade policies. This is why it stepped up the  negotiations on NAFTA which was implemented on 1 January.    Salinas said: "Faithful to its diversification policy,  Mexico  has already signed a trade agreement with Chile and has made  progress in similar projects with Colombia, Venezuela, and the  Central American nations." He also stressed the reform process  undertaken by his government in recent years, and he pointed out  the importance of fitting together economic, political, and  social reforms. "This means achieving economic efficiency with  social justice," he noted.    At the forum, Salinas de Gortari also made reference to the  events taking place in the Mexican southern state of Chiapas,  indicating it is a local problem in a region that suffers  extreme poverty. He asserted that to resolve this conflict  "wrong methods used in other parts of the world in the fifties  and sixties and even in the seventies will not be used."    Although it is true that there are economic and social  inequalities in Chiapas, the Zapatist National Liberation Army  revolt "is not an Indian revolt but, rather, it is a trained  revolt, prepared and led by a group that upholds a radical  ideology."    After taking part in the World Economic Forum, the Mexican  president concluded his working visit, which even included a  series of interviews with diverse international personalities.  Salinas de Gortari met with a group of important businessmen at  an event organized by the Mexican Investment Council, led by its  president Jaime Alatorre.    Salinas de Gortari also met with Pakistan's Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto with whom he took up both nations' bilateral  relations. They also discussed in a cordial fashion other  issues of common interest.    During his meeting with OECD Director Jean Claude Paye, he  discussed the world economic outlook, the evolution of the  Mexican economy, and the process Mexico must go through to join  that organization, slated for the second half of 1994.    President Salinas de Gortari also met with Switzerland's  Foreign Minister Flavio Cotta, during which the economic and  political process in Europe was analyzed. He also held a  meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on the  Middle East peace process. He also met with Leon Brittan, head  of the EC Trade Commission, with whom he discussed the process  of European integration as well as Mexico's economic and trade  relations with that region.    At the conclusion of his activities at Davos, the Mexican  president traveled to Zurich to board the Mexican Air Force's  TP-01 "Presidente Juarez" presidential plane to return to the  Mexican capital where he is expected to arrive tonight.</p>

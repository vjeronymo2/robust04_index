			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Offence of 'racial violence' proposed The creation of a new criminal offence of racial violence is proposed today by the Commission on Social Justice. Racial discrimination, says the commission, is a barrier to social justice in Britain and a specific offence of racial violence is one of the measures required to combat it. The commission, which was set up by Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, also calls for the law against incitement to religious hatred in Northern Ireland to be extended to the whole of the UK. It urges action to prohibit employers from rejecting job applicants because of their religious backgrounds. The Commons home affairs committee is conducting an investigation into racial attacks and is considering the value of a specific criminal offence of racial harassment. Even if it recommends creating one, however, the government is unlikely to do so. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, told the committee last week he was not persuaded that the case for an offence of racial harassment had been established. He said the courts could already take all relevant factors into account when passing sentence under existing law, and the main problem was the difficulty which the police often faced in identifying those responsible for racial attacks. Mr Howard said that if it could be shown that any changes in the law were needed, he would prefer to amend the existing Public Order Act rather than introduce a new offence.</p>

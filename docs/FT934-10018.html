			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Gray joins Sutherland Alan Gray, one of the best known analysts of the Scotch whisky industry, has shifted his berth within the Scottish stockbroking fraternity. He has joined Sutherland &amp; Partners in Edinburgh, having left Charterhouse Tilney in Glasgow which had absorbed his long-standing employer Campbell Neill. Gray is probably the only analyst who concentrates purely on Scotch whisky. Each year he puts out a 100-page annual whisky industry review, a densely-printed volume covering not just quoted companies but also facts and figures on distilleries, brand sales and industry trends, which costs Pounds 295. Gray, who has been following whisky for 25 years, prepares it single-handed. He says it sells not just to investors but to companies involved in the whisky industry, from bottle makers to PR firms. Sutherland &amp; Partners is a small institutional agency broker founded in 1989 with clients in Britain and abroad. It employs about 25 people; it now has four analysts.</p>

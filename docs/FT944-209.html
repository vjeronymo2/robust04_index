			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fokker seeks to calm share price volatility Shares in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, fell heavily yesterday after a series of negative domestic media reports, but recovered strongly towards the close of trading as the company repeated that it was working on a new cost-cutting campaign. In early trading, the shares fell by more than 15 per cent, to Fl 10.20 from Fl 12.10 on Wednesday. Dutch television on Wednesday night reported that management consultants believed the company's high costs made it uncompetitive, raising the possibility of plant closures. A Dutch newspaper said job losses might be as high as 1,000, while union officials said they were expecting proposals for more than 500 job cuts. However, the shares recovered after the company dismissed the reports of 1,000 further job losses and plant closures as premature speculation. It reiterated its intention to draw up a new cost-cutting plan by the end of February. It also said the management consultants' report was based on out-of-date figures. Fokker's shares closed yesterday at Fl 11.80, down 2.5 per cent from Wednesday. In mid-December, the shares fell to a 1994 low of Fl 9.50 after the company revised earlier forecasts of lower losses and said the deficit this year would be around the record Fl 460m (Dollars 261.4m) incurred in 1993. The company has blamed the decline of the dollar and downward pressure on the selling price of aircraft for its failure to pare losses this year.</p>

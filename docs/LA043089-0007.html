			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EYE THAT REINTERPRETS;  </P> <P> MINOR WHITE EXHIBIT: IS THE ADMIRATION SHAPED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORK OR  CURATORIAL FLIMFLAM?  </P> <P> Minor White was surely an exceptionally nice man. As dedicated to photography  as a cloistered monk, he believed its practice could act as a tool of spiritual  self-discovery. He taught that odd faith until his death in 1976.  </P> <P> He is just as surely the least well-known of classic American "straight"  photographers whose ranks include such heroes as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward  Weston and Ansel Adams, all friends and mentors. White admired and emulated  them just as he sifted through esoteric religions, the I-Ching and astrology in  his search for enlightenment. He was the very model of the artist who  approaches his work like a religious suppliant and it is poignant to remember  him in these cynical times. If his kind of photography has evolved into an  academic cliche it is because of its enduring substance  </P> <P> Now, the Museum of Modern Art hosts the very first major retrospective of  White's work. After closing here June 18, it will travel to cities where he  worked and taught -- Minneapolis, Rochester and Boston. Its closest approach to  Los Angeles will be San Francisco where he worked after World War II. It will  appear at that city's Museum of Modern Art in June, 1990. In 1991, it will go  to rest in Princeton where he bequeathed his archive.  </P> <P> A survey that includes 185 prints and probes even unknown aspects of White's  life and art certainly ought to prove whether Minor was great or Minor was . .  . minor. The compendium is subtitled "The Eye That Shapes." Unfortunately, this  attempt to do White justice raises questions so large and troubling that one is  not certain in the end whether one's admiring eye has been shaped by its own  experience of the work or gently coerced by suave curatorial flimflam.  </P> <P> The show was organized by Princeton University professor and curator Peter C.  Bunnell. It is not unusual for curators to clarify works through various forms  of grouping and juxtaposition. Bunnell, however, has shaped this material to a  point where we are obliged to wonder whether the work has been distilled to its  own essence or so entirely reinterpreted as to become at least as much  Bunnell's artwork as White's.  </P> <P> Rather than pursuing the musty but effective convention of setting the work out  in simple chronological order, Bunnell presents it in thematic sequences that  seem significant to him. That act is all the more questionable since White  himself came to believe less in the dominance of individual "masterpiece"  photograph and more in somewhat cinematic sequences of images. Rather than  respecting White's order, Bunnell simply created his own from the thousands of  images in the archive. This may not be quite as intrusive as pasting together  your own version of "Birth of a Nation" but it is somewhere in that territory.  </P> <P> In some instances, Bunnell's juxtapositions are too cunning for their own good.  The cover of the handsome catalogue, for example, sets a male nude of 1948 next  to some tree branches shot in 1951. The boy's hands and the branches make the  same gesture. It's a nice conceit but the rhyme is Bunnell's, not White's. The  coupling is revelatory, but of what?  </P> <P> The exhibition and catalogue suffer from what we might call the "Lust for Life"  syndrome. The catalogue begins with an extensive biographical chronology that  tugs at our heartstrings with accounts of White's troubled childhood in  Minneapolis, his early interest in science, poetry and theater, his military  service and his evolution into an itinerant photographer and teacher -- moving  from Portland to a beloved San Francisco to depressing Rochester.  </P> <P> If we are not made sufficiently sympathetic by this factual account we then get  a long section of writings derived from his own letters and journals. A granite  boulder would be touched by White's selfless dedication to his students and  friends. He signed his letters "Lufffff" as if just "Love" was not enough. He  practiced photography with the ecstatic naivete of a convert and came to  identify it with the tao, the Oriental "right way" to put one's spirit in touch  with transcendent nature. He studied esoteric religions of both East and West,  finally joining the Gurdjieff sect. He started life looking like a leprechaun  and ended it with the aura of a kindly guru. He managed the whole thing without  once sounding like a demagogue or a flake.  </P> <P> Reading all that is like reading "Lust for Life," the biography of Vincent Van  Gogh, before you've ever seen a Van Gogh. When you do, you cannot at first tell  if you love the art because of the man or vice versa.  </P> <P> In White's case, at least according to Bunnell, it was all because he loved the  man, or rather men. Minor White was a homosexual and that heretofore veiled  fact appears to be the central touchstone of the curator's thematic  organization.  </P> <P> The exhibition begins with the shadowed face of a sloe-eyed youth taken in  1975. It is followed by an image of a thrusting chimney (Erection!), a wave  crashing against a rock (Orgasm!) and a piece of twisted driftwood  (Self-loathing and Agony!)  </P> <P> Come on. Is somebody kidding us here or what? Art-making is often an act of  sexual sublimation. Is this news? When did Freud say that? Nineteen-aught-six  or something.  </P> <P> And yet the very next pair of images are the tender face of a young chap set  next to a stone visage from Peru.  </P> <P> The entire exhibition is anchored on heretofore unshown images of homoerotic  nudes whose penises, navels and shadowed behinds are then linked to  progressively more abstract images that resemble them -- often vaguely. One has  literally seen this sort of thing done in arty-erotic heterosexual photo  essays. It was cliched and pretentious then and it's worse in the hallowed  halls of the Museum of Modern Art.  </P> <P> The organizational principle casts an excessively literal  this-happened-because-of-that aura over the work. The curator finds an image of  a woman with a flower in her hair, so every flower becomes a symbol of feminine  fecundity. The curator finds an image of a handsome strong lady next to a rough  stone cliff and every outcropping becomes White's fear of furious femininity.  </P> <P> By now we have been railroaded into such a symbolic and autobiographic frame of  mind White can't even take shots of some charming street urchins without  causing us to think, "Hmmph, just self-pity over his tough childhood."  </P> <P> It was the last thing he wanted.  </P> <P> In 1961, he wrote to a student whose pictures conveyed homosexual Angst he knew  well.  </P> <P> "Your photographs," he wrote, "are still mirrors of yourself . . . the images  raw, the emotions naked. To present these to others they need appropriate  clothes. These are private images, not public ones. They are 'expressive  meaning,' a direct mirror of yourself rather than 'creative' meaning so  converted as to affect others as 'mirrors of themselves.' "  </P> <P> White wanted his art to transcend the merely autobiographic but this exhibition  tends to the opposite and trivializes the work. At best it looks like a  well-intentioned attempt to expose the anatomy of the creative process.  Excessive literalism delivers it into a mechanistic 19th-Century realm where it  was believed that El Greco painted square halos because he was astigmatic.  </P> <P> No one should suppress the known facts of an artist's life but no one should  forget that White did not make his best work because he was gay or Picasso  paint his masterpieces because he was a satyr. They made their best work by  transcending their temporal limits. Every artist looks at his own best work  with the awed conviction that it was done by somebody else.  </P> <P> It is very tiresome to spend this much time on an exhibition and still not know  with certainty what its author accomplished -- or even exactly who its author  is.  </P> <P> If the machete of the mind is capable of hacking through the surrounding  tangle, it seems that there was something almost willfully minor about Minor  White. He chose to use photography -- that most obdurately prosaic of mediums  -- to try to convey the unseeable and the unknowable.  </P> <P> He was perfectly capable of producing a grandiose mountainscape in the manner  of his friend Ansel Adams but such work feels exactly like the homage that it  is. We glimpse White when he finds a mountain surrounded by clouds that look  like smoke signals from some playful deity.  </P> <P> White was at his best in the application of his sweet longing for transcendence  to stubbornly realistic subjects. A peeling doorway becomes beatific as a holy  light expands across it. A lyricism not of Eros sparkles in a dandelion puff.  Crackled wood grain takes on the delicate complexity of a Bach sonata. There is  real mournfulness in the realization that the eye of God is a porcelain fixture  with a burned out bulb.  </P> <P> White felt most at peace with meditative Oriental philosophies and he  photographed with the gentle accuracy of a Zen calligrapher. Worldly ambition  is not part of such an enterprise  </P></p>

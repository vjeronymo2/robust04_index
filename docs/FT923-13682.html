			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Keating damages A US jury yesterday ordered the chief of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan bank, Charles Keating, and three co-defendants to pay Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in damages for swindling thousands of investors. The jury found that he and fellow corporate officers defrauded more than 20,000 people who bought junk bonds at the bank before it folded in 1989. The bonds proved to be worthless when Lincoln failed in what was the costliest collapse in US banking history. The damages were the largest awarded in the series of scandals that have rocked the US banking and financial industry since the mid-1980s.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / ADB approves Kazakh loans The Asian Development Bank has approved its first two loans, totalling Dollars 60m, to the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, the bank said yesterday. The bank said the loans to Kazakhstan is designed to help it in the transition to a market-based economy. A Dollars 554,000 technical assistance grant comes with the loans. The loans will support the government's stabilisation and structural reform programme by helping bridge an external financing gap to prevent a further decline in output and deterioration of living standards, the bank said. The project, which will promote trade with other countries in the former Soviet Union, is also intended to ease shortage in foreign exchange for critical imports and allow firms to access foreign currencies. The Manila-based bank also approved a Dollars 27.7m loan to improve water resources in Indonesia to help it enhance capacity at national, provincial, district and river-basin levels for sustainable and economic management and use of water resources. The bank said that in recent years water resources have diminished and growing urbanisation and industrialisation have led to a deterioration in water supply and quality. AP, Manila</p>

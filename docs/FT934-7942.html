			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: R-R wins third Indian power contract ROLLS-ROYCE, the British engineering group, yesterday won a Pounds 275m order for a power station in the Indian state of West Bengal. It was the company's third Indian contract signed this week and brought the total to Pounds 660m. The contracts have been completed during a week of British business events in Bombay attended by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. Other companies which announced commercial agreements yesterday included British Gas, the PowerGen generating company, and Aerospace Composite Technologies, a high technology materials manufacturer, which won an order for replacement windscreens for India's Russian-built MiG-21 fighter aircraft. Rolls-Royce is to manage the construction of a 500MW coal-fired plant at Balagarh and supply generators from the UK for the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation, an affiliate of the Calcutta-based R P Goenka business group. The total turnkey contract will be carried out by Rolls-Royce Power Generation Systems, part of Parsons Turbine Generators based in Newcastle upon Tyne, on behalf of CESC of Calcutta. Parsons will supply two 250MW steam generators for the three-year project, located on an island in the Hoogli River. Yesterday's news follows Tuesday's announcement by Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group of two Indian power station projects worth Pounds 385m. Under these contracts the company will build a 200MW gas-fired combined cycle plant at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and participate in a new company, Chandil Power, to build and operate a 500MW coal-fired power station at Chandil in Bihar. The three contracts give Parsons a total of five new turbine generators to build, providing work into 1996 for the company's present 2,500 employees. All three turnkey contracts will be carried out by Rolls-Royce Power Generation Systems. Rolls-Royce and Goenka have also established a joint venture company to manage the refurbishment of existing power stations, many of which operate far below capacity. PowerGen agreed a similar venture with Aditya Birla, a diversified industrial group led by Mr Aditya Birla, which will bid to build new plants as well as upgrade existing ones. British Gas signed co-operation agreements with the government's Oil and Natural Gas Commission covering technical aspects of oil and gas development in India and possible joint exploration overseas. Zeneca, the chemicals company, established a joint venture with ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT Industries, for a seed technology company.</p>

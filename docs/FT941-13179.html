			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / EU helps Russian banks: Funds target 'major defects' in financial system The European Union has approved a Ecu2m (Pounds 1.6m) scheme to help to remove 'major defects' in the banking system in the former Soviet Union. The defects include 'a worrying lack of transparency' in the net position of credits and liabilities between banks, and between banks and customers. This lack of transparency could point to hidden insolvency problems, the European Commission said yesterday. The Ecu2m contract will fund the dispatch of experts to the Russian central bank, and help to modernise their payment and clearing systems. A portion will also go to the new Inter State Bank set up to improve inter-state payments, as well as to the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus. EU officials said a more efficient payments system should help to reverse the collapse of inter-state trade. The Commission money belongs to the TACIS aid programme to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The contractor is a Spanish-British consortium led by the SEMA group of Spain. The Commission said that aid to the central bank of Belarus would 'naturally' take account of the recent agreement with Russia on monetary unification. Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, called yesterday for more aid to the former communist countries of eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. The EU, US and other donors should ensure that efforts do not fall short of what is needed. Other Commission officials indicated that future aid is likely to be tied even more closely to the pace of reform, with backsliders likely to receive net reductions in assistance.</p>

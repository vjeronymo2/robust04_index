The figures and facts which he quoted can  hardly be called reassuring. Over the past two years the number  of people sentenced in the district for various military crimes  has increased by 13 percent. Over the past year 82 servicemen  have been killed, along with another 19 in the first two months  of this year. Twenty-five of them died while not on duty, and  another 18 died in car crashes in personal transport.    Nor has there been any reduction in the number of those who  have embarked on the path of embezzling military property,  weapons, and munitions. Last year 20 firearms and more than  5,000 rounds of ammunition -- most of which have not been  recovered -- were stolen.    The district chief of staff noted that the main pernicious  influences on the state of military discipline and law and order  include the acute shortage of platoon and company commanders and  their deputy commanders for work with the personnel. The  district is currently 50 percent short of these categories of  junior officers, and in certain units this figure is  considerably higher. At the same time more than 500 mostly more  senior officers have been in uniform for a long time now and are  to all intents and purposes dealing with matters far removed  from the service.    There are also problems with the discipline of contract  servicemen. The command has been forced to cancel the contracts  of 1,266 of the 7,360 soldiers and warrant officers serving in  district units under contract. The reasons for this are  indiscipline and low moral qualities. Colonel General Leontiy  Kuznetsov, commander of the Moscow Military District, called on  commanders and oblast military commissariat workers to be more  discriminating in their selection of people for contract service.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: PosGold raises bid for Aztec Mining The bid battle over Aztec Mining, the diversified Australian mining group, was stepped up yesterday when PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, announced it was raising its cash offer to 74 Australian cents a share. This compared with a previous bid of 68 cents a share, and values Aztec at ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m). Aztec, which last week found a 'white knight' in the shape of Pancontinental Mining, said it did not intend to make any statement immediately. The recommended merger with Pancontinental was an all-paper deal and Aztec shareholders were offered a mixture of Pancon shares and options in return for their Aztec stock. When the deal was announced, Pancon's shares were trading at about ADollars 1.85, and that deal was said to be worth 76 cents per Aztec share. However, the Australian stock market fell back last week, lowering Pancon's offer to below 70 cents. Yesterday, Pancon's shares closed five cents up at ADollars 1.70. The revised PosGold offer is now free of certain conditions, meaning that the bidder can acquire Aztec shares in the market, where they were trading yesterday at 68 cents. Ahead of yesterday's announcement, PosGold controlled less than one per cent of its target's equity. The other key is Alumax, the US company which owns 37 per cent of the target company's shares. It had thrown its support behind the agreed merger, but said only that that it intended to accept Pancon's offer 'unless a better offer materialises'.</p>

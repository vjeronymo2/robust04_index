			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] says the decision on whether or not  to keep voting stations open after 7PM on the three voting days  will be entirely up to the presiding officer overseeing the  process.    An IEC statement said on Tuesday [26 April] issues such as  the safety of the area after dark would be considered. The  IEC's major concern was to allow every eligible voter an  opportunity to cast his or her ballot. "Every effort to achieve  that will be undertaken and all kinds of measures will be  employed," the statement said.    Additional electoral officials would be brought in to staff  the voting stations should the need arise, or if the presiding  officer requested it. Mobile voting stations could also be used.    The commission called on voters to exercise "patience,  understanding and co-operation in this historic process".</p>

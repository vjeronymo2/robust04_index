			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Women set for power in the big league - The City is still waiting for the first female to chair a top 100 company Sooner or later a woman is going to become the chairman of an FT-SE 100 company. It may have escaped the notice of some men out there but the race is on. The question many businesswomen are asking is who is going to be first. Suppose it is within the next 10 years; in fact let's be more adventurous and look at the possibility before the turn of the century. Who might it be? Where will the candidates come from? Gill Carrick, a partner at Goddard Kay Rogers &amp; Associates, the executive search firm, sides with those who expect a woman to break through before the Millennium. She said: 'I think it could well happen within the next five years but I don't think it would necessarily cause a surge. I think we shall have one and then a shocked silence as people assimilate it before we gradually get a few more.' Statistics drawn from the latest edition of Crawford's Dictionary of City Connections show that the number of women chief executives of UK listed and unlisted securities market companies had fallen from 12 in 1993 to nine this year. The only women chairmen of sizeable companies were Aleksandra Clayton of Alexanders Holdings, the car dealer, and Anna Vinton, joint chairman of the Reject Shop. The big league of the FT-SE 100, however, still awaits its first woman chair. Here is a very subjective form guide gleaned from a trawl of colleagues, headhunters and a few industrialists. Could it be any of the following 12? They are listed in no particular order of preference. Rosalind Gilmore, chairman of the Building Societies Commission. At 56, with a civil service background, part of which was spent at the Treasury, she certainly has gravitas, and the robust way she handled the Cheltenham and Gloucester's proposal to sell out to Lloyds Bank proves she also has the metal to take on a top job when she leaves near the end of the year. At present she is the prospective chairman of the Arrow FM consortium bidding for the London FM radio franchise but she is also well placed to take on a bigger chairmanship if one becomes available. Kathleen O'Donovan, at the BTR industrial conglomerate, must be a strong contender. She the first woman finance director in an FT-SE 100 company at the age of 34, and that move, in 1991, won her the European Women of Achievement Award sponsored by the European Union of Women. She recently took up a non-executive directorship at Ardagh, a Dublin-based glass maker. Rosemary Thorne, finance director of J Sainsbury. Apart from collecting more than 20 O-levels, she has the sort of industrial street cred still valued by male-dominated boardrooms. Her business teeth were cut as a management accountant with BOC, the industrial gases company, before moving into retailing. Her experience, particularly with Habitat-Mothercare and Harrods, gives her a strong platform for a big retailing chairmanship if and when it comes along. Baroness Detta O'Cathain, the former managing director of the Milk Marketing Board and current managing director of the Barbican Centre, still has a series of non-executive directorships. A few years ago she would probably have been the favourite because she occupied a very narrow field. This tended to leave her somewhat overexposed at a time when the names of women executives were difficult to recall. Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of The Economist Group and non-executive director of W H Smith, is a US-lawyer turned media executive. Her success in increasing the newspaper's sales in the US made her an automatic choice for The Economist job. Bridget Macaskill, former marketing manager at Unigate, now president and chief operating officer of Oppenheimer Management (the seventh-largest marketer of mutual funds in the US, controlling Dollars 20bn) and a non-executive director of Hillsdown Holdings. June de Moller. When she took over as managing director of Carlton Communications just more than a year ago she became the first woman to the chief executive's job at an FT-SE 100 company. In an expanding industry she has to be well placed to take on a chair although she will probably have to wait a while if she is hoping to succeed Michael Green as chairman. Her non-executive directorships include Anglian Water and Riverside Medical Health Trust. Pippa Wicks is far too young to be considered in the short term but she has great potential. Wicks is the 31-year-old finance director of Courtaulds Textiles. She is among those MBA-qualified finance directors who are prized as much for their general boardroom skills as they are for their ability to run the finance function. Recruited by Martin Taylor, the then chief executive, before he moved to Barclays Bank, she is likely to emerge as a strong contender in a few years' time. Helen Schneider Lenne on the main board of Deutsche Bank and a non-executive director of ICI. Schneider Lenne is one of the new breed of Euro-directors bouncing into the large British boardrooms. Rachael Lomax, 48, head of the economic secretariat in the Cabinet Office, was formerly head of financial institutions and markets in the Treasury and a one-time principal private secretary to Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor. For some time she has been regarded as one of the Treasury high-flyers and ranks among those civil service women who have been able to thrive, partly because of its greater concern in recent years to provide equality of opportunity. Wenche Marshall Foster: chairman and chief executive of Perrier (UK). If you can sell bubbly water in green bottles to the conservative British anything is possible. Yve Newbold, company secretary at Hanson, should probably be among the top dozen contenders. However, company secretaries rarely make the top job. It is no coincidence that many of those I have listed above are finance directors or have backgrounds in finance. Other women in high-earning City jobs, such as Carol Galley, director in charge of pension funds at Mercury Asset Management, and some leading headhunters, rule themselves out because of their existing work. The conflict of interest would stop Galley from taking on a non-executive role, so she is probably among the non-starters. A best of the rest list might include Kamlesh Bahl, chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, Frances Heaton, a director of Lazard Brothers merchant bank and former director general of the takeover panel, and Megan Richardson, director of planning at Barclays. Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, is daily handling powerful mandarins, used to getting their way. Mary Baker, president of Women in Management (a professional management association for women in the UK), who could easily claim a place on the list herself with non- executive directorships at four quoted companies, believes that the Cadbury recommendations for the chairman and chief executive function to be split has increased flexibility for a potential female appointment, possibly from outside a particular company. 'Women are very good at being number one which is why so many leave the corporate structure and set up their own business,' she said. Who could we list as non-starters? Lady Thatcher comes to mind. It would be rather akin to the Rolling Stones playing at the London Paladium. They could do it with ease but the orchestra would walk out. The 12 suggestions are only for that coveted large company chairman's role. Some would be too young if you believe that a woman is going to get there in the short term. But they have been a long time waiting and may have to wait some more. If I were a betting type I might have a flutter on Gilmore.</p>

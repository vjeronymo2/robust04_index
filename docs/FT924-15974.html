			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Il Trovatore - Opera In Mark Brickman's new Scottish Opera production, Verdi's great melodrama seems a very archetype: absurd story, great tunes, nothing much else. The first-night audience accepted it happily in that spirit, so it may count as a success. Darkly lit by Ben Ormerod, Tim Hatley's sets - tall strips of moveable wall, curved this way and that for different scenes - serve well enough, as they might for many another opera. Brickman's directorial hand is visible only in the same sort of way: the soloists are moved carefully from place to place (some waving their arms more, some less), but otherwise left to their own routine devices. Some routines, of course, are better than others. The chorus were drilled to a Dalek unanimity. Super-careful articulation robbed their music of full Italianate fervour, though they can make a lusty sound, and their anvils in the Anvil Chorus were terrific. As the hero's rebel troop rescued the heroine from the villain's forces with ludicrous tameness, however, we got the surtitle 'All sense of reason is gone'; for a moment one thought that Verdi, like Strauss later, must inadvertently have set a stage-direction to music. The Australian soprano Lisa Gasteen (Cardiff winner last year) made a stately, placid Leonora, varying her facial expression from gracious smile to worried frown as the action required. Big voice, attractively warm; technique not equal yet to sharp rhythms, and rapport with the conductor decidedly weak. As the hero Manrico, Kenneth Collins gave us his reliable, all-purpose, hell-for-leather impersonation of the archetypal Italian tenor  -short on finesse, maybe, but firmly committed and sometimes stirring. For subtlety of colour and dramatic response (even in a vacuum), there were visiting Slavs to admire. The gypsy Azucena was Ludmila Nam, a mezzo from Kazakhstan whose exotic facial cast lent a bonus to a mature and generously felt performance. The Muscovite Vladimir Redkin has a dusky, 'inward' timbre at his disposal as well as heroic menace, and his Count di Luna was less of a bully than usual, more a creature of private anguish. On this showing, the conductor Richard Armstrong is not well attuned yet to middle-period Verdi. The pace of the music was often heavy-footed, despite the occasional manic rush forward; what should be rapt, suspended moments were regularly jostled. He fell upon any passage in waltz-time like a Teutonic conductor finding homely relief at last in alien territory. The last act, which crowns Il Trovatore as a great melodrama, should exercise a steady, relentless grip, but here it was disappointingly choppy and sectional. We expect much more from Armstrong, and will in due course surely get it. Theatre Royal, Glasgow, October 3 (m), 10, 22 &amp; 28 October; Aberdeen, Newcastle and Edinburgh in November</p>

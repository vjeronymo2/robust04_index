			<p>BFN     [Text] The ambassador of yet another country -- Germany's  Johannes Preisinger -- today presented his credentials to  President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic. Senada Cumurovic  reports:    [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] Upon receiving the  credentials of Dr. Johannes Preisinger, German ambassador to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Izetbegovic said:    [Izetbegovic] In you, as an individual, we greet all the  German citizens who, through numerous manifestations of a moral  and political nature, supported our struggle for freedom, and  who, through various types of help extended to our people, stood  steadfastly by us. In addition to this, with this act, the  Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has once again  proven its indisputable support of our independence and  sovereignty. Your country was among the first to recognize us  and, in addition to this, before the Serbian and Montenegrin  attack, Germany had a clear position and an authentic vision of  the tragic developments if the aggression was not prevented by  all the means available to the international community. The  Federal Republic of Germany is currently a second home to  350,000 citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Your country has  provided shelter to the greatest number of refugees and expelled  Bosnians. It is not only numbers that speak of the generosity  of the German authorities toward our citizens, but also the way  in which our people have been received throughout your country.  The economic and legal status of our refugees has been  optimally regulated in Germany until conditions are established  for their safe return. All this testifies to the fact that  Germany is not only great in an economic and political sense,  but it means that your country is also great in respect to its  choice of social aims. Please convey our gratitude and respect  to the president of the republic, Mr. Richard von Weizsaecker,  Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bundestag Chairman Rita  Suessmuth, and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Ambassador  Preisinger, I welcome you to our country and wish you great  success in your mission.    [Cumurovic] Dr. Johannes Preisinger is the 12th ambassador  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina that has presented his credentials. [end  recording]</p>

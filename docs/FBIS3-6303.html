			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The No. 2 man of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) urged coalition partners Wednesday  [16 March] to come closer to its policy on defense and  peacekeeping issues as a prerequisite to fielding joint  candidates in the next general election.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told reporters at the  Japan  National Press Club, "our party opposes a proposal to develop  Japan's military capability under the slogan of making Japan a  normal country."    He apparently was alluding to a best-selling book by  coalition strongman Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito, a core party in the coalition.    "It is our goal to make Japan an unarmed country and  eventually eliminate military forces from the world," said Kubo,  secretary general of the biggest force in the seven-party  coalition.    In the book "Nihon Retto Kaizo Keikaku" (program to reform  the Japanese archipelago), Ozawa proposed that Japan expand its  role in UN peacekeeping operations so that it is perceived  overseas as a "normal country."    "I believe we need to maintain some intra-coalition  differences on this issue to pursue our goal and live up to the  spirit of the Constitution," he said, referring to Article 9 of  the Constitution that bans the use of force to settle  international disputes.    Kubo said the coalition should hammer out a policy  coordination accord similar to an agreement reached July 29,  1993 under which they formed an alliance by reconciling policy  differences on key issues such as foreign, defense and farm  policies.    "At that time, the SDP urged other partners to include  wording on reform of foreign and defense policies into the text  of the seven- party accord document. As a result, it adopted a  phrase that says Japan should assume the responsibility of  pursuing peace and disarmament," he said.    "If the coalition parties want to merge into a new large  party, we should sketch out a firm policy coordination agreement  as a vital first step that would enable such joint fielding of  candidates."    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has argued that unity among  candidates of the seven coalition parties is crucial to  defeating the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    A political reform package passed in late January is  designed  to introduce 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats chosen  through proportional representation in elections for the House  of Representatives.</p>

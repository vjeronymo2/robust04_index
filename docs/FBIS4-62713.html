			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>   [Text] Russia's Ministry for Fuel and Power and Ukraine's  State Committee for Oil and Gas are reported to have reached an  agreement on tariffs for Ukrainian petroleum piping and  transshipment services.    Thus, an earlier (December 1993) agreement may materialize,  which provides for increasing Russian petroleum piping across  Ukraine's territory to Central and West European nations from  5.5 million tons in 1993 to 8 million tons this year.    The issue of transit piping and transshipment tariffs  involving the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility remains  unsettled, though, same as Russia's schedule of export petroleum  piping.    Ukraine has agreed to lower its averaged $3 per ton tariff,  though no exact figure has been divulged. Nonetheless, as  spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for Oil and Gas  maintain, the deal is mutually profitable.    Under the Russo-Ukrainian General Agreement the Koneks firm,  which was co-founded by major Russian petroleum extractors, has  been granted the exclusive right to export Russian crude  petroleum and petroleum products.    Russia's Transneft joint-stock company is in charge of  piping  petroleum to Ukraine's border. The Russian joint-stock company  agreed specific schedules of petroleum delivery to Ukraine's  border with its Ukrainian partner, Ukrtransneft, which is in  charge of further Russian petroleum piping across Ukraine's  territory to the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility. (For  more details see UBN no. 13/1994).    Besides, Ukrtransneft concluded additional contracts with  foreign firms, engaged in Russian petroleum exports, in view of  the Odessan transshipment facility's 15 million tons a year  capacity.    Currently, Ukrtransneft has such contracts signed with  Lukoil, Telf, Stanford and Galaxy.</p>

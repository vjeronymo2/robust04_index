			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Face-lift for listed National Theatre - Off the Wall On Thursday Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke declared the National Theatre on London's South Bank a listed building. And on Thursday Richard Eyre, the NT's director, announced that Sir Denys Lasdun's unloved creation was to be subject to a substantial face-lift. Time may improve the look of the National but concrete brutalism, circa 1970, is currently out of popular favour. Richard Eyre's diplomatic embellishments, which include closing the ugly road that circles the place and knocking down a superfluous walkway to create a square stretching to the river, are a small step in the right direction. Sealing and cleaning the concrete before it starts to crumble may also soften the over-riding menace of the fly tower. So here is an artistic re-development to be warmly welcomed. And although it is dangerous to distribute Lottery money before a pound has actually been staked, the National must stand a good chance of being an early beneficiary. For of course Richard Eyre can only afford his Pounds 7m refurbishment if he gets Lottery aid. He anticipates raising Pounds 3.5m from the National's friends with the rest coming either as a millennium project or from the Arts Council's Lottery funds. The National is enjoying an artistic flowering; it runs a tight ship financially and never publicly asks for more subsidy; the building is more successful inside than out and money will be spent here. This seems a Lottery project with a favourable wind behind it. Adding to its prospects was the news that Peter Brooke and his fellow Millennium Medici's have decided to devote some of the Pounds 100m plus a year they will distribute to smaller projects, as well as a dozen major schemes. The National's Pounds 3.5m falls neatly into this category if its alternative source, the Arts Council, should prove unexpectedly difficult. Peter Brooke has shed some light on his thinking. The number of substantial millennium projects has been raised from the rumoured eight to a dozen, which should encourage the more peripheral projects like the Chester auditorium and Albertropolis. As expected, he intends to support bursaries. He also gave tentative backing for the idea of a major festival on the lines of the 1851 Great Exhibition. Surely no time can be wasted if this project is going to be a serious contender rather than a half-cocked diversion. When Charlie Allsopp calls to order the saleroom at Christie's at 7pm on Monday evening and takes bids on a tiny Boudin landscape, the art world will hold its breath. This auction of post-1870 art, taken with a similar offering at Sotheby's on Tuesday, will determine the fate of the season. In the good old days, Pounds 50m and more might be raised from an hour's frantic dealing at this annual summer sale. Now both auction houses will be happy to bring in half that. The auctions are very selective, with just 50 or so lots at each. Vendors have been persuaded to accept modest reserves. The pictures are mainly fresh on the market, with enticing historical pedigrees. The preparations have been meticulous, for another disaster could set back the price recovery in art for another year. Christie's has the good later stuff, including one of the eight Atelier pictures that Braque painted in the 1950s. It sold Atelier VIII for Pounds 4.3m in 1992, when the market was at rock bottom. The top estimate of Pounds 3.5m for Atelier V shows excessive caution. Sotheby's has the better earlier works, including the first sketchy version of Manet's most important composition, that bar girl at the Follies-Bergere, a star of the Courtauld collection. The Pounds 3m estimate seems modest. The other Sotheby's gem is one of the ten paintings of poplars Monet completed in 1891. Here again Pounds 3m is expected. A sign of the times is the Pounds 750,000 estimate on a haunting painting by Magritte: in 1989 it sold for over Dollars 2m. Perhaps Sotheby's and Christie's will have calls from a mysterious telephone bidder, like the one who transfixed Bonhams' auction of Gothic art last Monday. The sale almost doubled its forecast at Pounds 271,000, with a bed designed by Pugin's son Edward in 1865 making Pounds 38,500. The new owner of the bed, and much else from the sale, is that well known Hollywood Goth, Cher.</p>

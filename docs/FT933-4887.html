			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / R-R starts Pounds 60m aero-engine R&amp;D ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and power systems group, yesterday launched two six-year programmes to develop advanced technologies for future aero-engines at a cost of Pounds 60m. The two programmes, jointly funded by the Ministry of Defence and Rolls-Royce, will be carried out at the company's military engine facility at Bristol. The first programme will research and demonstrate ways of applying advanced technologies to combustors and high-pressure turbines for use in a range of future engines. The second programme, known as Near Term Advanced Core Military Engine Technology, will focus on the demonstration of advanced compression systems, low-pressure turbines, reheat systems and nozzles. Mr Stewart Miller, Rolls-Royce director of engineering and technology, said that the two programmes were relevant to future military engine applications, advanced short-take-off/vertical-landing power plants, and new engines for military trainers. The research programmes would also have spin-offs into civil engine developments, he added. Compared with current combat engine technology, the aims of the new programmes include a 50 per cent cut in engine mass and a 30 per cent fall in fuel consumption. Rolls-Royce said the programmes would help new versions of the Eurojet EJ200, the power plant being developed for the Eurofighter 2000, and other future combat engines.</p>

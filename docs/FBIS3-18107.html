			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PTT Telecom Acquires Stake in </F> Indonesian Telephone Company"]    [Excerpt] PTT Telecom has acquired a 30-percent stake worth  $90 million (approximately 175 million guilders -- NRC  HANDELSBLAD editor's note) in the Indonesian Bakrie Electronic  Company [BEC].    This acquisition makes the Netherlands company the first  foreign company to acquire a share in the Indonesian  telecommunications market. PTT Telecom describes the stake in  BEC as being of strategic interest. The Netherlands company is  predicting further growth on the Indonesian market, from where  it intends to expand into Southeast Asia. At the end of last  year, PTT Telecom already concluded a cooperation agreement with  the Indonesian state-owned telecommunications company Telkom.  However, this did not result in any specific initiatives. At  the time, B. Verwaayen, a director of PTT Telecom, said that the  Netherlands company wanted to participate in the imminent rapid  growth in Indonesia. Indonesia has a total of 187 million  inhabitants, but has [an average of] less than two lines  connected per 100 inhabitants. Telkom wants to increase the  number of connected lines to at least 7 million within five  years.    Bakrie Electric Company is a subsidiary of Bakrie and  Brothers, a conglomerate active in the steel sector,  plantations, chemicals, communications, and immovables. BEC has  more than 121,000 telephone lines (5 percent of the total number  of lines in Indonesia -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note). The  revenue derived from their operation is shared with Telkom. At  the same time, BEC is involved in establishing telephone  networks in Jakarta and Bandung, markets which comprise at least  250,000 and 30,000 lines respectively. These networks are being  laid and operated by a separate company, Ratelindo, in which BEC  owns a 55-percent stake and Telkom a 45-percent stake.    Of the 90 million dollars paid by PTT Telecom for its stake  in BEC, Bakrie and Brothers is investing 72 percent in its  subsidiary. The rest will go to other Bakrie companies,  according to Tanri Abeng, the general manager of Bakrie  Electronic. [passage omitted]</p>

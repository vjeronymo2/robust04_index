			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE TO ERASE ERROR ON APARTMENT MORATORIUM  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council will take a second vote to extend the city's  apartment building moratorium, this time allowing five days for public comment  to make sure the action is legal.  </P> <P> In its haste to extend the moratorium, the council on Jan. 10 ignored a City  Charter requirement that an ordinance be enacted only after a five-day waiting  period.  </P> <P> The city made the same mistake in September and got caught. In a December  ruling, Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel said the city's initial moratorium of  Sept. 27 had been improperly enacted because the public received no chance to  comment.  </P> <P> Vogel allowed the moratorium to stand, saying it would have become effective by  then anyway.  </P> <P> But last Thursday when a group of Glendale developers informed her about the  extension, Vogel criticized Glendale officials for ignoring her ruling.  </P> <P> "The question of unclean hands jumps out at me," Vogel told Assistant City  Atty. Scott Howard at a hearing.  </P> <P> Howard said he did not know how the council had taken the action. "I am the  litigator. . . . I am not the city attorney," Howard said. "I know they  extended it only from reading it in the newspapers."  </P> <P> Vogel has been hearing the developers' challenge to the moratorium, which so  far has been unsuccessful.  </P> <P> A ruling on reconsideration of her first ruling is expected in a few days.  </P> <P> The judge said Thursday that she was inclined to let it stand.  </P> <P> But she advised the city to correct its mistake to save itself "some time and  aggravation and another court appearance."  </P> <P> City Manager David Ramsey acknowledged that the city made a mistake in adopting  the extension without notice.  </P> <P> "The staff sincerely apologizes," he told the council. "The ordinance will be  discussed today and placed on the agenda for next week."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said she would reluctantly follow Vogel's  instructions. "I personally don't think we made a mistake," she said, "but we  have to cover all the bases."  </P> <P> The initial 150-day moratorium was adopted Sept. 27 to prevent an overflow of  building permit applications during reevaluation of the city's building and  zoning codes.  </P> <P> The City Council extended it until April 24 because the city was unable to draw  up new guidelines in time.  </P> <P> The Moratorium Litigation Committee, a consortium of developers, sued the city  in November and asked the court to order that the moratorium be lifted.  </P></p>

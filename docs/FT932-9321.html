			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Wales picks up foreign plums: How the inward investment trend is being bucked MR David Hunt, Welsh secretary, was banging the drum this week over foreign investment in Wales. The occasion was the 20th anniversary of the first arrival in Wales of a Japanese company. More striking was the fact that last year foreign direct investment in Wales was higher than the year before. This seems a remarkable exception to the general trend. Foreign investment in Europe reached its peak at the end of the 1980s. Since then it has dropped sharply, both in the European Community and in the UK overall. But in Wales, according to Mr Hunt's officials, last year's figure of Pounds 825m for planned investment by foreign companies was 13 per cent up on 1991 and more than double the 1990 level. Mr Hunt says that with only 5 per cent of the population, Wales has claimed 20 per cent of inward investment into the UK. This investment has more than compensated for blows during the 1980s such as the closure of the Shotton steelworks in Clwyd, north Wales. Last year UK manufacturing output was 5 per cent higher than in 1979. Welsh output, says Mr Hunt, was 27 per cent higher. In seeking to define Wales' success in attracting foreigners Mr Hunt points first to the quality of the Welsh workforce: 'I think the work ethic is the most important factor. In Wales we've always had a tradition of working hard and of long service with one employer. If you talk to a German company like Bosch they will say their productivity in Wales is higher than it is in Germany.' Yet other UK regions could make similar claims. A more revealing difference is the advantage Wales derives from the centralisation of functions in the Welsh Office. 'We are the ultimate one-stop shop,' Mr Hunt says. 'An inward investor just has to come to me or one of my colleagues. He doesn't need to see anyone else. 'We bring everybody together, whether it's the Welsh Development Agency, the local authority, the Training and Enterprise Council or the university. 'At the Welsh Office we have all the policies brought together  - education, health, environment, industry, agriculture, transport and training.' Mr Hunt takes an aggressive approach to marketing: 'I'm about to fly off at the end of the month to North America where we have some very good prospects. 'They all involve competition with other parts of Europe, not the UK. 'I'm generally fighting Ireland in particular, because they go out positively to win manufacturing, and Spain. 'Belgium is getting very positive about investment too, and parts of France are going out more savagely to win business.' Above all, he says: 'I believe we combine better than any other country in Europe. Led by the secretary of state and the chairman of the Welsh Development Agency we go into boardrooms anywhere in the world and argue the case for Wales. There aren't many other parts of the world that do that.'  ----------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN WALES  -----------------------------------------------------                       Planned        Number of                    (Pounds m)         projects  ----------------------------------------------------- 1989                      476               48 1990                      402               77 1991                      733               90 1992                      825               83  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Welsh Office  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

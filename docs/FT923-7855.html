			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Observer: Sir John's party It is not every day that the chairman of Britain's biggest bank invites the media into his office for a drink, let alone his family home. But yesterday Sir John Quinton, Barclays outgoing chairman, opened up his riverside pad in leafy Bucks (four beds, three bathrooms and a Gertrude Jekyll garden) to celebrate 10 years of Saturday opening at Barclays. It would seem unthinkable for the banks not to open at weekends now, but back in 1982, when Sir John led the way, it was a revolutionary move in Britain's conservative banking industry. Barclays was the first of the big banks to take on the building societies and its success in this area was one of the main reasons why he won the chairmanship in May 1987. Like Deryk Weyer before him, who was passed over for the chairmanship, Sir John was one of Barclays' ablest bankers. It would be sad if he is remembered as the first Barclays chairman to get his job on merit and then blew his chances. Morgan Stanley's banking guru, Keith Brown, says that it will be another two or three years before judgment can be passed properly on Sir John's time at the top. Observer believes that history may be kinder to Sir John than his current critics.</p>

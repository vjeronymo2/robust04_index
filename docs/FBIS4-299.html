			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- There was sporadic  shooting with light and heavy weapons in various areas of Kigali  this morning, according to inhabitants of the Rwandan capital,  following the deaths last night of the Rwandan and Burundian  presidents. However, calm prevailed in Bujumbura where many  civil servants and traders did not report for work, an AFP  correspondent said.    UN officials in Kigali and the security forces could not  provide details on possible material damages resulting from the  shooting which was heard mainly in the center of the city.  According to a spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda  [UNAMIR], security forces have cordoned off the strategic areas  and UN patrols are cruising the city. The spokesman was not  able to give details on whether the shooting was between  organized armed groups. The shooting, which began early this  morning, could still be heard by 0930.    The Rwandan Government has appealed for calm on the radio,  and has asked people to remain at home, "to avoid panic," and to  "avoid engaging in acts that could threaten state security."    According to various Rwandan sources, the plane that was  returning Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian  President Cyprien Ntaryamira from Tanzania was attacked by heavy  weapons before crashing at Kigali Airport. The UN officials and  the security forces could not confirm this information.  According to unofficial sources, the Rwandan presidential  plane, which was carrying about 10 people who all died in the  crash, took fire and literally exploded.</p>

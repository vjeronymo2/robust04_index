			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Council  recently issued a circular on launching a nationwide general  inspection of commodity prices to provincial and municipal  people's governments, and to ministries, commissions, and  organizations under the State Council.    The circular said: At present, China enjoys a stable  political environment and a prosperous economy. However, price  hikes occur frequently. Price hikes and unauthorized fees have  provoked a strong reaction from the masses. Some enterprises  raised prices by taking advantage of the reforms in taxation, in  the exchange rate, and of prices; some localities exceeded their  authority, set prices for services, and wantonly collected fees  for personal gain; and some shop owners, instead of marking  prices clearly on their merchandise, demanded unreasonable  prices, fixed prices, and cheated customers. Some of them even  earned exorbitant profits from selling fake and shoddy products.  These illegal operations have pushed up the general price level  and have seriously harmed consumers' interests. To prevent  illegal acts of raising prices, establish order with regard to  market prices, restrain the general price level from an  excessive increase, keep people's lives stable, maintain social  stability, and create a favorable environment for the smooth  implementation of various reforms, the State Council decided to  continue the nationwide general inspection of commodity prices  in 1994.    The circular's demands:  <H5>  1. The Scope, Focus, and Main Content of the Inspection </H5>   All enterprises, individual industrialists and businessmen,  and administration units authorized to collect fees will be  included in the inspection.    The inspection will focus on prices of daily necessities and  fees for various services for citizens which are closely related  to the people's lives.    The main content of the inspection will focus on illegal  acts  of raising prices in the second half of 1993. These illegal  acts include:    1) Raising prices without authorization by taking advantage  of taxation reform and by widening the gaps between purchasing  and selling prices and between wholesale and retail prices, and  raising prices of products and services by adding additional  value-added tax to original prices;    2) Exceeding the authority of price administration to raise  prices and service charges that are supposed to be set by the  state; wantonly raising and charging fees for railway, highway,  and water transportation services; and forcing passengers to buy  insurance while selling them tickets;    3) Violating state regulations on reporting the price  adjustment plan, on controlling price differences, and on  temporary price controls; and failing to mark prices on  commodities;    4) Violating relevant state regulations and wantonly raising  the prices of agricultural production means such as chemical  fertilizers, agricultural films, pesticides, diesel fuel for  agricultural use, and electricity in rural areas;    5) Charging fees outside of authority, adding categories of  charges without authorization, and increasing fees  indiscriminately.  <H5>  2. The Time and Method of the Inspection </H5>   The nationwide general inspection of commodity prices will  begin in late March, and preliminary results must be scored by  the end of June. Price departments at all levels will be in  charge of the inspection. Working together with supervision,  finance, taxation, auditing, industrial and commercial  administration, and technology supervision departments, they  will select cadres to form inspection teams to kick off the  inspection. With the price inspection organizations serving as  the mainstay, the nationwide general inspection of commodity  prices will give full play to price supervision organizations in  all fields. It will be conducted by simultaneously carrying out  propaganda, handling problems, and correcting mistakes.    In the course of the inspection, it is necessary to bring  into full play the role of the mass media in exercising  supervision, utilizing radio and television broadcasts,  newspapers, and journals to build up momentum and create public  support for the general price inspection and to publicize major  and serious cases which have created bad influences. It is also  necessary to encourage the masses to expose various instances of  price violation. Measures for improving and perfecting price  management should be worked out promptly to deal with problems  uncovered during the inspection and to strengthen enterprises'  capability for self-restraint.    Local governments may invite people's congress deputies,  members of political consultative conferences, and the  democratic parties to take part in the price inspection,  bringing into play their role in exercising supervision and  offering guidance.  <H5>  3. Organization and Leadership of the Inspection </H5>   The nationwide general price inspection should be carried  out  and led directly by governments at various levels. Governments  at all levels should attach great importance to, strengthen  leadership over, and assign a leading comrade to take charge of  the inspection, while leaving specific work to the commodity  price departments. To ensure the smooth progress of the  inspection, it is necessary to keep consistent commodity price  departments and staff members, replenish essential inspection  personnel, coordinate relations between various departments in  good time, and effectively solve practical problems arising in  the inspection.    On the basis of investigations and study, governments at all  levels should identify focal points, arrange them in the order  of their priority, formulate plans, study policies, work out  meticulous and well-conceived arrangements to ensure the  concentration of resources to achieve breakthroughs in the focal  points, and use the experience of selected units to promote work  in the entire area, thereby making the inspection a great  success.    All departments should step up cooperation and coordination.  The finance department should ensure outlays for investigating  price violations uncovered in the inspection; banks should  assist price inspection departments to collect, according to the  regulations, fines and confiscations that units and individuals  being penalized refuse to deliver to the state; the industry and  commerce administrative departments should provide active  cooperation in regard to price inspection departments' request  for suspending a business's operations pending consolidation or  revoking its business license; and the public security  department should, in pursuance of the relevant laws and  regulations, punish those who obstruct inspection personnel from  executing their official duties.    The State Council should instruct the State Planning  Commission to work together with the supervision, finance,  taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration, and  technical supervisory departments in organizing a number of work  groups and should send them to provinces, autonomous regions,  and municipalities to give inspection-related guidance; while  local governments at various levels should also dispatch work  groups to go down to lower levels to supervise the inspection.  <H5>  4. Requirements of the Inspection Work </H5>   1) All inspection personnel should diligently study the  "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning  the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure"  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, to fully recognize the inspection's great importance  for stabilizing commodity prices, reassuring the public, and  ensuring the smooth progress of reform programs. It is  necessary to conduct training to enable inspection personnel to  familiarize themselves with this year's reform programs as well  as relevant professional knowledge, policies, and legislation.  In the course of inspection, it is necessary to uphold  principle, to observe discipline, to perform duties honestly, to  strictly enforce the laws, and to handle price violation cases  impartially without bending laws for the benefit of relatives or  friends.    2) Price inspection offices should sternly handle uncovered  cases of price violation in accordance with the "Regulations on  Price Management in the PRC" and other relevant regulations. It  is necessary to instruct units and individuals involved in price  violation to refund their illegitimate incomes to buyers or  consumers. Illegitimate incomes that cannot be refunded should  be confiscated by price inspection offices, and those involved  should be given a fine depending on the degree of gravity of  each case.    3) All units and individuals being inspected should  voluntarily accept inspection and provide accurate information;  those who deliberately create difficulties and refuse to accept  inspection will be given a heavy punishment.    4) It is necessary to protect inspection personnel who  uphold  principle as well as people who expose price violations; and  retaliation against them should by no means be permitted. Those  who shield and connive at acts of price violation should be  affixed with responsibilities and duly punished.    The State Planning Commission is responsible for the  day-to-day work of the nationwide price inspection. Before 20  July, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  should submit to the State Council special reports on progress  in the inspection.</p>

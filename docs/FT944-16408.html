			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lewis resigns Technology chair Mr Derek Lewis, chairman of Technology, is leaving the personal computer distributorship at the end of the year after some 18 months of strife and unhappiness among staff and customers. Technology, which is owned by ICL and is one of the UK's largest pc distributors, is unlikely to make a profit for the year although it is currently trading in the black, according to Mr Ninian Eadie, in charge of ICL's volume products division. Mr Lewis denied that he was leaving in any mood of bitterness, however. He is moving to Schroder Ventures where he will take a role in determining the group's electronics and computers investment policy. He said yesterday that Technology was now firmly established as part of the ICL structure and ready for its next expansion phase. 'I think I have done my job and now it is time to move on.' The new chairman will be Mr Ken Wallace, deputy chairman and logistics director. Ms Marie-Anne van Ingen, sales director, becomes managing director. ICL's take over of Technology is 1992 was seen as a bold experiment for a former mainframe computer manufacturer in the low cost distribution of pcs. It failed to work as planned, however, because Technology proved unable to handle the volume of business on its own and earlier this year ICL put a new organisation, ICL Client-Server Systems, in place to supply pcs and midrange machines to dealers and systems houses. Now Technology operates at arms-length to ICL, distributing computers from a range of manufacturers: 'It is very much back to basics' Mr Eadie said yesterday. Mr Lewis led the management buy-out of Technology and its subsequent sale to ICL. There was speculation in the industry yesterday that if ICL was prepared to sell Technology, Mr Lewis would be well placed with Schroders to help with financial matters.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Mathematical problem for Hillingdon's Labour voters - Campaign Diary If the Conservatives do lose in Westminster, it won't be the fault of Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister. Sir Edward, who knows all about close elections, came to the aid of the party yesterday afternoon, rushing off to the polling station, and missing the beginning of an arts debate in consequence. Every vote counts. Reports that Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, is emerging as a front-runner to replace Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission caused palpitations in Downing Street, where Sir Leon Brittan is regarded as a much more acceptable candidate than the arch-federalist Dehaene. But the disclosure came as no surprise to readers of The European Journal, monthly magazine of the European Foundation, the Euro-phobic organisation chaired by arch Euro-sceptic Bill Cash, MP. The journal, clearly well plugged into the drift of federalist thinking, tipped Dehaene a whole month ago. Only trouble is, no-one seems to have noticed.</p>

Shevchenko;  UDC678.621.315.772.93]    [Abstract] Low melting point oligomers are used in  photo-thermoplastic recording as a recording medium. An electric  charge placed on a film of such material remains intact in  darkness and diminishes under illumination. The remaining charge  in unlit portions of the film is capable of deforming the film  when heated to a temperature above the flow point, thereby  forming an image. In the present work linear and radial  (star-like) carbazole-containing oligomers, used as recording  means for photo-thermoplastics, were synthesized. The  coefficients of molecular packing of the synthesized oligomers  were determined, and it was demonstrated that on transition from  the linear to the radial (three and four rays) form, the  coefficient of molecular packing decreases and the fraction of  free space increases. This confirms the branched structure of  the radial form. References 5 (Russian).</p>

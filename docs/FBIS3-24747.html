			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Commonwealth envoys trying to strike a deal between  the opposing factions of Lesotho's Army were supposed to be  meeting 10 delegates from each side today with Lesotho's foreign  minister. Trouble began over two weeks ago, when a section of  the Army demanded a huge pay increase. Since then, there have  been clashes around Maseru. A number of soldiers have been  killed, and fears of a coup against Ntsu Mokhehle's government  are in the air. There has even been talk of this other southern  African peacekeeping force being sent in. On the line to  Maseru, Timothy Ecott asked one of the Commonwealth envoys, Max  Gaylard, how they had got on today.    [Begin recording] [Gaylard] Well, we had a very long day. We  spent all of the morning with one of the two groups and spent  all of the afternoon with the second group. Each group consists  of 10 persons, soldiers, NCO's [noncommissioned officers], and  junior officers, and that was the modus operandi.    [Ecott] And what did the two groups have to say to you?    [Gaylard] Well, we encouraged them in each case to talk to  us  and let us know their grievances and try to get to the bottom of  the current difficulties.    [Ecott] And can you now, having met the two factions,  explain  what the problem is within the Lesotho Army?    [Gaylard] Well, I think it is a little bit early for me to  pronounce on that. We have been here three days as you know,  and I think some of the problems go back a bit further than  that. But it was a constructive day, because I think we got two  or three--not I think--we did get two or three quite strong  commitments from both delegations, and I think the most  important commitment to mention was the unequivocal commitment  to the democratically elected Government of Lesotho.    [Ecott] But does that mean, though, that they will stop  fighting each other, or is that a separate problem?    [Gaylard] Everything is connected, I suppose, in one way or  another, but I was going to go on to say that a second common  commitment from the two of them, there is no doubt that both  sides don't want to fight anymore. They have stopped in the  last three or four days. There is no guarantee right now that  they won't start again, but I think it is less likely because  the tensions have lessened. They are now into a procedure of  talking. And, eventually, not in the near future, hopefully we  will bring the two delegations together [word indistinct] the  government, but they are committed to talks, there is no doubt  about that.    [Ecott] But, at the moment, presumably, the two factions are  still well armed, and they are still facing each other with the  potential to start fighting if they feel that you are not  solving their difficulties.    [Gaylard] Yes, yes, they are certainly armed. They are not  exactly facing each other. I suppose, if you want to be  technical, they are separated by four or five miles, the two  main groups. But as I said, the tensions have lessened. We are  hoping in the next one or two days that we will be able to  control the talking process.    [Ecott] Can you, though, exactly explain in simple terms  what  the fight is all about, because that doesn't seem to have been  adequately explained by anyone?    [Gaylard] It is a little bit early to give you a definitive  answer on that, but I can say that it is a fight between two  factions of the Army. What I am suggesting is that it is not an  antigovernment problem, as far as we can see. In fact, today,  as I say, both were at pains to tell us that they supported the  government.    [Ecott] And what is the government's role and view of the  situation now?    [Gaylard] Well, you would want to talk to government itself  about that, but our position is that our bottom line is that we  are here to support the government in its efforts to resolve the  problem. Now, what they have done is facilitate our role as  facilitators, if you like, and that has been no easy task, even  just getting into barracks--that had to be arranged by  government and has been done. Of course, in our early meetings  with the troops, we accompanied a minister from government who  addressed the troops in both camps. [end recording]</p>

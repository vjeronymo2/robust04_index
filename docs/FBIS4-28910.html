			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon)  [SKNDF] made public a detailed report on the crisis of the South  Korean economy which is getting all the more serious amidst  apprehensions of war growing because of the intensifying new war  provocation moves of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam  group and the increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula,  according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul.    The export-oriented economy of South Korea, a colony  dependent on foreign capital and wriggling in a bog of the  crisis of stagnation, has begun to shake to its very foundation  due to the instability of the situation, the report said, and  went on:    First of all, foreign capital investment in South Korea has  dwindled and phenomena of its withdrawal increased as the  apprehensions of war heightened.    According to data, foreign businesses took 610 million  dollars out of South Korea in March and 490 million dollars in  April.    South Korean stock prices dropped sharply. Foreign  businesses now are more interested in selling stocks en masse  than buying them in the South Korean stock market as the rumor  of war spread. They took away 114.2 million dollars in the  period from March 1 to 8. Subsequently, the South Korean  securities market prices slumped.    The issue of securities has almort come to a suspension as  the prices of securities of South Korean businesses rapidly  dropped in external securities markets, too, owing to the  perceived crisis of war.    An increasing number of flight of capital have been  witnessed among the rich since the rumour of "crisis of a war in  July or August" by the United States and the Kim Yong-sam  belligerent group was set afloat from the beginning of the year.    According to the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation February  26,  the number of those who left South Korea when the situation was  tense totalled over 427,300 till February 19, or 107,000 more  than in the same period last year. They have secured their  fabulous property through the purchase of houses and immovables,  depositing, etc. abroad.    Foreign exporters are hesitating to ship export goods to  South Korea because of the unstable South Korean situation  caused by the rumour of a crisis of war.    In addition, the rich are reluctant to invest and do not  deposit money in banks, with the result that colossal funds  accounting for 40 percent of the gross national product are kept  idle.    Thus, the withdrawal of foreign capital, paralyzed  securities  market, flight on capital, thriving underground economy and  other phenomena caused by the crisis of war are driving the  South Korean economy to the worst phase.</p>

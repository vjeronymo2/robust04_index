			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Earnings data spur further advance in shares - Market Report Favourable news on domestic wage levels encouraged the UK stock market yesterday to retest the top of its latest trading range as both shares and bonds extended the gains of the previous session. Trading volume, and market attendance, was curbed by the effects of the national rail strike in the UK, and shares slipped back from their best levels as business died away towards the end of the day. The FT-SE 100 Index edged above 3,050 in early trading as government bonds led the market's firm response to the announcement that UK average earnings growth had slipped to 3.75 per cent in April, while inflation, as measured by the retail price index, had remained steady. By the close the gain on the FT-SE 100 had been cut to a net 6.2 for a final reading of 3,045.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, still suffering from the aftermath of expiries of over-the-counter contracts, fell a further 19 points to 3,559.7, the second successive underperformance against the Footsie. The stock market was restrained by adverse developments in the utility sectors, which have been the mainstays of the big investment funds during the period of bond market weakness. British Gas fell heavily after the chief executive responded negatively to the Ofgas ruling on gas pricing. He warned that the ruling could force British Gas to 'peg' its dividend next year, a prospect which hit the shares and also other utility stocks which have been sought out for their dividend paying capacity. The sector took fresh pressure when Thames Water disclosed that it was making new provisions against some recent acquisitions. However, these adverse pressures on market indices were counter-balanced by strength in Glaxo shares as news of the impending retirement of the chairman brought suggestions that Glaxo might now follow some of its European rivals in seeking a major acquisition in the US. After its prolonged period of watching the European bond markets, London refocused yesterday on the host of domestic economic data, and on prospects for tonight's speech in the City of London by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Little heed was paid to the modest reduction in money market repo rates in Germany, or to the dull response from European bond markets. Although equity trading picked up following announcement of the average earnings data, the final total of Seaq reported business, at 562.8m shares, compared with 709.8m registered on Tuesday. Some City professionals had arranged to work from home because of the national rail strike, and many others left their offices early yesterday afternoon. On Tuesday, retail business in equities jumped to a healthy Pounds 1.56bn. Strategists commented that the City's fears of renewed inflation pressures have to some extent been calmed this week by the flow of economic data on both sides of the Atlantic. The expectedly poor showing of the UK Conservative party candidates in both national by-elections and the elections for the European parliament has fed hopes that the British government may cut taxes in order to restore its standing with voters. At the same time, the sudden wave of nervousness over Federal Reserve policies was also seen to subside a little following favourable news this week on US retail sales and consumer prices.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAIN-COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES  </P> <P> Whatever are we to do with these anti-abortionist gadflies? They trample the  rights of most to intercede where they are wanted the least. Then they whimper  that their right to violate the law is frustrated by police who, they say, have  no business shoveling them from the public thoroughfare, like so much refuse,  given their determination to behave irresponsibly.  </P> <P> Is there, perhaps, some address to which we can send donations in order to buy  the LAPD more nunchakus?  </P> <P> STEPHEN C.

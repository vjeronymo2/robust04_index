			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No place for philanthropy in provision of share options for executives Sir, The subject of executive compensation in general and share option schemes in particular is characterised by an excess of emotion and a dearth of logic. Sadly, some of the comments quoted in your article about Dorling Kindersley's unusual share option scheme are very muddled ('Publisher shares his wealth at the office', July 26). What Peter Kindersley has chosen to do is to make a gift to a number of senior executives of the company of which he is by far the largest shareholder. There could be only two possible explanations for his behaviour: either philanthropy or the belief that this action will enhance the loyalty and motivation of these executives. Whichever reason applies, Mr Kindersley has chosen to bear all the dilution himself and he is, of course, perfectly entitled to make this decision. Mr Kindersley's suggestion that institutions wrongly believe that share option schemes are 'some sort of dilution' is odd. Share options very definitely involve a form of dilution and, before permitting their holdings to be diluted, institutional investors have a legal obligation, no less, to think very seriously about the issues involved. Trustees of pension schemes have a fiduciary duty to their beneficiaries and their investment managers, as their agents, have the same duty. Thus philanthropic gestures by institutional investors towards key executives simply cannot be contemplated. The only grounds upon which institutional investors can contemplate the dilution of their shareholding is if they believe that this action will produce behaviour which is likely at the very least to compensate for that dilution. That is precisely why the NAPF, in conjunction with the Association of British Insurers, issued its share scheme guidance which requires performance criteria in share option schemes which will engender a coincidence of interest between investors and management. Furthermore, by being non-prescriptive the guidance deliberately empowers remuneration committees to identify the performance criteria which they believe are appropriate and, I earnestly hope, to articulate to investors why these criteria are appropriate. There is one area where I personally feel useful dialogue between industry and investors could be opened. If executives could be encouraged through liberalisation of the amount, phasing and timing of options to retain their shares rather than selling them immediately after the exercise of their options they would be welcome converts to the spirit of long-termism which most institutions practise. It seems to me that such liberalisation might well be to the advantage of both shareholders and management.

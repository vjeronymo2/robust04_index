			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Hasan Abu-Zayid on the first </F> session of the Palestinian National Authority held 26 June in  Gaza]    [Text] The PNA [Palestinian National Authority] met at the  Government departments complex in Gaza City today to discuss a  number of issues, notably funding sources for the PNA and the  status of aid from donor nations.    The man in charge of the planing portfolio in the PNA is Dr.  Nabil Sha'th:    [Begin Sha'th recording] The PNA held its first session  today, with the participation of all its members who are now  present in Gaza and Jericho. It was an important session that  laid the groundwork for the organizational structures. We  agreed to adopt a spirit of teamwork and on the need for each  department to have its own organization and budget. We will be  holding weekly sessions in Jericho and Gaza alternately. We  will next meet in Jericho next Sunday [3 July], God willing. We  also agreed to meet again after lunch for another look at  certain important matters, including the detainees and  prisoners, as well as mundane, everyday issues in Gaza and  Jericho. The PNA then met with a World Bank team to assure  themselves that the money flows from the donor nations via the  World Bank channels will be enough to meet the current expenses  of all the departments and municipal projects, including one to  clean up Gaza. The World Bank team answered all the questions  that were put to them. They have now returned to Jerusalem.    I will have my first meeting with General Danny Rothschild  next Tuesday at Eretz [crossing point from Gaza to Israel] to  work out the mechanism and agenda and methodology [preceding  word in English] for future negotiations and committee meetings.  It will be a preparatory session. Before my meeting with Gen.  Rothschild, I will confer with Minister Yosi Sarid also at  Eretz. I will likely travel to Cairo Thursday [30 June] for a  scheduled meeting with Belgium's foreign minister and the donor  nations. On 4 July, the Palestinian Police Support Group is due  to convene its first meeting. It will bring together  representatives of all the donor nations. [end recording]    Reacting to the findings of the Shamgar Commission [the  inquiry that investigated the 25 February massacre of Muslim  worshipers in Hebron by Dr. Baruch Goldstein], Dr. Nabil Sha'th  said:    [Begin Sha'th recording] The matter is now on brother  Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] desk. I think the entire PLO  Executive Committee membership will also look at the findings.  [end recording]</p>

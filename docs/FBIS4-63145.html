			<p>BFN     [Text] Ibragim Nabi Ogly, our special correspondent in  Ankara, has interviewed President Demirel. We now present the  report he has dispatched to Baku:    [Begin recording] [Nabi Ogly] Have you studied the recent  packages for the settlement of the Karabakh dispute? Can you  comment on the matter?    [Demirel] We are confronted with conditions that change  every  day. The Armenians cannot achieve anything by fighting and  occupying Azerbaijan's territory. Turkey cannot agree to the  occupation of Azerbaijan's territory. The Armenians are  neighbors of Turkey and Azerbaijan. They have been entrapped.  In view of that, the most reasonable approach by Armenia would  be to agree to abandon its attempts to occupy part of  Azerbaijan's territory by force.    The Armenians have occupied a significant part of  Azerbaijan's territory. No solution can be found to resolve the  dispute if they do not withdraw. The Armenians may rely on  whoever they wish, however, they are faced with significant  problems. Fighting a war with Azerbaijan is depleting their  resources.    It is a fact that 1 million people in Azerbaijan have become  refugees. That is a pitiful and shameful situation. I cannot  think of anything more tyrannical than forcing those people to  abandon their homes and property.    Azerbaijan is the side that has suffered. An injustice has  been done to that republic. Finding a peaceful solution to the  dispute will, as I have already mentioned, depend on the  Armenians' withdrawal from all the occupied territories,  including Terterskiy, Kelbadzharskiy, Agdamskiy, Fizulinskiy,  Lachinskiy, and Shushinskiy Rayons. Azerbaijan's territorial  integrity is acknowledged by the entire world. Regarding the  situation in Karabakh, the status there can be discussed later.  [end recording]</p>

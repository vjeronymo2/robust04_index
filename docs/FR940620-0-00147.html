			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.3(6)&blank;Street Identification and Other Pedestrian Signage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (6) requires that pedestrian signage comply with ADAAG 4.30.2 (Character Proportion), 4.30.3 (Character Height), and 4.30.5 (Finish and Contrast). It further requires that bus route identification signs provided on or adjacent to a public sidewalk comply with ADAAG 10.2.1(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM sought comment on whether certain types of pedestrian signage should be made accessible to persons who are blind or have vision impairments and what technologies, such as audible signage, are available to provide orientation information. Although many comments were received from individuals with vision impairments and organizations representing them, no clear consensus emerged. Many commenters, including one national organization representing persons who are blind, stated that properly trained individuals with vision impairments did not need and could not use tactile signs in the public right-of-way because of the lack of standardized placement. These commenters also stated that audible signage might mask other environmental cues and strongly opposed any change to current ADAAG requirements. Other commenters, including three national organizations representing individuals with vision impairments, supported both tactile and audible signage and submitted detailed recommendations and data on currently available technologies. Several commenters noted that tactile bus route signage would be useful. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Demonstration projects of audible signage employing fixed transmitters and portable receivers have been well received by persons with vision impairments. Future rulemaking may consider data resulting from such projects. ADAAG 14.2.3(6) has been clarified by adding requirements for bus route identification signs from ADAAG 10.2.1 (New Construction). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.3(7)&blank;Other Elements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (7) requires that miscellaneous fixed street furnishings and equipment not otherwise covered by prior paragraphs be accessible with respect to approach area, reach ranges, controls, and operating mechanisms and that they be connected to the continuous passage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Department of Transportation and FHWA comments requested guidance on items of street furniture not specifically addressed in the NPRM. Several commenters recommended the inclusion of fire alarm boxes and information kiosks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any fixed object intended for pedestrian use that is installed in the public right-of-way should be accessible. Therefore, a new provision has been added to cover miscellaneous items, such as fire alarm boxes, information kiosks, fixed vending equipment, and trash cans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.4&blank;Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps [14.2.5 in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section requires that newly constructed public sidewalks incorporate a public sidewalk curb ramp at each street crossing where there is a curb or other change in level. This provision clarifies that ADAAG 4.7 (Curb Ramps) and ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps) do not apply to public rights-of-way. It also covers public sidewalk curb ramps provided at other locations (e.g., at accessible on-street parking spaces, passenger loading zones, and similar locations). Technical requirements for location, type, landings, slope, width, edges, surfaces and adjacent surfaces, and obstructions to public sidewalk curb ramp construction are provided. Appendix notes clarify the requirements for landings, the types of public sidewalk curb ramps, and recommendations for uniform applications. A note also explains that application of these guidelines does not require greater right-of-way width than that established by State or local plan or practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed a series of sequential exceptions for public sidewalk curb ramp construction and an alternative method of measuring ramp slopes to allow for conditions of site infeasibility. Many commenters found the sequence difficult to follow and apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, this section has been reorganized to place new construction and alterations requirements in separate provisions and to clarify that site infeasibility applies only to alterations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters, including all of those from organizations representing persons with disabilities, supported the approach outlined in the NPRM that requires public sidewalk curb ramps to serve all street crossings, regardless of the slope of the adjacent public sidewalk. As DREDF stated in its response, ``Even on steep sites, persons using motorized chairs or receiving assistance can use ramps, and they should be available if there is a pedestrian walkway.'' Others were concerned about the safety of persons using steeply sloping public sidewalk curb ramps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

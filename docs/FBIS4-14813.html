			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Shvedov] </F>   [Text] Delhi, 1 Apr -- The Government of Pakistan will  allocate Tajikistan $20 million in payment for purchasing  Pakistani consumer goods. This is one of the results of the  visit to Pakistan by an official delegation from Tajikistan  headed by Supreme Council Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov. During  the course of the talks held in Islamabad, the parties agreed to  study the possibility of carrying out a joint project worth $500  million to erect a powerful electric power station in the south  of Tajikistan. According to the plan, Pakistan should receive  power from the station across the territory of Afghanistan.    At their meeting, the Tajik leader discussed with Pakistan's  President Faruq Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto a wide  range of international issues concerning, among other things,  the situation in central and southwest Asia. The head of the  Pakistani government said, among other things, that the unstable  situation in neighboring Afghanistan and Tajikistan was having a  negative effect on the situation throughout the Central Asian  region. Bhutto expressed the hope that the strife in these two  countries would be ended as soon as possible. She also stressed  that the use of military force to solve controversial problems  was unacceptable both for the Tajik and Afghan peoples.    In turn, Rakhmonov said that with the start of talks in  Moscow between the Tajik leadership and the opposition, the  situation in the republic would undergo serious alterations  toward normalization. Tajikistan will soon come out of its  political and economic crisis, he declared.    Another important result of the talks held in the Pakistani  capital was the signing by Tajikistan and Pakistan of a protocol  on developing amicable relations between the two countries as  well as an agreement to expand bilateral economic cooperation.</p>

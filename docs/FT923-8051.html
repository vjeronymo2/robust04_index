			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Bonn backs health budget curbs: Doctors and dentists threaten strikes over cost-cutting reforms THE GERMAN cabinet yesterday shrugged off widespread opposition to its planned health reforms and approved measures which could save the state-subsidised system more than DM11bn (Pounds 3.9bn) a year. Coalition leaders approved the package put forward by Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, in spite of strike threats by doctors and dentists, a pledge from the Social Democrat opposition to use its blocking majority in the Bundesrat, and fears of constitutional complications. The plan, which caused protests when first aired in June, will be given its first reading in the Bundestag on September 11. It includes proposals for increased charges for patients totalling DM3.2bn a year. Economies on drugs, doctors' and dentists' fees and hospital charges are worth a further DM8.2bn. Defending his scheme yesterday, Mr Seehofer said payments from health insurance funds were increasing at double the rate of contributions. Bonn, which is also committed to a freeze on public spending until 1995, is expected to have to subsidise health care by more than DM10bn this year, compared with DM5.5bn in 1991. The federal government has shied away from increasing employee contributions because reducing take-home pay would lead to union demands for higher wages to compensate for the loss, increasing inflationary pressure. The package was 'a bitter pill', Mr Seehofer said, but the alternative of increased insurance contributions was 'politically wrong, economically dangerous and socially unjust'. An offer to use part of the savings to employ 13,000 more nurses cut no ice with his political and professional opponents. The Social Democrat opposition threatened to deploy its blocking majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house, to bar increases in patient contributions and structural changes proposed in the minister's package. Mr Karsten Vilmar, president of the federal doctors' association, said he could not exclude the possibility of strikes in protest at the changes. Dentists have already threatened action. The reforms may also run into constitutional objections. Some ministers suggested that plans to limit the number of doctors operating within the state-subsidised system might be interpreted as interference with a citizen's right to practise his or her occupation. The minister's plan, which includes an obligation for consultants to pay half their private fees to the hospitals in which they work, and the introduction of a 10 per cent contribution from patients to drug costs, is mainly a holding operation. His aim is first to restrain current cost increases, and follow up in 1995 with structural changes. Meanwhile, hospitals will be forced to economise and drug companies will have to freeze their prices for two years at a level 5 per cent below those applying in May this year. The volume of drugs prescribed will be controlled, with the aim of bringing it down to 1991 levels. Funds show surge out of Germany, Page 2</p>

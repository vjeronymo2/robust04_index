			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by M. Oysboyt, chairman of the Kaliningrad Oblast </F> branch of the Chernobyl Union: ``Submarine That Cannot Sail...''  -- first paragraph is KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA introduction]    [Text] Discussion around the possibility and expediency of  building an underground nuclear power plant in our oblast --  judging by the number of letters from our readers -- still draws  attention. We have published articles by Mr. Dolgov, a  representative of the joint stock company Malakhit, and Mr.  Leonov, commander of the APLK-27 submarine boat, who have called  on citizens of our region to mature to the understanding that  building a nuclear power plant in our oblast is necessary. In  response to these appeals, ordinary citizens of Kaliningrad  Oblast have sent us letters objecting to this idea. M. Oysboyt,  chairman of the Kaliningrad Oblast branch of the Chernobyl  Union, has also joined the discussion. His position and  justified criticisms have made us rethink other aspects of this  issue.    The idea of constructing a nuclear power plant in our oblast  was first suggested by Dolgov, a representative of the joint  stock company Malakhit, which was once working on designs for  nuclear reactor steam-generating machines for the defense  industry. The approaching conversion has made the designers  seek a nice wrapping for the introduction of their products on  ``peaceful'' markets. In other words, the ``atomic lobby'' has  tried to pour new blood into an old industry which was damaged  along with the Chernobyl reactor. In other countries, the  lobby's synonym is the ``nuclear Mafia.'' I dare say that it is  the most dangerous one. There have been many cases when  top-level officials from different oblast administrations, or  even the government, who were previously sharply opposed to this  lobby, have suddenly changed their opinions completely. It is  quite obvious with what this has been connected.    The apparently absolute nuclear security and safe operation  of the proposed type of reactors with liquid metal heaters serve  as arguments for building an underground nuclear power plant in  Kaliningrad Oblast, and the underground location of the plant is  portrayed as additional security. At least three aspects here  are alarming. The first two have already been presented -- the  failure of a similar reactor on the APLK-27, the causes of which  are still unknown, and the well-known vacuum reactivity effect,  another inherent fault of this type of reactor.    There is also a more recent example: Russian VESTI has  reported that a leak of radioactive sodium occurred during a  recent accident at the Beloyarskaya nuclear power plant.  Apparently, the accident involved the recommended type of  reactor with a liquid metal heater. Sodium is used in no other  type of reactor. The secure operation of underground nuclear  power plants also raises doubts. Such a plant will rather  resemble a nuclear submarine that cannot come to the surface.  Every component of this system may provoke an emergency  situation. The number of emergency situations at currently  operating nuclear power plants and submarines is listed in the  three-digit range. I will cite a sample from a report by the  Government Commission for Investigating Causes of the Chernobyl  Nuclear Power Plant Breakdown.    ``There has been no single year without an emergency  situation at the nuclear power plant... There have been 1,042  emergency stoppages of power units over the last five years;  among them, only 35 percent have occurred due to human error.''    This means that the remaining 65 percent were caused by  technical malfunctions and led to serious consequences. The  most frequent emergency situation on nuclear submarines is fire.  An analysis of the causes of fires on Soviet and U.S. Navy  nuclear submarines shows that 70 percent of such accidents have  been caused by short circuits in electric switchboards and  wires, which are connected with technical defects. There are  twice as many electric wires in a nuclear power plant as on a  submarine. Whereas a nuclear submarine can surface and call for  help from other naval vessel, an underground nuclear power plant  will not sail, and therefore, politely speaking, it is very hard  to extinguish a fire in one.    There is an array of intermediate scenarios between these  two  extremes, but it is obvious that a number of problems will have  to be solved over the coming decades or even centuries,  depending on the half-lives or degeneration of nuclear  components. There are also two intriguing economic aspects of  building a nuclear power plant. The first one is that the  Malakhit joint stock company will charge only for designing a  nuclear power plant, which will take three or five years. Who  will built it, provide necessary supplies, and complete the  work? All Malakhit needs right now is money, and later it will  somehow be built. The second aspect is that those who have  suffered from nuclear arms research have been asking who is  responsible for that after these many years. Who is to pay  compensation for possible accidents?    My position is clear: We do not need such problems.  However, neither the current administration nor future  parliament will have the right to resolve this problem. I am  deeply convinced that only the entire population of our oblast,  having complete information about the risks facing them as well  as possible profits and losses, can decide whether they want to  live in such a neighborhood. This can be done only by way of a  region-wide referendum.</p>

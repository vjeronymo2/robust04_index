			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Observer: Strung out Alarmed by the recent turn of events in Russia, the organisers of a British school party about to take the St Petersburg-to-Moscow train, contacted the travel advice unit at the Foreign Office. It replied that while it could not accept liability for injury, loss or damage arising from its advice, it did recommend that train travellers secure the door of their compartments with 'wire or strong cord'. Back at the school, the teachers are anxious to prevent the secret leaking out to some of their more unruly pupils. If it does, 'they'll all want to go,' says one nervous organiser.</p>

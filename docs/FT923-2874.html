			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / N Korea refuses to budge NORTH Korea is showing no sign of making concessions on closer ties with South Korea, despite increased diplomatic isolation as the prime ministers of both sides begin a new round of talks in Pyongyang today. Although South Korea's bargaining position has been bolstered by the recent establishment of diplomatic relations with China, North Korea's main ally, this has apparently not persuaded the North to seek a compromise with Seoul. North and South Korea signed reconciliation and non-nuclear agreements last December, but negotiations to implement these pacts have reached stalemate. South Korea is demanding that North Korea accept challenge inspections of its suspected nuclear research facilities and is refusing to provide economic investment until Pyongyang accedes to the request. 'No substantial progress in relations between the South and the North will be possible without finding a bona fide resolution to the nuclear issue,' South Korean Prime Minister Chung Won-shik said in a speech at the welcoming dinner in Pyongyang last night. Only limited progress has been made in reaching agreement on other steps to promote closer co-operation between the two Koreas. A scheduled reunion of separated Korean families from the two sides last month was cancelled due to the impasse in negotiations.</p>

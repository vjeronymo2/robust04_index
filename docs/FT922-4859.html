			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Fujimori's promise leaves many questions: Sceptics, home in ona lack of detail IN LINE with his commitment to the meeting in the Bahamas of the Organisation of American States (OAS) two weeks ago, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has announced elections for October 18. The Peruvian people are to elect an 80-strong, one-chamber congress. This would draft a new constitution to be submitted to the people in a referendum, Mr Fujimori said. His Monday night televised announcement was inexplicably delayed for 24 hours but still came as a relief to foreign observers accustomed to abrupt presidential retreats from apparently cast-iron commitments. While Mr Fujimori gave no details of the election mechanisms by which the congressmen would be chosen, he has invited OAS and other international observers to scrutinise and even advise on the electoral process. Many other questions also remain unanswered. The government has promised a new law to 'democratise' the internal functioning of Peru's political parties and to eliminate the practice of electing candidates by lists, but Mr Fujimori evaded the issue in his address. Neither did he mention the legislative and watchdog powers he had earlier proposed. Politicians were enraged by the condition that anyone elected to the constituent congress will be disbarred from standing for parliament for 10 years. They say this is for the congress itself to determine. One senior western diplomat said that the moves were 'almost entirely the result of external economic pressures. Mr Fujimori realised, albeit late in the day, that everything he'd worked for during his term of office was about to collapse with the suspension of international aid.' The definitive turn of the international screw was provided by Japan, Peru's chief economic lifeline. The Japanese government had initially expressed 'understanding' of Mr Fujimori's April 5 suspension of the constitution on the grounds that parliament and the courts were blocking economic modernisation and his counter-subversive and drugs-trafficking offensives. But Tokyo, just days before the OAS decision on economic sanctions against Peru, spelled out that, without a swift return to democracy, Japan would also cut off assistance. That Mr Fujimori managed to cobble together a last-ditch, face-saving proposal for the OAS was largely due to Mr Hernando de Soto, the think-tank chief who, until early this year, was Mr Fujimori's chief adviser on drugs and international relations. Mr de Soto has for years been promoting a project for 'democratising the government decision-making process'. That project provided the intellectual meat for Mr Fujimori's Bahamas proposal. If Mr Fujimori were to follow the de Soto proposals to the letter, then Peru would indeed have democracy. However, Mr Diego Garcia Sayan, president of the Andean Commission of Jurists, is one of many sceptics. 'Mr Fujimori's discourse lacks coherence,' he says. 'It is totally ingenuous to believe that a basically authoritarian president and a de facto regime that rely on the tactics of improvisation and surprise can install a real democracy.' In one advance, Mr Fujimori has reinstated the 1979 constitution pending approval of the new one, 'except for those articles which impede the progress of this government'. But jurists and human rights organisations remain alarmed that penalties for those involved in the 'disappearances' of alleged terrorists have been erased from the statute books. The April 5 measures appear to have done little to curb subversive activity, and much of Mr Fujimori's support is founded on the hopes that his hard-line approach to fighting subversion will work. Economic stabilisation and future growth hinge on the defeat of terrorism, which has cost the state an estimated Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.1bn) in 12 months, about the same as Peru's foreign debt. With international economic assistance suspended since democracy was overthrown, the already precarious balance of payments position has been further exacerbated. A Dollars 2bn reserves war-chest will cushion the economy for this year, but sweeping debt rescheduling, particularly with Peru's Paris Club creditors, will be essential by the end of the year. And a clean return to democracy will be a pre-condition. Mr Fujimori is reiterating his commitment to turning Peru into a fully-fledged market economy, 'a country for business' he called it on Monday night. He is promising 'definitive stabilisation and the integral reinsertion of Peru in the world system'. Wherever possible, he says, this process will be speeded up. Announcements by Peru's economy minister and privatisation chief in New York last week indicate that the government will now countenance use of debt instruments in the long-delayed privatisation process. Tight domestic liquidity meant that, for local entrepreneurs, the rounding up of a modest Dollars 1.3m last week to buy the first state-owned mine was a major feat. The government knows it will need to provide special incentives to attract purchasers for the public sector giants now in the privatisation pipeline. Mr Fujimori's announcement may be enough to appease the international political community. But re-establishment of fledgling investor confidence and the urgently needed inflow of private capital is likely to be a much longer haul.</p>

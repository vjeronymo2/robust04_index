			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Transatlantic morning after JAM TOMORROW, but never jam today. The stock market reaction to a week of dreary economic news has been instructive. The FT-SE Index has retreated 65 points, or about 2.4 per cent; but much of the fall came well ahead of the main economic news. This suggests that the market was falling simply because it was over-bought, as technicians had warned that it would. The bad news, of flat retail sales, a continued housing slump and weak car exports, seems to have come as no surprise. The forecasting consensus in the City has virtually caught up with the pessimism of its monetarist minority, who got it right all along. Whitehall leaks suggest that the government is also getting used to the idea of a flat 1992. What remains to be seen is how business and consumer confidence will stand up to disappointment. If the unchanging facts arouse new insecurity about jobs, or find shops overstocked and production schedules overambitious, the news itself could get worse before the trend stabilises. For real recovery, wait a bit longer - possibly until 1993. How did we get locked into this recurring cycle of hope deferred? The clearest explanation has been offered not in London, but in Washington. The US economy is now a full year into statistical recovery, but continues to disappoint. The Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, has commented on this with a candour which is itself a strong argument for an independent central bank. He says, in effect, that we are off the map. This is the worst credit crisis for 60 years, and the models which generate economic forecasts have no experience to guide them. Micawberish hope Mr Greenspan has always warned of the downside risk - partly to justify the enormous fall in short-term interest rates which the Fed has engineered. Whitehall has been very reluctant to catch up with his thinking, and persisted in a Micawberish hope that something will turn up - partly because membership of the ERM forbids any dramatic easing of monetary policy in response to disappointing reality. This obstacle has led some monetarists to blame all our troubles on the ERM, but the parallel disappointments across the Atlantic, and indeed in Japan, show that this cannot be the whole story. While there are marked contrasts between the three economies, the over-borrowing permitted during the late 1980s has led to a similar hangover in all of them. Property and asset prices have fallen, reducing personal and corporate wealth (most heavily in Japan); the banks have come under heavy strain, which has forced them to cut their lending and raise their charges (especially in the US); and personal and corporate spending has fallen as borrowers try to reduce their debt burden (most markedly in the UK). It is these confidence and wealth effects which have disrupted the forecasting models. Biggest obstacle However, if the disease looks much the same, the cures in the three countries are quite different. In Japan the biggest obstacle is the disgrace which the financial markets have suffered; it is almost impossible to finance new enterprises. In the US, which is at last beginning to face up to its national debt crisis (urged on, to much applause, by Mr Ross Perot), Washington has run out of prescriptions. The only promising stimulus must be sought from net exports (which have supported more than half of total US growth over the last five years); only this will raise employment and so revive the home market. The Americans will therefore continue to badger trade partners (especially Germany) for a stimulus, as they have often done before. British commentators may also be tempted to badger the Germans, but ministers know better. The two countries share a central objective, to defeat inflation, and no-one (least of all Mr John Major) has ever believed that this would be easy or costless. With an election victory behind them, ministers will be more than ever ready to soldier on. If this involves some years of painfully slow growth, as it has in France, so be it - at any rate until the next election looms. This need not mean that there is nothing the British can do except grit their teeth. In a fascinating speech in Rome the Bank of England's chief economist, Dr Mervyn King, argued that there is no inherent reason why the German rate of interest should be a floor for all other members of the ERM; it is simply a question of market confidence in their exchange rate commitment (in two words, street cred). He forecast that within the year someone would follow the French in testing this proposition by cutting domestic rates below those ruling in Frankfurt, and he can only have meant the UK. There are two difficulties with this strategy. It may be hard for ministers to establish market credibility unless the trade figures improve markedly; and even if a King experiment succeeded, any likely rate cut would be small. There remain what Dr King calls 'alternative ways of dealing with shocks' - tax adjustments and public investment. This is marginal stuff, again; it's still jam tomorrow.</p>

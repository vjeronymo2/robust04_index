The ruling parties basically agreed to  accept the LDP's proposal that a regulation on a limit on the  public raising of funds for political parties should be included  in the Law on Fund Raising for Political Parties. However, the  ruling parties and the LDP failed to agree on the LDP's other  proposal that "corporate status should be given to political  parties" to clarify responsibilities of political parties which  will receive subsidies. They will discuss this issue again and  also the issue of the regulation on funding limits on 24  February.    Regarding an issue of setting a limit on the public raising  of funds for political parties, both sides basically agreed on  the LDP's proposal that the amount of public funds allowed to be  raised should be limited to less than two-thirds of the amount  of revenue -- which does not include the amount of funds  political parties raised publicly during the previous year.  Concerning the issue of giving corporate status to political  parties, they failed to reach an accord because participants  from the ruling parties, one after another, said: "Giving  corporate status to political parties would invite intervention  by the administration. There is a possibility that `the freedom  of association' will be violated by restricting political  parties' activities. This issue should be cautiously discussed."</p>

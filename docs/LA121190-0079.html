			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLE-PLAGUED SHUTTLE LANDS SAFELY AT NIGHT  </P> <P> Descending from a clear, starlit desert night sky, the space shuttle Columbia  landed safely here late Monday, ending a nine-day mission marked by technical  glitches and scientific advances.  </P> <P> The shuttle touched down at 9:54 p.m. before a crowd of just more than 500 who  braved 37-degree temperatures. "Houston, wheels are stopped at Edwards. We're  home," said Vance D. Brand, commander of the Columbia.  </P> <P> "Roger that, Columbia. Welcome home. Beautiful landing. Outstanding job," said  astronaut Mike Baker from the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </P> <P> An approaching cold front bringing threatening weather forced NASA officials to  cut the mission short by one day. The night landing, which ends the 38th  shuttle mission and the 10th flight for Columbia, was the fourth in shuttle  history.  </P> <P> The launch of the shuttle was plagued by delays and the mission hampered by  technical problems, but nevertheless yielded significant astronomical data.  </P> <P> Shortly after the launch, both computers that were to point the four telescopes  that study ultraviolet light and X-rays and lock them on their targets failed  to work. The crew later found that lint clogging the air vents caused both  computers to overheat.  </P> <P> The astronauts overcame the potentially mission-threatening glitch by working  with technicians at Mission Control at the Marshall Space Flight Center in  Huntsville, Ala., who radioed commands to point the telescopes in the general  direction of their targets. Then the astronomers, working with a joystick  similar to those used on video games, aimed the telescopes and locked them on  target.  </P> <P> Later, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials thought they  would have to cut the flight short by one day because the drain tube for the  waste disposal system jammed. The crew had to pump the waste water into plastic  bags, restoring the system to working capacity.  </P> <P> NASA spokesman Don Haley acknowledged that "as far as problems that were  visible," this mission was probably the most trouble-plagued flight other than  the Challenger explosion.  </P> <P> Despite the difficulties, NASA officials are elated at the volume of data the  telescopes have yielded. "They collected more science than scientists and  astronomers can assimilate," Haley said.  </P> <P> The Astro Observatory aboard the Columbia contains four telescopes that can  detect X-rays and ultraviolet light that are obscured by the Earth's  atmosphere. They provided scientists with valuable data on various planets,  stars and galaxies.  </P> <P> Two of the telescopes also provided unprecedented evidence that indicates the  existence of black holes.  </P> <P> Monday night, scientists reflected on their roller-coaster nine days at  Marshall Space Flight Center. "For the scientists, we're just beginning" to  study all the exciting data collected, said mission scientist Theodore Gull,  who said he "broke down" after the emotional conclusion of science activity.  "We know we are going to help rewrite the textbooks."  </P> <P> Despite the telescope-pointing problems, which meant only 135 of 250 planned  observations were made, the science part of the mission ended on the upswing,  with the astronauts targeting a fast-moving comet just minutes before the three  ultraviolet instruments were shut down.  </P> <P> The workhorse Broad Band X-ray Telescope -- built at Goddard Space Flight  Center and pointed independent of the Astro crew from a control room at the  Greenbelt, Md., center -- operated for several more hours, taking a final look  at a distant galaxy.  </P> <P> "We went out with a bang," said Arthur Davidsen, who heads the team that built  the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at Johns Hopkins University.  </P> <P> Brand, 58, completed his fourth shuttle mission. Other crew members are pilot  Guy S. Gardner, mission specialists Jeffrey A. Hoffman, John M. Lounge, Robert  A. R. Parker, and payload specialists and civilian astronomers Samuel T.  Durrance and Ronald A. Parise.  </P></p>

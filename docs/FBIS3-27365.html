The  so-called second boundary, which separates the booming zone from  neighbouring rural counties, is 40 kilometres long and three  metres high.    "There have been more migrant workers here than ever  before,"  Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda said yesterday. He said more than 75  per cent of the city's crime could be linked to such workers.  Last year more than 240,000 migrant workers flooded into  Zhuhai, straining the city's limited police department and  social services, Mr Liang said.    However, officials in Guangdong province have indicated the  influx of workers into the Pearl River Estuary area has been  brought under control. A cadre at the provincial Labour Bureau  said yesterday "things are in order" in Guangzhou. The official  refused to give an estimate of the size of the influx, but the  director of the province's Communications and Transport Bureau,  Li Peiwu, said this week the number of job seekers province-wide  was about eight per cent less than last year's figure.  Congestion on trains had decreased because an increasing number  of migrant workers were using special coaches chartered by their  employers, he said. Guangdong has reached arrangements with  nine other provinces, including Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan and  Henan, since last year to better control the flow of workers  from these areas. Workers moving to Guangdong need to hold  three types of identification before they can be employed.    The semi-official China News Service reported yesterday that  eight people were killed and six injured in a collision between  a coach and a car on the busy highway between Guangzhou and the  special economic zone of Shantou in southern Guangdong province.</p>

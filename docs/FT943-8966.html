			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: Struck out on the field of dreams - Patrick Harverson says a players' strike is ludicrous and should be banned / Baseball The Lexington Avenue express is not the only means of getting to Yankee Stadium, but it is by far the most satisfying. The subway train rumbles through Harlem and under the Bronx River to emerge blinking into the sunlight alongside the great ballpark. As the train pulls into the 161st Street station, the appetite is whetted by a tantalising glimpse between the stands of the lush grass in rightfield. As I stepped off the train last week, I experienced the familiar rush of excitement as thousands of other baseball fans walked up River Avenue to join the long lines at the ticket booths. The division-leading Yankees, who this season have been playing their best baseball in 13 years, were at home to the Cleveland Indians, and Yankee Stadium seemed the perfect place to be in New York on a warm Saturday afternoon in mid-summer. At Dollars 11.50 a seat, watching the Yankees is not cheap, but for that you get an upper deck seat in the sun, three or more hours of major league baseball, and a big, lovely slice of history. Yankee Stadium is not just any old sports ground. It is known as 'The House that Ruth Built', after the great Babe Ruth, whose exploits attracted the huge crowds which ultimately paid for the stadium's construction. When it opened in 1923, Yankee Stadium was the wonder of the sports world, with its imposing entrance and spectacular two-tier stands. It remains so today, even after a mid-1970s facelift that changed much of the way it looks but which, thankfully, left history intact. The seats high in the upper deck afforded a splendid view. As the Yankee players jogged out for the opening inning against Cleveland, the bright white of their uniforms sparkled against the green of the outfield and the brown earth of the diamond-shaped basepaths. While the outfielders languidly tossed balls around as they awaited the arrival of the Indians' first batter, I bought a hot dog from one of the vendors who roam the stands shouting 'Dawgs - Who Wants Dawgs?' in mustard-thick accents. Yet my enjoyment of the game was marred by the certain knowledge that the Yankees' great run of 1994 was heading for a premature end. This was not because I had had some premonition that the team was going to stop playing the smart, unfussy baseball that had taken it to the top of the table, but because I knew the team was going to stop playing, full stop. Just days before the Cleveland game, the players' union had announced plans for an indefinite strike, starting on August 12, to protest against the baseball owners insistence on including in the new labour contract a salary cap - a limit on the total amount each team can pay its players. The owners, who have been unable to agree among themselves on how to divide baseball's revenues so that the clubs in smaller cities such as Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and San Diego are not forced into extinction trying to compete with the wealthy, big-spending clubs in cities such as New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, view the salary cap as a way of controlling their rapidly-escalating costs. The players regard the cap as an infringement of the free market and oppose pay limits. Yesterday, the union made good on its threat, and the 1994 season - so far a marvellous one, full of promise, not just for the Yankees but for other teams, and for several players who are poised to break some of baseball's oldest records - came to an inglorious halt. The strike is maddening. Irrespective of the merits, or otherwise, of the players' actions, there is something ludicrous about millionaire sportsmen striking against multi-millionaire owners in an argument over money. As anyone who watches a game or reads the sports pages knows, there is plenty of money in baseball. The average salary for a player is Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 770,000) a year. Revenues from attendance, television contracts and merchandising total almost Dollars 2bn a year. And the 28 teams of Major League Baseball are estimated to be worth a combined Dollars 2.5bn. With that much money swilling around, it is remarkable that a way cannot be found to share the bounty of America's national game. Not only is the strike ludicrous, but there should be a law against it. Indeed, were it any other US sport there would be: earlier this summer, baseball managed to fight off an attempt in Congress to overturn its precious, and unique, exemption from anti-trust laws. Both the owners and the players have overlooked something important in their dispute: the fans. It is they, after all, who pay everyone's wages. This may be a cliche, but it is true. The players are not paid millions of dollars because a home run, a strike, or a great catch are of themselves valuable commodities. Gold, oil, copper - these are valuable commodities. A home run is valuable because people are willing to pay to see it happen, either in the flesh or on television. If people were not willing to pay to watch big league baseball, players could hit all the home runs they wanted but would still never earn a cent. Everyone in the business of baseball is party to a three-sided contract between the players, the owners, and the fans. The players have broken that contract. The owners are equally culpable for having made such a hash of their own affairs. The fans should sue. If they do not sue (and this being America, someone probably will), fans will be left to do what they spend much of the year doing anyway - moaning about the greedy players and greedier owners. A few were energised enough this week to plan a fans' strike, but little came of it. Why? Because fans - the poor pathetic things they are - love baseball, even if baseball does not love them. Thursday was the last chance to see a game before the shutters came down, and hundreds of thousands paid to do just that. Now the baseball bats are silent. Yankee Stadium should have been alive this Saturday with the sound of 40,000 fans cheering on their team against the world champions from Toronto. Instead, the great ballpark will be deserted. And the Lexington express from Manhattan will rumble past almost empty. All that will be on offer at Yankee Stadium is that inviting glimpse of the lush, green grass in rightfield.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (11): Star performance after slow start - Venezuela / Privatisation THE Venezuelan government's privatisation programme, announced with considerable fanfare after the government of President Carlos Andres Perez took office in early 1989, got off to a very slow start. Late in 1990 the Venezuelan Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela (FIV)), the government agency charged with carrying out privatisation, sold the first state asset, a majority package of shares in a commercial bank called Banco Occidental de Descuento. But last year, Venezuela's privatisation programme put in a star performance, obtaining Dollars 2.2bn in extra revenues for the government. Through open bidding, the FIV sold off 60 per cent of shares in the government's international airline, Viasa, to Iberia; sold two more commercial banks (Italo Venezolano and Republica); a shipyard (Astinave); a large sugar mill (El Tocuyo); a franchise to operate a cellular (mobile) telephone system and the state-owned telecommunications company, CANTV. By itself, CANTV would have made the privatisation programme a success. The government received Dollars 1.89bn for 40 per cent of shares in the telephone company, an equity package that allows the buyer to have full operating control. The successful bid, made by an international consortium headed by GTE (US), was Dollars 1bn above the government's minimum price. Winning bidders must pay cash, and no debt-equity swaps are permitted. This year, the FIV also has sold four hotels - the sales agreement was signed a day after a military uprising was put down on February 4 - and plans several other auctions. Government assets to be sold this year include eight more hotels; Aeropostal, an airline on domestic and international routes; six sugar mills; the National Racetrack Institute (INH), which owns horse and dog-racing tracks and other assets; the water company serving the Caracas metropolitan area; and two or more regional electric power companies (Enelven and Eneblar). Other assets that may be sold are additional electric generating companies; franchises to run toll highways; another shipyard (Dianca); a leading salt producer (Ensal) and metal companies. The government does not intend selling any parts of its profitable domestic petroleum assets, but it wants to attract foreign investment for joint ventures in exploration and production, refining and other sectors. The government also has considerable holdings in petrochemicals, where it works in a variety of joint ventures with Venezuelan and international partners. There are no plans to sell any of these assets. The government is also considering selling parts of the state-owned CVG (Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana), which controls the country's heavy industry. The announcement was made by Mr Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon, who as minister of state and president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, is the head of Venezuela's privatisation programme. Although no firm decision has been made, Mr Moreno said one candidate for privatisation would be Sidor, the government-owned steel producer. Sidor, which has had problems but recently made a profit, according to government figures, is the largest steelmaker. Over the past few years, Japanese investors considered starting a new steel complex in conjunction with Sidor, but decided against it. Aside from Sidor, the CVG group includes Venalum, the world's largest aluminium smelter (a joint venture between the CVG and several Japanese companies), other aluminium companies, iron ore and gold mining operations, and Edelca, the largest hydroelectric company.</p>

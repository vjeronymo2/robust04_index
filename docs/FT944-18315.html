			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Unravelling the Banesto tangle - Chairman Alfredo Saenz talks to Tom Burns about the Conde legacy The modern building on Madrid's central Castellana boulevard where Mr Alfredo Saenz has his office is an ironic example of the problems that he, Spain's best-known banking troubleshooter, has inherited from Mr Mario Conde, his predecessor at Banesto. In 1990 Mr Conde, seeking to build up Banesto's balance sheet, sold a real estate group which owned the bank's Castellana offices to a business associate at a greatly inflated price. As the associate, who owned the leisure group Oasis, did not have the cash for the acquisition, Mr Conde had Banesto lend it to him. Oasis could not meet the interests on the loan, so Mr Conde arranged to have Banesto lease the building over 12 years, paying in rent the equivalent of the loan's principle and interest. 'What do you make of a deal like that?' asks Mr Saenz in his first interview as chairman of Banesto. He is now in the middle of what he calls a 'divorce' from Oasis (Mr Conde had Banesto's Industrial Corporation buy 50 per cent of the leisure group). Banesto is suing Oasis over a business arrangement that Mr Saenz, choosing his words carefully, says was not 'fair'. Mr Saenz arrived at Banesto as caretaker chairman on December 28, hours after the Bank of Spain, alleging gross mismanagement of the the banking group, had removed Mr Conde and his fellow board members. Four months later, Banesto was acquired for Pta281bn (Dollars 2.2bn) by Banco Santander. Mr Saenz has a variety of messes to sort out, and some will undoubtably end up with the public prosecutors who are examining Mr Conde's business dealings during his six-year reign as chairman. But he is also quietly confident that he will rebuild Banesto's 2,500 domestic branch unit into a leading Spanish retail bank. The bank was on course to lose some Pta55bn this year. However, the haemorrhage was already stemmed in the first half - losses stood at Pta21.8bn at the end of June - and the shortfall could be down to some Pta12bn by December. Between January and June, Banesto lost Pta495bn worth of deposits, 12 per cent of the total, but in the third quarter it recovered Pta230bn. The recovery is being fuelled by a rescue plan involving a Pta180bn capital injection, the purchase of Pta285bn worth of non-performing assets by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, and a zero-interest loan of Pta315bn to offset current losses. Banesto's chairman is managing by far the largest lifeboat operation mounted for a Spanish bank. Mr Saenz is also immersed in ridding Banesto of its industrial assets. Recent disposals - involving the battery producer Tudor, the mining company Asturiana de Zinc and the Rioja winery Bodegas Age - has raised some Pta45bn. Banesto's shareholdings in two television stations and in a newspaper group, which were bought by Mr Conde as a platform for his possible entry into politics and have proved costly investments, are also up for sale. With the worst behind him, Mr Saenz is talking about expansion. 'Next year we will begin to open 100 new offices, and they will in good urban locations: in Madrid, in Catalonia and in the Basque Country.' 'When I got here I didn't know where the bathrooms were, let alone the documents, and the first weeks were horrible,' he recalls. He turned himself into an auditor - 'one of the enlightened sort' - and into a consultant. 'In a question of weeks, I had to discover what the possibilities of a recovery were and where the bank should go if it did recover.' Mr Saenz, who had been 'lent' by his employers, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, where he was first vice-president, to sort out the Banesto mess, readily accepted Santander's offer to stay on as chairman. 'The Bank of Spain kept dropping me hints that I was part of the Banesto acquisition package.' What Mr Emilio Botn, chairman of Santander, acquired when he bought Banesto was a plain-talking Basque-born professional. Mr Saenz, 52, who worked in the steel industry before joining Banco Vizcaya (later merged with Banco Bilbao to form BBV) in 1981, made his reputation by turning around Banca Catalana, a bankrupt Barcelona-based institution acquired by Vizcaya from the Guarantee Fund. Mr Saenz is delighted with the financial muscle that Banco Santander provides, and with the 'total management freedom' that Mr Botn has given Banesto's new team, all of whom followed the new chairman from BBV. 'If we foul up, Santander will kick us out at the next AGM,' he says. 'Those are rules of the game that we understand and we are happy to live with them.' Inherent to the 'rules' are that Banesto will be competing directly with Santander - it will open a branch next door to one of its parent's if it believes there are sound business reasons for doing so. Mr Saenz is keen to segment the Banesto business between its strong rural network, the bank's traditional cash cow, and the urban branches he plans to develop. 'I know Emilio Botn very well and I know that real competition, gripping a knife in your teeth, is exactly what he expects. It would be a mistake, in any case, to act differently; at Catalana we competed ferociously with BBV.' Santander owns 67.9 per cent of Banesto but, as part of its acquisition arrangement, will this week be disposing of 13.7 per cent of its equity to existing shareholders. It will offer one new share for every two held at par value of Pta400. 'I would be very surprised if the shareholders don't wholly subscribe the offer,' says Mr Saenz. If the offering is successful, it will not be just because of the give-away pricing. Battered by the Conde experience, the shareholders will, like the shrewd Mr Botn, be putting their faith in a very different chairman.</p>

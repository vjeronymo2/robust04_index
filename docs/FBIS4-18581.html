			<p>BFN     [Text] Among the goals of Political Spring is cooperation  with PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] in the municipal  elections.    During the opening of the party's political office in Samos,  Political Spring Deputy Nikitas Kaklamanis said  characteristically: "...if we find it appropriate, or someone  proposes to us, or we propose to cooperate in some  municipalities, something that is among our goals, I would say  it is more likely to happen with PASOK rather than New  Democracy."    Responding to a correspondent's question on possible  cooperation between Political Spring and other political parties  in the election of the president, Kaklamanis said that the  institution of the presidency cannot, in any case, be part of  any kind of political commercialization or exchange.</p>

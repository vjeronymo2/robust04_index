			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Signs of thaw for HK talks SINO-BRITISH talks on the future of Hong Kong resume in Beijing today with the British side hoping that discussions can progress towards substantial negotiations. China yesterday gave approval to three key Hong Kong franchises after an informal meeting in the colony of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, suggesting a further thawing in relations between the two sides. The contracts had already been approved by the Hong Kong government, but were caught up in the political backlash that followed the announcement of Governor Chris Patten's political reform proposals. China said it would not recognise new franchises handed out by Hong Kong without Beijing approval. Following the meeting, the Wharf group received approval for its HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 420m) cable television project, while Hong Kong Electric has a 15-year extension on its operating licence as monopoly supplier of electricity to Hong Kong island. The third contract was for a land-fill site. Wharf had already spent HKDollars 600m on the cable project on the basis of unofficial assurances from China, while the Hong Kong Electric franchise was never considered at risk. The timing of the announcement, however, is considered auspicious. Last week, the Sino-British land commission agreed on the current fiscal year's land disposal programme. However, the fate of the colony's Container Terminal 9 still hangs in the balance. There are indications that a full Joint Liaison Group meeting may be agreed for June, when the terminal contract will be discussed. The agreements suggest China is prepared to move forward on pressing business matters concerning Hong Kong. The two previous rounds of broader Beijing talks were dominated by a Chinese re-statement of 'guiding principles', which left little room for discussion of specific issues such as the shape of a possible compromise. Beijing charges that Mr Patten's plans to broaden the franchise for Legislative Council elections go beyond understandings reached in negotiations on Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head of its negotiating team, told reporters in Hong Kong before leaving for China that his aim was to reach agreement on 'practical arrangements' for Legco elections due in 1994-95. Sir Robin had been visiting the colony for consultations. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, meanwhile, said the Sino-British talks would produce 'positive results' if both sides were guided by previous agreements on the future of Hong Kong. Earlier this week, Sir Robin was carpeted by China over a meeting in London between Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader. Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, reported that Sir Robin had received a 'stern warning' from a foreign ministry official. It described the Dalai Lama as a 'political exile preaching so-called independence for Tibet and engaged in activities aimed at splitting China.'</p>

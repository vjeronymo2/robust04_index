			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Labour proposes Spring as 'rotating' Irish PM Ireland's search for a new government took an unexpected turn yesterday with Labour proposing Mr Dick Spring, the party leader, as a possible 'rotating' prime minister in a future coalition. Last night a new government composed of Fianna Fail, the largest party, and Labour still seemed the most likely outcome, following the collapse of the outgoing government last week and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister over the controversial paedophile priest extradition case. However Labour's proposal, announced after a meeting of its parliamentary party on Tuesday night, is being seen as a clear overture to Fine Gael, the main opposition party - a conservative group which has been in coalition with Labour before. With parliament adjourned until next Wednesday, Ireland is set for a period of intense political horse trading. Fianna Fail's parliamentary party was meeting yesterday for the first time since the appointment of Mr Bertie Ahern as new leader. However all the attention was on Fine Gael and Labour after the 'rotation' proposal. Mr Spring is widely seen to have been the main beneficiary of last week's crisis with a personal rating in weekend polls at an all time high of 67 per cent. Labour yesterday insisted the issue would be part of any negotiations with either party - Fianna Fail or Fine Gael. Labour and Fine Gael have been in coalition three times before, during 1973 and 1987: it was a Fine Gael Labour government which negotiated both the Sunningdale agreement of 1972 and the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. However relations became strained after the 1992 general election with Labour finally entering government with Fianna Fail. The idea of a 'rotating' prime minister was proposed then by Labour after the party's good showing in the election - and dismissed out of hand by Fine Gael. Today observers believe Fine Gael may prove more receptive. Fine Gael leader John Bruton has not performed well in the polls, although the party has 47 seats against Labour's 33. Fine Gael's deputy leader, Mrs Nora Owen, said only that the party would 'put our proposals on the table when we enter into negotiations.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The European Union (EU)  Commission said Thursday it was considering whether to extend  anti-dumping tariffs on video cassettes made in South Korea and  Hong Kong that are due to expire in June.    The commission is investigating charges by the European  Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federation (CEFIC), which has  expressed concern that the two countries may continue to export  their products at unfair prices in view of their ample  manufacturing potential.    The CEFIC charges that Korean and Hong Kong video cassettes  are sold at one-third the price of European products and that  their dumping margins were actually greater than the  anti-dumping tariff rates imposed. The EU has imposed punitive  duties of 1.9 percent on Saehan Media, 3.8 percent on Sunkyong,  2 percent on Kolon and 2.9 percent on Goldstar since June 1989.    Under the sunset provision, tariff imposition automatically  terminates after five years unless the industry in the host  country calls for an extension.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During his first official visit to Spain, UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali discussed the situation and  today's developments in Bosnia. During his meeting with Spanish  Foreign Minister Javier Solana and in the news conference held  after the meeting, Butrus-Ghali said he does not have any  regrets about it and that he will again request NATO air strikes  in the former Yugoslav republic if the circumstances warrant it,  as they seem to now. Over to our correspondent, Maria Jesus  Castejon.    [Castejon] Today in Madrid the UN secretary general will  start diplomatic moves to stop the serious deterioration of the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    When asked about Russia's criticism of NATO air strikes in  the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, Butrus-Ghali recalled that  Moscow, as well as the other members of the [Security] Council,  approved the use of force to defend the peacekeeping troops.    Ghali stressed that that kind of action will be repeated if  need be.    [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording in English fading to Spanish  translation] I want to confirm that we will not hesitate to ask  for NATO air support as long as we have this mandate from the  [UN Security] Council and as long as we believe that this could  help the search for peace in former Yugoslavia. [end recording]    [Castejon] The UN secretary general informed the Security  Council about the bloody conflict in the central African country  of Rwanda.    Foreign Minister Javier Solana was very pessimistic, because  he fears an escalation of the bloodbath over the next few hours.    [Begin Solana recording] Consider for a moment that in a  very  few hours, very few hours, hundreds of thousands of deaths took  place, hundreds of thousands of deaths, which means something  absolutely terrible for any conscience of the least, the very  least sensibility. [end recording]    [Castejon] Solana said our country does not plan to send  blue  helmets to Rwanda. It is waiting for the Security Council to  decide what to do with the 400 blue helmets already deployed, or  whether it will send another peacekeeping force.</p>

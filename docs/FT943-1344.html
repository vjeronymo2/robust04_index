			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Unilever detergent comes under renewed criticism Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, suffered a fresh attack on its new-generation washing powder yesterday. The influential Consumers' Association in Britain said the first version of the detergent produced 'substantial damage to some clothes' in laboratory tests, even when 'normal recommended low-temperature programmes' were used. Early tests by the association have also suggested that Unilever's reformulated version of the detergent might damage clothes. Unilever admitted on Thursday that the detergent - sold in Britain as Persil Power and in continental Europe as Omo Power - was 'defective', but said trouble arose only if it was used at high temperature. The original version was launched this spring but replaced in June after Procter &amp; Gamble, arch-rivals in the Pounds 6bn-a-year European detergent market, said tests by it showed the detergent could 'rot' clothes. The latest version contains less of the manganese catalyst 'accelerator' which is the powder's patented ingredient. Yesterday's attack came as Unilever was attempting to play down an admission on Thursday by Mr Morris Tabaksblat, its Dutch co-chairman, that the company had failed to apply 'appropriate safeguards' in tests before the launch. Unilever said yesterday that laboratory tests gave only a distorted picture of how the detergent performed. 'The defect the chairman referred to was only evident under extreme and destructive laboratory conditions; it was quite irrelevant in real conditions in consumers' homes. This product underwent field tests among 60,000 consumers throughout Europe over a period of two years,' the company said. However, Mr Derek Prentice, Consumers' Association assistant director, said it was 'nonsense' to claim that it was only extreme conditions that caused damage. 'Our independent tests on behalf of the consumer have shown that there can be substantial damage to some clothes, under far from extreme laboratory conditions designed to imitate normal washing, as far as possible, without wearing.' He added: 'Thousands of consumers are still using old and new formulations of the detergent. They deserve a little more plain speaking from Unilever.' Later on ITN's News at Ten, Mr Prentice said early tests showed that the reformulated product also 'caused a far greater degree of fading (in clothes) than we would normally expect to find in a washing powder.' The association is conducting further tests, which involve a panel of consumers wearing clothes and then taking them for laboratory washing. Those tests, unlikely to be complete before December, will be on the old and new formulations of the product. Unilever said it believed very little of the original detergent was still in use. It was 'baffled' as to why the association had intervened when its own tests were incomplete. 'We reiterate that any laboratory tests do not reflect real life,' it said.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Nissan wins first round in fight with importer NISSAN MOTOR of Japan won an initial victory yesterday in its High Court battle with Nissan UK, its privately-owned importer, by persuading the court to hear at least the first part of the action behind closed doors. Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest car maker, is trying to avoid an embarrassing open confrontation in the English courts by having its dispute with Nissan UK referred to arbitration in Japan. It argues that under the terms of the original distribution agreement, which came into effect at the beginning of 1971, any disputes or legal proceedings were to be settled in Japan. Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, the vice-chancellor, agreed to Nissan Motor's request that the issue of jurisdiction over the dispute should be heard in chambers. He said his judgment would probably be given in open court, and the second part of the action - Nissan UK's attempt to win an injunction preventing Nissan Motor from selling vehicles to any other distributor - would be heard in open court.</p>

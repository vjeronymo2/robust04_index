			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang on Friday [24 June] issued a stern warning on the  impact Taiwan's GATT membership may have on the local  automakers, calling for them to merge to cope with the  anticipated hard times.    "Only by merger can local automakers reach the economies of  scale, and there is no other alternative," Chiang said in a  meeting with the senior executives of local car companies.  There are 11 carmakers in Taiwan vying for a slice of the tiny  market, but sales of foreign imports have continued to make  steady gains as tariffs have decreased. Imported cars took 33  percent of the local market share in 1993, up from 24 percent in  1991 and 30 percent from 1992, while overall car sales decreased  3.2 percent to 401,270 in 1993.    Chiang said sooner or later, Taiwan must fully open its car  market in line with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  "That would make the present difficult times even harder," he  warned.    Yet the response to Chiang's proposal from automakers was  cool despite the fact that some of them have been operating in  the red. One executive who participated in the meeting simply  replied that "the time is not yet ripe" when he was asked to  comment on Chiang's merger suggestion.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA TO PROCEED WITH SUIT OVER HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council on Friday reaffirmed its decision to file a  lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to overturn the  board's approval of a 2,555-unit addition to the giant Stevenson Ranch housing  development.  </P> <P> The council met during a special meeting called to reconsider the lawsuit and  the council's recent decision to oust a member of the city's Parks and  Recreation Commission. On the parks issue, the council reversed itself,  reappointing Commissioner Laurene Weste to a new term on the panel.  </P> <P> The lawsuit will challenge the adequacy of the environmental impact report  prepared for the Stevenson Ranch expansion. Councilman Carl Boyer III, speaking  after the council's deliberations, said the report was deficient, limited in  scope and based on old data.  </P> <P> Stevenson Ranch, which the developer hopes to expand to 10,000 units, is  situated west of the Golden State Freeway and south of Magic Mountain.  </P> <P> Boyer said the environmental report prepared for the developer, Dale Poe  Development Corp., fails to consider how much traffic the project will funnel  into Santa Clarita, which is east of the freeway.  </P> <P> Boyer said the lawsuit might be filed as early as next week.  </P> <P> The council voted recently to sue the county, but in an unusual move  reconsidered its decision Friday afternoon at the request of Mayor Jo Anne  Darcy. Darcy said she wanted the council to be aware of the potential impacts  of a lawsuit.  </P> <P> Darcy is a field deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who  supports the project. To avoid a conflict of interest, Darcy did not attend the  closed session held to discuss the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Dale Poe, as a condition of winning county approval for the project, has agreed  to donate 13 acres and $2.4 million for a new school in the fast-growing  Newhall School District. The company will donate more money and land as other  phases of the project are approved. Donations ultimately could total $22  million.  </P> <P> Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the school district hoped to  obtain the money by November so it could apply for a matching contribution from  the state. A lawsuit could jeopardize the district's ability to receive those  funds, Stevenson said.  </P> <P> Meeting in open session on the parks issue, the council re-evaluated a  numerical ranking system it had used to rate the candidates vying for three  slots on the commission. Candidates were rated on a scale of one to five.  </P> <P> Weste was ousted from the panel even though she had received fives from Darcy,  Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and Boyer. Councilwoman Jill Klajic gave  Weste a zero and Councilwoman Jan Heidt gave her a one.  </P> <P> Weste was replaced by George Stigile while Commissioners Jeff Wheeler and Todd  Longshore were reappointed to new terms. Stigile lost his seat after the  reappointment of Weste.  </P> <P> McKeon said he was disturbed that a minority of the council could control an  appointment. Council members said Friday that they should use the ranking  system only as a guide for appointments. The council set aside its previous  action and renamed Weste, Wheeler and Longshore to the commission.  </P></p>

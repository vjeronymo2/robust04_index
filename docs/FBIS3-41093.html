			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez, retired, the new  executive secretary of the National Antinarcotics Secretariat  (Senad), has said the resources available to the agency for  repressing drug trafficking are "infinitely less" than the  resources available to traffickers. Rodriguez said if he finds  any military officer or influential person involved in the  illegal trade he will arrest him or resign from his post.    "We have a limited amount of money available, while drug  traffickers have large amounts. For this reason we have  infinitely less resources than those available to traffickers.  It is very difficult to be even in this respect," Rodriguez  said.    Gen. Rodriguez was appointed to the post in a surprise move.  His name was not mentioned as a candidate for the post and his  designation was therefore a surprise.    Gen. Rodriguez told us that he was first in his class at the  Military School promotion of 1955. He then entered the Military  College. He went to Panama where he took infantry training  courses at a U.S. instruction center. He then travelled to the  United States to take general staff training courses.    He retired in December 1992 when he was 3d Corps general  staff chief. He confirmed that he worked for the candidacy of  the present head of state in the Colorado Party primaries and  the presidential race.    As an example of the need to have the means to fight drug  trafficking, Rodriguez said: "If I am the cook and someone wants  to eat a steak, I have to get meat. If that person wants a  steak and I only have rice and noodles, he will not get a steak  from me."    What Rodriguez means is that in his short time as Senad  secretary he was able to see the need for improvements knowing  that the resources are limited. He talked about the lack of  radar and interceptor planes to fight trafficking by air in the  Chaco.    He indicated that trafficking by land in the Chaco is  controlled by the military units in that zone, but even so more  personnel are required.    Asked about the possibility that a high-ranking military man  or an influential individual in the government try to get his  complicity, Gen. Rodriguez said he will have two options.  First, resort to the president to implement sanctions, and  second resign.    "I am the boss" said Rodriguez, who pointed out that he will  not allow another individual to run the institution at his will.  He reiterated the support he received from the president.    Previous Senad administrators said they were seriously  investigating money laundering in our country. Rodriguez said  the work started by the previous team continues. He was not  able, however, to give details of the investigation because he  did not have the information.    He emphasized that for the time being he will not replace  the  men working with him. He indicated there may be changes in the  future.    Regarding drug addiction in our country, Rodriguez said this  problem is not yet that serious but it could get worse if  corrective measures are not taken on time.</p>

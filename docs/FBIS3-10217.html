			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Marin] </F>   [Text] On 1 March, representatives of the so-called  National Front for the Defense of Banco Latino and Banco  Hipotecario de Occidente Depositors [Frente Nacional Pro-defensa  de los Depositantes del Banco Latino y del Banco Hipotecario de  Occidente] occupied the Dutch Consulate in this city [Maracaibo,  Zulia State capital].    Elias Mata and Aurelio Mhr said that this measure seeks to  expose to international public opinion the financial problems  depositors have had to face since the intervention of Banco  Latino. In this particular case, they want the Dutch consul to  ask the Dutch ambassador to Venezuela and Venezuelan Foreign  Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to suggest to the Dutch and  Venezuelan Governments that they establish a commission to  investigate the Latino NV Curazao case.    They also urged the Dutch and Venezuelan Governments "to see  that the culprits in the Latino NV Curazao case are punished."  We are also demanding that the Dutch Government guarantee  deposits that are currently frozen in Latino NV, Curazao. This  action also demands the expeditious treatment of an emergency  law submitted for Congress' consideration, they added. Front  members asked the national government to allow "representatives  of those affected by the Banco Latino and its branches crisis to  participate in the commissions discussing the emergency law."    This afternoon, Dutch Consul George Vinck reportedly gave  the  protesters a document written in English, which reportedly  states his government's position on this situation.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (1): Goodwill is key to unity - There would be no shortage of economic opportunities if the two communities of Cyprus could reunite, even in a much looser relationship than the bi-communal system of government which collapsed in 1963. But a lot of political goodwill is needed. Kerin Hope investigates THE roofless houses and rusting barbed wire around the UN checkpoint in central Nicosia could be part of an abandoned film set. But a loitering soldier in a blue serge cap serves as a reminder that Cyprus remains a divided island where most Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been unable to exchange even a greeting for almost 18 years. The contrasts within the city underline how the two communities' paths diverged after Turkish forces invaded the north of the island in 1974 in response to a coup plotted in Athens which aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece. Tall, white office and apartment blocks crowned with satellite dishes overlook the UN-patrolled 'green line' on the southern side. The Greek Cypriots, forced to rebuild their lives after abandoning the northern third of the island, proved so successful at developing tourism, textile manufacturing and offshore services that per capita income in the internationally-recognised Cyprus republic compares with Spain. The Turkish Cypriots, an 18 per cent minority in the island's population of 600,000, live quietly in what resembles a Turkish provincial town, apart from a newish suburb housing the administration of the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognised only by Turkey. The presence of almost 30,000 Turkish soldiers in the breakaway state, plus some 50,000 settlers from mainland Turkey - brought in to cultivate farmland left idle when the Greek Cypriots fled - reinforces the impression that northern Cyprus is somehow an outpost of Anatolia. Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriots are also better off than before, thanks to tourism and investments by Asil Nadir, the Turkish Cypriot entrepreneur now facing fraud charges in Britain after the collapse of his fruit-to-electronics group. But given its lack of international respectability, northern Cyprus generally holds little attraction for investors, making it heavily dependent on aid from Turkey - said to have totalled more than Dollars 500m since 1974  -and loans from Turkish banks. Wages in the north are only one quarter of southern levels and unemployment is rising, while several thousand jobs remain unfilled in the south. As Greek Cypriot businessmen are starting to point out, there would be no shortage of economic opportunity if the two communities could reunite, even in a much looser relationship than the bi-communal system of government which collapsed in 1963, only three years after independence from Britain. 'The pie is now big enough for both of us. We should accept that they want to live separately from us and co-operate accordingly,' says a Greek Cypriot financial consultant, one of a group that recently started building contacts with Turkish Cypriot businessmen. The politicians do not necessarily agree. Although intercommunal talks over the years, sponsored by successive UN secretaries-general, eventually produced the outlines of a settlement, the crucial details remain to be resolved. The idea is that Cyprus would be reunified as a bi-zonal federation where Greek and Turkish Cypriots could move freely, work and live in each other's zones. The two communities would share power in a federal government more concerned with promoting Cypriot interests abroad than regulating domestic affairs. Most Turkish troops would go home and compensation would be paid to islanders who decided not to return to their pre-1974 homes. But a considerable amount of political goodwill is needed to resolve arguments over how much territory the Turkish Cypriots should hand back, how many Greek Cypriots will eventually be allowed to move north again and how often a Turkish Cypriot should serve as president of Cyprus. This goodwill still seems to be lacking, even after US President George Bush voiced a personal interest last summer in seeing the Cyprus problem solved, thus providing the inspiration for a fresh UN negotiating effort. 'It is very frustrating because 90 per cent of the settlement is already there. If the breakthrough were to happen, the UN officials could have an agreement ready to sign in a matter of days,' says a western diplomat. To the Greek Cypriots, and also some outside observers, the stumbling block is Mr Rauf Denktash, leader of the breakaway state, who now demands full political equality for the Turkish Cypriot community in a Swiss-style federation. 'We shall never say Yes to a federation that is not based on our sovereignty,' he says. Mr Denktash, whose avowed priority is to safeguard his community from a return to the days of discrimination and periodic violence at the hands of the Greek Cypriot majority, is also criticised by the Turkish Cypriot opposition as an autocratic leader unwilling to trade some of his personal authority in return for a settlement. On the other hand, President George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader whose background as a millionaire businessman and political newcomer initially made him more flexible, is constrained by the probability that he will seek a second term in a presidential election to be held next year. He now seems to favour the conventional view, backed by Greek and Greek Cypriot politicians, that the only way forward is for President Bush to press the Turkish government to convince Mr Denktash that the moment for a settlement has finally arrived. But one indication that he still feels optimistic is the preparation of a Greek Cypriot master-plan for reuniting the two economies. 'We think it will be possible to bring the Turkish Cypriots up to our level within two years, without any pain,' he says. Despite Mr Vassiliou's inability so far to bring about a solution, he will still be the front-runner if he decides to seek re-election. One result of a rapidly improving standard of living for Greek Cypriots over the past four years has been to push what is known as 'the national issue' further into the background. 'There are times when you feel it's a topic for discussion over dinner, no longer really part of your life,' says a Greek Cypriot engineer. Even the politicians' insistence that a settlement must allow all Greek Cypriots the right to return to their homes in the north seems at variance with the views of a younger generation which is growing up in the towns of the south without any knowledge of Turkish Cypriot community. Mr Vassiliou, elected with the backing of the still-powerful Cyprus communist party, Akel, has had his difficulties pushing economic reforms through parliament as a president without a political party of his own. But he could only be unseated next year by an alliance of the two right-wing parties, Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party, whose ageing leaders are associated with past political embarrassments and old-fashioned attitudes. Their resilience since the island was effectively partitioned makes the Greek Cypriots feel confident they will go on prospering on their own. But Cyprus cannot be assured of long-term security or of achieving its ambition to join the European Community until the two communities are again united.</p>

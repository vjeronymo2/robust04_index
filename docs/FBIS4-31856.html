			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gyorgy Jozsef Farkas: "The Common Historical </F> Past Also Promises a Common Future--Jozef Moravcik's Interview  on Slovak-Hungarian Relations"]    [Text] An interview that touched upon the issues of  bilateral relations was published in today's edition of the  Bratislava UJ SZO with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik,  Gyorgy Jozsef Farkas reported.    In the interview given to Deputy Chief Editor Peter Miklosi,  Moravcik first outlined the gestures addressed to the national  minorities. He said that one of his government's basic goals is  to fulfill the obligations undertaken in connection with gaining  membership in the Council of Europe as soon as possible. "It is  our intention that the social climate of good relations emerge  at last among our country's citizens of various ethnic  backgrounds," Moravcik emphasized, pointing out that this  includes a full and unhindered application of the name law and  the establishment of legal conditions for bilingual place-names.  He also said that they wish to establish the conditions for  Slovak membership in the European charter of regional local  governments and national minority languages. However, he assumes  that the implementation of this will be a task for the new  government to be formed after the fall elections. He  nevertheless stated that signing the above conventions is a  natural interest of the whole of Slovakia.    Speaking about the temporary halt of the signs law, Moravcik  noted that certain people are too worried: If the principle of  historical names used by the national minorities prevails in the  case of bilingual signs, this phenomenon might also extend to  other areas. These worries can be bridged after some time if  the sides concerned seek the solution through dialogue rather  than through negative actions.    Moravcik pointed out that the Hungarians living in Slovakia  can express their views in many ways--their representatives are  present in the government's advisory bodies and the parliament  and at the meetings of the coalition council. "I see no  obstacles to the Foreign Ministry creating an ad hoc or even  permanent committee from the representatives of Slovakia's  national minorities," he added.    The interview discusses in detail the situation of  Hungarian-Slovak interstate relations. Moravcik does not  consider it likely that the basic agreement will be completed  before the fall elections; however, consultations can still be  held. He also believes that talks on Bos are necessary in such  a way that the whole dispute be moved to the level of technical  debate while neither side suffers any lasting damage. In reply  to whether some easing can come about in bilateral relations by  the end of September, Moravcik said: "Every day and week that  passes by without results is wasted.... I am convinced that we  have to reach what we call historical reconciliation as soon as  possible. In the future, it is very important for us to pay  attention to the advantages of our mutual relations rather than  to our former disagreements. The common past also holds out a  common future, and it matters a lot what kind of prospects we  have," Moravcik stated.</p>

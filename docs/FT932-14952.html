			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Something old, something new for embattled Yeltsin WITH something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue, the finance and foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations yesterday pulled together a package of financial support for Russia with the impressive price tag of Dollars 43bn. The package to bolster Russian economic reforms has three main components. About Dollars 14bn has been earmarked for macro-economic stabilisation, particularly to help bring inflation under control. A similar amount will be spent on structural reform, mainly trade assistance, aid to develop the energy sector and small and medium-sized businesses. About Dollars 15bn will be debt rescheduling. The package thrashed out during two days of talks at a Tokyo hotel dwarfs the much derided Dollars 24bn plan agreed last year. It is on top of bilateral commitments of more than Dollars 4bn announced during the meeting by the US, Japan and the UK. According to the plan's authors it is designed to deliver practical and visible help to hard-pressed Russian consumers and unemployed workers who are bearing the brunt of the dislocations of reform. With President Boris Yeltsin preparing for a critical referendum on his political reform plans on April 25, the G7 leaders yesterday claimed to have met the historic challenge they set themselves, to throw their weight and money decisively behind the embattled Russian leader. Yet, on closer inspection, the G7's achievements are less impressive than they seem. The new multilateral money committed in Tokyo was well short of Dollars 43bn. The immediate benefits for men and women in Russian streets will be even less. Much of the package drawn up in Tokyo was already in the pipeline. The Dollars 15bn debt rescheduling had already been agreed by 19 creditor countries in Paris on April 2. About Dollars 10bn is in the form of export credits, much of which G7 countries have already offered bilaterally. A further Dollars 10bn is in the form of a Dollars 4bn IMF standby loan and a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund. These loans were offered last year but not taken up. The G7 is simply reaffirming that the facilities are still available. About Dollars 5bn is due to come from World Bank loans to promote structural reform in industry. Many of these loans have been under negotiation for months. So the only new multilateral initiatives taken by the G7 in the past two days amount to Dollars 3.3bn. The main element is an innovative Dollars 3bn IMF loan dubbed a systemic transformation facility designed to help economies undergoing sweeping reform. The remainder is a Dollars 300m European Bank for Reconstruction and Development fund to promote the development of small businesses, in part through planning a Russian bank for small and medium-sized enterprises. Indeed the boldest initiative, a US proposal for a Dollars 4bn fund to promote large-scale privatisation, met a cool response. Ministers agreed to study the idea in the run-up to the July G7 summit of heads of state. The protagonists, including Russia's Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, dismissed such calculations of their achievements as crude underestimates. They make four main claims for the Tokyo agreement: It marks a more credible western commitment to the process of reform. The special Dollars 3bn IMF facility - which is conditional on Russian pledges that it will tackle inflation and reduce its budget deficit - is designed to kick-start macro-economic stabilisation. That should make it easier for Russia to negotiate the Dollars 4bn stand-by arrangement with the IMF. The meeting set an October deadline for concluding those talks. As Mr Fyodorov remarked: 'This puts us in a stronger bargaining position with the IMF.' If the stand-by arrangement is agreed Russia will be in a better position to take up the additional Dollars 6bn IMF rouble stabilisation fund. The G7 will make it easier for Russia to take up assistance from international financial institutions such as the World Bank. The west is adopting a more practical approach in an effort to make sure aid makes a tangible and visible difference to everyday life in Russia. The main symbol of that is the small business fund. As Mr Fyodorov put it: 'The whole process is better co-ordinated and more practical then before.' According to the Russians, the political value of the G7 being seen pulling together its support into a single package at such a critical time should not be underestimated. In time, Mr Kozyrev's desire that ordinary citizens should see some of the fruits of foreign assistance in their daily lives may come true. In the meantime the main effect of the Tokyo talks on daily Russian life will be the headlines generated in this morning's newspapers. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

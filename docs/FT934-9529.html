			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: J Dickie jumps to Pounds 678,000 SHARES in James Dickie rose 16p to 81p yesterday as the USM-quoted manufacturer of engineering components announced a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 206,000 to Pounds 678,000 for the year to August 31. The figure last time has been restated in accordance with FRS 3. Turnover advanced to Pounds 16.5m against Pounds 15.4m. Mr Joseph Grimmond, chairman, said the result was achieved despite the group's inability to obtain any general price increase and that in real terms prices to customers had fallen since 1991. However, profit margins had increased, he said, which was a measure of the effort to seek better production methods and control overheads. A single final of 2p (1p) is recommended from earnings of 8.4p (2.5p) per share.</p>

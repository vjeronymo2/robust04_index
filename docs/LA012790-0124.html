			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> STUTE HOPING HISTORY WILL REPEAT  </P> <P> Contrary to his best instincts, trainer Mel Stute has tapped into the same  source that produced his 1986 champion, Brave Raj, in hopes of landing another  top filly.  </P> <P> Heaven for Bid, whose roan coat will make her easy to spot coming down the  seven-furlong chute in today's Santa Ynez Stakes at Santa Anita, began her  career last fall in New Jersey with Ben Perkins, the same trainer who sold  Brave Raj to Stute and his patron, Dolly Green, in the summer of 1986.  </P> <P> For her $300,000, Green got a Breeders' Cup winner and an Eclipse Award  champion. Brave Raj earned $933,650 in 1986, the most money ever won by a  2-year-old of either sex at the time.  </P> <P> "They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place," Stute said in  reference to his latest Perkins purchase. "That's why I always worry about  going back for seconds when the first time around worked out so well. But this  filly could be the exception."  </P> <P> Acting for owner Jerry Moss, Stute flew to the Meadowlands last November,  inspected Heaven for Bid from head to toe, and put his seal of approval on the  deal. The filly was in California eight days later.  </P> <P> In her first local appearance on Jan. 4, Heaven for Bid battled heavily favored  Forest Fealty from the half-mile pole to the wire in a display of uncommon  tenacity for such an inexperienced filly. Heaven for Bid won by a head while  running six furlongs in 1:09 1/5. She also dumped jockey Gary Boulanger while  pulling up after the race.  </P> <P> "She can be a little nasty when she's on the track," Stute said. "She has a  habit of wheeling like that. After she'd done it a couple of times in the  morning, we called Perkins and asked if she'd done it for him. He said yes."  </P> <P> By now, Stute is fairly certain there were no other instructions Perkins forgot  to include in the package. Stute already was aware that her sire, Spectacular  Bid, the 1980 horse of the year, has been a relative disappointment as a  stallion, boasting only a handful of major stakes winners among his nearly 200  sons and daughters who have raced.  </P> <P> "I've always found that hard to believe, because Spectacular Bid impressed me  as a tremendous racehorse," Stute said. "Maybe that's one of the reasons I like  this filly -- I keep thinking her sire is due to come up with a real good one."  </P> <P> Stute could use a little spark in his barn these days. After being in the  spotlight for most of the 1980s with Brave Raj, champion colt Snow Chief,  Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Very Subtle and a host of other stakes horses, the  chain-smoking Hoosier has fallen on quiet times.  </P> <P> "Our last stakes winner?" Stute wondered aloud. "Pomona, I think. But right now  I'm down to the lowest number of horses I've had in the last 10 years.  </P> <P> "Many of my clients are older gentlemen," Stute went on. "Some of them are not  in good health, and others are cutting back on their horses. Then when you hit  a cold streak, people tend to forget about you."  </P> <P> While Heaven for Bid could get 1990 off to a good start, Stute is reserving his  highest hopes for the proven filly, Kool Arrival. Now a 4-year-old, the  daughter of Relaunch is on the comeback trail after an eventful 1989 campaign  both on and off the track.  </P> <P> Kool Arrival won five of 10 starts last year, including the Las Virgenes Stakes  at Santa Anita and the Rancho Bernardo Handicap at Del Mar. On Oct. 10, she  went through a sales ring at Del Mar, and on Oct. 11, she made her final start  of the season, finishing last in the Autumn Days Handicap at Santa Anita. Stute  immediately prescribed a long rest.  </P> <P> "It occurred to me that I was running my best horses all wrong," the trainer  said. "The horses that seem to get all the attention anymore are the ones that  win at the end of the year.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced Kool Arrival can be the best mare in the country this year.  That's why you won't be seeing her until this spring and summer, with an eye on  the big races in the fall."  </P> <P> The identities of the 1989 horse of the year, trainer of the year and jockey of  the year will be revealed today at about 2 p.m. in the Club Court at the east  end of the Santa Anita clubhouse. Jim McKay will be the host for the  proceedings, which will be televised as part of ABC's "Wide World of Sports."  </P> <P> Fans at the track will be able to watch the ceremony on the in-house  closed-circuit system, according to Santa Anita officials. Elsewhere on the  West Coast, the eight minutes of envelope-opening and video clips can be seen  during the program's regular time period, from 4:30 to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Charlie Whittingham is favored to win his third Eclipse Award as the nation's  top trainer, but don't think for a minute he lost any sleep Friday night  worrying about it.  </P> <P> "I know better than to get all worked up," Whittingham said earlier this week.  "Look what's happened before. In '73, Lucien Laurin won the Triple Crown with  Secretariat, and they gave the trainer award to Allen Jerkens. When Billy  Turner won the Triple Crown with Seattle Slew, they gave it to Laz (Barrera).  </P> <P> "And just a couple of years ago, when I won the Breeders' Cup Classic and  horse-of-the-year (honors) with Ferdinand, they gave it to (Wayne) Lukas."  </P> <P> The only other viable candidate for the trainer award this time is Lukas, whose  national stable led the country for the seventh straight year and included  champions Open Mind and Steinlen.  </P> <P> Win or lose, Whittingham will be on hand to accept congratulations from McKay  for training Sunday Silence and also owning 25% of the obvious choice for horse  of the year. Kent Desormeaux, who won a record 597 races in 1989, is a virtual  lock as the top jockey.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye missed his mounts again Friday while recovering from being  kicked in the leg by a horse last Tuesday. "It was a puncture wound, and some  infection set in," Terry Lipham, Delahoussaye's agent, said. Delahoussaye is  scheduled to return today. . . . Quiet American, among the top candidates for  the $500,000 Strub Stakes on Feb. 4, worked a mile on the main track at  Hollywood Park Thursday morning in 1:40 2/5.  </P> <P> A total of 34 horses have been nominated to the Legend's Last Ride, Bill  Shoemaker's final race, next Saturday at Santa Anita. Among the eligibles are  Steinlen, Patchy Groundfog, Royal Touch, Oraibi and Miswaki Tern. . . . Lively  One and Present Value head a field of eight older horses going in the $163,800  San Pasqual Handicap Sunday. Also in the field are Candi's Gold, Attesa,  Avenging Force, Raise a Stanza, Criminal Type and Stylish Winner, who finished  third in the same race last year.  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Mercedes seeks site in Europe to produce new small car MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury carmaker, is considering four sites in Europe for the construction of a new assembly plant. The new plant, for which the UK is in the running, would produce the company's planned small car, Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, said yesterday. A decision on the plant, which would be able to produce about 200,000 cars a year, could be taken by the end of this year, he said. The company was aiming for a share of about 2.5 per cent of the world market for small cars, which totals about 8.5m. Mercedes-Benz is seeking to spread manufacturing of its passenger vehicles outside Germany as part of its new product strategy, although a German site for the new plant is on the shortlist of four, which includes the UK and the Czech Republic. The disclosure will trigger intense competition between countries trying to attract one of the biggest greenfield site automotive projects likely to be built in Europe in the second half of the 1990s. In recent years, the main share of new car assembly capacity in Europe has been built in the UK with the development of three plants by Nissan, Toyota and Honda, the Japanese carmakers. The European car industry is already suffering heavily from over-capacity, but Mercedes-Benz has been forced to plan a new facility to enter the small car market. Mr Werner said the plant would be dedicated to the small car. The decision to build a small car marks a sharp change of policy by the German luxury carmaker, which is also planning to expand into other new market segments, those for four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles and multipurpose vehicles. Mr Werner said an announcement would be made around the end of this month on a location in the US for a plant to build the proposed four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicle. Mercedes-Benz planned to build up to 65,000 vehicles a year in this range for sale worldwide, but expected the plant to break even at production of less than 40,000 a year. The new MPV would be built at Mercedes-Benz's existing plant in Spain and would be launched in January 1995, Mr Werner said.</p>

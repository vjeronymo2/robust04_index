			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic resistance forces last week carried out  two brave operations in which they succeeded in blowing up and  destroying large parts of the road that links the al-Kahla'  district to the subdistrict of al-Musharrah at various points.  In addition, they blew up the (al-Ghutayji) bridge across the  (al-Ghutayji) River, which is a tributary of the al-Musharrah  River and pours into the al-Qubbah marshland east of the  al-'Amarah Governorate.    He added that the targets were considered two of the most  important roads of communication used by the regime's forces in  transporting equipment and troops recently.    A source in the Islamic resistance forces clarified that  resistance groups distributed leaflets in the places where the  regime's forces were deployed. They warned these forces against  becoming involved in the regime's bloody schemes. It called on  them to disobey orders and direct their weapons at tyrant  Saddam's aides and his collapsing regime, which is on the brink  of annihilation.</p>

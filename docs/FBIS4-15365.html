			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 07, BNS -- Two organizations of  Estonia's Russian-speaking population warned the government  yesterday of a "social explosion" if the effective regulations  for issuing residence and work permits to non-citizens are not  changed.    The Russian Representative Assembly and the Russian  Community  are of the opinion that the application of the aliens law, which  met with an otherwise "positive response," by the executive  branch of power is a "juridical trap" which deprives most of the  non-citizens of a number of their rights.    The statement notes that at present only temporary residence  and work permits for a one-year term are issued to persons who  lived in Estonia before July 1990. The permits don't grant them  social and economic rights promised upon adoption of the aliens  law, the statement claims.    In the opinion of the Russian organizations, the problem can  be solved only legislatively. The Russian Representative  Assembly and the Russian Community have made their proposals for  this to the government through the minorities' round-table  conference.    The proposals include defining legally the status of persons  who were born on the Estonian territory or arrived in the  country before July 1, 1990, and were registered as Estonian  residents by the authorities of the Estonian SSR; introducing a  guarantee in the aliens law that permanent residents of Estonia  will be issued permanent residence permits; and defining the  exact meaning of "permanent residence and work permit,"  "temporary residence and work permit," "cadre personnel of  foreign armed forces," and "sufficient legal income" in the  aliens law.    Both Russian organizations announce that, until such  decisions have been passed, they cannot advise non-citizens to  apply for residence and work permits.</p>

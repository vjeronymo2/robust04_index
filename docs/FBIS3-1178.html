Capital outflows of over R16-billion [rand] had reached  something of a "crescendo" last year due to political  uncertainty and ongoing unrest, and total almost R50-billion  since 1985 when the country introduced debt standstill  arrangements.    "1994 looks as though its going to go in the other  direction," he told a business breakfast in Johannesburg.  "We've had two good months so far, and march also looks  alright."    Mr Keys said SA's [South Africa] arrangements with its  international creditor banks, worked out late last year, created  a good long-term basis for the management of the country's  capital account. He was confident the economic policies pursued  by a government of national unity following April's elections  would not divorce the country from the global economy. The  country simply could not afford to adopt policies that would  scare foreign investors as evidenced by SA's foreign exchange  reserves which amounted to an alarmingly low level of five  months of imports.    The long-term creation of sustainable jobs could not take  place with the limited amount of capital available. Instead,  above average economic growth would have to be achieved.    He expected the imperative of creating employment would  drive  the cabinet ministers responsible for the economy towards  policies aimed at boosting growth.    Mr Keys said the consensual approach towards national  economic policy determination augured well for a future  government, as well as the ability of the country's enterprises  to emerge from one of its worst recessions. "We're in good  shape now for future growth. A lot of business in the last  period have become more efficient," he said referring to the  competitive pressure of the country's re-integration into  international markets and systems like the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade.</p>

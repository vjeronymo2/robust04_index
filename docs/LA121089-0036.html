			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MISSION'S COMPUTERS PROVIDE DENVER'S HOMELESS A LINK TO LITERACY, JOBS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: ONE RELIEF AGENCY WANTS TO DO MORE THAN FEED, CLOTHE AND SAVE THE  SOULS OF ITS PATRONS. IT TEACHES THEM TO READ, WRITE AND USE COMPUTERS TOO.  </P> <P> The Denver Rescue Mission, the oldest relief agency in the city, isn't  interested in just feeding, clothing and saving the souls of the down and out.  It wants them to read, write and understand computers too.  </P> <P> Inside the red-brick building with the blue "Jesus Saves" sign over the door,  director Del Maxfield is trying to redefine the goals of a shelter for the  homeless as well as the needs of the men who seek help there.  </P> <P> The latest innovation is a computer-based program for functionally illiterate  adults. It is part of "a new sophistication of the old urban missions" in  response to changes in the makeup of the growing homeless population in  America, Maxfield said.  </P> <P> In the past, he said, shelters were thought to be doing their job by providing  a roof, a prayer and a meal for hobos and alcoholics.  </P> <P> The new homeless are "people who are economically distressed, abused, people  from broken families" who need more, he said. "It's a very complex world of  homelessness out there."  </P> <P> In appearance, the Denver Rescue Mission, founded in 1893, reveals little of  its new-wave approach. It sits on a run-down corner a few blocks east of  Denver's skyscrapers. Weeds poke out of the sidewalk and curbs. At mealtimes,  lines of ragged men wait at the front door, as always.  </P> <P> Inside, though, a clinic provides free medical, dental and eye care. It gave  away more than 1,000 pairs of glasses last year. And not only does it teach  literacy, but computer literacy as well.  </P> <P> Its computer room, in the basement, contains three terminals and file cabinets  and bookshelves crammed with computer-course materials. The materials include  science, math, Bible studies and geography as well as basic reading, writing  and spelling.  </P> <P> On a recent day at the mission, two men sat in the computer room, one studying  computers and the other Spanish, specialized skills for, they hope, specialized  jobs.  </P> <P> One of the men, Mike, 27, had come to the shelter a month earlier from Dallas  after losing his job as a truck driver because of "personal problems." He has a  high school equivalency diploma and is studying computer programming in hopes  of applying for college soon. Some others who study at the shelter have only an  elementary-school education.  </P> <P> Mike said he came to Denver to find "a new beginning, a fresh start," and  showed up at the mission for a meal. He now spends about five hours a week with  the computers and works in various jobs at the mission about 42 hours a week.  </P> <P> He wants to become a counselor or perhaps a pastor, he said. "It's been a dream  for a few years," he said. "I guess I didn't have enough confidence to make an  effort at it."  </P> <P> The mission provides 140 beds for homeless people for up to 10 nights and feeds  about 450 people a day, but Mike is one of 28 "program men." These are men who  live at the mission and are enrolled in its rehabilitation program. They must  spend at least two hours a week at the computers and show a commitment to  staying free of drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> One shelter resident, who had some knowledge of computers before he came to the  shelter, landed a job with a pharmaceutical company after less than a month in  the program, said Aaron Mossman, coordinator of the new literacy program.  </P> <P> Working at computers can be a positive experience for people who lead  "negative" lives, Mossman said.  </P> <P> "It's simple, but it's positive. They sit, push a button and something happens.  They've just succeeded three times. They begin to build positive mental  attitudes that 'I can,' " he said.  </P> <P> The word "homeless" doesn't begin to describe the people who need help from the  mission, Maxfield said. There are those who are literally without homes, he  said, and then there are those he calls "the poor and needy," who may have a  home but no food, or are in imminent danger of becoming homeless.  </P> <P> "One of the things that we have lacked is knowing what these people want to do  in life," Maxfield said. "We're trying to find a way to test these people, see  how they're wired, so we can send them down a road of success instead of more  failure."  </P> <P> Maxfield, who worked for 24 years in the aerospace industry before leaving to  get a master's degree in divinity, came to the Denver Rescue Mission from the  Fuller Seminary in California. He has, he said, an ingrown awareness of the  value of education. "I'm a high school dropout myself. I had to learn that a  formal education was important. I've had some tough times of my own.  </P> <P> "When I got here, I noticed that people would fake reading the Bible and the  hymnals. I discovered that a lot of these people couldn't read."  </P> <P> So he, along with the chairman of the shelter's board, Roy O. Howell, a retired  schoolteacher, and other volunteer educators began a tutoring program to help  the shelter's wards earn high school equivalency diplomas.  </P> <P> Then, a year ago, Maxfield visited Accelerated Christian Education Inc. in  Dallas to take a look at its computer-oriented education courses for schools.  He worked with ACE to develop similar programs for adults, from the illiterate  to those in need of refresher courses. The resulting program began at the  mission a few months ago.  </P> <P> The literacy program and other courses are financed entirely by donations,  Maxfield said. In 1988, the Denver Rescue Mission reported revenues of  $717,000, all of it from donations and interest. The shelter probably has  invested at least $6,000 so far in the literacy program, Maxfield said.  </P> <P> Maxfield believes in taking the mission to the streets as well. He said many  cannot leave their camps in railroad yards or under viaducts because they are  afraid of being robbed. This doesn't faze Maxfield. He said he developed street  smarts during a previous job as a chaplain in the Los Angeles County jail  system.  </P> <P> The mission also has a truck that collects unused food from Denver-area  supermarkets and drops it off in poor neighborhoods. And it has a farm in  northern Colorado where interested shelter residents can get away from city  pressures and help grow food for the shelter.  </P> <P> Now Maxfield is expanding the mission to include a shelter and  vocational-training center for women in a building being renovated nearby. It  is scheduled to open in January.  </P> <P> Maxfield hopes that the computers ultimately will be used not only for  educational and vocational training, but for personal development.  </P> <P> Such as?  </P> <P> "How to balance a checkbook," he said.  </P></p>

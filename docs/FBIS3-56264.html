He told journalists on  Thursday that instead of distinguishing between the notion of  "Zhirinovskiy himself" and the "phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy,"  they had been giving too much publicity to him.    The phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy means discontent with  official  policy in Russia today. Zhirinovskiy is disgusting to many  people, Poltoranin said, but they seem to have chosen the lesser  of the two evils. And Clinton has been right to say that by  voting for Zhirinovskiy citizens protested against the policy of  the authorities. "The balloting showed that people had gotten  tired of the helpless government, rampant bureaucracy, crime,  etc. Official policy must be more effective," Poltoranin said.</p>

Kostsov; UDC 537.226] </F>   [Abstract] Electrooptical effect in thin ferro-electric  films of strontium barium niobate (SBN) Ba[.sup]x[/]Sr[.sub]1-  x[/]Nb[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]6[/] and features of its  application as a reversive memory medium with electro-optical  information reading, when the state of the medium element is  determined by the polarization direction in the ferro-electric  material were examined. The electrophysical characteristics of  this medium are discussed. This ferro-electric material was  selected because in addition to other high electro-optical  parameters it exhibits other qualities: a high melting  temperature, small values of piezoelectric losses, time  stability of the samples, a high value of dielectric constant,  etc. Thin- film (In[.sup]2[/]O,[.sub]3[/] +  SnO[.sup]2[/]) - SBN film - (In[.sub]2[/]O,[.sub]3[/] +  SnO[.sup]2[/]), obtained by high frequency sputtering method  on sapphire substrates were used for the studies. Based on  comparative analysis of different contemporary methods for  obtaining multi- component 2 - 5 m thick ferroelectric  films,  it can be assumed that at the present time the high frequency  sputtering is a preferred method.

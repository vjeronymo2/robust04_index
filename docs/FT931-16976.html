			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Japanese Government Bonds: Fiscal packages likely to deliver moderate recovery WITH the Japanese economy in a weak state, the Bank of Japan is expected to allow a further easing in interest rates early in 1993. However, with the government's Y10,700bn fiscal package and the possibility of a package later in the year, economists expect a moderate recovery during 1993. The combination of renewed growth and heavy corporate bond issuance could help to drive Japanese government bond yields higher by the year-end. Many economic forecasters expect a steepening of the Japanese yield curve, with the shorter end of the market out-performing the long end. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew warns that the rally in long-dated Japanese government bonds is ending, and that the time has arrived to take profits and concentrate holdings at the short end of the market. 'Ten-year yields are at their cyclical bottom and will now trend upwards,' said the firm. It is forecasting an annual rate of return of 3.2 per cent for two-year bonds to June 1993, whereas it predicts a decline in return of 4.3 per cent for 10-year bonds. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew ranks as one of the more bearish securities houses when it comes to the prospects for the Japanese government bond market. At the opposite The bond yield curves for France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US have been compiled from several sources. The existing bond yields curves were supplied by S. G. Warburg Securities. The forecast yield curves are based on the average of forecasts supplied by the following houses: BZW, Deutsche Bank, DKB International, Goldman Sachs, Midland Montagu, Nomura Research Institute, S. G. Warburg Securities and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. extreme is DKB International, which expects further falls in Japanese rates and in bond yields over the next year. The combination of concern about the weak state of the economy, the fragile stock market, falling inflation and the decline in confidence, has prompted a steady easing in interest rates by the Bank of Japan over the last 18 months. Since the middle of 1991, the overnight call rate has dropped from 8.25 per cent to 3.9 per cent, while the official discount rate has been steadily cut from 6 per cent to its current level of 3.25 per cent. Although the bond market has discounted a lot of the poor economic news, as well as another interest rate cut, some economists point out that the domestic background remains favourable for bonds, given the weak growth prospects and continued fall in inflation. Consumer demand remains weak and the stock market continues to look vulnerable. DKB International expects the overnight call rate to fall even lower - reaching 3.5 per cent in the first quarter and 3.0 per cent in the second quarter. It forecasts two more cuts in the official discount rate - to 2.75 per cent in the first quarter and to 2.25 per cent in the second quarter, the level at which it is expected to remain in the second half of the year. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said this scenario favours the shorter end but added that long bond yields should continue to fall, reaching their low point in the middle of 1993.</p>

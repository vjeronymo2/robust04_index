			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONALD TRUMP'S WOES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> I thought Allan Sloan's "Trump-In-A-Jam Show to Be Top Entertainment," (June  18) about Donald J. Trump was excellent up to a point. But the last paragraph,  "Stay tuned to The Perils of The Donald.  </P> <P> It's going to be a lot of fun," was, I think, a "below the belt" kind of  remark.  </P> <P> Granted, Trump overextended himself and I'm sure he deserves whatever he may  experience in the future, but he wasn't in these schemes all by himself. The  bankers and lending institutions had an obligation to rein in Donald's  extravagance.  </P> <P> If Donald, albeit a self-centered egotistical person, really is financially  dying, then why can't we let him die with as much dignity as he can muster, not  reach down and twist the knife a little for our own gratification?  </P> <P> DOROTHY CROWLEY-CAVECCHE  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

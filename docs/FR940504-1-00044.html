			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The May 1 opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries now has the effect of preventing domestic fishermen from harvesting these resources at the beginning of the fishing year, when few other fishing opportunities exist. This season has contributed, for example, to a situation in which the available TAC for the ``other flatfish'' complex has been underutilized in recent years. In 1991, only about 47 percent of the TAC for this species group was harvested. In 1992 and 1993, that figure was 38 percent and 45 percent, respectively. Nonetheless, while these resources have been underutilized, despite an expressed interest in accessing them at the beginning of the fishing year, retention of the May 1 opening has forced BSAI trawl fishermen either to move into the GOA deep-water flatfish fishery, which opens in January, or cease fishing until May 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rock sole fishery in the Bering Sea currently opens at the beginning of the fishing year to allow fishing in the lucrative ``roe'' fishery. This fishery typically closes in late February or early March when the rock sole have finished spawning. Seasonal halibut bycatch restrictions can close other fisheries (e.g., Pacific cod during 1991 and 1992), leaving, as noted above, few alternative fishing opportunities for the BSAI groundfish fleet. Flathead sole, one of the species in the Bering Sea ``other flatfish'' category, produce roe that matures just after rock sole roe matures. Markets for roe-bearing flathead sole have emerged, making this fishery a natural extension of that for roe-bearing rock sole in the Bering Sea. Other markets for these flatfish species, including a domestic fillets market, are under development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Opening the BSAI yellowfin sole fishery and the ``other flatfish'' fishery at the beginning of the fishing year (January 1) would provide vessels operating in the Bering Sea with the opportunity to participate in a potentially profitable, developing fishery. This opportunity is expected to reduce the need for vessels to move into the GOA trawl fisheries early in the fishing year, and thus would decrease pressure on the GOA halibut PSC limit and diminish the probability of preemption of existing GOA groundfish fisheries through early closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would amend the directed fishing standard for flatfish species (&sect;675.20(h)(2)) to accommodate this season change and allow sufficient bycatch amounts of rock sole, yellowfin sole, arrowtooth flounder, or ``other flatfish'' in the flatfish fisheries, while allowing for fishing operations to minimize the discard waste of these species. The proposed rule would also establish species-specific standards, rather than aggregate standards, for all flatfish species closed to directed fishing. The intent of this action is to simplify directed fishing standards, and to reduce discard waste by increasing the retainable amounts of flatfish species closed to directed fishing relative to other flatfish species that are open to directed fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Editorial and Technical Changes to &sect;672.20(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to reorganize &sect;672.20(f) to clarify the presentation and interpretation of regulations pertaining to halibut PSC limits. Existing regulations at &sect;672.20(f)(1)(i) and (2)(i) would be amended and redesignated as (f)(3)(i) and (f)(1), respectively, to implement management measures set out in this proposed rule. To eliminate redundant regulatory language, paragraph &sect;672.20(f)(2)(ii) would be amended and included as part of paragraph (f)(1) to cross reference the publication of proposed and final specifications required under &sect;672.20(c). These documents also include proposed and final halibut PSC limits and satisfy separate publication requirements currently set out in &sect;672.20(f)(2)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following paragraphs would be redesignated as indicated; no changes would be made to the regulatory text:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (14): First decide if you really need to buy - Mortgages A MORTGAGE is the biggest financial transaction of most people's lives. Banks and insurance companies are aware of this: people buying houses are usually in the market for other financial services at the same time, especially insurance. So the financial services industry sees each mortgage customer as a lucrative sales opportunity. Mortgage lenders also chase would-be customers hard these days: the era when you had to build up substantial savings and wait in a queue to become eligible for a mortgage ended in the early 1980s. If you are prepared to make the effort, there is no need to rely on a 'finder' when choosing a mortgage. If your needs are complex, it may be sensible to consult a mortgage broker who, for a fixed fee, can find you the most suitable mortgage on the market. But do not lean for advice on an insurance salesman or your bank manager. Another point to consider at the outset is whether you should be taking out a mortgage at all. Might it be wiser to live in rented accommodation and put your cash somewhere else? The answer depends partly on your motivation. Are you primarily looking for a home to live in? Or are you seeking an investment which will perform well in the years ahead? In decades when house prices climbed steadily, there was never much doubt about the answer to the second question. If you bought a house in the 1980s, and even more so in the 1970s, you would have seen the value of your deposit for the mortgage grow much faster than most other investments, sometimes by as much as 75 per cent in three years. This is no longer the case. Since 1988, the market has changed dramatically and perhaps for ever. Mortgage interest relief on income tax is being whittled away. House prices have fallen steadily during the past two years, and a recovery in the market looks some way off. Even when it comes, prices will grow slowly: the foreseeable future is unlikely to see windfall gains made from home ownership, as happened in the 1980s Lawson boom. But if you do decide to buy rather than rent, the next question is what kind of mortgage you should have: repayment, endowment, personal equity plan, or interest-only? The oldest type is the repayment mortgage, in which your monthly payments include interest and repayment of capital. About three-quarters of mortgages sold these days are endowment mortgages. These yield high commissions for insurance salesmen; but they lock customers into a 25-year savings scheme - and only one customer in eight completes the full period. Those who surrender their policies early do badly. This may be an important consideration when you next move house and perhaps switch to another lender. Though they are not supposed to, some lenders try to tie the sale of an insurance policy to a new mortgage. There may be other risks. With-profits endowment policies work by paying an annual bonus and a final bonus at the end of 25 years. Last year, one large insurer (Norwich Union) cut its annual bonus, though not by an amount which immediately affects policy-holders. But if conditions remain as tough for the insurance industry as in the last two years, it is conceivable that endowment policy holders may find themselves asked to increase their payments. More exotic repayment vehicles, such as Peps, are available. They may be less expensive than the endowment mortgage, but can they be expected to last for 25 years? It is also possible to have a mortgage without a repayment vehicle at all. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society was the first lender to offer interest-only mortgages. These are likely to suit two sorts of people: those who already have a payment vehicle (such as an endowment policy), and those who cannot afford to enter the mortgage market in any other way and hope to sell at a profit in a few years. Some people will presumably not move during the 25-year life of an interest-only policy; in which case they could find themselves with problems when its term is up and they have no way of repaying it other than by selling their home, especially if by then they are advanced in years. Foreign-currency mortgages require even more cautious examination. A mortgage denominated in US dollars or Japanese yen is fine if you are earning your salary in that currency. But if your income is in sterling, you will find your debt and your monthly outgoings increasing sharply when the pound falls against the currency of your mortgage. There are other points which anyone taking out a mortgage should consider. One important question is what penalties you will face if you pay off your mortgage early, as most borrowers do. This particularly applies to fixed-rate mortgages, where you often face penalties of between three and six months. Fixed rates offer the attraction of certainty, but investors may feel foolish if interest rates then fall. Most lenders now offer reduced rates to customers with large mortgages, and also to first-time buyers. This is fine, but check to see how long the discount will last. Even more caution is needed with 'low start' mortgages, where you pay less at the start of the mortgage, but only because unpaid interest is added to your debt. Borrowers may find that, after three years, their monthly payments rise by more than they can afford. Finally, the question that is probably uppermost in the minds of all would-be borrowers: which lender should they turn to? Efficient administration, an understanding attitude to borrowers in temporary difficulties, and a long-term commitment to stay in the market are qualities you should seek, though you will obviously also want a lender who keeps interest rates as low as possible. If you take out a mortgage from a lender who later wants to withdraw from the UK market, you may find yourself paying a higher rate than the market standard. The clearing banks have a good reputation for efficiency, and few of their mortgage customers seem to come unstuck. Building societies have generally offered slightly cheaper interest rates than banks. Those who have fared worst have been the customers of the specialist mortgage companies, set up in the 1980s, who in some cases seem to be stuck with higher interest rates and poor service.</p>

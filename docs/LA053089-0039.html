			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Vietnam War memorial in Philadelphia was splashed with white paint, upsetting  veterans paying a Memorial Day visit to the granite monument, police said.  Police said they believed only one person was involved in the early-morning act  of vandalism. A paint can and a straw hat draped with an American flag were  found nearby. Firefighters removed the latex paint from smooth surfaces on the  monument but were unable to remove it from a more porous surface that is  engraved with the names of more than 600 Philadelphians who died in Vietnam.  The memorial was erected 18 months ago through the contributions of Vietnam-era  veterans and others who raised $800,000 for its construction and maintenance.  </P></p>

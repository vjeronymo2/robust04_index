			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: AC Milan channels its master's loves - Football sans frontieres MR SILVIO Berlusconi is a media, supermarkets and property millionaire. He also loves football. His ownership of Europe's dominant football club, AC Milan, through his family holding company Fininvest, satisfies both needs. Soccer is one television product that transcends Europe's national and linguistic boundaries and Mr Berlusconi uses AC Milan to feed other interests in his media empire. The club has provided him with a lever which he has applied to win greater audience shares for his Italian television stations. He successfully lobbied UEFA, European football's governing body, to redesign the European Cup tournament along lines which not only increase Milan's chances of winning, but also maximise the number of matches - and hence income - for both the club and the television stations. The expansion of Mr Berlusconi's television empire into other European countries makes more sense if he can find broadcasting material that straddles these markets: soccer is perfect for that. 'I am not just a television financier. I create television - or at least I try to,' he says. Through Fininvest, which bought AC Milan in 1986, he has lavished a fortune on the club. Since then it has won the Italian league championship four times and the European Cup twice. He transformed the debt-laden club with a huge injection of cash and astute changes of coaching staff. He did not just want to win. He decreed that 'lovely football' should be played, a sentiment bound to endear him to fans from the touchline to the armchair. This year he introduced pay-television on his sports channel Tele-Plus 2. Subscriptions cost Pounds 75 a month and the fare has included the Wimbledon tennis tournament and the British Formula 1 Grand Prix. As Milan's owner, he controls television rights to all their non-league matches. The European Cup games are broadcast on his RTI network, some friendlies are on Canal Plus 2. In the European Cup, the old knock-out contest has given way to a group system for the last eight. Even if Milan does not reach the final, it will have played 10 glamorous matches - and Mr Berlusconi's television station had first refusal on all of them. All this football puts a strain on players. To ensure that it has the best, not only on the field but in reserve too, Milan has spent a fortune. In 1987 it paid a then world record Pounds 5.7m for Ruud Gullit. It rapidly added two more Dutch stars, Marco Van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. These players led Milan to the Italian championship in 1988 and the European Cup in 1989 and 1990. Far from resting on its laurels, Milan has upped its spending. Estimates of last summer's spree vary enormously. No one at Milan is likely to object to exaggeration, especially if it shows Mr Berlusconi exhibiting more financial machismo than his great rival Mr Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat boss and owner of Juventus of Turin. The sums talked about are between Pounds 9m and Pounds 13m for Gianluigi Lentini - the higher figure would make him the world's costliest player; between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds 9m for Jean-Pierre Papin, the 1991 European player of the year; at least Pounds 4.5m for the Croat Dejan Savicevic; Pounds 5.5m for Stefano Eranio; Pounds 3m for Fernado De Napoli. Whatever the real figures, they tot up to more than any other club in the world has spent, outstripping not only Juventus but also the Spanish plutocrats Barcelona. Then there are the salaries. Traditional caginess reaches its zenith in Italy, where accurate figures are especially not given to the tax man. Some estimates put Lentini's signing-on bonus at about Pounds 2.5m and his guaranteed salary at Pounds 7.5m over four years. He could add substantially to that. Milan paid its players bonuses of Pounds 170,000 each for winning the Italian championship. They will get more if they win the European Cup. The club has substantial revenues. It plays in the 82,000 capacity San Siro stadium which it shares with Inter Milan. It has 73,000 season ticket holders who pay between Pounds 95 and Pounds 950. Tickets for individual matches cost between Pounds 12 and Pounds 105 and average gates are between 78,000 and 80,000. It earns about Pounds 1.5m a year from its sponsors Motta. Further income comes from perimeter advertising and kit suppliers, as well as from television contracts. In order to keep delivering success while playing more matches, Mr Berlusconi has talked of having enough players for two teams: Milan I and Milan II. 'We intend to play twice a week - some 80 to 90 matches in the national league competitions, the European Cup, plus lucrative friendly matches which will be beamed live on TV.' His idea of keeping fans glued to their sets has a single-market flavour. 'I look forward to a Europe where AC Milan supporters would be found in Reykavik as well as St Petersburg. They would be able to watch their favourite team's matches at the switch of a TV set, alongside the supporters of, say, Marseilles, Real Madrid or Tottenham Hotspur.'</p>

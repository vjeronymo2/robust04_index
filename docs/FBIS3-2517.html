In his report on government work delivered to the current  session of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li Peng  reviewed China's achievements in reform, opening to the outside  world and modernization drive last year.    In 1993 China's economy continued to expand vigorously. The  gross domestic product exceeded three trillion yuan,  representing an increase of 13.4 percent over the 1992 figure.  Good harvests were reaped and the added value of agricultural  output increased by four percent. Except for a drop in the  output of cotton and sugar-yielding crops, the output of major  farm products increased considerably. The added value of  industrial output increased by 21.1 percent, and the output of  major industrial products rose enormously.    He said the domestic market was brisk, the pattern of  investment improved, more funds were used on key projects and  the construction of projects in energy, transport and  telecommunications advanced apace.    In view of the conspicuous contradictions and problems that  cropped up in the course of rapid economic growth, the Chinese  Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council took  prompt macro-control measures to restore financial order,  stabilize the economy and maintain sound development. This  created the necessary conditions for sustained development and  smooth progress of the reform in the present year and also  helped accumulate valuable experience in exercising  macro-control under conditions of a socialist market economy.    Referring to the progress of economic restructuring last  year, Li said China deepened the reform of enterprises,  continuing to concentrate on changing the way they operate and  gradually giving them more decision-making power. The  state-owned and collectively owned economic sectors developed,  and so did the privately owned sector and the sector with  foreign investment, Li Peng noted.    China rationalized price relations and for the most part,  lifted controls over the purchasing and selling prices of grain.  China accelerated the development of markets for the basic  means of production, including capital, labor, land, technology  and information. China has also drawn up plans for reform of  finance, taxation, banking, investment and foreign trade and  began to implement them smoothly.    Over the last year the country continued to open wider to  the  outside world. Foreign trade expanded in all fields, with the  volume of imports and exports increased by 18.2 per cent over  the 1992 figure.    Achievements were scored in the fields of science and  technology, education, sports, literature and art, the press and  publishing, radio, film and television, social sciences, public  health, pharmaceutical production, family planning,  environmental protection and the prevention and control of  natural disasters. Further efforts were made to improve the  comprehensive management of public security. Achievements were  also scored in national defense. Socialist cultural and  ideological progress were promoted and socialist democracy and  the legal system improved.    He pointed out the living standards of urban and rural  people  continued to improve after allowing for price rises. Last year  the average income of city dwellers per capita increased by 10.2  percent over the 1992 figure. The average per capita income of  people in the countryside increased by 3.2 percent. Consumption  level of both city and country people rose steadily, and their  cultural life was continually enriched.    In his report, Li Peng also mentioned the major  contradictions and problems in the midst of progress, such as  excessive investment in fixed assets, a fairly sharp rise in  prices, irrational economic structure, and some state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises having difficulties with  production and operation.    In some areas public order is poor, and not enough has been  done to combat social evils. The corrupt practices of a few  government functionaries, such as embezzlement, fraud, accepting  bribes and bending the law for personal gains, and formalism and  bureaucratism in government organs have impaired the close ties  between the government and the people. The party central  committee and the State Council regard these as serious problems  and are making every effort to solve them, Li said.</p>

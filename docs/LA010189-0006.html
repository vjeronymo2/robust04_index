			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK ME  </P> <P> This novel's hip style, smooth tone and sensual spirit distinctively recall the  music of Steely Dan, a resemblance which turns out to be more than accidental,  for Marcelle Clements lives with Donald Fagen, Steely Dan's lead singer and  composer. Clements, a journalist, wrote "Rock Me" in part to evoke the lives of  the musicians she first met at New York City's High School of Music and Art and  then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen's backup singers. On this  level, "Rock Me" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael, Clements'  protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with the late  1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and longing  for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a delightfully  spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the New  School for Social Research: "It's just been a horrible grind for so long,"  Casey tells Michael, "that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative tropism  about all of it."  </P> <P> Sometimes Clements' language, with no evidence of satire, strays from the  eccentric to the insipid. "You really have a great tan," Casey tells Michael.  "I hope so," he responds. "Because that's all I have." Clements' point of view  is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person for no  apparent reason. A final problem is Clements' attempt to study a love triangle.  Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New York  City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover and  band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between Casey and  Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between the  two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting her  feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled with guilt  over her "dirty deed."  </P> <P> Clements' portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible sketch  of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively  reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her music:  "The best affair is the affair you don't have . . . except in your songs."  </P></p>

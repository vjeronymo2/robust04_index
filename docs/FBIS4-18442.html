			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Emin Varol: "Golhan: Vigilance Against Greece"] </F>   [Text] Ankara--National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has  said that Turkey must be vigilant, because Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou may decide to make a frenzied move.    While waiting with his wife to cast his vote, Golhan replied  to several questions in a public opinion poll on allergy tests.  A SABAH correspondent asked him about the agreement between  Greece and south Cyprus to cooperate on defense. Golhan said:  "Papandreou won the election by describing Turkey as Greece's  target. He feels he must do something now. He is 80. He may  make a frenzied move. It will be useful to remain vigilant.  Considering that agreement, we are taking the necessary  measures."    Asked another question, Golhan said that Greece is less  popular than any of the other members of the European Union.  Stressing that Turkey will dispatch 2,700 troops to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Golhan asserted: "But Turkey has received  no official UN document on the issue. The UN Security Council  has adopted a resolution but Turkey has received no official  document."    Golhan also asserted that General Cevik Bir, former  commander  of the Turkish troops in Somalia, will not be assigned to  command the Turkish military units in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He  said: "Gen. Bir will not be assigned to the job. He has  fulfilled his mission in Somalia. Others wish to be assigned  similar duties. Naturally, such missions are linked with  qualifications and promotions."</p>

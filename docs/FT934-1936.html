			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Observer: New leaf What a fickle world. It was only a few months ago that Dillons, part of the once high-flying Pentos book retailing chain, took over Midland Bank's splendid old headquarters in Birmingham and turned it into the UK's largest bookstore outside London. Old banking hands saw it as another symbol of the long-term decline of what used to be Britain's biggest bank. Now Midland is bouncing back under new owners and Pentos, headed by ex-Midland chairman Sir Kit McMahon, needs to reduce its borrowings. Perhaps Midland should buy back its old headquarters and move out of London. It would help distance Midland management from its interfering parent, HSBC Holdings, and give the impression that it was returning to its original roots in the Midlands. Just an idea.</p>

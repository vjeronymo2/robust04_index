			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings greet Nigeria's big cocoa crop Cocoa farmers, traders and exporters in Nigeria are greeting the end of the 1993-94 season with mixed feelings: delight at the crop yields and fear that foreign exchange restrictions will drive the export of cocoa beans underground or out of business. This season's crop matched last year's but the world price for Nigerian cocoa is much stronger - averaging Dollars 1,200 a tonne. The 1993-94 crop produced 135,000 tonnes of which 120,000 has been harvested. The remaining 15,000 tonnes will be harvested in the mid crop starting April till August, when weight and butter fat content of the beans are low. 'It has been an excellent season for Nigerian farmers and traders. Everyone has made money,' said a spokesman for one of the leading cocoa exporters. The 1994 budget in January put a stop to the optimism. The budget pegged the official rate of the naira at 22 to the US dollar, outlawed the parallel market and decreed that all exporters must repatriate and sell their dollars at N22 to the central bank of Nigeria. Exporters who paid farmers N47,000 a tonne and sold for Dollars 1,200 a tonne would have to re-sell the same dollars to the government for only N26,400, making a loss of 56 per cent on the currency transaction alone. Traders predict that farm prices for Nigerian cocoa for the mid-season crop will be down to N35,000 a tonne (Dollars 730 at the parallel rate). Some traders were able to carry on exporting cocoa legitimately after the budget because they had sold dollars far enough forward to see them through the season. All but 15,000 tonnes of the harvest had been shipped by mid-March. Exporters without forward dollar contracts had two choices: either stop buying from the farmers or smuggle the cocoa so that the dollars did not have to be repatriated. Cocoa remains Nigeria's biggest export earner after oil, despite inconsistent government policies affecting trade and investment. It is one of the successes of deregulation in the 1980s, which abolished the state marketing board, brought international traders into the market. As farmers' prices improved the crop almost doubled in less than a decade. Although the currency has depreciated by about 90 per cent on the legal parallel market to about N48 in the past year, the farm gate prices have risen sharply in real terms. 'It is fortunate that the budget came at the end of the harvest - most of the cocoa had been exported,' says an international trader. 'We are just hoping some sanity will be restored before the main 1994-95 harvest.' Fears over the outlook for the 1994-95 season could undermine the hard work and investment that goes into cocoa farming between April and October. The investment in fertilisers and chemicals to stop black pod disease has been essential to the improved output in recent years. With the export market so uncertain the farmers' commitment and the necessary credits may be in short supply.</p>

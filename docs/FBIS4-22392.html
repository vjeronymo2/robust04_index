			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tsigankov: "With Thoughts of the USSR </F> and Socialism: Republic Residents Prefer Private Property"]    [Text] In November-December 1993 the Independent Institute  for Socioeconomic and Political Research (NISEPI) conducted a  national poll under the title "Life in Our Times-2" (the first  poll was conducted by the institute in 1992 and its results are  also quoted for comparison). In a nationwide sample, 1,148  persons representing the entire adult population of the republic  were polled. Six parameters were controlled in conducting the  survey: gender, age, education, distribution of workers by  economic sector, residence (rural or urban), and distribution of  the population by oblast. The maximum statistical error of the  sample is 5 percent.    The survey results show first and foremost that the  population of Belarus, to put it mildly, is not entirely  knowledgeable about some socioeconomic notions, sometimes  selecting something that would be resolutely denied in the reply  to the next question. The very first question: "Which would you  choose: a market or a planned economy?" brought rather typical  replies (by the way, almost identical to those in 1992). A  market economy was supported by 54 percent, a planned one--by 43  percent. But replies to another question: "What system is most  suitable for Belarus?" present a completely different picture.  "Capitalism"--31.6 percent, "socialism"--40.9 percent,  "other"--13.7 percent, and 13.8 percent did not answer. Of  course, the role of propaganda in such reactions is great. While  even communists advocate a "moderate market," capitalism for  many remains tantamount to cannibalism. This contradiction  becomes even more obvious when we look at the answers to the  question: "In your opinion, which form of ownership is more  effective in the economic sense?" "Private"--52.8 percent,  "state"--28 percent, a sensible combination of "state" and  "private"--11.7 percent. It is a paradox, but among those who  chose socialism, to the question "Do you consider private  ownership in land acceptable in Belarus" 72.4 percent answered  "yes", and 26.6 percent--"no." However, 78.2 percent--and 64.2  percent in 1992--consider it impermissible for foreigners to own  land, although the number of those who find it permissible also  increased from 12.9 percent in 1992 to 20.3 percent in 1993. The  no opinion share was 1.5 percent, in 1992--23 percent. Those who  defined their financial situation as average comprised 39.7  percent, below average--37.7 percent, poverty--17.7 percent,  above average--3.8 percent, and high-income--0.4 percent. For  67.6 percent the financial situation has worsened over the past  two years, for 22.8 percent it has not changed, and for 9.4  percent it has improved. Therefore it is probably not surprising  that the number of persons who prefer free social services with  low quality of service and without choice increased from 28.7  percent in 1992 to 39 percent in 1993. At the same time, the  number of those who prefer to have the ability and find it  necessary to choose for their money social services of a  suitable quality decreased from 68.8 percent to 59.6 percent. As  to employment, the degree of insecurity is even greater. Low  wages at a guaranteed job are preferred by 56.7 percent (49.1  percent in 1992), while 40.6 percent (48.1 percent in 1992)  would prefer high pay but with a high degree of risk of losing  the job. It is amusing to observe the attitude of Belarus  residents to speculation, which, in my opinion, is another  paradox. A positive attitude toward speculation was registered  by 9 percent; 19 percent were neutral; and the rest were  negative to one extent or another. At the same time, 21 percent  engage personally in reselling goods, that is, many more than  those having a negative [as published] attitude to speculation.  By the way, in answer to the question "Have you had a chance to  participate in nonstate economic activities?" the figures do not  differ dramatically from those in 1992, which probably is  graphic evidence of the level of development of market relations  in Belarus. For instance, 5.8 percent (3.9 percent in 1992) had  bought securities; 2.4 percent (2.2 percent) owned a firm or an  enterprise; 13.2 percent (5.5 percent in 1992) were working for  hire in the nonstate sector; and 18.6 percent (12.1 percent in  1992) were engaged in individual labor activities.    Finally, a cluster of political questions, the answers to  which, to put it mildly, surprised many in Belarus. Restoration  of the USSR is supported by 55.1 percent (47.9 percent in 1992),  with 22.3 percent against (22 percent in 1992) and 22.3 percent  with no opinion (29.5 percent in 1992). The creation of the CIS  was seen as a stage on the former USSR republics' path to  complete independence by 18.4 percent, as the ruin of a great  state--by 39.3 percent, as a forced measure that has prevented a  bloody form of disintegration--18.3 percent, and 23.8 percent  had no opinion. New elections to the republic Supreme Soviet are  supported by 68.8 percent. Those in favor of the presidency in  Belarus comprise 43.3 percent (in 1992 only 28.2 percent). Hence  a special interest in the rating of political parties, which the  respondents were asked to indicate in answer to the question  "Representatives of which political parties and movements in  Belarus enumerated below will you vote for in the elections?"  The top-rated party was the Belarusian People's Front (17.9  percent), followed by two communist organizations--the Party of  Communists of Belarus (10.5 percent) and the Movement for  Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice (15.9 percent). Those  are followed by two "right-wing" democratic parties--the  Belarusian Peasants Party (10 percent) and the United Democratic  Party of Belarus (5.4 percent). All in all, in the calculations  of sociologists who organized the poll, 36 percent of potential  voters cast their vote for the democratic flank in politics, 26  percent support communists, and 11 percent--centrists, which is  probably the greatest paradox of the public mind in Belarus.  While voting for democratic parties and private property,  Belarus residents are nevertheless nostalgic for the USSR and  socialism.</p>

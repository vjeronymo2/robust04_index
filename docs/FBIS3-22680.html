			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marco Bustamente: "War Against Onchocerciasis"; </F> first paragraph is editorial introduction]    [Excerpt] More than one year ago VISTAZO reported on the  possibility that Ecuador would be the first country in the world  to control Onchocerciasis. This possibility is about to become a  reality.    Discovered in Ecuador in the Province of Esmeraldas in the  mid 1970's, Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by a fly bite which  can end up causing blindness in its victims, received attention  in the Ecuadoran press a little more than one year ago. The  reason for the attention was unfortunately the low state of  public health in that province. A discussion of the cause of  this situation ranged between malaria, a viral disease related  to AIDS, and "river blindness," or Onchocerciasis.    The positive aspect of this discussion, as VISTAZO reported,  lay in the possibility that, because the territory in which the  disease has been found is limited to rural areas of the Province  of Esmeraldas, its transmission can be controlled, and this  illness can be eradicated. This prediction was made by Ronald  Guderian, a North American researcher from Vozandes Hospital in  Quito. It was regarded with healthy skepticism by VISTAZO. Up to  now the only disease in the world which has been successfully  eradicated has been measles. This was done following an effort  made by thousands of scientists, the expenditure of millions of  dollars, and the passage of more than two decades. Furthermore,  the last time that the term "eradication" was used in Ecuador  was in connection with malaria. And although the National  Service for the Eradication of Malaria, or SNEM, the government  office in charge of handling this disease, still does not  consider that the illness has been conquered, malaria  eradication in Ecuador for the moment remains a well-intentioned  wish, rather than a realistic goal.    Nevertheless, the control and eventual eradication of  Onchocerciasis is quite probable in Ecuador. Guderian says,  "Yes, Onchocerciasis can be controlled." In fact he is the  principal author of the "National Plan for the Elimination of  Onchocerciasis in Ecuador," which he wrote in collaboration with  Dr. Mariela Anselmi and Dr. Alberto Narvaez, of the Ministry of  Public Health. Action on the plan began in 1993 and will be  completed in 1997. The difference between this document and  other, similar plans which have only been on paper, can be  summarized in two terms: money and the effective distribution of  medicine to those suffering from the disease.    Guderian and his team, with the cooperation of the Ministry  of Health, have obtained funds from foreign sources amounting to  $170,000 for the first year of the program. By 1997 these funds  will have totaled $730,000. This will be the financial cost of  freeing Ecuador and nearly 25,000 Ecuadorans -- principally  black citizens and members of the "Chachi" tribe of Indians in  Esmeralda Province.    As a result Ecuador is in an excellent position to be the  first country to control the spread of this disease and  accomplish its eradication, due to the availability of money,  including funds from the local, private sector, the limited  geographic distribution of the disease, the previous experience  of Ecuadoran and foreign researchers, the lack of excessive  bureaucracy in the program, the improved, though modest,  cooperation of the Ministry of Health, and the donation of a  medicine called "Ivermectina" by the Merck Pharmaceutical  Company.    Guderian has said: "According to the goals agreed upon at  two  recent, scientific meetings, our goals are stopping the spread  of the disease by the year 2000 and achieving its eradication by  2011." Evaluation of the program at the national level will be  conducted by Dr. Jose Rumbea, professor of tropical medicine at  the University of Guayaquil and an associate of Guderian in the  control program.  <H5>  Key Drug </H5>   Rural areas of the Province of Esmeraldas basically have  onchocerciasis because, in the affected areas -- the basins of  the Cayapas and Santiago Rivers and other, small areas where the  disease is found -- there are flies of the "Simulium" variety,  known popularly as "juros" [always there], which transmit the  disease. For example, when a person living in the Province of  Esmeralda or an Indian of the "Chachi" tribe goes to the rivers  to get water, he or she is bitten by a fly already infected with  so-called "microfilary" parasites. In the bite the fly injects  onchocerciasis larvae, which eventually settle in subcutaneous  skin tissue, where they develop into adult worms. These worms  are encapsulated by the body. In an attempt to isolate them the  body forms subcutaneous nodules. Inside these nodules are worms  which produce thousands of microfilary parasites which spread  out into nearby body tissue. Immune reactions against the  microfilary parasites, which account for most of the symptoms,  can cause anything from blindness to skin wrinkles. If the  microfilary parasites block lymphatic circulation, it is  possible to see elephantiasis, a grotesque and pendulous growth  of tissue alongside the obstruction.    Trying to control the flies has turned out to be impractical  because of the cost. The strategy which Guderian and his  associates have followed is based on "taking away the raw  material," so to speak, from the flies transmitting the disease.  How is this done? In the first place, by extracting the  subcutaneous nodules, where the adult worms produce thousands of  microfilary parasites. This procedure is called "nodulectomy."  Secondly, trying to reduce the number of microfilary parasites  which, after leaving the nodules, move to the surrounding  tissue, waiting for a fly which transmits the disease but is not  yet infected to bite the sick person. The fly then becomes  infected and can bite another, healthy person, continuing the  transmission of the disease. The drug which successfully kills  these microfilary parasites is called "Ivermectina." It has been  donated by the Merck Pharmaceutical Company to the control  program, thanks in part to efforts made by Dr. Plutarco Naranjo,  the former minister of health.    During the periodic trips which the researchers make to the  areas affected by the disease they have evaluated more than  20,000 persons who have the disease. They provide them with  "Ivermectina" twice a year and, if necessary, perform  nodulectomies to remove the adult worms. According to Dr.  Marlene Silva, coordinator of the present program, "When we go  to see them, the great majority of the patients are interested  in receiving `Ivermectina.' We work with their community  leaders. Only in this way have we succeeded in reaching those  20,000 patients." In effect, according to Doctor Rumbea, who  evaluates the results, "We have seen how, in certain cases, the  number of microfilary parasites has been reduced after treatment  from about 1,000 microfilary parasites per cubic millimeter of  skin down to two or three microfilary parasites per cubic  millimeter. Furthermore, the program for controlling  onchocerciasis in Ecuador can serve as a guide for other  programs, like the one in Colombia." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> VET DISABILITY RULES TO BE REVAMPED  </P> <P> Bowing to a recent federal court ruling, the government today moved to revamp  rules that have prevented 34,000 veterans from obtaining disability benefits  for exposure to the defoliant "Agent Orange."  </P> <P> Proposed new rules published for public comment would authorize the Veterans  Affairs Department to award disability benefits when there was reasonable doubt  as to whether a particular disease was statistically linked to exposure.  </P> <P> The department set an Aug. 17 deadline for comments, and it said it would try  to have final rules in place by Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski ordered the new rules in May  after a federal judge in San Francisco threw out the existing rules, concluding  that they were too restrictive.  </P></p>

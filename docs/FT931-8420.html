			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister seeks slimmer agencies GOVERNMENT agencies should do more to reduce staff numbers and slim down management, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said yesterday, John Willman writes. Mr Waldegrave, addressing a conference of agency chief executives in York to mark the fifth anniversary of the creation of agencies, acknowledged that the Civil Service was growing again. Figures recently published by the Financial Times showed that 21 of the first 28 agencies had increased staff numbers since inception - by 12 per cent overall. Public expenditure pressures meant that agencies should be at the forefront of increasing productivity, Mr Waldegrave said. He urged the chief executives to use the managerial freedoms given to agencies to remove 'old hierarchies in management' and tailor structures and pay to the needs of their activities. The minister also acknowledged concern among chief executives over legal confusion on whether European legislation on employee rights in mergers and takeovers applies to contracting-out of public services. If it does, the contractor must take over the staff currently doing the work at their existing pay and conditions.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOLF / RICH TOSCHES;  </P> <P> UPKEEP AT KNOLLWOOD VEERING OFF COURSE  </P> <P> The good news these days from the Knollwood Country Club in Granada Hills --  the most heavily played public course in the Valley -- is that not all of the  fairway grass is dead and not all of the greens have turned brown.  </P> <P> The bad news, however, is that most of the areas of the course that are not  parched are soggy and swampy.  </P> <P> Once a splendid golf course, Knollwood has deteriorated badly in the past  several months. How bad is it? Well, let some of the golfers describe it.  </P> <P> "The condition of the course has approached the level of a cattle enclosure,"  said veteran golfer Eugene McCarthy of Valencia.  </P> <P> And from Don Axelson, also a longtime player at the course and the president of  the Knollwood Men's Golf Club: "Basically, they have allowed Knollwood to go to  hell. It is simply a disaster."  </P> <P> And this from Larry Lee: "Knollwood is not in the best of conditions at the  moment. It has been a few months since I played there, and it was acceptable  then. But the problems have worsened since then."  </P> <P> If it seems that Lee was a bit more tactful in his criticism than McCarthy and  Axelson, well, there's a reason. Lee is golf director for the Los Angeles  County Parks &amp; Recreation Department, where his job is to make sure the  county's courses are properly maintained.  </P> <P> The county last year considered turning over maintenance of Knollwood to a  private golf course management firm, but the plan fizzled when the Parks &amp;  Recreation Department received no bids that it considered adequate.  </P> <P> In the ensuing months, very few things have not gone wrong at the course. On  the first hole there is an area of standing water and mud extending nearly 75  yards from the green. It is impassable with a golf cart and nearly impassable  without one. The best way to play the hole is while wearing your  brother-in-law's golf shoes.  </P> <P> McCarthy, who has played at Knollwood for 17 years, said a snorkel would be  nice, too.  </P> <P> "At least five holes have had leaks in the sprinkler systems for so long that  actual swamps have formed on the fairways," he said. "I mean standing, filthy  water. No one knows how deep it might be because no one has been brave enough  to find out."  </P> <P> And several of the tees similarly have been, let's say, overwatered.  </P> <P> "Two weeks ago I played there and one tee was so wet, the ground so thoroughly  soaked, that when you put a tee in the ground it could not support the weight  of a golf ball," McCarthy said.  </P> <P> Not everything at Knollwood is soaked. Some areas appear to have last seen  water about the time that the niblick was a popular club.  </P> <P> "The greens are either dead or dying," said Axelson. "We don't even call them  greens anymore. We call them browns."  </P> <P> And if the alternating swamp-and-desert setting isn't enough to make the  golfers angry, the holes are. The holes were dug by a construction company  installing an irrigation-control system during the past several months. The  holes are deep and they are wide. And several of them, flush in the middle of  fairways, have yet to be filled in.  </P> <P> "The No. 4 fairway has six excavations in a row," McCarthy said. "Like someone  dropped bombs."  </P> <P> Lee said the problems have been related to ongoing construction.  </P> <P> "The installation of the new irrigation control system, a computerized system  which tells the sprinklers when to come on and how long to stay on for, was a  major project," Lee said. "It caused some disruptions. And while converting the  course from the old watering system to the new one, we have lost some control  over the watering process, which has given us inconsistent watering. There are  wet areas and there are dry areas.  </P> <P> "We know of the problems and we are addressing them. I have told people at  Knollwood that the greens, which were subject to heavy fungus infestations this  summer, will be back to normal in November and that all the other problems will  be corrected before that."  </P> <P> Going places: Angie Ravaioli of Moorpark remembers the day that she realized  she might have a future in golf. It was the day that recruiters from Southern  Methodist University came calling.  </P> <P> "When I was still in high school and someone was offering to pay for my college  education if I would play golf for them, I knew I might be better than an  average golfer," said Ravaioli, who went on to play at SMU for four years.  </P> <P> For the past year she has played on the new women's Players' West Tour in  California, Nevada and Arizona. And next week, Ravaioli, 23, leaves for Venice,  Fla., for the first stage of the LPGA Qualifying School and a chance at a  playing card for that lucrative tour for 1991.  </P> <P> "I know what the odds are," she said. "I know how many people are competing for  just a few spots. But ever since I started playing golf, I've always been able  to compete against the players at each level. From junior golf to high school  golf, then to college golf and now on this pro tour.  </P> <P> "I think I can compete on the LPGA Tour, too."  </P> <P> Ravaioli has not exactly dominated play on the Players West Tour. In 16 events  this year she has won just $2,744 and ranks 22nd on the money list.  </P> <P> "I've played well," she said. "In several tournaments I had a good chance to  win but then turned in one bad round out of the four that dropped me back. Golf  is, I think, all mental and I've had a hard time keeping my concentration for a  whole tournament. But I'm working on it.  </P> <P> "I've always dreamed of playing on the LPGA Tour. I think I have a chance."  </P></p>

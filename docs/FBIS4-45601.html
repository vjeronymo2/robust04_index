			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 24 (XINHUA) -- This, China's largest  metropolis and economic center has a basic system in place to  prevent deterioration of the environment.    "The amount of major discharged pollutants has dropped and  the quality of the local environment has improved vastly," Lu  Shuping, a specialist in environmental protection, said.    "But noise pollution is getting worse," noted Lu, also  director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental  Protection.    Shanghai, with a population of more than 13 million, is  China's largest industrial city.    To ensure that its people live in a clean environment, the  municipal government has adjusted its industrial structure and  industrial locations in a scientific and rational way in recent  years. At the same time it has concentrated on the treatment of  water and air pollution, along with the construction of  infrastructural facilities and basic industries.    As a result, the director noted, the quality of water and  air  has improved to some degree, but noise still exceeds the set  standard due to the construction of urban facilities and the  increase in the number of motor vehicles.    According to the latest statistics, the amount of discharged  industrial waste water in 1993 was 6.52 percent less than in  1992, and that of water after treatment increased by 5.47  percent.    The rate of industrial waste water treated last year reached  82.3 percent, up 5.3 percent over the previous year.    According to the statistics, the amount of discharged  domestic sewage last year went up by 105 million tons and that  of sewage treated by 96.9 million tons.    All this shows that Shanghai discharges an average of 5.567  million tons of waste water a day, of which 63.1 percent is  industrial-use water and the rest domestic sewage.    According to the expert, the amount of sulphur dioxide,  smoke  and industrial dust, which are regarded as major pollutants in  waste gases, shrank by 14.1 percent, 15.9 percent and 3.4  percent, respectively, last year over 1992.    The rate of utilization of solid industrial pollutants is  83.7 percent and that of the treatment of garbage 71.6 percent.    According to the director, the main pollutants in local  water  are ammonia, nitrogen, chemicals and oil.    A recent survey on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River  showed that the water quality was better than in 1992 and the  amount of dust in the air over the city was less than in 1992.    Lu said that the municipal government is working out an  overall program to clean and beautify the environment so as to  control pollution and improve the quality of the surroundings.    The program includes construction of sewage treatment, waste  water discharge and garbage disposal projects.    In addition, the municipal government will strengthen noise  control, including banning the use of motor vehicle loudspeakers.    It will also develop cooking gas facilities and plant more  trees, flowers and lawns in and around the city, Lu said.</p>

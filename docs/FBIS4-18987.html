			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The situation in Bosnia: things are somewhat  calmer this evening in Gorazde. [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this evening that the  allies would not retreat when faced with provocations or attacks  in Bosnia, wherever they came from. Alain Juppe spoke to Alain  Pages of Radio France Bordeaux-Gironde:    [Begin Juppe recording] The resolutions of the Security  Council and the decisions of the alliance are very clear: they  authorize UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] to ask for the use of  air strikes when it believes that our soldiers on the ground are  under threat. These conditions were fulfilled in Gorazde.    If the conditions that occurred in Gorazde should, alas,  happen again, if UNPROFOR is attacked, if one side or another,  let us say the Serbs, do not respect the decisions taken by the  United Nations, then of course air strikes must be used. We  must make it clear that we shall not retreat when faced with  provocations and attacks. [end recording]</p>

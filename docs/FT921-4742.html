			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Responsibility for bomb sites I LIVE in a terraced house which is adjacent to the site of houses destroyed in the war. This land belongs to the London Borough of Southwark and has for many years been left as a wilderness. In 1975, the council erected a chicken-wire fence along the boundary of my front and back gardens. The fence is now collapsing into my garden. After a long series of complaints to the council, the land was cleared but the fence was not renewed. My deeds are silent as to the ownership of the fence. This land is open to the street and thus I have a security problem. Also, if the land is not kept cleared the problem will recur of vegetation and seedling trees growing into the fabric of my house (which forms the boundary along its side wall), damaging any replacement fence and blocking the light. There is also the sheer unsightliness of the site and the fence. Can I compel the council to replace the fence and/or keep the site in reasonable order? You cannot compel the council to fence the site or to maintain the fence, but you would be entitled to erect a fence at your own expense. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPERATION RESCUE  </P> <P> I'm sure you'll get barraged with complaints about Chief Gates' aggressive  handling of the Operation Rescue demonstrations, but for all those silently  thankful, I'll say it: Thank you, Chief Gates! It's time the tail stopped  wagging the dog on this issue.  </P> <P> A woman considering an abortion is in fact considering denying the  responsibility associated with rearing that child. Few women undertake such a  decision lightly, and those who would force the woman to follow through and  bear the child under such circumstances cannot claim to have the child's  welfare at heart, gut-level sloganeering notwithstanding.  </P> <P> FRANK SHOFNER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

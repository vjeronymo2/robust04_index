			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MORE SHELLSHOCK  </P> <P> Raphael, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo -- a.k.a. the "Teenage Mutant  Ninja Turtles" -- are back in action. The sequel to New Line Cinema's big hit  (domestic gross: more than $121 million) is set to go before the cameras in  October for Golden Harvest.  </P> <P> This time out, the budget's $20 million -- up from the $12 million for "Turtles  I."  </P> <P> "We want to give the film bigger production values and better sets," says  producer David Chan. "We want it to be even more entertaining. And we'd like a  little more time to shoot." (The first film was shot in nine weeks.)  </P> <P> The director is not set, and the turtle players are still being cast.  </P> <P> Todd W. Langen is again scripting. Chan was mum about the storyline, revealing  only that the character of Splinter, the pizza-loving turtles' mentor-rat, will  return in a plot involving "the fight against injustice."  </P> <P> Projected release date: spring, 1991. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

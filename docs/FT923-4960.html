			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ACTIVITY increased sharply in the derivatives markets yesterday as a strong advance in government bonds encouraged several London securities houses to take a more positive view of the interest rate outlook, writes Terry Byland. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE Index opened lower but rose strongly at mid-morning, touching a day's peak of 2,330 before its official close of around 2,328, a premium of around 7 to the fair value figure, which incorporates dividend flows and financing costs. Dealers identified two leading UK houses and one US house as determined buyers of the stock index futures. However, there was further selling of the September contract by a US house which has followed a determinedly bearish tack for several weeks. In traded options, volume jumped from Tuesday's 15,060 contracts to 27,495 yesterday, with 17,619 representing calls. The FT-SE contract traded 10,153 lots, compared with 6,424 previously. Tesco topped the actives list in stock options with 2,249 contracts, as a large line of shares appeared in the stock market. Cadbury-Schweppes options, also overshadowed by stock in the equity market, had 1,178 lots transacted.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Dividend scheme uncovered The Economics Ministry in the German state of Hesse has uncovered 179 cases of a stock market phenomenon known as dividend-stripping, German newspapers reported over the weekend. The reports, quoting the Czerwensky Intern newsletter, said the transactions concerned had involved 5.9m shares with a value of more than DM2bn (Pounds 826m) and were based on brokers' data from 1991. In dividend-stripping transactions, which fall into a legal grey area, shares are exchanged between domestic and foreign shareholders just before a dividend payout so the domestic operator holds the shares when the payment is made. This means the domestic shareholder can take advantage of a tax credit accompanying the cash dividend which is worthless to a foreign investor. The shares are then sold back to the foreign party at a fixed lower price, allowing the two parties to split the effective cash value of the tax credit.</p>

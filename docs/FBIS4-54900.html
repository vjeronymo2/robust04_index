			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ze": "Agreement on Extradition and Acceptance </F> of Citizens Between Slovakia and Croatia"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav  Pittner and Croatian Minister of Internal Affairs Ivan Jarnjak  signed an agreement between the Governments of the Slovak  Republic and the Republic of Croatia on the extradition and  acceptance of their own citizens, as well as a protocol on the  execution of the agreement, in Bratislava yesterday. [passage  omitted]    The agreement will facilitate cooperation between the police  and the security forces of both countries in uncovering criminal  activity. [passage omitted]    Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner announced at a  briefing that some 18,000 foreign nationals are currently  staying legally in the Slovak Republic, and another  20,000-30,000 are estimated to be staying here illegally, most  of whom are citizens of the former USSR. Chechens, in  particular, are engaged in criminal activity on our territory.  Certain indications suggest that they play the role of some  kind of punitive expeditions in connection with international  crime or the role of drug couriers. Jarnjak said that, although  the number of foreign tourists doubled in Croatia last year, the  crime rate declined 18 percent, also thanks to preventive  operations. [passage omitted]</p>

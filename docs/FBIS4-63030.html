			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has declined to accept Sergey Shakhray's resignation,  having found his arguments insufficient, Yeltsin's press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a briefing here today.    The president instructed his staff to convey to Sergey  Shakhray "a few critical remarks concerning his style of work  and some personal qualities". The president, according to  Kostikov, pointed to Sergey Shakhray's "political whimsicality  and his desire to accumulate too many posts. The president  observed Sergey Shakhray's personal political motives are not  always correlated with Russia's interest".    Kostikov rejected categorically press allegations about the  forthcoming sacking of Sergey Filatov as the president's chief  of staff. According to the press secretary, Yeltsin said there  can be no question about Sergey Filatov's resignation.    Kostikov said that rumours about the dismissal of such  figures as Sergey Filatov are destabilising in character. "I  have an impression that NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has no real sources  in the presidential and governmental structures and often  engages in improvisations," he stressed. Filatov was is and  will be in the foreseeable future one of the president's closest  employees, Kostikov said.</p>

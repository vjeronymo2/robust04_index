			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Asia-Pacific 'leads air traffic growth' THE Asia-Pacific region and Latin America will lead growth in international airline passenger traffic in the five years to end-1997, says the International Air Transport Association. Total world scheduled airline passenger traffic will rise at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent, indicating a 38 per cent increase in passengers by 1997, IATA forecast at a traffic outlook conference. This could well be double world economic growth in real terms. Cargo traffic is expected to rise at an average annual rate of 7.6 per cent. North American passenger growth will be 6.1 per cent and Europe's 5.9 per cent, reflecting more mature markets and persistent recessions, said Mr Michael Brown, senior forecaster. Eastern and central Europe will grow at 10.2 per cent, from a low base. Asia-Pacific growth is seens as averaging 7.5-8.5 per cent until 2000, based on surging economic growth, improving infrastructure and booming international trade, according to IATA figures. By 2001, Asia Pacific will account for 39 per cent of international scheduled passenger traffic. Latin America, with improving conditions in countries such as Chile and Argentina, should grow by nearly 8 per cent annually until 1997. Mr James Halstead, transport analyst with Swiss Bank Corp in London, said traffic growth through 2000 implies a 30 per cent increase in the world aircraft fleet. 'By 2010, the cost of re-equipment and fleet extension will reach Dollars 850m (Pounds 568m), against net book value of the present fleet of Dollars 125m. A few profitable global airlines will emerge, with a handful of good regional carriers and another group of state-supported airlines,' he said.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / US rejects 'new Haitian president' The White House yesterday condemned the installation of a new president in Haiti but denied reports that it had already decided to remove the Caribbean republic's military junta by force, if tougher sanctions agreed last week by the United Nations do not work. US officials said, however, that some kind of UN security force, including a significant US component, would be needed, even if the sanctions do force out General Raoul Cedras and his colleagues. Haitian legislators had named Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint as interim president. This is seen as further defiance by the military regime and its associates of UN efforts to restore the exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. 'We expect him to return (to Haiti) at some point,' said a White House official, calling the legislators' move 'cynical, unconstitutional and illegal.' The Haitian embassy in Washington said the installation of Justice Jonassaint was 'designed to protect (the junta's) personal interests, further increase the suffering of the Haitian people, and plunge the country deeper into chaos.' President Bill Clinton has been careful in recent statements not to rule out the use of US military force to remove the junta that ousted Father Aristide in 1991. However, US officials are anxious to give sanctions some time to work. 'There has been no decision to send in a small force to purge the military,' said Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN. The sanctions are to go into effect if Gen Cedras and his colleagues have not left Haiti by May 21. US officials declined to say how long they planned to wait to see whether the sanctions work.</p>

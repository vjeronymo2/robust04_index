THE HERALD, Zimbabwe's main daily newspaper, on Tuesday  morning quoted senior Zimbabwe Government sources as saying that  Mengistu, who was granted political asylum in Zimbabwe nearly  four years ago, was to meet personally at 2PM Tuesday with none  less than Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira to be told to  "shut up or get out".    The angry reaction against the man once seen as one of  President Robert Mugabe's closest friends follows a long,  rambling letter by Mengistu published in Harare at the weekend  in which he claims to have been called by his countrymen to  "rescue my country" from the government of President Meles  Zenawi.    A Zimbabwean Government spokesman on Monday night sharply  attacked Mengistu, dubbed "the butcher of Addis Ababa" for  alleged massacres of thousands of people. Information Director  Bornwell Chakaodza said Mengistu's statement was "regrettable"  and that it threatened to undo the rapport between Zimbabwe and  Ethiopia.    THE HERALD, widely regarded as a government mouthpiece, said  Mr Shamuyarira would express the government's "extreme  displeasure" to Mengistu over what was a serious breach of his  conditions of asylum, which were that he would be allowed to  live here privately with his family but was forbidden to engage  in any political activity.    The newspaper spoke of high-level meetings at the Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs on Monday, where Mengistu's statement was  discussed with indignation by officials. It said Mengistu would  be told "in no uncertain terms" that Zimbabwe respected the  wishes of the Ethiopian people in electing President Zenawi. Mr  Mugabe and Mr Zenawi had met twice and relations between the two  countries were now "cordial".    As rebel forces of Zenawi's Ethiopian People's Revolutionary  Democratic Front (EPRDF) converged on Addis Ababa in May 1990,  Mengistu fled his country. His departure followed 13 years as  head of one of the bloodiest regimes in recent African history,  which imposed Stalinist policies that wrecked the thriving  economy under former Emperor Haile Selassie.    He landed in Harare and was granted asylum by Mr Mugabe, a  favour that has repeatedly embarrassed the Zimbabwe premier, as  human rights groups condemned him for giving refuge to a man  regarded as a mass murderer, who should be sent home to face  trial.    Over the years Mengistu has become a lonely man, a virtual  prisoner in his government villa in a diplomatic suburb of  Harare, deserted first by his wife, Werb Anchi, and then his  bodyguards.</p>

[Text] Everyone says the mainland is good: There is  plenty of manpower, cheap land, and a vast market; it is a good  place for Taiwan traders to continue to grow and make money.    Is this true? What do Taiwan traders who have invested in  the  mainland say?    Cheng Pao-t'ang [6774 1405 1016] (General Manager, China  Giant)  <H5>  This Is No Return Home </H5>   It is very hard going here. Very hard going. People who  haven't come to the mainland do not appreciate just how hard  going it is here. Here, you cannot look at the mainland with a  Taiwan outlook. Doing things here with a Taiwan point of view  does not work.    But if you want to come here to complain, then don't come  here. This is because the system that has existed on the  mainland for the past 40 years has bred a large common pot  mentality in which everyone expects the same benefits no matter  his or her work. Different environments have bred different  value concepts. One cannot say that theirs are wrong. Since they  are people, and people's natures are different, there are no  rights and wrongs about cultural matters. But standards should  be improved. For example, people over here do not do things on  time and they do not keep promises. They should be trained to do  things on time and to keep promises, and they should may  attention to sanitation.    Mainland employees follow instructions, but their thinking  and outlook is different. You have to spend a lot of time  explaining things to them.    I came here in August 1992, and we are still building a  factory. I open my eyes at 5:30 every morning and climb to the  top of a hill alone. At 7:00 o'clock I eat breakfast, and at  7:30 I go to the office. I work until 7:00 p.m. Then I return to  my dormitory to eat dinner. At 9:00 or 10:00 o'clock at night, I  often return to the plant area on patrol.    Although I am only a junior middle school graduate, I have  always believed that a person should have a desire to learn.  After graduating, I worked in the underworld, and as a  pharmacist in a clinic. I was 24 years old before I entered  Jumbo where I worked as head of the model car manufacturing  department, head of the warehouse receiving department, head of  the issuing department, and head of the painting department. I  also served as head of the on-site manufacturing section, in  general affairs, and in procurement, and on up to the manager of  the materials department.  <H5>  Both a Challenge and a Mission </H5>   When the company asked me to become the Giant general  manager  in China, I wrestled with the matter for several months, finally  deciding to come. I did not want to let the board of directors  down after the many years they had invested in me. It was also  an opportunity for me to move upward in the company and to  expand my horizons. So I came to the mainland to give my all. It  became my second youth.    At first, in the quiet the night, I frequently wept thinking  about my family. I felt very sad that my children were so small,  but I could not be with them to help them grow up. I had three  small children studying in middle school and primary school. It  was the period of their schooling. When I was at home, they  often asked me questions. Whenever they saw something, they  asked about it. Now I was unable to perform my duty as head of  the family.    My father lost a leg in an automobile accident, and my  mother  has diabetes. In order for me to come to the mainland, I asked  by younger brother to resign from his job in Taipei and move  back to Ta-chia to look after our two parents.    Coming here takes physical strength and stamina. One has to  work hard. When I return to Taiwan for 10 days every 3 months, I  am sure to help the children polish their bicycles.    I thought about sending the children over here for an  education, but in Taiwan, the savior of the people is Chiang  Kai-shek. On the mainland, it is Mao Zedong... I often explain  to the children what daddy's thinking is, and why I want to go  to the mainland. When I first came here, I was very happy at  returning to Taiwan each time, but now it is agonizing to  return, because there is so much to be looked after here. The  employees here are ignorant about bicycles. They have to be  looked after and taught.    I am very sad at heart at coming here, because coming here  is  no returning home, and because my tour of duty is open-ended.  Coming here is a challenge and a mission.  <H5>  Anonymous Taiwan Trader: Everything Is a Swindle </H5>   When you operate a factory on the mainland, very many people  collect money under very many guises. Someone may suddenly come  to collect a cleaning fee. Never mind the reason given, if they  want to collect it, they collect it. Here fees for public order  are also levied by the head, and the Customs also frequently  makes things difficult for Taiwan traders. They like to cause  trouble for no reason at all, suddenly issuing fines of tens of  thousands of yuan. During one Mid-autumn Festival, I spent  15,000 yuan on dinner parties and gift giving. They often say  that we are the most stingy, but since we are not engaged in  smuggling, why should we give dinner parties? There are very  many bogus joint ventures here that are actually sole  proprietorships. When paying employees their salaries, you have  to turn over Hong Kong dollars to the joint venture unit first;  then, they pay the employees in renminbi, benefitting from the  difference in the exchange rate.    Here, management is the biggest headache. The workers here  stonewall each other and are fond of quarrelling. This is very  hard to deal with. Communism rules here. Using democratic  methods to operate is impossible. One has to use forceful means.  During my first year, I used Taiwan's humane management methods,  which failed miserably. The following year, I changed. I used  dictatorial management. I changed to arbitrary management.    Here I found everything is a swindle. I have yet to meet a  good person. There is no way to defend yourself against it. When  we first set up the factory, they helped with everything, and I  felt they were very good. But after two or three years, things  are not the same.    When I was in Taiwan, I did not take medicine for three  years, but since coming here, I take medicine every day, and  every two or three days, I have to have a shot.    Criminals are beginning to appear here. Ranking cadres can  also earn money easily.    One ranking cadre runs a gambling parlor. One has seven  automobiles, two of them Rolls Royces.    Once I bought a generator. When it was delivered, I wanted  to  try it out to see whether it would generate electricity. But the  other party would not let me try it out. I insisted. Several  days later, he had a criminal come to kill me. I barricaded the  door and had someone mediate before the matter was resolved.    [passage omitted]  <H5>  Taiwan Trader Suicide Image </H5>   Taiwan traders here must also engage in self-criticism. Some  Taiwan traders are fond of indulging themselves. They go out  karaoke singing; they go wenching; and they keep women. This  causes bad feelings among the local people. Sooner or later,  this will make for tense relations between the two sides of the  Straits.    In addition, some Taiwan traders engage in cut-throat  competition. They engage in price slashing with each other, and  some factories do not train their own personnel. Instead, they  try to hollow out each other.    Very many Taiwan traders who come here that do not make  money  in a year or two turn to smuggling. Well-behaved Taiwan traders  are hurt by these Taiwan traders that have a bad image. Over  here, one positively should not travel by bus. Two or three  people may board a bus with knives to steal money. If you are a  little slow in giving it to them, they may stab you. During the  New Year when workers return home, robberies frequently occur.  The place is simply lawless and godless, one swindle after  another.</p>

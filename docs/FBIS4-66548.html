			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 12--The Communist Party of India  (CPI), has demanded that immediate steps be taken to initiate a  political process in Jammu and Kashmir so that people of the  state can regain their confidence.    Briefing newspersons on the issues discussed at the National  Council of the CPI which met here from February 8 to 10, the  party General Secretary, Mr Indrajit Gupta, said to start with,  the government should convene an all-party meet at the national  level to discuss the question of `political freedom', and pave  the way for a dialogue with the various political forces in the  State.    He said the National Council also wanted the problem to be  resolved within the framework of the Constitution while  preserving the special status of the region under Article 370  and respecting the desire of the people to safeguard their  identity.    Referring to the external pressure with regard to Kashmir,  Mr  Gupta said India should take all possible steps to rebuff the  United States' anti-Kashmir stand. The evil designs of the  United States against peace and amity in the sub-continent, must  be frustrated.    Charging the government with procrastination and lacking in  a  clear cut policy on Kashmir, he said the Kashmir administration  was not responding to the people's urges as it was treating the  problem merely as a law and order one. Instead of creating a  favourable condition for initiating a political process in the  State, the Narasimha Rao Government was relying only on  administrative measures, he said.    Mr Gupta also opined that the leaders of both the Communist  Party of India (Marxist) and the CPI should "sit together and  talk of the possibilities of a merger." These two parties, he  said, had a special relationship which had to be developed,  although there were differences on some questions. The two  should also seriously consider the question of the unity of mass  organisations like the trade unions, rural organisations and  students' organisations.    "Both of us together can and should give a new turn to the  nation's politics," he said, adding that the Left parties have  planned an intensive nation-wide campaign in February and March  and also a march to the Parliament on April 5 to protest against  the economic policies of the Rao government.</p>

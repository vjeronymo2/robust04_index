			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Bonds: Japanese equity warrants begin cautious recovery long-dated options to buy shares - bounced back in April, when 23 new issues of equity warrant bonds were launched. The recovery of the market is the latest in a series of resurrections over the past year or so. But potential supply in the sector still outstrips demand, so the market is being carefully monitored in an effort to ward off another collapse. At the end of last year, about 80 per cent of warrants were out of the money  -that is, the exercise price of the warrant was lower than the share price, so they were not worth converting. Now, according to Robert Fleming, 114 actively-traded dollar warrants are in the money and 282 are out, following the recovery of the Japanese stock market. Although new issue volume has picked up steadily, demand for paper is not even close to the peaks of 1989. Equity warrants follow underlying stock prices, but their movements are exaggerated because they are highly-geared instruments. Consequently, they are most useful - and most dangerous - in volatile markets. The current trading range of the Japanese stock market between 26,000 and 27,000 has put a damper on the secondary market. 'In a flat market, it is impossible for investors to make the 1 1/2 points bid/offer spread to break even,' one analyst pointed out. Japan's Golden Week holiday this week is further stifling activity. Meanwhile, the pattern of the new issues market is changing. Seven of this months' new issues were denominated in a currency other than dollars, the usual sector for equity warrants. There are signs that warrants in European currencies will form an increasingly important portion of the market. D-Mark and Swiss franc issues made up less than 9 per cent of the market at the end of 1990, but accounted for more than 15 per cent by the end of the first quarter of 1991. Historically, the D-Mark sector has been the domain of smaller, lesser-known companies. Japanese investors have not bought such paper because these small issues were rather illiquid, but larger companies have started to enter the market, enticed by better swap opportunities and the chance to tap a fresh investor base. According to Robert Fleming research, the all-in yen cost of borrowing is now marginally cheaper in D-Marks than in dollars, at 3.5 per cent versus 3.6 per cent for a four-year issue of 4 per cent bonds with warrants. There have also been suggestions that large issuers have stayed away from the dollar sector because of embarrassment that their existing warrants in the sector were substantially out of the money. The appearance of larger deals, such as a DM400m issue for Daiwa earlier this month, has encouraged Japanese investors to become more active in the D-Mark sector. However, they are still not buyers of Swiss franc equity warrants, because that market, dominated by the domestic investor, is still quite illiquid. Meanwhile, marketmakers in dollar warrants based in London, which provides much of the market's liquidity, are starting to make markets in D-Mark warrants as well. More importantly, it is expected that D-Mark warrants will soon be traded on the broker-broker market in Japan, which would encourage greater participation by Japanese investors. Issues of more than DM200m are expected to be traded. The growth of the Ecu bond market this year has increased the prospect of Ecu-denominated warrants. But the relatively high cost of funds for borrowers remains a barrier. The Ecu/yen swap market is less liquid than either the D-Mark/yen market, as well as the dollar/yen market. Further, the Swiss franc and D-Mark sectors were supported at the outset by domestic buying, while there is no obvious investor base for Ecu warrants. The lack of a domestic investor base may also slow development of a market in French franc equity warrants. The first such deal, a FFr1bn offering for Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, was launched at the beginning of April, and opened at a three-point premium to its par issue price. Japanese securities houses are keen to nurture demand for their lucrative equity warrant business. The Y50bn equivalent limit on the size of new issues has been in force for a year and is likely to remain. However, the market may face a further threat in the form of supply from another source. The Japanese equity market, which has been closed to new issues for a year, may reopen in June or July. The reopening of this market 'may take some of the money out of the equity warrant market,' said one Japanese banker.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: VW sees small profit this year The Volkswagen group expects to show a small net profit this year on turnover up around 4 per cent to almost DM80bn (Dollars 51bn), writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. The German company, which last year lost DM1.94bn, said yesterday it had increased deliveries of vehicles to customers by about 200,000 to 3.3m, gaining most in north American and Asia-Pacific markets. In western Europe, where market share fell half a percentage point to 16 per cent this year, sales grew only 2.3 per cent.</p>

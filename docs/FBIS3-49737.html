			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(per)": "The Czech Army's SS-23 Missiles Will </F> Be Dismantled Within Three Years"]    [Text] Prague--The SS-23 surface-to-surface missiles that  the Czech Army took over from the former Federal Army will be  withdrawn from its ordnance and dismantled before 1996. This is  apparent from the information made available to RUDE PRAVO by Z.  Borkovec, press spokesman for the Defense Ministry. He refused  to reply to questions on how many missiles there are on our  territory and where they will be dismantled. We found out from  other sources that the Research and Testing Institute in  Slavicin has looked into dismantling the missiles, and their  actual dismantling should be carried out by the military unit in  Bohuslavice nad Vlari near Zlin. According to Borkovec, the  metal parts of the missiles will be scrapped following their  removal, and the Army will offer the chemical compounds to  select organizations for further evaluation or ecological  elimination.</p>

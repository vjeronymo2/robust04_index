			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Matsuka, academician and chairman, </F> Ukraine National Committee for the Fight Against AIDS, Kiev,  under the ``Your Health'' rubric: ``AIDS Spares No One''; first  paragraph is boldface DELOVOY MIR introduction]    [Text]  In September of last year, the National Committee for the  Fight Against AIDS was formed under Ukraine's president, and  this April in Riga Ukraine signed a document called the ``Riga  Initiative'' that is a program of actions and special measures  to limit the epidemic in Central and Eastern Europe in  1993-1996.    As of 1 April 1992, 311 cases of AIDS had been recorded in  Ukraine; 120 Ukraine citizens and 191 foreigners were infected.  From 1987 through 1992, the number of ill foreigners increased  steadily, and the number of ill fellow countrymen increased.    According to data from World Health Organization experts,  last year there were already 14 million carriers of the AIDS  virus and 1.5 million AIDS patient throughout the world.    In Asia, the pandemic is now proceeding at the same swift  pace as in Africa at the end of the 1970s: cases numbering in  the single digits were known 6 years ago, whereas now there are  already half a million. This is largely because of the naive  certainty that people there have immunity to AIDS. Similar  conversations have been heard regarding our people, whose  genotype has, they say, been hardened by life's abrupt changes.  Hoping this is naive to say the least. There is no Ukrainian  immunity against AIDS -- it is a misfortune of all humankind.  Quite to the contrary, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear  Power Plant and significant environmental pollution have made  Ukrainians more vulnerable to diseases, including AIDS.    The only reasonable way out is AIDS prevention.    A national AIDS prevention program has been developed and is  already being implemented in Ukraine. The Ministry of Health has  created a network of diagnostic laboratories where 5-6 million  persons come yearly for check-ups. Unfortunately, no test system  is produced in Ukraine. In the near future, the national  committee plans to create joint ventures for their production.  There is Ukraine's president's decision to create an AIDS  Institute. A special scientific program, i.e., a social order to  Ukraine scientists to develop drugs to treat AIDS or at least  alleviate its clinical course, must be developed. This means the  creation of drugs based on domestic processes and raw materials.    According to data from sociological studies, 6 percent of  physicians surveyed consider it necessary to isolate infected  persons, and 69 percent vindicate their families' refusal to  accept them. Many patients have no place to go after the  hospital. They cannot get a job. We asked the Ministry of Social  Welfare to organize special residences in Odessa and Kiev. The  problem must be solved by civilized methods. This was already  discussed, moreover, at the Riga meeting. It is not the AIDS  patient who should be fought but rather the disease, and without  forgetting human rights.    All of this creates a great deal of difficulty. It is bad  enough that we still do not have our own test system or enough  disposable syringes. There are no quality instruments for  transfusing blood or performing other medical manipulations. We  must purchase all this, including reagents, from abroad, and  until recently, they even levied large taxes on anti-AIDS  developments at the border, which is completely absurd.    For this, we need 13.8 million karbovantsy [the Ukrainian  name for rubles]; however, only 8.3 billion have yet to be  allocated from the budget. The national committee's board has  decided to continue priority financing of scientific  developments, propaganda, means and methods for protection  against infection, production and use of disposable instruments,  and purchase of diagnostica.    Of course, there is not enough money. Foreign exchange is  especially needed. I appeal to businesspersons and those who  understand the importance and severity of the problem and ask  for sponsor contributions. Our future and the future of our  children depends on this.

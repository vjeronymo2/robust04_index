			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: CIBC to quit Australia and cut back in Europe CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second biggest financial institution, is closing its operations in Australia and cutting back its presence in Europe. CIBC has had a presence in Australia since 1966, specialising in resource and infrastructure financing, gold hedging and treasury activities. The operation is understood however, to have been unprofitable for the past few years. CIBC said yesterday that the Australian subsidiary, which employs 85 people at offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, would be wound down or sold over the next three years. A capital markets division in Sydney was closed last year. In Europe, the bank will shut or sell operations in Frankfurt, Milan and Paris, which together employ 90 people. European customers will in future be served from CIBC's large office in London. CIBC continues to maintain private banking and trust administration businesses in Switzerland and Guernsey. All five leading Canadian banks have pulled in their horns overseas since the mid-1980s to concentrate on their North American business. Mr John Hunkin, president of CIBC's investment and corporate banking division, said the bank's business in Europe will in future focus on trade finance, Canadian dollar products and the energy, utilities, media and communications sectors. The bank also has a presence in securities markets.</p>

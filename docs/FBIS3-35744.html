			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kyrgyz </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Kyrgyz Government issued the following  resolution "On the stimulation of production and the sale of  agricultural produce in 1994".    The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic notes that despite a  number of measures which have been taken, a decline in the  production and sales of produce in the agrarian sector is  continuing. Correspondingly, the level of consumption of food  products by the population is also decreasing. The processing  industry produces less as well. Industrial enterprises are not  sufficiently provided with raw material.    According to preliminary data, in 1993 the gross output of  production in all categories of farms decreased compared with  1992 by 8 percent in comparable prices. Last year the sowing  area for cereals was enlarged by 64,000 hectares compared with  1992. Nevertheless, gross harvest figures, including corn, did  not exceed the 1992 level and equaled 1,693,000 [metric] tonnes.  The yield of cereals per hectare was 1.1 quintals less than  planned. As a result of reducing the sowing area under corn for  seed by 18,000 hectares, or 28 percent, and the decrease of its  yield by 6.2 quintals a hactare, the output of corn decreased by  93,000 tonnes, or by 43 percent. Similarly poor results were  obtained in 1993 in potato, vegetables, berry and fruit, and  grape growing. About 290,000 tonnes of potatoes were produced,  which is 20 percent less. Only 249,000 tonnes of vegetables were  harvested, which is 1.4 times less than in 1992.    Due to the decrease in yield and the slow rates of  harvesting  of some crops, certain loss of produce took place: 62,000 tonnes  of cereals were not received nor 10,500 tonnes of beetroot;  1,200 tonnes of sunflower; 41,000 tonnes of vegetables and  22,000 tonnes of potatoes. As before, the situation in  agriculture is complicated. The number of cattle in all  categories of farms decreased by 8 percent compared with 1992,  of sheep and goats by 12 percent; of hogs by 32 percent; of  horses by 3 percent. The production of meat in live weight  decreased by 2 percent, of milk by 2 percent; of wool by 9  percent.    As a result of the decrease in the production of  agricultural  produce and disadvantages of the finance and crediting policy in  the rural area, procuring organizations have decreased their  volumes of procurement and failed to deliver the right amount  for the needs of the state. In order to stimulate the  production and sale of agricultural produce, the Kyrgyz  Government resolves:    First, to set a minimum volume of the procurement of  agricultural produce by procurement organizations and processing  industries for the needs of the state and the level of  guaranteed procurement prices for these products, without value  added tax, in line with appendix M1;    Second, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Products of the  Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyzchleboprodukt republican production  amalgamation, the Kyrgyztamakash state concern should, in two  months, conclude agreements with producers in all forms of  ownership for the procurement of agricultural produce. Oblast  and rayon state administrations should urgently define the  optimum structure of sowing areas and numbers of cattle for 1994  and provide assistance to procurement organizations and  processing industries in concluding agreements for the  procurement of produce;    Third, to recommend that the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan and  joint stock and commercial banks should, in one month, provide  credit resources to procurement organizations and processing  enterprises in order for them to be able to advance money to  producers of agricultural goods in the amount of 25 percent of  the minimum volume of procurement.    Fourth, the Kyrgyzstan State Committee for Economy, the  Ministry of Agriculture of the Kyrgyz Republic, the  Kyrgyzchleboprodukt republican production amalgamation and the  Kyrgyztamakash state concern should introduce changes to levels  of guaranteed procurement prices for agricultural products  taking into account higher production costs proceeding from  objective conditions of supply and demand;    Fifth, to state that the agricultural produce excluded from  the minimum volume of procurement will be sold by the producers  by direct agreements for agreed prices, exports included,  without licenses and exempt from customs duties.    [Signed] Prime Minister Dzhumagulov</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Nowhere in Package Is Found Alternative </F> Proposal to the `No' to the U.S. Demand"]    [Text] The government has decided on a package of external  economic measures at a cabinet meeting. The government has  stressed that the package is aimed at reducing "fully and  significantly Japan's current account surplus in the medium  term" through macroeconomic measures and to achieve a "robust  and steady economic growth driven by domestic demand in the  medium term." The government, however, has said that from now  on, it would study concrete action programs and measures to  achieve those goals. The package has again proven the  government's work always focuses on quantity.    At the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, the Japanese side  said "no" to the U.S. demand for setting so-called numerical  targets, and it was the right answer to the demand. What is  important, however, is whether the Japanese Government has  prepared an alternative proposal to the "no" to the U.S. demand.    Looking at the package, it is regrettable that we have no  choice but to conclude that the Japanese Government has not yet  prepared such an alternative proposal.    There is a worrisome point in the "results-oriented trade  policy" adopted by the U.S. Government and the policy method  adopted by it to achieve the policy. Japan is now in a stage  where it must take seriously the "results-oriented trade policy."    Japan's external surplus is conspicuous and too huge. If  Japan's external surplus is left uncut, it may spread the trend  of protectionist trade and managed trade all around the world.  Japan's external imbalance is not confined to the bilateral  issue between Japan and the United States, but is becoming a  factor of instability in the world economic system. In other  words, Japan can no longer continue its external imbalance.  Hence, achieving good trade results has become a priority task  for Japan itself.    It is important for Japan to map out a package of concrete  measures to correct its external imbalance from this point of  view. If Japan maps out a package simply as a concessionary  response to external pressure, it may be the wrong policy,  causing a delay in the correction of Japan's external imbalance.    In the course of looking for a way to correct Japan's  external imbalance, the Japanese market will be disrupted, the  yen will appreciate further beyond Japan's industrial  capabilities, and Japanese enterprises will move more of their  production overseas. If Japan's economic and industrial  structures remain unchanged, this would hollow out Japan's  economy.    What the government must do when it announces specific  policies is to have an awareness of those issues and shape a  reasonable strategy on the basis of its awareness.    What is important is the compatibility of Japanese and U.S.  macroeconomic policies. As the United States has recognized for  a long time, the current account imbalance between the two  countries has come from macroeconomic factors.    A reversal in the growth rate between Japan and the United  States will impede the correction of the imbalance for the time  being. The lack of savings in the United States is a serious  issue. U.S. measures to reduce the federal budget deficit are  certainly generating the desired effect, and the ratio of the  federal budget deficit to the GNP has begun to fall.    Nonetheless, the savings rate in the U.S. private sector has  continued to drop. It would be meaningless if financial revenue  and expenditure are not assessed in relation to domestic savings.    No individual microeconomic measure is found in the package.  What we can find in connection with microeconomic measures is  the expression "attempts will be made to further improve" and  "plans will be drawn up." As for deregulation, the government  has left it to a report to be compiled by the Administrative  Reform Promotion Headquarters in late June. No alternative  proposal is found anywhere in the package to "no" to the U.S.  demand.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 1 May (INA)--In their editorials today, the  Iraqi papers stress that Christopher's article in THE NEW YORK  TIMES is nothing more than a reiteration of the same conniving  U.S. stands aimed at fabricating pretexts and justifications to  prolong the blockade and harm the leadership and people of Iraq.    The paper says that the lies included in Christopher's  article are fabrications that will not stand up before the facts  and that they are an obvious misrepresentation of reality and a  sign of weakness, for a strong stand does not need lies to  support it.    The papers add that Christopher's article is a nervous  response to Iraq's diplomatic moves and the international  changes acknowledging and praising Iraq's cooperation and  calling for taking the required steps to remove the blockade  after the disappearance of its justifications.    Under the headline "Iraq's steadfastness and Christopher's  Allegations," AL-QADISIYAH says that thanks to its patience,  jihad, balanced political stand, and the wisdom of its  historical leadership, Iraq has destroyed the chapters of  conspiracy against it. Despite their unfairness, Iraq has  fulfilled its obligations fully toward relevant UN Security  Council resolutions. This has been acknowledged by the fair UN  Security Council member states and the special commissions that  have dealt with those resolutions.    The paper explains that Christopher's stand reflects the  reality of the tendentious and unjustified U.S. stand against  Iraq, thus increasing U.S. isolation and showing that the United  States is the sole power antagonizing Iraq and seeking to  perpetuate the blockade against it. This is contrary to the  will of the majority of permanent UN Security Council member  states, other member states, and the rest of the world states  that sympathize with Iraq's suffering and view positively its  honoring of its obligations in accordance with UN Security  Council resolutions.    Under the headline "Christopher Is Swimming Against the  Current," AL-JUMHURIYAH says that Christopher has fallen into a  glaring contradiction when, claiming to be speaking on behalf of  the international community, he said that he opposes Iraq's  efforts to have the blockade lifted. He said, however, that he  sees that the unity of the Security Council has begun to  disintegrate and that the majority of the international  community are now in favor of lifting the blockade. He also  said that a minority--specifically the United States and  Britain--still want the blockade to continue.    The paper adds that some may think that like his president,  Christopher may have little information about the suffering of  the Iraqi people. But in his article, Christopher shows  complete awareness and acknowledges the Iraqi people's  suffering. Yet, he called for maintaining the blockade against  Iraq, turning a blind eye to that fact and deliberately seeking  to prolong that suffering. The paper asks: Can any double  standard be clearer than this?    Under the headline "Exposed Fabrications in Warren  Christopher's Article," AL-THAWRAH says: Warren Christopher's  article reflects the embarrassing situation the U.S.  Administration, led by Clinton, has put itself in as a result of  its continued unjustified confrontation with Iraq and its  desperate attempts to continue to harm Iraq by calling for  tightening the blockade and extending it at every review session.    The paper adds that the U.S. secretary of state's article  was  a direct reply to the voices, which are growing louder even  inside the United States, saying that the U.S. attitude not only  conflicts with the changing international position but also with  the interests of United States itself, especially after French,  Italian, German, and Japanese companies have opened negotiations  with Iraq to protect their interests.    The paper says Christopher's accusation that Iraq tried to  assassinate criminal George Bush during his visit to Kuwait has  been refuted by the trial of those accused of the attempt. The  statements made by the defendants and the fact that the sessions  have been adjourned several times to reach a verdict prove that  the story is nothing more than a fabricated and exposed attempt  aimed at maintaining a tense situation and pressing for  continuing the blockade imposed on Iraq.    On Christopher's claims about the so-called displacement  operations of Arabs in the marshlands, the paper says: The  report prepared by a special UN committee -- formed to look into  chemical use allegations propagated by Western quarters and  Iranian authorities -- has conclusively refuted these  allegations after examining all aspects of this affair. The  committee would not have missed the slightest indication of such  operations, especially since it hoped, along with those who sent  it, to find even a shred of evidence to facilitate condemning  Iraq.    On Christopher's allusion that Iraq is still holding Kuwaiti  prisoners, the paper says Iraq is willing to cooperate with any  party to ascertain the truth of the information sent by Iraq to  the Arab League through its envoys who visited Iraq and saw with  their own eyes that there are no Kuwaitis detained in Iraq. The  latest Iraqi initiative in this regard was the invitation  extended by the Iraqi National Assembly speaker to a Kuwaiti  parliamentary delegation to visit Iraq and see that Iraq is not  holding any Kuwaiti prisoners, but Kuwait has rejected the offer.    On Christopher's accusation that Iraq continues to produce  weapons of mass destruction, AL-THAWRAH says: The statements of  Rolf Ekeus are still fresh. Ekeus said two days ago, after  meeting with Iraqi officials, that Iraq is cooperating with the  Special Commission and that both sides are working together to  shorten the trial period of the monitoring regime. Also, all  reports by the UN committee supervising the destruction of  Iraq's weapons of mass destruction show, in documents and  figures, Iraq's full response to its demands to facilitate its  mission.    On Christopher's talk about our beloved north and his  accusation that Iraq is assassinating relief workers and UN  observers, the paper wonders: Has Christopher forgotten that  the region he is talking about is currently outside the control  of the central authority and that the forces of his country and  the allied states are supervising the region and claim to be  providing security and peace for it?    AL-THAWRAH concludes: Christopher's article amounts to  nothing more than a repeat of conniving U.S. positions that seek  to create excuses and pretexts to maintain the blockade and  target the people and leadership of Iraq, who have proven,  through their remarkable steadfastness, that it is possible to  defeat the schemes of the enemies. The enemies did not imagine  Iraq would return a giant, as it was, having dealt it a blow  with all of the weapons of mass destruction in their arsenal.</p>

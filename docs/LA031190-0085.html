			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERINTENDENT HUNT NARROWS  </P> <P> The Pasadena Unified School District board moved closer to picking a new  district superintendent Thursday when it whittled down its list of internal  applicants from four to one, board President Anne Pursel said.  </P> <P> Pursel declined to name the remaining candidate, saying the board wants to have  further discussions with the candidate before making any contract decision.  </P> <P> But at least one board member has said Joseph Linscomb, Pasadena's deputy  superintendent for instruction who is serving as acting superintendent, is a  likely candidate for the job.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the board is expected to decide whether to make the candidate an  offer or expand its search to a state or national level.  </P> <P> Board member Elbie Hickambottom, who has criticized the board's decision to  look at internal candidates first, said at Thursday's meeting that he still  favors expanding the search to a state or national level, Pursel said.  </P> <P> The district is seeking a replacement for Phillip Jordan, who retired from the  $91,000-a-year post last year.  </P> <P> In January, Pasadena Unified also lost one of its two assistant  superintendents. Robert Sampieri left to take the No. 2 job in the Chicago  Unified School District.  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Top Treasury official quits for First Boston MR David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, is to join the CS First Boston group next week, the US Treasury announced yesterday. Mr Mulford, the longest-serving senior US Treasury official responsible for international economic policy since the second world war, is one of the first members of the Republican administration to announce his departure following Democratic Governor Bill Clinton's victory in the presidential election. His move, to become vice-chairman of First Boston in New York and deputy chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston in London, represents a return to the world of investment banking for Mr Mulford, 55, after 8 1/2 years at the US Treasury. He will be a member of First Boston's operating committee in New York with special responsibility for Latin America. Mr Mulford was closely involved with the region during his time at the US Treasury, helping to develop and implement the Baker and Brady plans for easing the Latin American debt crisis and playing a large role in producing President George Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative. He served at the Treasury first as assistant secretary for international affairs and from May 1989 as under-secretary. His departure comes as no surprise - he is known to have been considering various job offers for several months. Since entering the Treasury in March 1984 he has been the Group of Seven deputy responsible for co-ordinating economic policies with other members of the bloc of leading industrial nations. He helped develop the 1985 Plaza Accord to curb the dollar's strength and since 1986 has been the one of the US team preparing the annual world economic summit as 'financial sherpa'. He chaired negotiations with Japan to open and liberalise Japanese capital markets and has played a prominent role for the US in international discussions on assistance for Russia. As a tough and sometimes brutal negotiator, Mr Mulford has earned respect rather than affection in his dealings with officials from other countries. The policies he has espoused have sometimes been controversial. Some economists criticised the Brady initiative for having deterred banks from lending new money to the debtor nations. Mr Mulford believes the Brady initiative was one of the great successes of US economic diplomacy in the late 1980s and played an essential part in bringing Latin American nations back into the mainstream of the world economy. Mr Mulford and Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary after whom the plan was named, were quicker than European policy makers to warn that the world economy was slowing down at the end of the 1980s. Mr Mulford has always pursued an international career. He spent 20 years in international investment banking before moving to the Treasury. After leaving the Treasury he will keep in touch with public affairs through the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, where he will be a special adviser.</p>

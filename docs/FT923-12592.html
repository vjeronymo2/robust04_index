			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: The Last Carnival WHILE Derek Walcott's 1992 version of The Odyssey continues at The Other Place (RSC, Stratford-upon-Avon), his 1970 play, The Last Carnival opens at The Birmingham Rep. Vintage 1992 Walcott is far and away the better, although the 1970 is still robust theatre. Walcott sets The Last Carnival (part of a post-colonial Caribbean trilogy) in Trinidad: an inland estate and the wharf at Port of Spain. In 1947, Aggie, a firebrand radical cockney governess arrives to instruct the children of a French Creole planter. She sets about changing the plantation way of life, moving confidently between native Trinidadians, European settlers and the British administration. But looking back on post-colonial Trinidad from 1970, eight years after independence, Aggie - now Agatha - becomes implicated in the island's complexities of race, culture, language and politics. Her original employer and sometime lover is now dead, and a Black Power coup overshadows Carnival this year. She has become more conservative. Walcott's attention runs everywhere, and the play has no centre. The tensions arise from the possibilities inherent in Trinidad itself, a Spanish dominion with French settlers seized by the British in 1797. As one character says: 'All th' races of th' world here, an' if dey ain't get on here, dey ain't goin' get on anywhere.' Walcott allows the play's issues to dissolve back into the environment: national identity and cultural history are white burgundy at a cricket match under a Caribbean sun. Political change is seen as impossible, British rule continues in Trinidadian form. Agatha the radical ends up crying, 'Why can't you people do anything for yourselves?' John Adams, in his final production at The Rep, directs with tact. The narrative-flashback form means that each scene becomes predictable, and the play builds slowly. Its strengths are not its plot or characters but its setting. The versatile design, by Roger Butlin, incorporates a French past in one of Watteau's Embarkation to Cythera paintings and a soundtrack from Cantaloube's Auvergne folk settings. There are steel bands and cicadas, but not enough sweat, dirt or energy to make the carnival season convincing. The actors move between creole, English, French and Trinidadian patois, a cool collation of accents. Jill Brassington and Catherine Russell as Agatha then and now hold the centre of the play, while Peter Woodward and Michael Bertenshaw (the creole planters) orbit around them. Lorna Laidlaw as the maid become minister of housing is a treat. The key to the play is a poetic moment, a tribute to Caribbean time. When Aggie arrives, her host takes her watch - she will not be needing it - and swings it over the water: 'she knew she had all the time in the world.' Birmingham Rep (021) 236 4455, to August 1</p>

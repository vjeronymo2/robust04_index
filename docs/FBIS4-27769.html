			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA June 4 -- Fishery in the territorial  waters of the Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelago offshore Vietnam  has constantly brought back great profits to local fishermen in  the island district of Phu Quy, Binh Thuan Province.    In 1993, some 94 vessels of fishermen in Phu Quy Island were  engaged in deep-sea fisheries, netting nearly 436 tonnes of  fishes. In the first months of this year, more than 150 vessels  with 1,200 men fished in Truong Sa. On an average in each  fishing trip, they caught two tonnes of fish, earning 3-5  million dong, and even more than 9 million dong on one or two  occasions.    To create favourable conditions for fisheries in Truong Sa,  the government has applied tax exemption for exploitation and  export of sea products in the territorial waters of the  archipelago. The authorities of Binh Thuan Province have also  promulgated a policy on tax exemption for building deep-sea  trawlers.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Braddock takes over as chief of drugs group MR Richard Braddock, who resigned two months ago as president of Citicorp, the biggest US bank, has accepted a job as chief executive of Medco Containment Services, a New Jersey-based business that manages prescription drug programmes. The 51-year-old Mr Braddock will take over in mid-January. Medco is the leading US manager of prescription drug delivery benefits to corporate employers and insurance firms. Unlike Citicorp, which has Dollars 219bn of assets, Medco is a small, but fast-growing company that was founded in 1983 and reported Dollars 102m of net profits on Dollars 1.8bn of revenues in its financial year to last June 30. Medco, which employs 6,000 people, is quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. Mr Braddock's appointment took Wall Street by surprise because he is moving from such a high-profile position as president of the largest US bank. Although the bank has never commented on rumours, many banking analysts believe Mr Braddock, who began his career in consumer goods marketing at General Foods, was pushed out by Mr John Reed, the chairman of Citicorp. There has been speculation that Mr Braddock might be a suitable candidate to replace Mr James Robinson, who last weekend announced his plans to resign as chief executive of American Express, the financial services and travel group. Medco said Mr Braddock's salary would be about Dollars 741,000 a year. He would receive an attractive stock options package for 1.25m shares of Medco. The healthcare company's share price rose by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 37 3/4 in early trading yesterday. Mr Braddock said he decided to accept the offer at Medco because 'I set out to run a company that was consumer-oriented and with upside potential'.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN BRIGHT, 81; SCREENWRITER  </P> <P> John M. Bright, a one-time Chicago newspaper reporter who helped through such  films as "The Public Enemy" in 1931 establish the gangster film as a powerful  motion picture theme, has died in a Panorama City hospital.  </P> <P> He was 81 and lived in West Hollywood. He had suffered a stroke and died Sept.  14.  </P> <P> With Kubec Glasmon, another former journalist, Bright wrote a series of stories  that became films, beginning with "The Public Enemy" with James Cagney and Mae  Clarke. The film made a star of Cagney, and the scene in which he smashes a  grapefruit into Miss Clarke's face has become one of the more fabled moments in  American cinema.  </P> <P> One of the 10 founders of the Screen Writers Guild in 1933, Bright had screen  credits for "The Brave Bulls," "The Kid From Cleveland," "I Walk Alone,"  "Close-Up" and several more when he became entangled in the House Committee on  Un-American Activities' investigation of communist influence in the film  industry.  </P> <P> Rather than subject himself to the scrutiny, he moved to Mexico, returning  several years later to write magazine articles and plays. His leaving the  country resulted in his blacklisting.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Mildred, and two sons.  </P> <P> A memorial has been scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Writers Guild, 8955  Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles.  </P></p>

The morning daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' quoted Ayatollah  Sane'i  as saying that five years after the death verdict was issued  against the Indian-born British author, the world Muslims now  fully realised the matter.    The desperate attempts of Rushdie and his western backers  too  have only failed to lift the verdict and have only added to  Muslims' wrath. 'Today the situation is appropriate more than  any other time for the execution of Salman Rushdie,' the  ayatollah stressed.    Ayatollah Sane'i underlined that the Islamic countries  solidarity as well as the Organization of Islamic Conference's  (OIC) renewed support for the verdict against Rushdie as factors  paving the way to carry out the death decree.    According to western media, the ayatollah said, Rushdie was  gradually dying and even the police protection failed to improve  his morale. 'It is the fate of anyone who insults Prophet  Muhammad (PBUH) and over one billion Muslims' sanctities.'    Referring to formation of some European committees to  support  the apostate writer, the ayatollah said their act too was an  insult to the sanctities of Muslims.</p>

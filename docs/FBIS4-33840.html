			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo de Leon, Institutional </F> Revolutionary Party presidential candidate, by Jacobo  Zabludovsky in Mexico City; on the "24 Hours" program -- live]    [Excerpt] [Zabludovsky] Two days ago, on Monday, Ernesto  Zedillo presented his program for economic reactivation and  steady growth. For this reason, we invited him to the "24  Hours" studies tonight. Mr. Zedillo, good evening and thanks  for being here.    [Zedillo] Good evening and thank you, Mr. Jacobo and kind  listeners.    [Zabludovsky] I would like to talk about your economic  program. I would like you to tell us how this program, which has  already been so profusely covered by the media, benefits the man  on the street, the common Mexican citizen?    [Zedillo] Jacobo, this program has been designed to create  more jobs in our country. During my campaign tours, I have  discovered that one of Mexico's most serious problems is the  lack of opportunities for work. The only way to correct this  situation is by making our economy grow again. There will be no  additional jobs if no more businesses are created or if those  that exist are not expanded. This is why my program is designed  basically to stimulate investment and, through investment,  growth and opportunities for work and higher salaries for all  Mexicans.    [Zabludovsky] You have said the positions of other  candidates  are probably prompted by demagoguery, particularly regarding  spending more in some areas. Why?    [Zedillo] Because I believe that one of the essential  requirements for the country to develop in the future is to  maintain a certain financial discipline to avoid the same  situations of the past. Some candidates have proposed to spend  more and more without paying sufficient attention to the  country's financial problems. I propose to consolidate what was  done in the past few years and, beginning from there, enter into  a new state of the country's development where stimulus for  growth receives the main emphasis. Our idea is for the  government to actively promote economic growth and the creation  of jobs that so many millions of Mexicans require. This should  be done through rational instruments and without returning to  past policies    [Zabludovsky] So what would be the main differences between  what you propose and what the other candidates, in particular  the National Action Party and Party of the Democratic Revolution  candidates, have proposed?    [Zedillo] They have discussed problems and expressed good  intentions but so far they have not presented any specific  strategy to deal with the country's economic problem. I think  the difference is very clear. I have a proposal for economic  growth, the creation of jobs, investment, better salaries. This  is the proposal I presented on Monday. The people are still  waiting for the other candidates to present sound proposals.  Certain adjectives have been used. One of the candidates  speaks of a humane economy, but he failed to say how he will  achieve this. The other candidate mixes very old recipes and  some updated ideas, of which he has gradually become convinced.  From my viewpoint, they have no proposals. Of course, it is  the people who will have to assess this.    [Zabludovsky] Do you think the proposals have been  sufficiently understood by the would-be voters?    [Zedillo] I am not sure the candidates still endorse their  proposals. The problems have been pointed out at length, but  there has not been much in terms of proposals. In this  campaign, I have tried to present proposals, telling the people  how I propose to solve problems. In this campaign, I have tried  to listen to the people's problems. It is my duty to listen to  those problems, but also to offer solutions.    [Zabludovsky] Some aspects of your speech were discussions  of  the economy, training, and health. What is the relationship  between these aspects?    [Zedillo] Jacobo, economic growth depends on how much  capital  we invest. Not only physical capital, as manufacturing plants,  roads, or dams, but human capital as well. Human capital is  perhaps the most important factor in a country's development.  How much we invest in men and women to make them more capable,  educated, productive, and more willing to work and produce for  the economy's sake, is what counts.    [Zabludovsky] Mexican citizens sometimes think proposals  exceed reality. How will your program make the family budget  sufficient?    [Zedillo] My program includes very specific aspects to  promote investment. The program identifies the obstacles that  at present prevent greater investment in our country. Through  these stimuli for investment, new enterprises will be  established and those already existing will be expanded. This  will create more jobs. My proposal regarding education,  training, and technology will increase productivity. With more  jobs, greater economic activity, and greater productivity,  salaries will increase.    Wages and employment are two important factors that  determine family well-being. This is why we are talking about  shifting from a good macroeconomy, which must be consolidated,  respected, and sustained, to a good microeconomy, which consists  of suitable family incomes and large production output.    [Zabludovsky] You included fiscal policies in your 10-point  plan. We have heard medium- and large-scale businessmen  complaining that there are too many taxes. We have also heard  small-scale businessmen complaining that there is so much red  tape they would rather pay fines than stand in long lines.    [Zedillo] I believe they are right. Jacobo, we are proposing  a number of tangible measures. First, we are suggesting larger  judicial security for taxpayers and a substantial reduction of  tax procedures, as well as tax reductions. For instance, we are  planning to reduce the 2-percent tax on assets as well as a  number of benefits to promote investments. According to my  plan, new businesses and investors are granted a four-year grace  period to pay this tax. In addition, those businesses that are  reporting losses, but reported profits in at least one of the  three previous years will not pay this tax. As for small- and  medium-scale businesses, I am proposing to expand the number of  businesses that pay this tax quarterly instead of paying it 13  times a year. This is a very good benefit, because it saves  tax-filing time and gives liquidity to those businesses that are  currently making monthly payments. Should this proposal be  approved, they will pay the 2-percent tax on assets quarterly.    Furthermore, we are also recommending a mechanism to  directly  promote investments through a more generous investment  amortization system and a number of fiscal incentives for  training, technology, and purchasing antipollutant equipment.  These are some of the many measures we are proposing to  directly benefit businesses to ensure they will be motivated to  invest more.    [Zabludovsky] Mr. Zedillo, in the last five years we went  from an almost 200-percent inflation rate to a 8- or 9-percent  inflation rate; I am not sure. This policy had a social cost.  I am wondering if you are planning to have single-digit  inflation rates. Is it worth it?    [Zedillo] It is worth it and necessary if we want to achieve  sustainable economic growth in the future. The effort that had  to be made was already made; we now must consolidate this  effort. This effort is letting us reach a growing economic  stage, which we could not reach in the last few years, because  we failed to see the country's reality for many years. Thanks  to this effort, which consisted not only of controlling  inflation but also of changing the economic structure of the  country with a broader opening and other measures, we currently  have the opportunity to begin growing. I am suggesting that the  economy must grow at least 4 percent by 1995, following two  years of virtual stagnation in 1993 and 1994.    [Zabludovsky] Let us talk about other issues. Since we have  you here, let us seize this opportunity to ask you other  questions. How do you feel about your campaign? What experience  have you gained since you were nominated presidential candidate  for the Institutional Revolutionary Party?    [Zedillo] Thanks to my being in constant contact with the  people, I have found two basic concerns: people are concerned  because they want to improve their personal and family situation  and because they want to put and end to unemployment,  insecurity, and poverty. In short, people are concerned because  they want to live in better conditions and in a better country.  On the other hand, I can see there is hope. People believe we  are about to overcome our problems, the country is capable of  solving them, and the difficult times we are currently living  are temporary. We are close to reach a different and better  stage for all Mexicans to begin thriving.    [Zabludovsky] In light of certain criticisms, do you believe  the upcoming elections will be honest, fair, and free of doubts?    [Zedillo] Jacobo, all political parties have been working  hard to improve our electoral system. The latest reform  concluded last week, and we currently have an electoral system  that has nothing to do with the electoral system of six years  ago, or even three years ago. We now have an electoral  organization whose board of directors is made up mostly of  independent citizens. We have a large number of citizens at all  electoral bodies.    Almost 2 million Mexicans will participate in the  organization of the upcoming elections. Only a small number of  them will represent my party; the rest will be representatives  of other parties and citizens selected through a double-election  process. I believe we have an exemplary electoral system that  citizens must trust. I am sure the upcoming elections will be  exemplarily legal, honest, and reliable. The country deserves  and demands it, and this is the way it should be. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Property: Good escudo to buy now. . . CURRENCY upheavals in other countries sometimes present attractive opportunities for holiday home buyers. But it is not often that a purchaser can take advantage of this type of situation in his own country. Sharp-witted Portuguese were not slow to spot a benefit to themselves on their home ground in the recent gyrations of exchange rates. British developer Bovis Abroad, building in Portugal's Algarve, had been working out its costings and quoting its new property prices in sterling. When the exchange rate dropped from a peak of about 247 escudos to the pound to about 214 escudos, the Portuguese began taking a lot more interest in these properties themselves. Bovis has now switched to quoting its Algarve prices in escudos. (Quoting in sterling had been an anomaly, said Bovis. The two Algarve developments concerned had been financed in sterling. For a time, the exchange rate for sterling buyers would be pegged at 250 escudos and would then revert to current rates.) Currently on Bovis' Sao Lourenco estate, prices range from about Pounds 100,000 for a studio to Pounds 205,000 for a three-bedroom villa. At Lakeside village - also an Algarve golf course development - the range is from Pounds 115,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to Pounds 280,000 for a four-bedroom villa. While sales are slow, as almost everywhere, Bovis says German interest is picking up, with a number of enquiries are also coming from Hong Kong.</p>

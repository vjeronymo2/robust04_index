			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / BNFL to reduce its workforce by 750 BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is to cut 750 jobs at its head office and design centre at Risley, near Warrington, Cheshire, the company said yesterday. The cuts, which affect engineering and design staff, are due to the rundown of construction at BNFL's Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant in Cumbria. BNFL has been spending Pounds 1.5m a day on construction work at Sellafield, mainly on the development of the Pounds 1.85bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) which will come into operation later this year. BNFL said the job losses, which would reduce its engineering division from 1,750 to 1,000 by the mid-1990s, were necessary for it to become more competitive. The division is being restructured to focus on core technical and engineering skills, including project management, with greater use of external contractors for other work. Mr Peter Roberts, BNFL group director of engineering, said: 'The restructuring will allow us to cope with the peaks and troughs of business demands.' BNFL said it was seeking business internationally on engineering projects. The company said the cuts would be achieved through natural wastage, non-renewal of fixed-term contracts and voluntary severance. In addition, an unspecified number of contract agency staff would be phased out. The company said many of those affected were nearing retirement age, and that it was too soon to speculate about compulsory redundancies. Mr Dai Hudd, national officer of the IPMS white-collar union, said: 'We are bitterly disappointed that the company should need to cut so many jobs. It is not a company with its back to the wall.' The rundown of Sellafield construction will also result in about 5,000 job losses by spring 1993.</p>

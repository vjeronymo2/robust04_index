			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong At almost 6100 the Hang Seng Index is already beyond earlier expectations for the year end, which ought to be reassuring for the bears. The problem is a surfeit of good news, not least confirmation yesterday that a group of Chinese investors is paying HKDollars 3.8bn for a slice of central Hong Kong real estate. This is a hefty price, valuing each square foot of office space at a 50 per cent premium to what was previously thought achieveable, and implying a HK Land net asset value of HKDollars 20 per share. More to the point, if friends of the colony's future governing power are prepared to pay top prices at this stage, is it not fair to assume that the People's Republic will hardly seek to damage the investment come 1997? It is that very perception, of course, which has encouraged a huge flow of international money into Hong Kong this year. Any narrowing of the China discount, however, obviously leaves the market vulnerable to shock. On a different scale, yesterday's move by Mr Li Ka-Shing's Hutchison Whampoa to buy out the Cavendish minority should also be positive. The HKDollars 5.50 per share offer is not exactly a knock-out blow, but the hope is that the transaction presages an overdue streamlining of some of Mr Li's operations. Both Hutchison and Mr Li's top company Cheung Kong have substantially underperformed the market over the last 12 months. The latter's rating has suffered from a series of diversifications away from property. By taking Cavendish private Hutchison is in a better position to dispose of its ill-fated investment in Husky Oil, though a more urgent priority might be to reduce gearing by selling the 34 per cent stake in Hong Kong Electric.</p>

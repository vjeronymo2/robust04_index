			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for timber remains in doldrums ECONOMIC recession and the depressed construction market in many European countries continue to dampen demand for timber and little recovery is seen over the coming year, according to a report from the timber committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. However, the North American market, fuelled by a revival in new housebuilding, is expected to show healthy growth this year and next. European consumption of sawn softwood, which fell sharply in 1991, is expected to fall by a further 4.8 per cent in 1992 to 69.1m cubic metres, and then to stabilise in 1993 at about 69.5m cu m. However, production is projected to rise by 0.8 per cent to 67m cu m in 1992 and by another 1.7 per cent next year. Despite a decline in imports and some rise in exports, weak demand has led to oversupply in many European sawn softwood markets, leading to fierce competition, low profitability and sawmill closures, the ECE says. This is likely to continue in the near term despite a steady fall in Russian exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the ECE is predicting a 5.9 per cent rise in North American sawn softwood demand to 122.4m cu m in 1992 and a 3.1 per cent rise in 1993. It also takes a more cheerful view of long-term European prospects, pointing to the strong latent demand for sawn softwood in eastern and central Europe, where there is a need to increase and improve the housing stock. Developments in the markets for softwood logs in Europe are still marked by the consequences of the 1990 storm, which felled over 100m cu m, according to the report. It forecasts a slow rise in production in 1992 and 1993, while trade is expected to drop back to pre-storm levels. Nevertheless, the ECE says, large stocks of water-stored logs will continue to weigh on the market. Sawn hardwood consumption and production in Europe may decline slightly in 1992 to 18.4m and 14.5m cu m respectively, with little change in 1993. The ECE notes that European imports of tropical hardwoods have fallen significantly since 1989, in part reflecting campaigns by environmental groups to save tropical forests. In North America, consumption and production of sawn hardwood are expected to increase by 5.5 to 5.7 per cent this year to 24.8m and 26.5m cu m respectively.</p>

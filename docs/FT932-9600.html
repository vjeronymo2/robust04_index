			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown rules out pact with Labour MR PADDY ASHDOWN, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday stepped up the pressure on Labour leaders to accept that their party has little prospect of winning the next general election on its own. He again ruled out any formal pact with Labour, and left open the door for co-operation with the Conservative party should a continuing decline in its electoral fortunes open the way for a broad-based coalition. Highlighting the key lesson of the outstanding success achieved by the Liberal Democrats when Mr David Rendel captured Newbury from the Conservatives in last week's by-election, he said the results showed that 'we reach the votes that the Labour party cannot reach'. Responding to questions at a Parliamentary press gallery lunch, he refused say whether his party would be more likely to support a government led by Mr John Major for the Conservatives or by Mr John Smith for Labour. He said that without knowing the political climate before the next general election it was impossible to make that kind of prediction. Mr Ashdown warned the Liberal Democrats against 'triumphalism' in the wake of the successes achieved at Newbury and in the county council elections. He called on the 'modernisers' in the Labour party to gain the upper hand by ending its domination by the trade unions through the introduction of one member, one vote, and securing support for ending the first-past-the-post electoral system. He suggested that the need for co-operation between the parties at local level in councils where no single party had a majority could set a pattern leading to 'partnership in power' nationally. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, had a foretaste yesterday of the scale of opposition within his party to electoral reform. At a private Parliamentary Labour party meeting, MPs were divided over the conclusions of Labour's internal inquiry into electoral reform under Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University. Mr Smith is expected to say next Wednesday that Labour must back the principle of change - but will try to unite his party around a pledge that reforms will depend on winning approval in a national referendum.</p>

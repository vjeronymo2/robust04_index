			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Management: A bashing from Metall - Germany's two-tier board system has been exposed by the latest corporate debacle The Metallgesellschaft fiasco has put the spotlight on Germany's traditional two-tier corporate board structure as never before. Criticisms of the system are far from new, but they have been dramatically reinforced by the scale and unexpectedness of the losses at the country's 14th largest industrial group. As Metallgesellschaft's 120 or so bankers yesterday deliberated whether to bail out the deeply troubled metals, mining and industrial group with a DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) refinancing package, the wider questions go beyond the immediate cause of the debacle - the massive losses run up by MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary. These were incurred through speculative trading on US commodities futures markets. The broader issue is how this could have happened given the quality of the company's shareholders and the calibre of management on Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board. Nearly 60 per cent of MG's shares are owned by the most reputable names in German finance and in-dustry: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, the Allianz insurance group and Daimler-Benz, coupled with the illustrious outsider, the Emirate of Kuwait. As is traditional in Germany, these large shareholders are represented on the group's supervisory board - the 'aufsichtsrat', whose legal duty under the two-tier system is to oversee the performance of the management board (the 'vorstand'). This two-tier board system has been looked at enviously by those in the UK and the US concerned with the reform of what is broadly known as corporate governance - the relations between executive management and the external shareholders and other 'stakeholders' in a corporation, such as employees. The role of external parties such as auditors and professional advisers has also come under scrutiny. The supervisory board, comprising representatives of capital and labour in equal measure - with the chairman exercising a casting vote - is responsible for appointing executive managers, voting on major capital expenditure projects and broader strategic issues. The management board is responsible for day-to-day management. In recent years the system has faced torrents of criticism from outsiders such as Ekkehard Wenger, a maverick professor of business studies, and Gunter Ogger, who wrote a best-selling book called Nieten in Nadelstreifen (nitwits in pinstripes). They condemned the cosy relations between management and supervisory boards, asking 'who supervises the supervisors?'. Formally subject to the control of shareholders, the twin boards had become accountable only to themselves, the critics argued. This was buttressed by the fact that German managers, with one or two exceptions, have never faced the threat of losing their jobs as a result of hostile takeovers. Until now, the criticism was not taken seriously by senior managers, but the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, and the speed with which the problems materialised, have challenged this complacency in a way that earlier corporate disasters did not. The lesson is especially acute because of the high calibre of the managers on Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board. Since March 1993 the chairman of the supervisory board has been Ronaldo Schmitz, head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank and a former finance director of the BASF chemicals group. His fellow board members include Gerhard Liener, finance director of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of the Allianz colossus, and Bernhard Walter from the board of Dresdner Bank - not to mention distinguished outsiders such as Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive of the RWE energy conglomerate, and Peter Schuhmacher, chief executive of Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials. There are also representatives from IG Metall and IG Chemie, respectively Germany's first and third largest unions. The quality of these managers is second to none - yet they failed spectacularly to oversee the affairs of Metallgesellschaft, a complex group with 258 subsidiaries generating DM27bn of turnover from many business areas. Part of the blame must lie with Schmitz, a cold-blooded finance expert with in-depth knowledge of many MG core activities. He was appointed because he was deemed the right man to curb the management style of the then chief executive, Heinz Schimmelbusch, an Austrian with a penchant for elaborate and risky diversification strategies. Schmitz will not talk at present about his relations with Schimmelbusch and the role of the supervisory board, but press reports suggest Schmitz exercised massive pressure to force Schimmelbusch to sell off loss-making businesses (notably the Schiess machine-tools company) and to begin a belated process of rationalisation. Only after Schimmelbusch came into line was his contract as chief executive renewed for five years by the supervisory board in November. Wolfgang Schultze, deputy chairman of IG Chemie who joined the MG supervisory board in the spring of 1993, told the FT that at the meeting before Schimmelbusch was confirmed in office he did not mention difficulties in the oil-trading area. The official Deutsche Bank line is that Schmitz acted with commendable speed once the magnitude of the problems at MG Corp became clear, and he was entitled to rely on statements from Schimmelbusch which later proved misleading. It was only on December 3 that Schimmelbusch walked the 200m from his headquarters on Reuterweg to Deutsche's twin towers in the heart of Frankfurt's financial district to tell Schmitz of the problems at MG Corp. A fortnight later, Schimmelbusch was ousted, with his boardroom colleagues. Although the severity of Schmitz's response was unprecedented, the fact remains that the supervisory board failed to identify the lack of controls at MG Corp as a major risk. The blame for this cannot be apportioned to Schmitz alone or indeed to his boardroom colleagues - it highlights a broader 'system failure'. Many German managers now believe that the commercial ties of Deutsche, Dresdner, Daimler and Allianz to MG made it less easy for them to be critical of Schimmelbusch's autocratic style. And privately, they point out that for years the big bank shareholders backed Schimmelbusch's DM8bn expansion spree, exacerbating the control problems caused by MG's very diversity and encouraging it to take on more debt. Just how close relations between Deutsche Bank and MG were is illustrated by the fact that it was none other than Schmitz, wearing his corporate finance hat, who advised on Metallgesellschaft's biggest acquisition - the DM1.5bn purchase of the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle Nobel in early 1992. German managers' almost paranoid concern for secrecy means it is unlikely that many details will emerge. But as they trickle out it will become clear that the image of the German two-tier board system is one of the main casualties of the Metallgesellschaft affair.</p>

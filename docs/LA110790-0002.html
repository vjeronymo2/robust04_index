			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILLING BIRDS  </P> <P> It is my opinion the government's actions in killing birds and other wildlife  in a so-called effort to strengthen its case against Exxon is criminal,  despicable and indefensible. Exxon's disaster apparently stemmed from  negligence, while the government's actions were undoubtedly premeditated with  malice aforethought. Let's forget about Exxon and prosecute the government.  </P> <P> DONALD B. HERBERT, Lomita  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Dutch drop deficit attack THE Dutch government yesterday abandoned its target for cutting the 1994 budget deficit, because of slower economic growth and sharply rising unemployment. The 1994 budget, presented to parliament yesterday, calls for a budget deficit equivalent to 3.9 per cent of net national income. This is unchanged from this year, but above the 3.25 per cent target set in 1989. The government also published projections showing that growth in gross domestic product will be flat this year but should return to a rate of 1 per cent growth in 1994. Unemployment will rise this year and next, with 715,000 people expected to be drawing unemployment benefit in 1994, a new post-war high. This is equivalent to an unemployment rate of just over 10 per cent of the workforce. Total government spending will be reduced next year to Fl 198.7bn (Pounds 70.9bn) from a projected Fl 207.1bn in 1994. Slower economic growth will cause state revenues to drop even more sharply to Fl 178.1bn from Fl 195.7bn this year. Inflation is expected to fall to 2 per cent this year, from 3.3 per cent last year, but to rise to 3 per cent in 1994.</p>

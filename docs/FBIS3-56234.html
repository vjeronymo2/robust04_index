The session involved regional legislators and administrators  and leaders of political parties and movements.    Instead, the Commission approved a proposal by Parliamentary  Chairman Ivan Plyushch saying that only constitutional clauses  on power sharing in the center and regions must be brought for  discussion by parliament due to open on January 20 before these  are approved in a referendum.    Plyushch will lead a working group to draft main  constitutional provisions to be adopted by a new parliament.    The Supreme Soviet did not authorize the Commission to bring  a new constitution under a referendum, head of the law  commission Alexander Kotsyuba said. He said the paper must be  adopted by the next session of parliament, but any controversial  points be put for a referendum.</p>

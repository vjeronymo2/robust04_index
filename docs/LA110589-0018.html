			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO AND REVENUE  </P> <P> Regarding the Oct. 29 letters responding to Patrick Goldstein's Pop Eye column  about KROQ-FM's format modification: None of the letter writers supported  KROQ's change, accusing the management of selling out. But they are forgetting:  Commercial radio is there to make money.  </P> <P> If stations could run nothing but ads, most would. KROQ was losing listeners  and thus ad revenue. Trip Reeb, the station's new manager, came from a highly  rated modern rocker, 91X in San Diego, and his actions may well save KROQ from  being forced to entirely change its format, as happened with KFAC-FM.  </P> <P> As a modern rock music director, I appreciate the need for an outlet for  underground/new music -- but the place for this is college radio. Stations like  ours regularly play bands months or even years before they gain acceptance on  commercial radio.  </P> <P> KROQ must appeal to the majority of its listeners, and believe it or not, you  alternative types do not make up all that large a demographic group.  </P> <P> Face reality and just be glad KROQ did not decide to go more Top 40.  </P> <P> RAYMOND SO  </P> <P> Music Director  </P> <P> KSCR, USC Student Radio  </P></p>

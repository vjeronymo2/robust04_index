			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Viktor Dmitriyev and </F> Vadim Chistov]    [Text] Sao Paulo May 29 TASS -- Russian Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has called for broader cooperation  with Latin American countries in various spheres.    Addressing the Latin American parliament on Saturday,  Shumeyko who leads a group of Russian parliamentarians on a  Latin American tour, said that "Latin American countries deserve  our efforts to promptly develop effective cooperation with them  in the spheres of inter-parliamentary activity, economics,  culture, science and education."    Shumeyko informed Latin American parliamentarians about the  activity of the Russian Federal Assembly and its upper house,  the Federation Council, stressing that the experience of Latin  American lawmakers is worth studying and using in Russia.    He said that the Latin American parliament and the CIS  Inter-  Parliamentary Assembly that he heads have much in common, adding  that both organisations have a large and yet untapped potential.  "The closer we are to each other, the more we help each other,  the stronger and richer our countries will be," he said.    From Sao Paulo the Russian delegation left for Rio de  Janeiro.</p>

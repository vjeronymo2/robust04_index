			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / IMF and Hungary reach credit accord HUNGARY has reached a 'gentleman's agreement' with the International Monetary Fund which clears the way for a new credit facility and the country's return to financial respectability, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Under the accord, agreed in Washington this week, Hungary promised to bring the country's wayward public-sector deficit down from more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 5.5 per cent next year. The Hungarian authorities plan a package of tax increases and spending cuts. Some will come into effect this year but most will bite only in 1994. Government officials were confident the measures would pass through parliament this month, allowing the formal signing of the accord with the Fund afterwards. In return the IMF will disburse a credit of SDR560m (Pounds 251m) over this year and next.</p>

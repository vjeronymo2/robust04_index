			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: A PRIZE SETTING  </P> <P> With its $100,000 tax-free grant and accompanying sculpture and worldwide  recognition, the Pritzker Architecture Prize is the most coveted honor in the  profession.  </P> <P> Adding a touch of class to the award in recent years has been its annual  bestowing in an appropriate landmark setting. When Austrian Hans Hollein won in  1985, the ceremony was held at the stately Huntington Library and Art Gallery  in San Marino. In 1987 when Japanese Kenzo Tange won, it was in the stylish  Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> This year, the concept has been stretched a bit, and those wanting to attend  the black-tie affair will have to journey to Nara, Japan.  </P> <P> The ceremony will be held at the Todai-ji Buddhist Temple, the world's largest  wooden building, dating from 1199, though originally built in 750. It is an  officially designated Japanese National Treasure. SAM HALL KAPLAN  </P></p>

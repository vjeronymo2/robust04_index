			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOOP TO RETIRE  </P> <P> Many thanks to the retiring U.S. surgeon general, Dr. C. Everett Koop. How  refreshing to have had a leader who respected us, who told us the truth! His  insistence on "our right to know" was proof of that respect.  </P> <P> His anti-smoking message, his enlightened, humane concern for AIDS victims and  his campaign for sex education show what a difference one person can make.  </P> <P> He has been a vitally important voice. That voice will be missed.  </P> <P> R. KAHN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

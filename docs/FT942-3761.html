			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Forge Europe ties, US urged US preoccupation with export expansion in Asia-Pacific should not detract from efforts to make new ties with Europe, which shares most strongly US views of the future of the world economy, a new report says. 'If the US is to influence significantly the rapidly emerging new global economy, it will need allies,' say Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former US trade negotiator, and Mr Robin Gaster, a prominent trade consultant, in 'Shrinking the Atlantic: Europe and the American Economy. While Asia has become the biggest US gross export market, the content of the trade is still a concern. Unlike trade with Europe, the US tends to exchange raw materials for high technology goods from Asia. 'Despite transatlantic trade rows in telecommunications, aircraft and computers, Europe remains a prime export market in each industry; the US trade balance with Europe is strongly positive in each,' the report said. After Britain, Japan is the second largest investor in the US, but its investment is slowing 'drastically' while European investment is expected to increase. Many more European companies manufacture in the US than do Japanese. European companies paid Dollars 7bn in corporate income taxes in 1990; Asian companies paid only Dollars 100m. European companies invest about Dollars 7bn in research and development in the US, compared to Dollars 500m for Asian companies. The report calls on North America and Europe to open exploratory talks about broadening and deepening their relationship, resolving their differences on such issues as labour policy, competition policy and regulation.

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Jewish community in the West German city of Frankfurt said it is taking  court action against a city council member from an ultra-rightist party over  alleged anti-Semitic remarks. Erich Gutjahr, a 78-year-old member of the  rightist National Party of Germany, was quoted by the Frankfurt Allgemeine  newspaper as saying: "Jews have bought up half the city. The Jews are  plundering us again. Something must be done about this." The city prosecutor's  office said it is investigating Gutjahr for possible violation of German laws  over the statements, and several members of the city council have demanded that  he resign. Gutjahr said he is not anti-Semitic and only wants to protect  "German interests," the paper reported.  </P></p>

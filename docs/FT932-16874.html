			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Union wins ruling on pupil testing THE government's programme of school testing received a further serious rebuff yesterday when the High Court rejected an attempt to stop a teachers' union boycotting national curriculum tests and assessments. The London borough of Wandsworth failed to win a High Court injunction to stop a boycott of testing by members of the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union. The decision increases the likelihood that union action against the tests will spread to other unions. The three largest teaching unions begin their annual conferences next week and there will be strong pressure from members of the NUT, the largest union, and the normally moderate ATL, to join the action. Both head teachers' unions have warned that boycotts could force heads to abandon tests and stop the collection of the data used to compile school performance league tables. The NASUWT boycott of testing was imposed after members voted overwhelmingly for action. The tests imposed an 'excessive and unreasonable workload', the union said. Wandsworth said the union's members would be acting in breach of employment contracts and of their statutory duty to carry out continuous assessment of pupils' attainments and to record the results by the end of May. Teachers were also under a duty to conduct national curriculum test assessments during two weeks in June, the council claimed. Mr Justice Mantell however ruled that the industrial action was a legal trade dispute under the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 because it was wholly or mainly about workload or working hours and therefore about terms of conditions and employment. He rejected the borough's claim that members of the union had a statutory duty to implement the national curriculum. Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, said the borough would be seeking urgent legal advice on whether to appeal. A date for an appeal hearing has been set for the third week in April if an appeal is lodged. The Department for Education issued a brief statement last night reiterating the government's commitment to testing. However, Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, said it was a 'stunning victory' and a great day for all teachers and pupils.</p>

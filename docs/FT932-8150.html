			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory cash disclosure plea THE 'CHARTER' group of Conservative activists is calling for a formal policy on donations to the party as part of its campaign to remove the secrecy surrounding Tory finances. In its seventh annual report on the party's income and expenditure Charter says there should be limits to donations from any one source and sources from which 'no donations at all are acceptable.' It calls for 'a formal policy on this' approved by the party's central council. 'The Conservative party . . . should not be financed by those who have no vote in United Kingdom elections' or by 'excessively large donations or loans from those who are not prepared to be publicly identified'. The report comes as the party is showing some signs of greater openness in its accounting. It decided earlier this week that it would publish a balance sheet for the first time with its 1992-93 accounts in July. However, current proposals stop short of advocating a breakdown of individual donations to the party. The report dismisses the party's new board of management - which met for the first time this week and has been likened to a company's board of directors  -as 'a sham'. 'The chairman of the board (Sir Norman Fowler - of course) is in no way beholden to the board,' it says. 'The board's members are there at his invitation and are wholly dependent upon his goodwill for the board to function at all.' Sir Norman owed constituencies 'a proper account for the damage that has been done to the party's image by Central Office's spendthrift ways and the carelessness with which they have accepted money from seemingly any source at all in order to feed their addiction to profligacy'.

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Amersham clinches Russian deal: British company to sell radioactive materials for non-military purposes THE troubled Russian nuclear industry today will announce its first significant deal to supply radioactive materials to the west. The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry is setting up a joint venture with Amersham International of the UK. Mayak, its production centre at Chelyabinsk in the Ural mountains, will manufacture radioactive isotopes for Amersham to sell worldwide for non-military applications, including nuclear medicine, scientific research and industrial irradiation. Mr Bruce Beharrell, the Amersham director in charge of the negotiations, expects Mayak initially to receive Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.4m) a year in hard currency for the isotopes. Their final value after incorporation into Amersham products is likely to be about Dollars 100m a year. Mayak's income from the agreement 'will grow rapidly as we work more closely together', Mr Beharrell said. Mr Dewi Lewis, group strategy manager, says the joint venture will adopt Amersham's existing procedures to ensure the import and export of isotopes comply with national and international regulations for nuclear trade. Last year the company was cleared by the UK Trade and Industry Department of any wrongdoing when it was revealed as a supplier of tiny quantities of plutonium solution to Iraq in the 1980s. The shipments 'were in accordance with the export licences,' the DTI said. Mayak, Russia's largest nuclear complex, includes civil reactors, weapons production and fuel reprocessing facilities. Until the Soviet Union started to collapse last year, it was a top-secret facility whose very existence officially was denied. The whole Chelyabinsk region  - blighted by radioactive pollution  - was closed to outsiders. Now the Ministry of Atomic Energy is desperately short of funds and keen to seize any opportunity to commercialise its work. 'This co-operation with Amersham is going to be very useful to improve the financial situation of Mayak,' said Mr Victor Fetisov, director general of Mayak. 'It will help our conversion programme (from military to civil work) and also improve our capability to solve the environmental problems of the region.' With the average salary of a nuclear scientist in Russia below Dollars 100 a year at current exchange rates, the initial income of Dollars 15m a year from Amersham will give Mayak a huge boost. Amersham scientists and engineers who visited Mayak were surprised by the good condition of its technical and production facilities. 'We have looked at the plant and we are fully satisfied that the standards match the quality demands of our customers,' said Mr Bill Castell, Amersham chief executive. He expects a reliable flow of material from Mayak to boost Amersham's sales. These have been held back by a shortage of isotopes since 1990, when the UK government closed two research reactors  - Pluto and Dido - at Harwell in Oxfordshire which had been Amersham's main source of radioactive materials.

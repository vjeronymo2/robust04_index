			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 31 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a  just-concluded national conference of secretaries of discipline  inspection commissions of public security departments and  bureaus, Public Security Minister Tao Siju stressed: The  in-depth struggle against corruption launched by public security  organs is extremely important, because it affects the overall  situation of safeguarding reform, development, and stability.  He urged public security organs to enhance their awareness,  have a clear idea on what is important, vigorously carry out  preparatory work to truly deepen the struggle and produce new  results. He urged them to nurture a strong force to accomplish  the arduous task of defending reform and opening up, and of  safeguarding stability.    Tao Siju said: Since the second plenary session of the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission last August, the  Ministry of Public Security, under the leadership of the party  Central Committee and the State Council; and public security  organs in various provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities, under the leadership of their local party  committees and governments, have attached great importance to  the anti-corruption struggle. With a strong determination, they  swiftly swing into action. Thanks to the effective measures and  a tremendous amount of work performed, they have achieved  varying degrees of success in attaining the interim goals  established by the Ministry of Public Security party committee  on the basis of the three tasks set by the central authorities.  Leading cadres at the departmental level and above, and county  and city (district) public security directors and commissars  have generally carried out internal investigation and  rectification, and have enhanced self-discipline and integrity.  Discipline was strictly enforced, and a number of cases of  violation of law and discipline were earnestly investigated and  dealt with. The unhealthy practice of public security organs in  coastal areas taking part in smuggling and shielding smugglers  has been effectively curbed. The unhealthy practice of wanton  collection of fees has basically stopped. The question of  public security organs going into business and setting up  enterprises has been initially resolved. The practice of  unfairness in enforcing the law, of breaking the law to seek  personal gain, and of imposing fines instead of criminal  punishment has been effectively checked. Tao Siju continued:  Under no circumstances should we overestimate our recent  achievement in combating corruption, nor should we take problems  existing in our ranks lightly. We must not ignore the serious  problems in our ranks simply because our ranks are good in  general. If our ranks become corrupt, it would seriously damage  our party and government images. In addition, we will not be  able to discharge the heavy responsibility of safeguarding  stability and we may even endanger stability. Public security  organs shoulder a heavy responsibility in combating corruption;  we must remain sober-minded.    Tao Siju pointed out: Public Security organs must wage the  struggle against corruption with reference to their  characteristics and give due emphasis to important issues. They  must give top priority to and earnestly investigate such abuses  in the law enforcement process as breaking the law to embezzle  money for personal gain, extorting confessions by torture, and  abusing their power for personal gain in issuing licenses,  certificates, and household registration cards. Efforts should  be made to investigate cases of serious violation of law and  discipline involving leading organs, leading cadres, and police  cadres and men.    Tao Siju stressed: Public security organs must strengthen  leadership and establish a system of leadership responsibility  in deepening the struggle against corruption. Beginning from  the Ministry of Public Security, every public security organ  shall be responsible for their subordinate agencies and report  to their superior. Leading cadres at each level must attend to  the building of the public security ranks while taking care of  their work. We must strengthen management awareness and have  the courage to enforce strict discipline in public security  units. Leaders who pay no attention to the building of the  ranks are not qualified to serve as leaders. When problems  occur in the ranks, leaders concerned, as well as the parties  involved, will be held accountable. To carry out the struggle  against corruption, we must strengthen the building of a clean  government on a long-term basis. This requires education and  the establishment of a system. Public security organs at all  levels must continue to educate police cadres and men to  establish the goal of serving the people wholeheartedly and to  educate them in the mass and legal concepts. At the same time,  it is necessary to strengthen rules and regulations and  establish a sound supervision mechanism. It is particularly  necessary to vigorously establish systems.    Tao Siju concluded by asking public security organs'  discipline inspection and supervision departments, as well as  administrative departments, to strengthen work and create a  situation in which everyone is involved in comprehensively  improving public security, and successfully carrying out the  struggle against corruption.</p>

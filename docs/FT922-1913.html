			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Trade News: EC ministers water down procurement row clause EC MINISTERS have watered down a third-country retaliation clause in new public procurement legislation which could have aggravated trade friction with the US, Andrew Hill reports from Luxembourg. Internal market ministers yesterday agreed a directive which will force utilities to put big service contracts, ranging from maintenance and cleaning to accountancy and insurance, to open tender. The directive is the last in a series designed to liberalise EC public procurement from the beginning of next year. The US is threatening trade sanctions over an earlier directive on utility equipment contracts. That includes a clause allowing utilities to favour EC bids over those from third countries which have failed to open their own markets to competition. The US says this so-called 'reciprocity' clause discriminates against non-EC suppliers, particularly in the telecoms sector, and should be changed before it comes into force on January 1, 1993. EC ministers have agreed a more relaxed regime for the services directive. This will let the Commission investigate alleged discrimination against EC companies by third countries. Any retaliatory measures will have to be approved by member states. The new measure will apply to energy, water, telecommunications and transport companies, publicly or privately owned.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       OECD EXPORT CREDIT RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced new minimum interest rates for officially-supported export credits for June 15 - July 14 (May 15 - June 14 in brackets):  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- D-Mark                 9.30 (9.29) per cent Ecu                    9.25 (9.36) French Franc           10.01 (10.12) Guilder up to 5 years  9.55 (9.60) 5-8.5 years 9.35 (9.4) more than 8.5                        years 9.25 (9.30) Italian lira           12.04 (same) Yen                    6.10 (5.8) Peseta                 12.21 (12.28) Sterling               10.15 (10.64) Swiss Franc            7.86 (7.67) US dollar              for credits of up to five years 6.18 (6.93)                        5-8.5 years 7.69 (7.78) for credits of over 8.5                        years 8.06 (8.15)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally around the middle of each month.

It will be subject to change on July 15.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Sunderland AFC views second site Sunderland Association Football Club is considering a disused colliery site for its new sports and conference complex, as an alternative to development of green belt land next to Nissan's Pounds 900m Wearside car plant. The plan for a Pounds 75m complex, which has prompted angry exchanges between the club and the carmaker, was to have gone to a public inquiry. But yesterday Mr John Wood, a director of the club, confirmed that it was investigating the possibility of a smaller development on the Wearmouth colliery site. This is less than a mile from the club's Victorian Roker Park ground, from which it needs to move to fulfil the requirements of the Taylor report on football ground safety. Mining at Wearmouth, where shafts were sunk between 1826 and 1834, ended last November and hopes of a buyer were dashed earlier this year. The club, which has asked the Department of the Environment to postpone the public inquiry plans, has not ruled out the land beside Nissan. But Mr Wood said the club believed that it had to examine all possible alternatives. The former colliery site covers 44 acres compared with the 184 acres of the site beside Nissan. Mr Wood said plans for a leisure element, including a multiplex cinema, bowling alley and hotel, would need to be dropped if Wearmouth were chosen. There would still be a football stadium, covered arena and conference centre. He could not give a revised price for the scheme. The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, the planning authority for the site, and Sunderland City Council have held informal discussions with the club. The corporation plans extensive site investigations before deciding on the land's future use. British Coal, the site's owner, said it had not yet been approached by the club. Nissan, which feared that the club's plan would disrupt its deliveries and block its expansion prospects, welcomed the news. It said: 'We've always believed there must be an alternative solution, maybe Wearmouth is the answer.'</p>

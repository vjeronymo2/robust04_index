The pilot experiment, which  began three months ago, consists of cannibalizing every  component from tires to steering wheel while eliminating  polluting materials. The firm doing the work is thereby  achieving one of the goals of the National Automobile  Manufacturers Association.    ``The experiment is turning out to be more worthwhile than  expected and less expensive than predicted,'' says Jorge Aladro,  coordinator of the system at the Reyfra (Recycling and Wrecking)  firm in Mejorada del Campo (population 16,000).    It is estimated that from 700,000 to 800,000 vehicles are  scrapped every year in our country. After being stripped of  their marketable parts and components, those vehicles undergo a  partial recycling process that leaves behind a large amount of  scrap, with the further difficulty that since the vehicle was  not decontaminated first, it becomes a source of pollution.    The complete recycling of automobiles that is now being  offered includes the stages of collection, decontamination,  disassembly, and crushing. Each of those stages has in view  certain objectives which, depending on economic profitability  and technical possibilities, may or may not be incorporated into  future practice and habits.    For example, a basic feature of the first phase is the  establishment of an automobile collection system that will  eliminate the current practice of removing cars after they have  been crushed, since that makes it impossible to extract various  usable components.    To begin with, it will be necessary to adopt regulations  requiring that the final owner turn in his vehicle at one of a  number of specific locations. Those locations will be the only  ones authorized to issue the ``delivery certificate'' enabling  the owner to stop paying taxes on the car.    Aladro says that for decontamination, Reyfra ``uses a system  never before seen in Spain: one that eliminates the pollutants  (oils, brake fluid, CFC's, and so on) and keeps them from  entering the atmosphere. Those pollutants are then recycled or  processed by authorized agents.''    Once decontaminated, the vehicle enters the disassembly  phase. The glass could be reused, resulting in an estimated  savings of 130 kg of fuel oil per metric ton of recycled glass.    The sulfuric acid from batteries is converted into lead-free  calcium sulfate, thus becoming a nonpolluting waste product.    The scrap, with the acid removed, is broken down into its  component parts by crushing. The final result is inert slag and  lead that is pure enough to enter the production cycle of that  metal.    Lastly, the car is broken up and the various metals are  separated and sent to the steel industry for reuse.    This pilot experiment differs from those carried out in  Europe in that it is the first to include all automobile  manufacturers and has the cooperation of associations in that  industry. Those associations are very necessary, since the  networks for reuse and marketing depend upon them.</p>

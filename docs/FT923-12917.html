			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Italian PM plans to cut state's role PROFESSOR Giuliano Amato, Italy's new Socialist prime minister, yesterday pledged to 'change the rules' in Italy, committing himself to a fundamental reform of the country's state dominated economic and financial system. In his first interview with a foreign newspaper he underlined his desire to convince the international community of the seriousness of his reformist intentions. On the key issue of privatisation, he said: 'You begin by saying you are in the year zero and you should reduce the role of the state as much as you can.' Referring to last week's move turning into joint stock companies Italy's four principal state entities - IRI, the holding company, ENI, the national oil concern, Enel,the electricity authority and INA, the insurance institute  -he said: 'I am creating a machine that will be forced towards privatisation.' He poured scorn on previous attempts at privatisation. 'One of the first cases was in the banking sector, IMI-Cariplo - a public bank (Cariplo) paid for with money from IMI (another state financial institution).' He said his cabinet was attempting to create a new market system where the state was no longer the source of funding and instead companies were obliged to look to the markets, not least the international markets. Prof Amato said his emergency budget, seeking to raise L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts, broke new ground by addressing structural reforms. 'This budget is different from previous ones since they did not touch such areas as reform of public health, pensions, state employment . . . This time we are going to change the rules . . . we have to tackle the fundamental (items) on which expenditures are flowing away.' He said he expected both the budget decree and the accompanying decrees to reform public health, pensions, civil service employment, greater financial autonomy for local authorities and privatisation to be approved within 90 days by parliament. If the 16 seat majority of his four party coalition failed in parliament he suggested he would seek a vote of confidence. On Italy's position over the Eurofighter project, he indicated he would still like it to prosper albeit in cheaper form. But he added elliptically: 'Does it make sense without Germany; will Germany be willing to to remain a partner if a cheaper plane will result as being feasible? The technical answer to this has not arrived as yet. But we are hoping for a positive solution.' Interview, Page 18</p>

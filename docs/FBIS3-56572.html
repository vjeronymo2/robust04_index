"The reports of our consent are the Georgian Interior  Ministry's exercise in misinformation. I have no intention to  go to Georgia because I have nothing to do with terrorists and  murderers. I demand that the body be moved to Chechnya for  burial," Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said.    In her words, she was visited by Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev, who told her that as a mediator he would insist on  doing as the deceased's family desired.</p>

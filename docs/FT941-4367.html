			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Observer: Who luvs Vlad? Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the iconoclastic Russian politician, has at last found a country where, if the red carpets are not exactly unrolling, at least there's no chance of an official ban - Poland. Russians don't need visas to visit Poland, so long as they can produce a valid invitation from a Pole. Curiously enough, Zhirinovksy has his from something called the Front of National Self-Defence, a militant nationalist organisation, which regards mainstream Polish political parties as - how can we put it? - somewhat lacking in patriotic fervour. Oddly enough the Front sees no contradiction in inviting a figure who has publicly advocated a 'common border between Russia and Germany'. Gulp.</p>

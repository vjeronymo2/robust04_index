			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Phnom Penh, April 1 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-Prime  Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh returned to his country Friday  after a three-week trip to France as the nation's co-defence  ministers returned from Hanoi.    Moving quickly through the airport, Ranariddh said only that  the trip, on which he was accompanied by his wife, had been a  private visit.    The joint ministers of defence, Generals Tie Banh and Tea  Chamrat, returned from a four-day trip in Hanoi to strengthen  military ties.    Tie Banh said Vietnam had congratulated the Royal Cambodian  army for capturing Pailin.    He denied a Thai newspaper report which said Thursday that  the two ministers had appealed to Hanoi for ammunition and  weapons.    "We went there only to improve our good relations with our  neighbors," he said. "Our trip was not concerned with politics  or ammunitions supplies. It was a friendly visit." [passage  omitted]</p>

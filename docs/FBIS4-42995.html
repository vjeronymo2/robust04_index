			<p>BFN     [Text] Augsburg (DPA) -- Bundeswehr Inspector General  Klaus Naumann has come out in favor of not forgetting Russia's  contribution on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end  of World War II next year. In an interview with AUGSBURGER  ALLGEMEINE (Tuesday [7 June] edition), Naumann said that a  celebration with Russia "is not my decision." But one "should  not forget the contribution and the sacrifices made by Russia to  destroy fascism and to end the war, even though Moscow's goal  was the establishment of another dictatorship."    Concerning accusations of antisemitic and xenophobic  statements by drunk Guard Battalion soldiers, as well as the  arrest of a noncommissioned officer for being the head of a  defense sports group, Naumann said that he does not observe any  intensified influx of right-wing extremists in the Bundeswehr.  Last year 53 such cases were reported, in which 63 soldiers  were involved, 80 percent of them conscripts. "I think that the  fact that there were only 53 cases among 390,000 soldiers in  1993 contradicts the impression of a shift to the right."</p>

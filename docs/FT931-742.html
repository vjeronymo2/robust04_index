			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Fears of inflation continue to haunt bond investors LAST week was not a good one for the US Treasury bond market. Investor sentiment continued to be increasingly bearish, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell by more than one and a half points on the week and fears about inflation were still haunting the market. Bond investors have in the last few weeks convinced themselves - albeit in a rather artificial and perhaps even mistaken manner - that they were staring at all the ingredients needed for a sell-off. Since mid-March, when fears of inflation were rekindled by statistics that in retrospect seem misleading, the market has been in a distinctly sour mood. Last week this worsened after professional dealers ended up holding the bulk of more than Dollars 26bn worth of new two and five-year Treasury notes that were auctioned. The malcontents of the market prevailed so substantially that it turned out to be of little consequence when, last Thursday, the Senate approved President Clinton's deficit-reducing budget package faster than had been expected. Bond prices continued to slide on Friday and the only explanation is that all the good news about the deficit reduction measures and prospects for economic recovery had already been priced into the market back in January, at the time of Mr Clinton's state of the union message. Ms Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, the bond market advisory firm, reckons the perceptions of both faster growth and higher inflation have been overdone. She, like other economists, says the reason is that some of the recent consumer price and producer price statistics overstate inflationary pressures. 'In reality, inflation is still running at about 3 per cent annually and it will continue to be held down by global competitive pressures and moderate wage gains.' Mr Philip Braverman, DKB Securities chief economist, takes a similar view: 'For the moment the market is responding to misleading suggestions that the economy is strengthening, that inflation is mounting and that credit growth is beginning to accelerate.' In fact, according to Mr Braverman, credit is still constrained and inflation will dissipate with a renewed economic slowdown. Since the February employment report was released on March 5 the bond market has been functioning in a trading range of yields between 6.75 per cent and 6.92 per cent on 30-year paper. On Friday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was 102 9/32 to yield 6.94 per cent, compared to a price of 103 31/32 and a yield of 6.81 per cent a week before. The current yield is the highest level since January. It didn't help matters that last week's auction of Dollars 15.25bn of two-year notes and Dollars 11bn of five-year notes put the paper mainly in the hands of professionals. Retail buyers remained on the sidelines. This week the market will focus on the new unemployment report that is due to be released on Friday. Ms Camilli forecasts an unchanged unemployment rate of 7 per cent and the addition of 137,000 payroll jobs for the month. That compares to a February rise of 365,000 such jobs, but this number will probably be revised downward by about a sixth. Mr Braverman argues that Treasury bond investors should not only reverse their sell-off mentality, but expect lower yields in the near term. However, this will depend on other factors such as the first quarter GDP report, to be released at the end of April, and the Treasury's plans for its May refunding operation, to be announced in early May.</p>

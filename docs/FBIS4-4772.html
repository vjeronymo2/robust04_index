			<p>BFN     [Text] Pochon, South Korea, April 5 (YONHAP) -- President  Kim Yong-sam said on Tuesday that four neighboring countries --  the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- will not make any  decision related to North Korea's nuclear problem without  consultation with South Korea and that every clause of the  United Nations Security Council president's statement to North  Korea on March 31 was drawn up after close consultation with  South Korea.    Kim, who is visiting Pochon, northeast of Seoul, to plant  trees, had a lunch with officials of the Forestry Administration  and local administrations, saying "the four neighboring  countries decided to divide the Korean peninsula in the past  without considering the will of the Korean people, but now these  countries are consulting with us on all matters related to the  Korean peninsula."    "China considers South Korea as an important partner in many  respects and Russia becomes an important country to have good  ties with us," Kim said.</p>

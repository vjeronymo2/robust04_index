Three items were on  the meeting's agenda. Here is a report on the meeting by the  minister of communication and spokesman of the government,  Cyriaque Simbizi.    [Begin Simbizi recording] Three items were on the agenda of  the meeting, first, the draft decree on the organization of the  services at the Presidency of the Republic; second, the draft  decree on the creation and organization of the General  Administration of State Security; and third, the draft decree on  the organization of the Ministry of National Defense. [passage  omitted]    The ministers discussed setting up a General Administration  of State Security charged with all the problems relating to the  security of the head of state, the other state institutions, and  senior political personalities. The main reason for this draft  decree originates in the unfortunate events that our country has  been through since the night of 20 to 21 October 1993. The  serious consequences of destabilizing the institutions, notably  the Presidency, justifies the establishment of a body  technically and morally trained to efficiently ensure the  protection of national democratic institutions, irrespective of  the party or people in power, today or tomorrow.    It is within this framework that we have proposed the  creation of a General Administration of State Security which  comprises a security unit for the institutions and the Central  Investigation Office. The unit is military and made up of about  1,000 men, whose recruitment will be carried out from existing  units of the Armed Forces or through military channels. The  unit will have to reflect the image of a truly national army in  its composition, discipline, and technical, moral, and patriotic  training.    The members of the council unanimously recognized the  appropriateness of such a structure given the circumstances our  country has just experienced. They recognized that this was, in  fact, a formalization of its existence, since there has always  been a Presidential Guard Unit, though without a regular  function. This unit did not deal with the protection of the  president of the republic alone. It was often drawn from a  military barracks and dealt with other tasks.    Under the new project, the same body will also deal with the  protection of other senior political personalities and strategic  points.    It is worth noting that the project was conceived jointly  with the services concerned, notably the Army and the  Gendarmerie headquarters, as well as the National Documentation  Services.

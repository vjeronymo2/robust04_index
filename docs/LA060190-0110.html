			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE, BUT VISION ISN'T ALWAYS 20/20  </P> <P> Abubaker Omar Shariff, the Kenyan witch doctor who correctly predicted that  Manchester United would win England's F.A. Cup in soccer, has predicted that  Italy will win the World Cup.  </P> <P> Or has he?  </P> <P> Said Reuters: "To be on the safe side, he has picked five other strong  contenders. He says reigning champion Argentina, England, the Netherlands, the  Soviet Union and Sweden all have a good chance should Italy falter."  </P> <P> Thanks, Doc.  </P> <P> Bad joke: Said San Francisco Giant Manager Roger Craig, recalling Monday's game  at Chicago, where his old buddy, Cub Manager Don Zimmer, threw a tantrum after  the umpires reversed themselves and ruled that Ryne Sandberg's home run was a  foul ball: "I called him. I said, 'The ball was foul. You held up the game and  got my pitcher tired.' He hung up."  </P> <P> Said Sandberg, when asked what he said to umpire Randy Marsh: "I told him I  thought the call was weak. Well, something similar to that."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter against the Dodgers?  </P> <P> Storm warning: From Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer, suggesting that the  Boston Celtics' Larry Bird, who differed with Jimmy Rodgers on strategy, helped  grease the skids for the coach: "At one point, after Rodgers forcefully  suggested that Bird pass more, Bird did just that -- he blatantly passed up  shots to pass the ball, whether the receiver was open or not.  </P> <P> "At that moment, you knew Rodgers was gone."  </P> <P> The survivor: Said reserve forward Ed Nealy of the Chicago Bulls, when asked to  list his career highlights: "Every time I make a team, it's a highlight."  </P> <P> Mike's lament: After his No. 20 uniform was retired at Philadelphia, Mike  Schmidt told Phillie announcer Richie Ashburn he was upset that Pete Rose  hadn't been invited to the ceremony.  </P> <P> "I've had a tough time with that," Schmidt said. "Pete and I are close friends.  When he came to the Phillies, he had a very positive effect on my career. I'll  always be indebted to Pete for that."  </P> <P> As for Rose's gambling, Schmidt said: "I can't take his side in what has  happened off the field. All I can say is that I love Pete for what he did for  me, and I think he knows I would have done anything to have him standing by my  side."  </P> <P> He's not kidding: Davey Johnson, who blamed a breakdown in communications with  the New York Mets' front office for his firing, was asked how he would like  working for George Steinbrenner with the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> "One thing," he said, "you'd definitely have a lot of conversations."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Tom Browning, Cincinnati Reds, 1988. He pitched a perfect game  to beat the Dodgers, 1-0.  </P> <P> Quotebook: George Vecsey of the New York Times, on the firing of Davey Johnson  by the Mets: "Darryl Strawberry was quoted as saying the Mets felt 'numb' after  Johnson was dropped. Big deal. They've been numb for two months." HARLEY  TINKHAM  </P></p>

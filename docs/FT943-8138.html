			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Row over call for curb on population Worldwide spending on family planning needs to rise to Dollars 17bn by the end of the decade - more than treble present levels - if the growth in the world's population is to be curbed, the United Nations population fund said yesterday. The UN call comes amid an international row over the agenda of next month's population conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting to tackle the issue for a decade. This week, US anti-abortionists joined the Vatican and Islamic leaders in attacking the conference's draft agenda, which calls on countries to draw up plans for stabilising the world's population. The agenda also covers homosexuality, women's rights and teenage sex, but it is the comments on abortion that have provoked the fiercest opposition. The US's powerful anti-abortion lobby took full page advertisements in leading newspapers this week to accuse the UN and the US of promoting abortion as a means of contraception. Governments from the Philippines to the Middle East have been drawn into the controversy, in which the US and the Vatican have been cast as the prime antagonists. Pope John Paul II, who has accused the conference of promoting the 'culture of death', last week attacked the conference's support for artificial birth control. Islamic leaders in Cairo, and Iran's Moslem-led government have also criticised sections of the draft document. Mr Timothy Wirth, the US undersecretary of state for global affairs, has insisted that 'neither US policy nor the Cairo document promotes abortion'. The UN said the agenda commented on abortion only in the context of a threat to women's health. The UN population fund, which estimates that 250,000 women die each year from the 50m abortions performed worldwide, has called for better distribution of contraceptives to help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. UN officials are exasperated that the abortion row threatens to distract debate from the broader issues of population growth. According to the fund's annual report, published yesterday, the world's present population of 5.7bn is set to rise to 10bn by the middle of the next century even if the sharp falls in birth rates seen in recent years continue. But it argues that the population could be stabilised at 7.8bn if contraception were made much more widely available. World's creaking cradle, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 11</p>

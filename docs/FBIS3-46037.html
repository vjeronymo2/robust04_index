The line-up included:    Oleg Soskovets as first deputy prime minister;    Aleksandr Zaveryukha as deputy prime minister;    Anatoliy Chubays as deputy prime minister;    Yuriy Yarov as deputy prime minister;    Eduard Nechayev as health minister;    Viktor Khlystun as minister of agriculture;    Sergey Shakhray as minister of nationalities and regional  policy;    Sergei Shoygu as minister of civil defense and emergency    situations; and    Aleksandr Shokhin as minister of economics.    President Yeltsin decreed on January 10 that the number of  deputy prime ministers should be cut to four or five from the  previous nine, and the number of ministers should be reduced to  23 from over 30.    Names of ministers including heads of defense or foreign  affairs departments were not written in today's decree.    The decree also relieved:    Vladimir Shumeyko of his duties as first deputy prime  minister in view of the fact that he has been elected speaker of  the federation council, the upper house of the parliament;    Yegor Gaydar of his duties as first deputy prime minister at  his request; and    Boris Fedorov, Shakhray and Shokhin of their duties as  deputy  prime ministers in connection with the changes in the government  structure.    The decree also relieved Vasiliy Voznyak, Vladimir Kuramin,  Vladimir Mashchits and Ivan Chernoyvanov of their duties as  chairmen of the state committees of the government because their  committees will be merged into relative ministries.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: World Index remains on a downtrend In the five days to last Friday, the FT-Actuaries World Index registered precisely the same decline - 0.91 per cent - as it did in the week before. The way it got there changed marginally, with the US going into decline after a miniscule rise in the week before. Japan had an eventful time. Tokyo's Nikkei average opened the week with a 1.6 per cent gain and a new 1993 high on hopes of a discount rate cut and additional fiscal measures to support the economy. But then the market had second thoughts, and ran into pessimism in the back half of the week about the effects of the new government's economic package. 'Not only did the government's fiscal package fail to live up to expectations, depressing the outlook for the domestic economy,' said James Capel, the London stockbrokers, 'but the second quarter GNP data revealed the extent to which exporters are suffering from the massive overvaluation of the yen and weakness in key export markets.' Nomura's global strategy team, headed by Mr Nicholas Knight, agreed with Capel on the Tokyo package and said that Japan and continental Europe were the most vulnerable equity markets. The remarkable performance in Europe was the gain in Germany, all of it last Friday as Daimler showed that getting a US quote had its disadvantages - to wit, the lifting of the corporate curtain which German companies, by the release of previous years' provisions, can draw over a bad year's losses. Mr James Cornish, a strategist at NatWest Securities, said that analysts were beginning to take the view that most of the bad news about Germany had appeared already. Additionally, he said, there was a view that west German inflation and M3 figures, due this week, will allow the Bundesbank to make a more acceptable reduction in repo rates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change in              % change in local currency**       sterling**  US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                          1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -1.55   -2.80    +18.37   +22.57    +21.29       +22.93 Belgium       -1.05   -3.40    +18.26   +16.96    +11.38       +12.89 Denmark       -1.05   -2.67    +31.31   +29.53    +22.25       +23.90 Finland       -3.07   -7.99   +143.03   +69.49    +51.65       +53.71 France        -0.32   -0.92    +16.50   +16.54    +13.09       +14.62 Germany       +1.08   -2.04    +19.09   +21.55    +20.68       +22.32 Ireland       -2.28   -4.64    +38.62   +39.03    +21.80       +23.44 Italy         -0.47   -5.29    +81.35   +43.51    +34.08       +35.88 Netherlands   -0.92   -2.53    +21.44   +20.13    +19.20       +20.82 Norway        +1.12   -3.78    +43.25   +28.17    +24.58       +26.26 Spain         -1.07   -2.55    +36.83   +33.22    +16.63       +18.21 Sweden        -0.67   -2.48    +59.49   +26.40    +10.36       +11.85 Switzerland   +0.85   -3.39    +25.92   +16.31    +20.08       +21.71 UK            -1.08   -1.75    +25.15    +7.53     +7.53        +8.98 EUROPE        -0.48   -2.24    +26.49   +16.11    +13.97       +15.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     -0.62   +0.11    +22.38    19.40    +11.97       +13.48 Hong Kong     -2.86   -1.91    +25.79   +32.17    +30.58       +32.35 Japan         -1.61   -0.63    +20.82   +24.90    +47.45       +49.44 Malaysia      +0.70   +5.94    +68.86   +48.98    +50.86       +52.90 New Zealand   -1.85   -3.60    +37.66   +30.58    +38.33       +40.22 Singapore     +0.71   +1.95    +54.78   +32.08    +33.95       +35.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.52   -2.70     +6.44   +10.59     +5.58        +7.01 USA           -0.56   +0.51     +9.57    +5.33     +3.93        +5.33 Mexico        -3.94   -1.24    +36.47    +2.14     +1.14        +2.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +0.64   -5.33    +23.77   +21.74    +26.22       +27.93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   -0.91   -0.63    +17.86   +14.28    +18.56       +20.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 17th 1993.

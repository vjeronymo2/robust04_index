This would extend the surveillance for these valves approximately 5 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The subject valve in the boron injection flowpath was exercised through a complete cycle on March 7, 1994, during the performance of SP 2601A. This surveillance verified the valve's operability. However, the performance of this surveillance did not satisfy literal compliance with Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c, because it was not performed while the unit was shutdown. A one-time extension to the surveillance frequency for the subject valve in the boron injection system does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Specification 4.7.4.1.b <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Service water valves 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B are normally open and are designed to fail in the ``as is'' position. The valves do not perform any active safety function (are not considered in any operational procedure to mitigate the effects of an abnormal event), nor do they provide isolation between the two service water headers. Their primary function is to isolate the downstream portion of the header for maintenance activities. Increasing the time interval between performance of surveillance testing 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B does not involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequences of a previously analyzed accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a review of the maintenance and operational history of the service water system valves did not identify any previous problems with the ability of the valves to open or close, or to meet any other design requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the one-time extension of the surveillance interval does not involve a significant increase in the probability of consequences of an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

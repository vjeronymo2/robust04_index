			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOG BREATH? HARRODS HAS THE ANSWER  </P> <P> Harrods, London's luxury department store, today presented a new toothpaste for  dogs that fights tooth decay and promises to give pets fresh breath.  </P> <P> "Britain has nearly 7 million dogs, and their life expectancy is increasing.  </P> <P> But often they have decaying teeth and gums, and their breath smells foul  because they are fed on dog food that is soft," said Dr. Roger Mugford, an  animal behaviorist.  </P> <P> Mugford told reporters at the presentation of the new Petrodex toothpaste that  he had tried the product out himself on a long-haired Irish setter and a  short-legged Welsh corgi. "They loved the paste since it tastes malty," he  said.  </P> <P> But he conceded that he would not venture to try to brush just any dog's teeth,  saying: "I would think about it with a Rottweiler" -- a breed known for its  sharp teeth.  </P></p>

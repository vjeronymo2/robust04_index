			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The release of 900 Palestinian prisoners will take  place today. This is reported by our correspondent Moti Amir.  In one hour, 400 hundred prisoners will be released from the  al-Zahiriyah prison. The first batch from among the 500  prisoners to be released from Qezi'ot today were released half  an hour ago. Our correspondent reports that prisoners from  Judaea and Samaria are being released from Qezi'ot this morning,  while Gaza Strip prisoners will be released this afternoon.    Sufyan al-Zaydan, the Fatah spokesman in Gaza, says today's  release of Palestinian prisoners will not bring the PLO back to  the negotiating table because the number of those being released  is insufficient.</p>

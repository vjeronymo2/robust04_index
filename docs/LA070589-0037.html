			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BROWNING MISSES PERFECT GAME, SETTLES FOR 2-1 WIN OVER PHILLIES  </P> <P> Tom Browning came within three outs of becoming the first major leaguer to  pitch two perfect games in a career before Dickie Thon doubled leading off the  ninth inning as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 2-1,  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Thon hit a drive to right-center field that went to the wall. One out later,  pinch-hitter Steve Jeltz singled to score Thon and chase Browning (7-6). John  Franco got the last two outs for his 22nd save.  </P> <P> Browning pitched a perfect game last Sept. 16 against the Dodgers at  Cincinnati. He missed another no-hitter this season when San Diego's Tony Gwynn  singled with one out in the ninth on June 6.  </P> <P> For eight innings, the Reds had only two tough plays to make on defense.  </P> <P> In the first, third baseman Lenny Harris dove to his left and gloved Tom Herr's  smash, straightened up and threw out the runner.  </P> <P> At the start of the third, on Browning's only 3-2 count, Len Dykstra hit a line  drive that first baseman Todd Benzinger speared.  </P> <P> Browning contributed a fine defensive play of his own in the fourth inning,  when he caught a smash by Dykstra that appeared headed for center field.  </P> <P> The Reds took a 2-0 lead in the first with the help of a pair of walks off  Terry Mulholland (1-3). Harris led off with a walk and scored on Kal Daniels'  double, Daniels taking third on the throw home. One out later, Eric Davis  walked and Paul O'Neill hit into a fielder's choice that scored Daniels.  </P> <P> On May 2 last season, Ron Robinson of the Reds was one out away from a perfect  game against Montreal. Wallace Johnson broke that up with a pinch single.  </P></p>

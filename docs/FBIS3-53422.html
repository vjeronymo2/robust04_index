			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Type of Criticism?"] </F>   [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's speech at the Friday  Mass Prayer and his detailed report on the country's economic  situation have set in motion a series of debates in political  circles in the country.    The debates are mostly centered on the types of criticism  levelled on the government's performance in the past few years  especially in connection with the implementation of the 5-year  Development Plan.    It is an undeniable fact that the enemies of the Islamic  Revolution, in particular the U.S., do not wish Iran to be  successful in its social reconstruction programs, and to be  turned into a prominent economic power.    The U.S. used the same strategy in its fight against  communism, and finally succeeded in using that ideology's  flagrant economic weakness to deliver the fatal blow at an  appropriate moment. It should be pointed out that the collapse  of communism was brought about by a complex combination of  factors.    America has already used various tactics against Iran such  as  arranging coup d'etat and giving the green light to Iraq to  invade Iran, and it has failed to undermine the foundations of  the Islamic Republic. So now America is trying to strike at us  with the economic weapon. In pursuit of that strategy the U.S.  has been exerting various types of pressures on the European  countries to make them restrict their economic cooperations with  Iran.    One of the economic weapons with which America hopes to deal  destructive blows on Iran is to spread false rumors about Iran's  economic position and to create an atmosphere of instability and  distrust regarding Iran's economic successes. It is a great  economic success that in 5 years time electricity breakdowns  will reach zero level, gas pipelines construction will have been  completed in 200 cities and towns, vast portions of surface  water sources will have been harnessed and telephone  communication facilities will have spread to the remotest  villages.    Alongside of all of these successes, the press and the other  mass media have every right to express their constructive  criticism.    There have undoubtedly been shortcomings in the planning and  implementation of parts of the 5-Year Plan, and now at the  conclusion of the Development Plan, it is the indisputable right  of the press to undertake an analytic examination of the First  Plan for the purpose of using the experiences gained from its  implementation in the Second Plan.    It is our firm belief that a clear-cut distinction should be  made between constructive and subversive criticisms.</p>

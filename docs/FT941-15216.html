			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Big drop in European car sales West European new car sales fell 15.2 per cent last year to an estimated 11.45m units, as carmakers suffered the steepest annual decline in Europe in the post-war period. At least 2m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe in 1993 than a year earlier. Four of the big six volume carmakers - Volkswagen, Fiat, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Ford of Europe - suffered heavy losses. Production has been cut drastically and carmakers have been forced to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. The outlook for 1994 remains depressed, with demand forecast to grow only 1-2 per cent. New car sales fell last year in 15 of 17 European markets with demand rising only in the UK and, marginally, in Norway. Four of the leading volume markets suffered heavy declines with sales dropping an estimated 19 per cent in Germany, 20 per cent in Italy, 18 per cent in France and 24 per cent in Spain. The steepest fall was suffered in the small Greek market with an estimated year-on-year decline of 28 per cent. The only significant growth was achieved in the UK, where sales rose 11.6 per cent, as the market began to recover decisively from three years of deep recession. UK new car sales, however, remain well below the 1989 peak of 2.3m. In December new car sales in west Europe fell 20.4 per cent year-on-year to 775,000 units, according to industry estimates. The decline was exaggerated, however, by the high level of new car registrations the previous year, when sales were boosted by pending increases in car taxation at the beginning of 1993 in several countries. In addition, manufacturers were disposing of cars not equipped with catalytic converters, which became mandatory last year to meet EU standards. New car sales in December were sharply lower year-on-year in all five leading volume markets, with declines of 31.2 per cent in France, 21.8 per cent in Germany, 19.8 per cent in Spain, 10.7 per cent in Italy and 7.7 per cent in the UK. There were signs of recovery in some of the smaller markets, however, particularly in the Nordic region, and sales in December were higher than a year earlier in seven of 17 west European markets. The Volkswagen group of Germany and the Fiat group of Italy, which both ended the year deep in loss, suffered the steepest sales declines last year, while General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) and Ford both gained market share. The VW group - including Audi, Seat and Skoda - remained the market leader in west Europe for the ninth year in succession, but it was hit by an estimated 20.1 per cent fall in sales volume in west Europe, where it sold about 320,000 fewer cars than a year earlier. Fiat, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, saw sales fall 21 per cent to 1.27m units, as its market share contracted to 11.1 per cent. Rover, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, achieved the strongest performance among European carmakers. It increased sales by 9 per cent in a market that shrank 15 per cent and raised market share to 3.2 per cent, from 2.5 per cent a year earlier. Japanese carmakers increased their market share to an estimated 12.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent a year earlier, increasing trade tensions between Tokyo and Brussels. However, the fortunes of the different manufacturers varied widely. Nissan, Toyota, and Honda, which are producing vehicles in Europe, all out-performed the market and offset reductions in export quotas from Japan with higher local output. Mazda, the only leading Japanese carmaker without firm plans for European production, suffered a 28 per cent fall in sales volume.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                          January-December 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Volume     Volume      Share (%)   Share (%)                           (Units)  Change (%)   Jan-Dec 93   Jan-Dec 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           11,449,000    -15.2         100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group        1,888,000    -20.1          16.5       17.5  -Volkswagen            1,245,000    -20.5          10.9       11.6  -Audi                    318,000    -23.2           2.8        3.1  -Seat                    273,000    -17.4           2.4        2.4  -Skoda*                   51,000     -0.1           0.4        0.4 General Motors****      1,493,000    -11.4          13.0       12.5  -Opel/Vauxhall         1,436,000    -11.0          12.5       12.0  -Saab**                   42,000    -18.1           0.4        0.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen     1,402,000    -14.7          12.2       12.2  -Peugeot                 848,000    -14.9           7.4        7.4  -Citroen                 554,000    -14.3           4.8        4.8 Ford*****               1,315,000    -13.4          11.5       11.3  -Ford Europe           1,304,000    -13.5          11.4       11.2  -Jaguar                   11,000     +1.2           0.1        0.1 Fiat group********      1,272,000    -20.6          11.1       11.9  -Fiat                    955,000    -19.9           8.3        8.8  -Lancia                  179,000    -22.4           1.6        1.7  -Alfa Romeo              125,000    -24.7           1.1        1.2 Renault*****            1,201,000    -16.2          10.5       10.6 Nissan                    397,000     -9.5           3.5        3.2 BMW                       370,000    -16.4           3.2        3.3 Rover***                  361,000     +8.9           3.2        2.5 Mercedes-Benz             354,000    -13.5           3.1        3.0 Toyota                    318,000     -5.8           2.8        2.5 Mazda                     194,000    -28.0           1.7        2.0 Volvo*****                171,000    -14.7           1.5        1.5 Honda***                  162,000     -7.8           1.4        1.3 Mitsubishi                140,000    -13.1           1.2        1.2 Total Japanese          1,388,000    -12.9          12.1       11.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany                 3,192,000    -18.8          27.9       29.1 Italy                   1,890,000    -20.4          16.5       17.6 United Kingdom          1,778,000    +11.6          15.5       11.8 France                  1,721,000    -18.3          15.0       15.6 Spain                     744,000    -24.1           6.5        7.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ****Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. *****Renault and Volvo are linked through minority cross-shareholdings. ******** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati. ***Honda holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover vehicle operations.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: industry estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

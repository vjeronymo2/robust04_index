			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late sell programme upsets equities A LATE 'sell' programme from one of the big UK investment houses and a flurry of selling by nervous investors as news filtered into the market that the UK Budget will be announced on March 10 took their toll of a London equity market regarded as ripe for a bout of profit-taking. The FT-SE 100-share index finished a relatively dull trading session only 5 points off the day's low, closing a net 21.4 down at 2,522.0. At its highest level for the day the index still showed a decline of 4.2 at 2,539.2. It reached its lowest point for the sess-ion of 2,517.0 during the late afternoon. Marketmakers moved quick-ly to lower their quotations for leading blue chips at the outset of trading, seeking to head off selling by arbitrageurs acting for US institutions. There was a flurry of US-sourced selling first thing, reflecting the widespread and often substantial losses among blue chips on Wall Street overnight which saw the US market retreat more than 30 Dow points. After the initial bout of weakness, however, institutions began to nibble at a number of leading stocks, taking advantage of what were described as generous quotations. Marketmakers kept one eye on the Footsie future as well as the Seaq screens, and moved quickly in mid-morning to follow a sharp rally in the derivatives market. Activity tended to wilt over the lunchtime period but then accelerated to accommodate the opening of Wall Street. The latter's overnight fall, which caused widespread dismay among some London brokers, was followed yesterday by a neutral opening. The lack of direction from America left London to its own devices, and a decline in the Footsie future, coupled with a late trading programme which was said to have been heavily weighted on the sell side, triggered a late plunge in the cash market index. The sell programme included big lines of blue chip stocks, while there were hints that Hoare Govett, one of the leading UK brokerages, had placed a substantial block of shares in Hillsdown, the food group. Property issues fell heavily after news that merger talks between Rosehaugh and Stanhope had come to nothing, and reports that there had been considerable shareholder opposition at the annual meeting of MEPC to the group's dividend policy. Drug shares, among the market's most volatile stocks, were mixed, with the leaders tending to lose ground on profit-taking. Wellcome, however, gave one of the best individual performances among the Footsie constituents, after suggestions that one of the top UK broking houses had lifted its profits forecasts. Telecom shares remained sharply in focus, with BT, formerly British Telecommunications, suffering from worries about the consultative document on pricing due to be published at the end of the month by Oftel, the telecoms watchdog. Cable and Wireless, heavily traded recently as stories of a link with AT&amp;T, of the US, have done the rounds of the market, fell further. Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular telephones group, declined sharply after a series of profits downgrades by analysts. Turnover in equities was again disappointing, reaching only 515.6m shares on the Seaq, compared with Tuesday's programme-boosted 619.4m and Monday's 418.2m.</p>

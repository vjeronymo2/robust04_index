			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON ROUTED BY INSPIRED COLORADO  </P> <P> The fifth-ranked Colorado Buffaloes showed what effect the death of 21-year-old  quarterback Sal Aunese would have on them.  </P> <P> The Buffaloes went out and played their best game of the season and defeated  No. 21 Washington, 45-28, Saturday.  </P> <P> "This exceeded anything I'd hoped for," Coach Bill McCartney. "This speaks a  lot about the intensity and resolve of our players."  </P> <P> Aunese, Colorado's starting quarterback last season, died last Saturday night  after a six-month battle against inoperable stomach cancer. His funeral was  Monday.  </P> <P> The Buffaloes knelt before their game in a tribute to Aunese. Then they went  out and played like a team determined to win a national championship.  </P> <P> Against a perennial Pacific 10 contender, the Buffaloes of the Big Eight  overcame a 3-0 deficit in the first quarter to score the second-most points  ever by a Washington opponent at 69-year-old Husky Stadium.  </P> <P> USC defeated the Huskies, 48-0, in Seattle in 1929.  </P> <P> McCartney said before Saturday's game that he wasn't sure how his players, who  were off last weekend, would respond to the death.  </P> <P> Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan said: "I was down when I heard about Sal,  but I was fired up at the funeral. I wanted to come here and get a big victory  for him."  </P> <P> After failing to get a first down in its first two possessions, Colorado scored  the first of its six touchdowns on the ground on a 35-yard run by Eric Bieniemy  at 11:53 and the rout was on.  </P> <P> The 17-point margin of victory by the Buffaloes (4-0) was deceiving. Colorado  outclassed the Huskies both on offense and defense.  </P> <P> Washington (2-2) trailed, 38-6, after three quarters and scored three  touchdowns against Colorado reserves in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Washington quarterback Cary Conklin, who was intercepted three times, twice by  strong safety Bruce Young, said, "It was a frustrating day."  </P> <P> With Hagan directing Colorado's run-oriented wishbone offense, the Buffaloes  rolled up 420 yards on the ground and 485 total yards. On defense, the  Buffaloes' first unit held Washington to a pair of field goals by John McCallum  until the last quarter.  </P> <P> Bieniemy scored two touchdowns, the second on a one-yard run in the second  quarter. Then, in order, Flannigan scored on a three-yard run in the second,  Hagan scored on a three-yard run in the third, wide receiver Jeff Campbell  scored on a 56-yard reverse in the third and backup quarterback Charles Johnson  scored on a 16-yard run in the fourth.  </P> <P> Ken Culbertson kicked a 43-yard field goal for the Buffaloes in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Washington scored its touchdowns in the fourth quarter on a 15-yard pass from  Conklin to Mario Bailey, when tight end Bill Ames fell on a Bailey fumble in  the end zone after a 25-yard reception from Conklin and on a seven-yard run by  Greg Lewis. Before that, McCallum kicked field goals of 21 and 40 yards.  </P> <P> Washington was ranked 11th in the nation a week ago before losing, 17-14, to  Arizona in its Pac-10 opener.  </P></p>

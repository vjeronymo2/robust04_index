			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACKETEER WHO BLINDED FINANCIER GETS 33 YEARS  </P> <P> Los Angeles racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello, a reputed underboss in the  Milano organized crime family, was sentenced to 33 years in prison Friday for  shooting and blinding an Orange County topless bar financier.  </P> <P> C. William Carroll, shot three times in the head while in a Costa Mesa parking  garage in 1987, told Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. before the  sentencing in Santa Ana, "I can't see justice done, but I can hear it.  </P> <P> I would like to hear it today."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contended that Rizzitello, 62, tried to kill Carroll, 58, because  he saw him as a roadblock in the racketeer's attempt to take over the  now-defunct Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Rizzitello has a long history of racketeering-related arrests and convictions.  He was one of five people convicted in Los Angeles in 1980 in a major federal  organized crime case for which he received a five-year prison term. But he had  also been acquitted in three major cases since then -- two involving fraud  charges and one involving a possible attempt to kill a government witness.  </P> <P> Flynn sentenced Rizzitello to 25 years to life in prison for conspiracy to  commit first-degree murder. He then added three years for great bodily injury  to Carroll, two years for use of a firearm and another three years because  Rizzitello was a convicted felon with a firearm.  </P> <P> On Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told the court that it was  "a miracle that this was not a completed execution. There's no doubt that when  the Legislature set up this kind of sentence for this crime, it was with  someone like (Rizzitello) in mind."  </P></p>

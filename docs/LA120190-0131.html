			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN YOUTH'S DEATH AT CONCERT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office on Friday cleared Inglewood  police of any wrongdoing in the death of an Orange County teen-ager who was  forcibly arrested last Dec. 10 outside a Grateful Dead concert at the Forum.  </P> <P> District attorney investigators said the officer who had used a carotid  chokehold to subdue Patrick Shanahan, 19, of Fountain Valley did not commit  criminal homicide.  </P> <P> An autopsy said Shanahan died of "compression of the neck during restraint."  The report also found a high level of LSD in his blood and bruises over his  body.  </P> <P> After subduing Shanahan with the chokehold, officers tied his ankles with a  nylon rope, handcuffed him and carried him to a police car, investigators said.  There, police discovered he had stopped breathing and brought him to nearby  Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  </P> <P> William Shanahan, Patrick's father, said he is "very disappointed" by the  report. "There is a lot of conflict between the police version and the witness  version of what happened," William Shanahan said.  </P> <P> The family has filed a wrongful death suit against the city.  </P> <P> Police discounted reports from numerous witnesses who said they saw officers  beating Shanahan with their nightsticks.  </P> <P> Police acknowledged using force against the UC Santa Barbara student but they  said it was necessary to defend themselves and to subdue the youth.  </P> <P> The district attorney's report agreed, saying officers "had a legal right and  duty" to arrest Shanahan and "the use by a single officer of a carotid hold" to  help subdue Shanahan did not amount to a criminal homicide.  </P> <P> Describing the situation, Inglewood police spokesman Sgt. Harold Moret said:  "You've got several hundred people on hallucinogenic drugs . . . four or five  incidents happening at one time . . . officers were using whatever force was  necessary . . . (with) guys that were blasted out of their minds on  hallucinogenic drugs."  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / A new verse in the ballad of Southgate SIR Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, has been singing the same song for so long that he would probably be as grateful as his audience if he could move on to the next number. The song, an interminable ballad, is about how he sold many of the family's tarnished treasures - the businesses he inherited from the group's founder Sir Jules Thorn - to devote himself to his real loves: making music and renting out television sets. The tune some of his followers long to hear is how he made them richer by splitting the remaining music and rentals businesses into two companies. Although the sale of Thorn's light fittings division for Pounds 162m yesterday could bring that day closer, it is still probably years rather than months away. Even then, some think Sir Colin should carry on humming his old tune. The case for demerger, they argue, is far from overwhelming. Both of Thorn's principal businesses require further development before they can go their separate ways. It is also uncertain that they would be awarded higher stock market ratings separately than together. Thorn EMI has sold off more than 60 businesses since 1985, including the television manufacturer Ferguson, the semiconductor producer Inmos, and Kenwood, the kitchen appliance maker. The decision to concentrate on music and rentals was made in 1990, when Sir Colin announced he was selling the lighting division, the group's first business set up by Sir Jules in 1928. After a proposed sale to GTE fell through, the light bulbs and tubes business was sold to General Electric of the US, with Thorn EMI holding on to the light fittings side. Yesterday's announcement leaves the group with just one division, Thorn Security &amp; Electronics, still for sale. Disposing of it would leave the group free to concentrate on the rentals sector, in which it is the world's leading company, and music, in which it is one of the three biggest. It could also then decide whether there is any sense in the two businesses belonging to the same group. Sir Colin does not deny reports that he is talking to the General Electric Company of the UK about the sale of Thorn's defence business, but he points out that this is only one part of the security and electronics division. There is also an electronic fire detection and security side. Thorn also has a business which has made automatic fare collection systems for British Rail and the Seoul Metro and which makes credit cards for US banks. Sir Colin says that while he would like to sell all three parts of the security and electronics division, they are unlikely to go to the same buyer. Until they have all been sold, which could take a few years, demerger cannot be considered. Sir Colin wants to see the music division expanding in the US, where it has a market share of 11-12 per cent, compared with 15 per cent worldwide. In the rental business Thorn is still attempting to introduce the concept of rent-to-own in the UK. Unlike hire purchase, this allows renters to change or return appliances they no longer want, but still holds out the possibility of ownership after a certain period of rental. Sir Colin does not pretend that there are any managerial reasons for having music and rentals in the same group. Demerger, however, can only be considered when the remaining peripheral businesses have gone. He says: 'I don't think it's inevitable. The answer can only come when we sit down and value the businesses.' Analysts are divided about the desirability of a demerger. Mr Mark Finnie of NatWest Securities says: 'As long as EMI Music remains part of Thorn EMI it remains undervalued. Demerger could quite conceivably happen in the next couple of years.' Direct comparison of stock market ratings is difficult. PolyGram, the music company with which Thorn EMI is most often compared, is not quoted in London and is 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands. But Mr Bruce Jones, of Smith New Court, argues: 'To justify a split, you'd have to point to some fancy ratings.' He adds that the music industry is not the attraction it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Sony of Japan bought CBS, the US record company, and Matsushita bought MCA.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The changing shape of Thorn EMI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main disposals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1985-1990: - More than 60 businesses sold, including:          - Ferguson, TV maker (1987)          - Inmos, semiconductors (1989)          - Kenwood, kitchen appliances (1989)          - Lighting, one of the original businesses (1990)      1991: - Software      1992: - Rumblelows shops converted to rental outlets      1993: - 59% stake in Thames Television sold          - Light fittings  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main acquisitions  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      1987: - Rent-A-Center, US      1989: - SBK music      1992: - Virgin Music  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What's left  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          - Music          - Rentals          - HMV music shops          - Thorn Security &amp; Electronics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

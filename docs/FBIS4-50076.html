			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- At a meeting with  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir at the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse this afternoon, President Jiang Zemin stressed the  importance of stability, saying China's stability is not only  requisite for its own development, but will also benefit the  stability and prosperity of Asia and the world in general.    In the meeting, the Chinese president and the Malaysian  prime  minister said they were delighted at seeing each other again.  Jiang Zemin said: "Your Excellency's second visit to China  coincides with the 20th anniversary of the establishment of  Sino-Malaysian diplomatic relations. Bilateral ties have gained  overall expansion in the past two decades, with fruitful  cooperation in the political, economic, science and technology,  and cultural fields. The traditional friendship between the  Chinese and Malaysian peoples continues to expand, while vast  potential exists for bilateral cooperation." He added:  "Continuous expansion of such relations will not only promote  common prosperity of the two countries, but will also serve to  enhance regional economic cooperation."    The Chinese president said: "Your Excellency remarked during  the visit to China last year that political stability is an  important factor for economic development. This makes a lot of  sense and we have good knowledge about that. China needs  stability, and so does Asia and the world in general. This is a  crucially important issue. Looking in retrospect at the  political disturbance between the spring and summer of 1989, if  resolute measures were not taken then, China would not enjoy  today's stability. A bad thing has been turned into a good  thing, and as a result, our reform and opening program has  forged ahead with steadier, better, and even quicker steps, and  our advantages have been brought into fuller play." History  shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good.  In the past five years, China has enjoyed economic development,  social stability, and the improved livelihood of the people,  thanks to our consistent efforts to take stability as an  overriding priority. Facts prove this is absolutely correct.    Jiang Zemin emphasized: Stability forms a prerequisite and  reform serves as a driving force, while development represents  the goal. The three factors interact to promote each other.  The importance of ensuring lasting national stability has  become a common understanding of all the Chinese people. The  stability of China is not only needed for China's own  development, but will also benefit the stability and prosperity  of Asia and the world in general. That is because the stability  of China, a big country with a close to 1.2 billion population,  is of international significance. In the past decade and more,  the stability and development of China has not only brought  benefits to its own people, but contributed to world peace and  development as well.    On the regional situation, Jiang Zemin noted: The current  situation in Asia is generally good, with relative political  stability, sustained economic development, and constantly  improving regional security. Further efforts to safeguard and  promote regional peace and development reflect an issue that has  won attention from leaders of Asian nations. He said: "We are  ready to work with Malaysia and other Asian countries towards  peace and development in Asia."    Mahathir said: Since the visit to China last year, he has  been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in and expand  trade with China. Malaysia is satisfied with the steady growth  of economic and trade ties with China.    The Malaysian prime minister also told Jiang Zemin that  during his meeting with U.S. President Clinton shortly before he  came to China, he stressed his opposition to imposing one's own  views upon others and to using the issue of Most-Favored-Nation  trading status to exert pressure on China.    According to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the meeting  proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Vice Foreign  Minister Tang Jiaxuan, assistant to the minister Wang Yinggan,  and Malaysian Ambassador to China Adenan [name as received] were  present at the meeting.    After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of  Mahathir and his party.</p>

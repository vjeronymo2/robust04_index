			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC expected to lift meat import ban THE EUROPEAN Commission is expected to lift its ban on imports of meat and dairy products from Central and East Europe today, but controls are likely to remain on livestock from Poland and Croatia. The European Community has been negotiating with 18 eastern European states to produce tighter controls on export certificates following a foot-and-mouth scare in Italy. Most have responded with new controls, but Poland is understood to have voiced reservations about the EC's request to impose a 14-day quarantine on live animals. EC officials said yesterday that restrictions on Polish dairy imports would be lifted, while the ban on Croatian imports would continue because of concern about the effectiveness of local controls. EC farm ministers have failed to agree farm prices and milk quotas for 1993-94 despite a strong effort by the Danish presidency to reach agreement in Luxembourg. Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, criticising the Danish package as too generous, urged a more modest settlement.</p>

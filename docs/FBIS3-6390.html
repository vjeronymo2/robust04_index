Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna:    [Begin Cha recording] The IAEA has concluded that the recent  inspection of North Korea is unsatisfactory [manjok suropchi  motada].    In an unofficial Board of Governors meeting urgently  convened  yesterday [16 March], Director-General Hans Blix revealed that  North Korea refused to allow the inspection team to conduct  various activities, including the extraction of sample materials  from the radiochemical laboratory which is a core target of the  current inspection. Thus, the IAEA director-general said that  the IAEA could not examine whether or not nuclear material was  diverted for other purposes and that the possibility of  additional plutonium production in North Korea cannot be  excluded.    During this inspection, North Korea refused any extraction  by  the the inspection team of sample material from the plutonium  refining facility. In addition, it refused to allow inspection  activities surveying (the ?uniformity) of radioactivity in many  parts of the radiochemical laboratory. Therefore, the suspicion  of additional plutonium production by North Korea has been  raised.    The IAEA concluded that North Korea's breaking of the  agreement it previously made by refusing inspections of its core  facilities is a serious situation. Thus, the IAEA decided to  convene a special Board of Governors meeting on 21 March with  the consent of member states of the Board of Governors.    At the special Board of Governors meeting on 21 March, the  IAEA will urge North Korea to sincerely fulfill the nuclear  accords, will adopt a resolution on sanctions against North  Korea, and will report the inspection result to the UN Security  Council.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters noted that the word ``qualifications'' was either misleading or redundant and that the word ``policies'' or ``procedural requirements'' would be more appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The word ``qualifications'' in the definition, which is the same definition as that used in previous regulations, does not refer to either policies or procedural requirements. Rather, it refers in general to the various requirements for accreditation that an accrediting agency might have. For example, an institution located in New York might meet all of the accreditation standards of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), but it is ineligible for accreditation by NEASC because it is not located in New England.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The term ``qualifications'' has been replaced by the term ``requirements.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Adverse Accrediting Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter felt the definition could be strengthened to ensure that agencies had a variety of useful sanctions, the application of which were not automatically appealable under &sect;602.28(a)(5). Another felt that the term should be uniformly defined by all accrediting agencies to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding arising from the use of different definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of these regulations, the Secretary has defined the term ``adverse accrediting action'' to include, as a minimum, those actions initiated by an accrediting agency that result in an institution or program losing its accreditation. However, the Secretary believes accrediting agencies should be free both to define other actions they consider to be adverse accrediting actions and to establish other sanctions that are not automatically appealable by the institution or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Branch Campus <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, commenters expressed concern that the definition of ``branch campus'' was inconsistent with its use in &sect;602.27 and that there was no statutory basis for including ``additional locations'' in the requirement for special actions by accrediting agencies when an institution opened a branch campus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under 498(j) of the HEA, the Secretary is charged with defining the term ``branch campus'' for purposes of Title IV of the HEA. Generally, when the Secretary defines a term, the term is defined in the same manner for any and every Title IV, HEA purpose. Accordingly, the Secretary adopted the definition of the term ``branch campus'' that was proposed in the Institutional Eligibility regulations, 34 CFR Part 600, in the proposed accreditation regulations. However, the Secretary realized that particular definition was too narrow to carry out the purposes of sections 496(c) (2) and (3) of the HEA, under which an institution that establishes a branch campus must file a business plan with its accrediting agency and the agency must conduct a site visit at the branch campus within six months of its establishment. Therefore, in &sect;602.27 of the NPRM, the Secretary imposed the requirements relating to branch campus on ``additional locations'' as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For program and administrative reasons, the Secretary has determined to keep the narrow definition of the term ``branch campus'' in the Institutional Eligibility regulations. However, the Secretary has adopted a different definition of ``branch campus'' for these regulations because that different definition is more in keeping with the statutory requirements of section 496(c). The Secretary believes this different definition is preferable because it provides assurances to students who enroll at any location of an institution that offers a substantial portion of an educational program that the location has the resources to operate, and is operating, in compliance with accrediting agency standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition has been revised to include locations that meet the definition of this term in 34 CFR 600.2, which is basically the same definition as in the NPRM, and any other locations at which an institution offers at least 50 percent of an educational program. Section 602.27 has been revised to eliminate any reference to ``additional location.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Prebaccalaureate Vocational Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary received numerous comments on the definition of this term and the corresponding term, ``vocational education.'' Many commenters believed there was no statutory basis for the distinctions in the NPRM and that the use of the term improperly targeted a particular segment of higher education for burdensome and unwarranted sanctions. Among commenters who expressed an opinion on the various definitions under consideration, responses were divided. Some preferred a definition that excluded any type of vocational education that led to a degree, while others felt the definition should include all prebaccalaureate vocational education regardless of the credential awarded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See discussion below under ``vocational education.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The term ``prebaccalaureate vocational education'' has been deleted from the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Representative of the Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary received two suggestions for changing this definition. One was to allow members of the governing board of affiliated nonprofit institutions to represent the public. The other was to exclude close relatives of students or employees at affiliated institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that members of the governing board of affiliated non-profit institutions can make valuable contributions to an accrediting agency but should not do so in the capacity of a representative of the public. The Secretary also believes the exclusion of spouses, parents, children, and siblings of employees of affiliated institutions is appropriate and that the exclusion ought to extend to close relatives of other individuals listed in the definition. On the other hand, the Secretary believes students, who are the consumers in this instance, and their families can serve a useful role as representatives of the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition has been revised to exclude close relatives of individuals listed in the definition from serving as representatives of the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

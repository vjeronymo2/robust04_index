			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Euro-cavalry comes to workers' rescue: The judgments on employees' rights could give legal clout to staff associations Yesterday's two judgments from the European Court of Justice - on the right of workers to be consulted about redundancies and business transfers - go to the heart of the UK debate about European labour law. Employer bodies such as the Institute of Directors say a decision on whether to consult workers is a typical example of the kind of measure that should be decided at national, not European, level. They add that such European labour law hits British employers much harder than employers in other countries, because the laws tend to reflect the continental European system of labour relations and not the more laissez-faire British one. Trade unionists, and other supporters of the European social dimension, say that consulting workers is merely civilised practice and one which is backed by law in every European Union country apart from Britain. Allowing bad employers not to consult employees encourages a downward spiral of standards. But what will yesterday's judgments on consultation actually require from the government and from companies? What it will not do is give unions a statutory right to recognition, or introduce 'works councils' into every British workplace. In the 1975 Collective Redundancies directive and the 1977 Acquired Rights directives there is a requirement to inform and consult employee representatives. When those directives were transposed into British law the requirement was restricted to companies which recognise unions. That will no longer be sufficient. The government, which was yesterday playing down the changes as a 'technicality', will probably merely introduce legislation requiring employers to consult employees, leaving the details of how to do so to employers themselves. As a result of the decline in union membership and collective bargaining, the employers which do have union representatives to consult in transfers or redundancies - or in the similarly organised health and safety committees - are probably now in a minority. But that does not mean that other employers have no mechanism for consultation. Organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Personnel Management have long recommended institutionalised consultation where unions do not exist. Many companies have staff associations, or other systems such as team briefings, which could become the focus of consultation. A senior manager of one large non-union service sector company said: 'We are not particularly concerned about these judgments because we already have a whole range of systems for informing and consulting with people.' The debate now will focus on the minimum that an employer can get away with. Will a discussion procedure with the employees affected suffice, or will a committee have to be established, albeit one which could be dissolved as soon as the consultation has taken place? If such a committee is required, will employees have to be elected independently or could the employer simply select them? According to Mr Fraser Younson of the Employment Lawyers' Association, the requirement in European law to 'consult with a view to reaching agreement' means that it will not be sufficient to inform employees individually and give them an opportunity to respond. And if a committee mechanism is established for consultation then it may well take on a life of its own. Mr Younson also speculated that the requirement to inform and consult might extend into health-and-safety areas, such as the recent maternity directive or working time directive. 'This could have huge implications for virtually all workplaces,' he said. At the other end of the spectrum, Ms Cherry Mill of the Institute of Personnel Managers speculated that it might be sufficient for line managers to give small groups of workers the news through team briefing-type systems or even through electronic mail. 'You have to go back and look at the intention of the directives. They were not designed to establish new industrial relations systems but rather to prepare workers for forthcoming events and give them an opportunity to have a say; something that is the practice already in most good companies,' said Ms Mill. If the amendments do turn out to have a lasting impact on consultation systems it will not necessarily be to the benefit of British unions. It could rather help to nudge the UK closer towards the European model, based in most countries on statutory employee rights, not union rights. That will be little compensation to employers who see such changes as introducing unnecessary bureaucracy. But the biggest beneficiaries in the long run may be the Cinderellas of employee consultation - the non-union staff associations.</p>

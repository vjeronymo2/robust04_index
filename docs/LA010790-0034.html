			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'NO DEAL' ON NORIEGA, BUSH SAYS;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S NOT SEEKING A PLEA BARGAIN FOR THE FORMER  PANAMANIAN LEADER. HE VOWED TO 'BEND OVER BACKWARD' TO ENSURE A FAIR TRIAL.  </P> <P> President Bush said Friday he is "not seeking a deal" on a reduced charge for  Manuel A. Noriega and vowed to "bend over backward" to avoid saying anything  that would interfere with the deposed Panamanian ruler's trial.  </P> <P> "Our case is strong, our resolve is firm and our legal representations are  sound," Bush told a nationally televised news conference after discussing  Noriega's prosecution on drug-trafficking charges with Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh.  </P> <P> Bush also announced he is dispatching Vice President Dan Quayle on a  fence-mending tour of Latin America "within the next several days" to explain  the U.S. military action and muster support for the new Panamanian government  of President Guillermo Endara.  </P> <P> Conceding the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama had upset U.S. allies in Central  and South America, the President said: "I am concerned, because I am well aware  of how our friends south of our border . . . look at the use of American force  anywhere."  </P> <P> But, he added, "I think it's something that's correctable."  </P> <P> Bush said he has "no immediate plans" to visit Panama. However, an  Administration official, who declined to be identified, said that a  presidential visit is under consideration and that Panama might also be  included on Quayle's itinerary.  </P> <P> The President called Panama's economy "a major priority" to help it recover  from the U.S. military invasion and economic sanctions. He did not put a price  tag on the U.S. aid, but some estimates for the damage have run as high as $2  billion.  </P> <P> Even as he savored Noriega's capture, Bush said he would be "ever mindful" of  the legal process from now on, suggesting he would refrain from his previous  characterizations of Noriega as a "thug" and a criminal.  </P> <P> "He is now in custody. Time for rhetoric is over," he said.  </P> <P> Bush said he is convinced that Noriega will get a fair trial. "I am going to  bend over backward and not answer hypothetical questions or not do anything  that might prejudice that," he said.  </P> <P> With Noriega securely in U.S. custody in Florida, Bush said he hopes to bring  U.S. combat troops home from Panama "as soon as possible." But he refused to  give a timetable.  </P> <P> Still, he ruled out a long-term peacekeeping role for U.S. troops. "I'd like to  see their police forces, whatever emerges, reconstituted," Bush said. Noriega's  Panamanian Defense Forces were routed in the U.S. military action.  </P> <P> Bush said the 12,000 troops stationed at U.S. bases in Panama before the  invasion will be left there, but will not serve a police role.  </P> <P> About 2,900 combat troops were brought home last week, leaving about 24,500  military personnel, according to the Pentagon.  </P> <P> In an opening statement at his news conference, Bush said: "Our government is  not seeking a deal with Noriega. Our policy remains that we have brought him to  this country for prosecution."  </P> <P> "We are committed to a fair trial and to providing all the protections  guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws," Bush  </P> <P> added.  </P> <P> Asked if he would rule out a plea bargain with Noriega -- perhaps offering  reduced charges in exchange for Noriega's information on drug-trafficking --  Bush said: "I'm not ruling it in."  </P> <P> He added: "I'm just saying he's got his rights and . . . we ought not to stand  up here and try to define narrowly what they are."  </P> <P> In Miami, Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said Noriega is not interested in a  plea bargain. "A man who is innocent is not receptive to any plea bargain.  General Noriega is not guilty of any of these charges."  </P> <P> Noriega refused to answer the charges against him at a brief arraignment last  week, and the federal judge in his case entered a not-guilty plea on his  behalf. The general remained in custody at an undisclosed location Friday.  </P> <P> Bush dismissed as "ridiculous" a question on whether the invasion of Panama and  surrender of Noriega had become a "political jackpot" for him.  </P> <P> "A President's called on to take certain actions. We're not going in to try to  furbish a political image," he said.  </P> <P> Even so, Bush was asked if the action would silence Senate Majority Leader  George Mitchell's criticism that Bush had a timid foreign policy. "Knowing  George, he'll find a way. And that's his job. Look, we're going into an  election year."  </P> <P> An aide to the Maine Democrat, Diane Dewhirst, said: "Sen. Mitchell has  consistently said that when he agrees with Bush on foreign policy he will be  vigorously supportive and that when he disagrees he will offer constructive  alternatives. That has not changed."  </P> <P> Bush took the unusual step of ending his news conference with a complaint to  television networks about coverage of his last news conference, on Dec. 21. He  protested that some networks juxtaposed his lighthearted banter with reporters  with pictures of bodies of U.S. servicemen killed in Panama being unloaded from  a transport plane.  </P> <P> "I could understand why the viewers were concerned about this," Bush said.  "They thought that their President at a solemn moment like that didn't give a  damn."  </P> <P> His voice choking, Bush said: "And I do, I do; I feel it so strongly."  </P> <P> In other comments, the President:  </P> <P> * Said he did not envision a change in U.S. policy against intentionally  sending military women into combat, although he would weigh such a  recommendation if presented to him by the Pentagon. He praised the "heroic  performance" of a "highly trained, gung-ho" group of women who did engage in  combat in the Panama action.  </P> <P> * Deplored the death of an American nun in Nicaragua, but refused to fix blame  on the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. He noted that the Contras had denied a role,  but he added: "It is extraordinarily murky."  </P> <P> * Defended anew two secret missions to China by National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft, saying "there has been progress" toward reform as a result of the  visits.  </P></p>

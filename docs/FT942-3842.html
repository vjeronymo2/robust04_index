			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Mr Blair looks for renewal Mr Tony Blair is the likely winner of the Labour leadership contest. He is also the most suited to the task. Five candidates have presented themselves. It is striking that four of them, all improbable victors, are from the left of the party. Mr Denzil Davies and Mr Ken Livingstone are mavericks. The weightier pair, Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott, have put themselves down for deputy as well as leader, a prudent insurance against losing the real prize, since neither is possessed of the leadership qualities the party needs. Mrs Beckett has proved her credentials as a competent administrator, a reliable second-in-command, but that may be all she has to offer. Mr Prescott is the voice of Labour's past. It is therefore hardly surprising that half the parliamentary party and the overwhelming majority of the shadow cabinet have declared their support for Mr Blair. The two other thirds of the party's internal electorate - its members in trade unions and its members at large - have yet to be consulted, but the general expectation is that they will follow the pattern set by their elected representatives. They will vote for Mr Blair if they want Labour to win. Some will do so with misgivings. At 41 his inexperience will be called in evidence against him, but his very newness is also an asset. As he showed in his interview with the Financial Times on Saturday, he has mastered a coherent set of generalisations within which a credible Labour policy might be developed. He has given the pro-market thinking of the 1980s an overlay of social responsibility, affirming that the individual and community strengthen one another. He has captured the theme of family values from the Conservatives. To call this 'renewal' may strike a chord with the electorate. Freedom to reposition This gives Mr Blair a freedom to reposition his party that his predecessors lacked. 'It is positively in the public interest to have a dynamic market economy,' he told the FT. Echoing President Clinton, he tackled another logjam of left-wing thinking with: 'We want a nation at work and not a nation on benefit.' As to state ownership, he said that 'most people would not regard it as a sensible expenditure of money . . . that you renationalise the water industry'. He defined full employment in the careful words of the 1944 white paper. Radical moderniser Astutely put as they are, such statements merely set a tone; there is room within them for Mr Blair to be the radical moderniser Labour needs, but there is also room for fudge and muddle. Mr Blair evokes a sense of mission, but he cannot rest on that. Before long he will have to provide specific answers to questions about Labour policy. Having grown up during the Thatcher ascendancy, Mr Blair is aware that the greatest British politician of his own lifetime approached her first election victory, in 1979, in comparable political circumstances. Mrs Thatcher resolutely avoided specific commitments, preferring to speak about values and principles. In present circumstances, Mr Blair would be unwise to regard this as a sufficient approach. The late Mr John Smith believed in keeping quiet while the Conservatives tore themselves apart; had he lived he would have focused on policy at the October 1995 party conference, in readiness for an election the following year. Mr Blair should begin to fill in the blanks well before that, between now and this year's conference. The list of gaps is large: strategic clarity on Europe, a sense of what he means by modernising the welfare state, an indication of where Labour proposes to draw the boundaries between public and private enterprise. His declaration of support for a dynamic market economy is meaningless unless he shows that he knows what it would take to sustain it. Leadership may be about broad perspectives and aspirations. Mr Blair is showing himself skilled at offering them. But in the post-Communist world there are no single ideological solutions. Specific, often technical, policies are required. The new Labour leader must use the crest of the wave on which he is now riding to drive his party's thinking forward. He must show soon that his leadership will involve believable social, economic and fiscal strategies. Without them the present expectant mood could quickly change.</p>

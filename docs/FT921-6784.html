			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (1): Consolidation not expansion - Self-preservation is the watchword for financial institutions as they count the cost of the recession and brace themselves for stiffer competition in the European single market AS THE final countdown to the establishment of a single market in the European community begins, there is a distinct lack of excitement among many of Europe's financial and investment companies. Grandiose plans to expand all over Europe are out of fashion. Even the strongest and most ambitious financial firms - such as Germany's Deutsche Bank and the UK's Barclays Bank - are consolidating their existing European networks rather than aggressively acquiring new operations. Most financial institutions are tending their gardens. Their preoccupation in the short term is with preserving core domestic operations, which became over-extended during the late Eighties and are now suffering the ill-effects of a widespread recession. In many cases, their capital resources have been depleted by losses and they need to enhance their profits to rebuild their balance sheets. Paradoxically, this preoccupation with domestic markets is a response to proposals for European political and economic integration. Over the coming years there will be increasing competition between financial institutions based in different member countries, which will reduce the ability of these institutions to make near-monopoly profits from exploiting closed domestic markets. So, companies are doing their utmost to increase the efficiency of their home operations to withstand this new competition. Banks, insurance companies and securities companies are all making severe cuts in their labour forces. Indeed, rival institutions are carrying out similar cost-cutting plans dreamed up by a handful of international management consultancies. There is therefore a growing awareness that cutting costs is not sufficient. It is a zero sum game if every institution is doing the same. Long-term competitive advantage will be won by those which succeed in improving their management and financial controls, which are often crude compared to industrial companies' controls. The background to many banks' long-term problems - notably those in the UK and France - is that for the past few years they have used the big profits from their retail operations, serving personal customers, to cross-subsidise other businesses such as securities trading, lending to companies and a range of overseas operations. Because these profits were so big, banks were under little pressure to 'unbundle' the range of corporate and personal services they provided, to measure precisely how much capital was tied up in particular parts of the business and thus their profitability. But the magnitude of these cross-subsidies has become apparent in the wake of big losses recorded by banks in northern Europe on their lending to companies, notably property companies. Substantial loan losses on corporate lending have been a feature of recent results disclosed by UK, French and Scandinavian banks. Many of these banks would be in serious difficulties without the bedrock of retail banking profits. One management issue for banks is how to improve controls over lending, to ensure they do not lend too much to dubious customers. However, progress in that respect will not be sufficient to guarantee a prosperous future for banks, since even retail banking profits are now under threat. They have traditionally earned big profits by investing the interest-free deposits of personal customers. But over the past few years, banks - particularly those in the UK - have begun to pay interest on current or cheque accounts. This has led to an inexorable decline in the profitability of high street banking, which is likely to affect banks throughout the EC as legal barriers to competition are removed. Technological change will reinforce this squeeze on retail profits. Branchless banking is already established in the UK, in the form of Midland Bank's First Direct subsidiary. If individuals become accustomed to doing much of their banking by telephone or using automated teller machines, then a bank should be able to expand relatively inexpensively, without acquiring branches. The bottom line is that an enduring competitive advantage will be won by banks which succeed in analysing the costs and profitability of the many different products and services they provide. They could then use their capital to back only those businesses whose profitability is adequate. Lloyds Bank in the UK has already demonstrated the benefits of such a strategy. In the Eighties, it eschewed low margin international lending and made no significant investment in securities trading, unlike its UK rivals. As a result, its value on the stock market is greater than all its domestic rivals other than Barclays, even though its balance sheet is around half the size of National Westminster Bank's. In a similar way, Europe's insurance companies are being forced to concentrate on improving their core underwriting operations and increasing their efficiency. Just as banks subsidised lending to commercial customers with profits from retail operations, so insurance companies have sustained loss-making commercial risks business - in which they insure the risks of large companies - with profits from their personal lines business and income from their investments. However, in the past five years competition across the board has increased substantially, depressing premium levels and increasing underwriting losses. Medium-sized players such as the French mutual companies and newcomers such as the UK's Direct Line, a Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, have undercut slower moving market leaders by selling direct to the public and reducing distribution costs. A number of companies - such as AGF and Axa of France - are already chasing the business of Europe's biggest companies aggressively. In addition, the recently agreed EC 'non-life directives' pave the way for much sharper pan-European competition. At the same time the downturn in the equity and property markets means income from investments and realised capital gains has declined. The fall in asset values has also damaged the industry's traditionally strong balance sheets. So, today there is an increased emphasis on calculating the risk on policies and setting premiums accordingly. A separate preoccupation of all financial institutions is to ensure the fairness of EC rules governing pan-European competition. Many securities firms, for example, are concerned that a forthcoming capital adequacy directive, laying down conditions on the strength of balance sheets, will increase costs unnecessarily - and perhaps give an advantage to banks which carry out securities trading business in competition with pure securities firms. Finally, financial institutions are making plans to remodel their businesses to take advantage of the expected monetary union in Europe. The most obvious effect of a single European currency on banks would be to deprive them of some of their lucrative foreign exchange trading business. A single currency would be accompanied by a single benchmark price for investment products throughout the EC in the form of a common base lending rate. This would bolster the trend, already noted, to pan-European competition in retail banking and insurance services. So a common theme for the Nineties is emerging. If expansion was the aim of most financial institutions in the Eighties, self-preservation is the watchword of today.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Kohl to hold talks on nuclear power GERMANY'S leading electricity generators are to hold talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl this month, to try to break the political deadlock over the future of nuclear power generation. Two of the biggest power station operators, RWE and Veba, have been holding talks with the opposition Social Democrats, represented by Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony. Both operators denied yesterday that they were contemplating abandoning all nuclear power generation, as reported yesterday in the German media. However they are refusing to commission any new nuclear power stations until a political consensus has been reached. Mr Schroder confirmed in Hanover that he had talked to Mr Klaus Piltz of Veba and Mr Friedhelm Gieske of RWE. One proposal to emerge from the talks was a switch from the present system of nuclear fuel reprocessing - in France - to one of direct disposal and storage, he said. Mr Schroder also said there was a possibility of keeping nuclear energy as part of a combination of power sources, including coal and gas-fired power stations, but only if safer nuclear technologies could be developed. That concession was immediately welcomed by the German government as a significant move by the opposition, possibly opening the way for a cross-party consensus on nuclear power generation. RWE and Veba yesterday said they wanted to include nuclear energy in power options, stressing that nuclear power stations were the only ones which did not produce carbon dioxide emissions. However they also said that they would not be commissioning any new power stations until a political consensus on future regulations had been agreed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Human </F> Rights and the Hypocrisy of the Imperialist West"]    [Text] The recent statement by Dr. Muhammad al-Mas'ari, one  of the founders of the Committee in Defense of Legitimate Rights  in Saudi Arabia, in which he said that "Saudi Arabia's record of  violation of human rights is the worst in the world" reveals the  extent of political hypocrisy the imperialist West is practicing  concerning the subject of human rights on the international  level.    This is because this committee, which includes several Saudi  lawyers, academics, and men of religion who oppose persecution,  corruption, and violation of human rights in Saudi Arabia and  whose members are subjected to various forms of murder,  imprisonment, torture, and pursuit, is crying out day and night,  collecting evidences and facts, and presenting documents on the  Saudi regime's violations of human rights. Yet the imperialist  West turns a deaf ear to these violations and laments human  rights in other countries where individuals live in dignity and  honor and work for their countries' development and progress.    For instance, we hear Max Van Der Stoel [UN rapporteur on  Iraqi human rights] howling about alleged human rights  violations in Iraq and Sudan, yet he and his overlords know that  human rights are violated only in countries under imperialist  domination, and that the Saudi regime provides one of the  outstanding examples of real and serious violation of human  rights.    The human rights committee in Saudi Arabia strives to  achieve  certain basic demands for the individual, and one would assume  that these demands are achievable at any time and place.  However, the savageness of the Saudi regime and the imperialist  regimes' condoning of the savageness and tyranny to which  individuals are exposed in Saudi Arabia has encouraged Fahd's  regime to continue persecuting the Arab masses there.    Human rights standards are supposed to be the same  everywhere  in the world. They are also supposed to be harmonious with the  World Declaration of Human Rights and other UN conventions and  to be applied correctly, not selectively. Therefore, violating  these rights in Saudi Arabia and lamenting them in Iraq, Sudan,  and other countries, as Van Der Stoel and others in the U.S.  State Department would have it, is unacceptable under any  circumstances. Moreover, they cannot convince anyone and their  actions cannot but be disapproved and ridiculed by all free men  in the world.    A review of the world's record on human rights will reveal  many Western scandals in this regard. The imperialist West  defends the most oppressive and terroristic regimes in the  world. It defends the Zionist entity, which kills Arabs en  masse, plunges them into prisons and detention camps, blows up  their homes, burns their farms and plantations, and expels them  from their country, Palestine. The imperialist West also  defends the Saudi regime, which throws strugglers into prisons  or drops them from planes to be devoured by ravenous beasts in  the desert. The Saudi regime also bans the freedom of speech  and the establishment of political parties. Saudi Arabia has  not witnessed any real parliamentary system expressing the  demands and aspirations of the Arab people in the Arabian  Peninsula. Furthermore, the Saudi regime is not known to  respect public opinion.    This Western political hypocrisy expresses the barbaric  mentality of imperialism and its disregard for human rights when  the matter concerns those who are outside the circle of  imperialist domination. This is well understood by  freedom-loving peoples, which is why they are always struggling  to achieve their basic human rights away from the mentality and  aggressive plans of the imperialists, who only care about their  interests and commercial markets; indeed, everything commercial.</p>

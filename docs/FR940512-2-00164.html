General Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background on Runaway and Homeless Youth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB), within the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), administers programs that support services to an adolescent population of approximately 1.3 million runaway and homeless youth. Many of these youth have left home to escape abusive situations, or because their parents could not provide them with the basic needs of food, shelter and a safe supportive environment. Many live on the streets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While living on the streets or away from home without parental supervision, these youth are highly vulnerable. They may become victims of street violence, or may be exploited by dealers of illegal drugs. Usually lacking marketable skills, they may be drawn into shoplifting, prostitution, and dealing drugs in order to earn money for food, clothing, and other daily expenses. Without a fixed address or regular place to sleep, they often drop out of school, forfeiting their opportunities to learn and to become independent, self-sufficient, contributing members of society. As street people, they may try to survive with little or no contact with medical professionals, the result being that their health problems may go untreated and may worsen. Without the support of family, schools, and other community institutions, they may not acquire the personal values and work skills that will enable them to enter or advance in the world of work at other than the most minimal levels. Finally, as street people, they may create substantial law enforcement problems, endangering both themselves and the communities in which they are located. All these problems, real and potential, call for a nationwide, community-based program to address the needs of runaway and homeless youth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

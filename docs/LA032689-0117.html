			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AUTO-TRUCK CRASH IN LANCASTER KILLS WOMAN, BOY, 5  </P> <P> A 28-year-old woman and a 5-year-old boy were killed Saturday when their car  was hit by a fast-moving pickup truck as the car attempted to cross a highway  in Lancaster.  </P> <P> The names of the victims, who authorities said may be from the same family,  were not immediately available because next of kin had not been notified.  </P> <P> A CHP spokeswoman said that the driver of the car, Hoang Hang, 24, of Los  Angeles, was crossing Sierra Highway on Avenue G at 9:15 a.m. when he pulled  out into the path of a pickup driven by Mike Goodwill, 24, of Rosamond.  Goodwill's truck was traveling at about 50 m.p.h. It was not clear whether Hang  had first stopped at a stop sign, the spokeswoman said. Both drivers suffered  major injuries.  </P> <P> Two other children were traveling in Hang's car. One, a 3-year-old girl,  suffered moderate injuries and was in serious but stable condition at the  Antelope Valley center. The other, a 7-year-old girl, suffered minor injuries  and was in stable condition at the Lancaster facility.  </P></p>

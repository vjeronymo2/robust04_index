			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Poll puts Labour at 50% and Conservatives at 26% Labour has the support of half of the electorate for the first time in nearly four years, says a poll carried out by ICM for today's Guardian. The poll puts Labour support at 50 per cent, up from 47 per cent last month. The Liberal Democrats are down 3 percentage points to 20 per cent. Conservative support is steady on 26 per cent. The poll suggests that government support was unaffected by the resignation of Mr Tim Yeo as environment minister after disclosures about an extramarital affair. However, the research was carried out before the resignation of the Earl of Caithness as transport minister following the death of his wife. The poll gives Labour its highest share since April 1990, at the height of the controversy over the council tax. The 1990 poll convinced Labour leaders that the party was likely to win the 1992 general election - but the lead had gone by then. Labour, with 25 per cent, was regarded as having the best economic policies. The Tories scored 20 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 8 per cent. ICM interviewed 1,460 adults in 103 constituencies last Friday and Saturday. Labour's struggles, Page 24</p>

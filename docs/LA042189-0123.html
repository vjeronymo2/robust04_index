			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CELTICS ROUTED BY KNICKS  </P> <P> After a decade of contending for the NBA title, the Boston Celtics are going  into the final three days of the regular season battling to make the playoffs.  </P> <P> "We're not used to scrapping for a playoff spot, but that's the cards we've  been dealt," Robert Parish said after the New York Knicks routed the Celtics,  137-117, Thursday night in New York.  </P> <P> Mark Jackson scored 29 points for the Knicks, and Eddie Lee Wilkins, starting  in place of injured Patrick Ewing, got six during a 13-0 run at the start of  the second half that broke the game open.  </P> <P> New York extended an eight-point halftime lead to 82-61 in the third quarter as  Wilkins, averaging under four points a game, got free inside for three layups  during the 13-0 run.  </P> <P> Washington 100, Chicago 98 -- Ledell Eackles scored a career-high 28 points,  and John Williams added 21, rallying the Bullets to a win at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> Michael Jordan led Chicago with 30 points but had only four assists and five  rebounds, while committing six turnovers. Horace Grant scored 18 points for the  Bulls.  </P> <P> The Bullets used a 10-0 third-quarter run to cut a 65-54 deficit to one point  with 3:17 left in the period.  </P> <P> The Bulls led, 74-71, after three quarters, but the Bullets outscored them,  7-0, in the first two minutes of the fourth period.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 105, New Jersey 92 -- Hersey Hawkins hit his first 10 shots, and  the 76ers shot 69% at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> Philadelphia took the lead for good with a 13-2 spurt that broke a 13-13 tie in  the first period. Charles Barkley had five of his 15 points in the run, and  former Net Mike Gminski added four of his 19.  </P> <P> New Jersey drew within three points in the second quarter and was within 65-61  midway through the third. The 76ers then went on a 9-4 burst to pull away for  good.  </P> <P> Denver 136, San Antonio 113 -- Michael Adams scored 25 points, and the Nuggets  scored the first 18 points of the fourth quarter at Denver, snapping a  five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Fat Lever had 23 points and Alex English 22 as the Nuggets won their 19th  straight home game.  </P> <P> Denver led by as many as 18 points in the first half and held off a  second-quarter rally by the Spurs that cut the lead to 67-61 shortly before  halftime.  </P> <P> The 18-point spurt at the start of the fourth quarter gave the Nuggets a 122-92  lead.  </P> <P> Seattle 124, Portland 118 -- Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel each scored 31  points as the SuperSonics won at home and kept the Trail Blazers from clinching  a playoff berth.  </P> <P> Portland made a strong run in the fourth quarter despite the absence of center  Kevin Duckworth, who missed the game because of strep throat.  </P> <P> Jerome Kersey scored 30 points, Kevin Porter 28 and Clyde Drexler 21 for the  Trail Blazers.  </P></p>

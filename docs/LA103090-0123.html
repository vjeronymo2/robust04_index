			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNOCAL TO BOOST OIL DRILLING; FIRM CITES HIGHER REVENUE  </P> <P> Unocal Corp., citing higher crude oil revenue as a result of the Middle East  crisis, said Monday that it would speed up plans for drilling in North America,  joining a handful of other companies that have boosted oil spending since the  Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> Unocal said it would increase its 1990 North American development drilling  budget by 12%, or $33 million, to drill 93 new development oil wells in the  United States and Canada that were originally scheduled to be drilled in 1991.  </P> <P> With the announcement, Los Angeles-based Unocal joins companies such as Conoco  Inc. and Chevron Corp., who earlier announced plans to speed up some drilling  to take advantage of a windfall resulting from higher oil prices.  </P> <P> But analysts said the projects do not signal a widespread increase in U.S. oil  drilling activity as a result of the Middle East crisis. That's mainly because  most oil executives are reluctant to change long-term spending plans based on  what is perceived as a momentary run-up of crude prices.  </P> <P> "It's the anticipation of prices that focuses exploration (planning)," said  Robert Megill, a petroleum economist and former Exxon Corp. executive in  Houston. That means "prices five years down the road," he said.  </P> <P> Most industry executives expect crude oil prices to fall from their current  high levels once the crisis is resolved, removing the long-term financial  incentive for dramatic increases in U.S. drilling.  </P> <P> Unocal's stepped-up drilling plans "reflect the use of additional cash that's  coming into the upstream (exploration and development) part of the company  because of higher oil prices," said John F. Imle Jr., a Unocal senior vice  president.  </P> <P> But, he added, these are projects that were planned all along based on oil  price projections made before the Middle East crisis began. They are not  marginal projects that suddenly appear more attractive simply because prices  have jumped for now.  </P> <P> The 93 new wells, including 20 in California, are expected to increase the  company's net production of oil and liquids by 5,700 barrels a day by 1991.  </P> <P> Last week, Unocal Corp. reported that third-quarter earnings had risen 53% to  $121 million from $79 million in the like period a year earlier.  </P> <P> Other companies that have recently stepped up drilling include:  </P> <P> * Chevron, which in August said it would spend an additional $100 million in  1990 on domestic oil and natural gas production, an increase of about 10% over  its total U.S. exploration and production budget. The money would be used to  drill about 130 development wells in major existing oil fields in California,  Colorado, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.  </P> <P> * Conoco Inc., which said it would increase its 1990 exploration and production  budget by $10 million, to $540 million, to drill five new exploration wells in  the Gulf of Mexico that had been originally scheduled in 1991.  </P> <P> * British Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield Co., which, since the Middle East  crisis began, have stepped up a program of well stimulation on Alaska's North  Slope, helping to boost production. Separately, they announced plans to spend  $1.1 billion on a long-term gas handling project designed to arrest the decline  of Alaskan oil production.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, there are signs that oil drillers have increased their activity  since Iraq invaded Kuwait.  </P> <P> This week, the number of active oil and natural gas rigs increased to 1,107  from 1,010 a year ago, according to the widely consulted rig count report  released Monday by oil services company Baker Hughes Inc.  </P> <P> The rig count, which is a measure of the number of rigs exploring for oil, has  risen in eight of the last 10 weeks and is at its highest level in about 2 1/2  years, said Baker Hughes spokesman Ron Turner in Houston.  </P> <P> Overall, the oil industry had planned to increase upstream spending in 1990  independent of the Middle East crisis, expecting oil prices to rise gradually  on their own. But there remain real impediments to dramatic increases in  domestic oil drilling, and most oil companies have been shifting their efforts  overseas.  </P> <P> The oil industry argues that the likeliest sources of large, new oil  discoveries in the United States are off limits, including offshore areas and  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  </P> <P> In addition, the number of available drilling rigs and rig crews has dropped  dramatically since the oil boom of the early 1980s. In December, 1981, the rig  count peaked at 4,500. After oil prices crashed in the summer of 1986, the rig  count plummeted to 663.  </P></p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Adams tells IRA leaders time may be right to end violence Hopes that the IRA might be poised to call an imminent ceasefire rose again last night after Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, told republican leaders that the conditions could be right for an end to violence in Northern Ireland. In his first public acknowledgement that he has advised IRA leaders to consider halting their 25-year armed campaign, Mr Adams said he had always argued that 'a changed political climate could break the . . . stalemate and create the potential to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict'. 'In my updated assessment to the IRA leadership I expressed my belief that the current political climate provides that potential,' he said. The IRA leadership assured him that it would 'study my assessment of the present political situation and that it will make a speedy response to it'. His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, called for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to start as soon as possible after a genuine end to IRA violence. Some 24 hours after issuing a joint statement with Mr Adams saying that the 'essential ingredients' for an approach to peace might now be available, Mr Hume said: 'If violence has genuinely stopped, the next step has to be dialogue and I would like to see that begin as soon as possible.' He also responded to scathing unionist criticism of his joint statement, saying: 'They don't seem to be listening to what I am saying. We have said that a new agreement is only viable if it enjoys the allegiance of the different traditions on this island.' The air of optimism was reinforced by Cardinal Cahal Daly, leader of the Irish Catholic church, who said Northern Ireland could be on the brink of the best opportunity for peace in 25 years. But it was tempered by unionist leaders, who voiced fears that Britain might be preparing to make concessions in return for a ceasefire. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, is likely to raise such concerns with Mr John Major at a meeting expected to be held in a few days. Mr Molyneaux yesterday accused Mr Hume of 'selling his soul to the devil and joining in a sordid attempt to blackmail the British, American and Irish governments into giving the Armalite supremacy over the ballot box'. The outlawed loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters warned last night that loyalists would not sit back and be 'coerced or persuaded' into a united Ireland. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Ulster secretary, warned unionists against trying to block political progress, saying that they should be reassured by guarantees in the Downing Street declaration that there would be no reunification without the consent of the majority in Ulster. The British and Irish governments have repeatedly stressed that a total cessation of violence would be required before Sinn Fein could be admitted to the all-party talks process. Mr Adams said that much common ground had been established by Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Dublin 'with the strong support of Irish-American opinion' and that the 'potential now exists to move the situation towards a democratic and peaceful settlement'. 'If such a settlement - the basis for lasting peace - is to be found there must be fundamental and thorough-going change,' he said. 'I am satisfied that Irish nationalism, if properly mobilised and focused at home and internationally, now has sufficient political confidence, weight and support to bring about the changes which are essential to a just and lasting peace.' Mr Adams called for 'equality of treatment, equality of opportunity and parity of esteem across the entire political, economic, cultural, social, legal and security spectrum'.</p>

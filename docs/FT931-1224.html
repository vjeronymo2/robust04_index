			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Codan in renewed bid for Hafnia unit CODAN, the Danish insurer controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, yesterday made a new bid to acquire the insurance operations of Hafnia, the Danish insurer. The group put its insurance business up for sale after the parent company, Hafnia Holding, suspended payments last autumn. Codan's bid cuts across plans for an all-Danish solution to the crisis in the Danish insurance industry caused by the financial problems at Hafnia and its rival Baltica, which has reported a DKr4.4bn (Dollars 699m) loss in 1992. Baltica offered to acquire Hafnia's insurance and banking operations last Monday, when it also announced a re-organisation by which the parent company, Baltica Holding, will be reduced to a minority shareholder in Baltica Insurance. This move caused a big drop in the share price in Baltica Holding, which in turn affected Hafnia, which is the largest shareholder in Baltica Holding with just over 33 per cent. Codan was among several companies which made offers earlier this year to acquire Hafnia's insurance business. Last Sunday Codan withdrew the offer, but according to Mr Peter Zobel, Codan's chief executive, the offer was remade this week. Difficult conditions in world shipping markets cut net profits in the Lauritzen shipping and shipbuilding group to DKr83m (Dollars 13m) in 1992 from DKr320m in the previous year. Group sales increased from DKr13.15bn to DKr13.84bn, but profits after net financial items were down from DKr416m to DKr146m, and after ship disposals and extraordinary items from DKr545m to DKr186m. The group said that earnings by the Lauritzen refrigerated cargo business, in which it operates one of the world's largest fleets, gas tankers and offshore drilling rigs, were unsatisfactory.</p>

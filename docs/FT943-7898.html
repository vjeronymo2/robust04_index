			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / 100 colleges face disruption Lecturers in at least 100 further education colleges in England and Wales plan strikes during two weeks of action early next month. The Natfhe lecturers' union said yesterday that more colleges would hold ballots on industrial action during the first weeks of term in September, as the union continued local action against the introduction of new contracts. However it added that its hopes of reaching a negotiated settlement had improved since the government had decided not to carry out its threat to withhold funds from colleges which failed to implement new flexible contracts. The dispute started after colleges were removed from local education authority control in April last year. The Colleges Employers' Forum, which includes most college principals, demanded new flexible contracts which halved holiday leave each year, and added an hour to each working day. It said these changes were necessary to allow flexibility. Natfhe refused to accept the forum's conditions, and has held both national and local strikes against the proposals. Last year the government announced that 2 per cent of central funding for each college would be held back if they did not introduce flexible contracts. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, recommended the forum's model contract to principals. However the government announced this month that it would hold back funds from only three colleges. Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe's negotiating secretary, said this had 'removed the last impediment to a negotiated settlement'. Funds have gone to two colleges that negotiated new contracts accepted by Natfhe.</p>

Comic books continue their adult ways: The upcoming first issue of  "Ripper" -- about a young man obsessed with vengeance, following the brutal  rape and murder of his fiancee -- is so violent that it will be sealed in a  clear plastic wrapper. To ship in November from Aircel publishing, it will  carry a "mature readers" advisory.  </P></p>

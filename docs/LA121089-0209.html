			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT CARDS ON HIGH SCHOOLS ISSUED BY STATE  </P> <P> It's report-card time for Orange County's public high schools.  </P> <P> But educators caution against reading too much into the information released on  each high school last week by the California Department of Education.  </P> <P> In today's Section U, a special report gives school-by-school reports and  examines Newport Harbor High School, which posted the county's highest overall  score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  </P> <P> Experts also discuss the value of the SAT, which is often used by college  placement officials and is the target of critics who say it is biased against  women and minorities.  </P> <P> For a look at the week ahead, Your Week appears today in Section U. The weekly  chess column is also there.  </P></p>

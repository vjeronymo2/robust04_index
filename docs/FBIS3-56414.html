			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Viktorov commentary] </F>   [Text] Iran has once again stressed the peaceful nature of  its nuclear program. [Word indistinct] Reza Amrollahi, official  representative of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO],  speaking to an IRNA correspondent on Wednesday [12 January],  said that a recent report in the U.S. magazine "U.S.A. TODAY" is  sheer lies and (?part of a) U.S. plot against the world of  Islam. Sergey Viktorov writes on this:    We should recall that normally information by the special  services of the United States form the basis of reports such as  those that are being (?recently heard) in a number of Western  countries. Taking into consideration the special  characteristics of U.S.-Iranian relations, it is difficult to  consider such information to be realistic and unbiased.    Nevertheless, according to known facts, in their effort to  portray the Islamic Republic as a country that has been  (?rejected) by world society, the U.S. special services are  willing to ignore conclusions that have been drawn by impartial  international experts, something which Reza Amrollahi justly  pointed out in his news conference.    Last fall a group of experts from the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] inspected all the nuclear installations on  Iranian territory and did not find any proof that Iran is  manufacturing nuclear weapons. It should be noted that all  similar IAEA inspections have so far yielded the same  conclusion. Moreover, it should be added that Tehran has never  expressed its intention to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Pact and has also signed the agreement on (?banning) chemical  weapons.    Thus it appeared that the exploitation of this issue could  be  stopped. But this did not happen. The United States has  succeeded in its efforts to convince its partners in the G-7 to  join in boycotting the exports to Iran of so-called technology  that can be used for dual purposes. Tehran, which was in a  technoglically unfavorable position, requested assistance from  Russia and China to complete the construction of incomplete  nuclear energy installations, and specifically (?agreed) on the  purchase of two Russian-built nuclear reactors and one Chinese  nuclear reactor. However, this rekindled a more intense campaign  in the West regarding Iran's ambitious nuclear programs.  Russia's assurances were in vain. Russia pointed out that  Russian-Iranian cooperation in the field of nuclear energy would  be strictly within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Pact and under the constant supervision of the IAEA.    Of course, the United States wants a more moderate  government  to come to power in Tehran. However, the traditional anti-U.S.  remarks by the current Iranian leaders do not leave any chance  for a positive change in the situation, and it seems that the  West will thus continue to exploit the issue of Iran's imaginary  nuclear threat.    One can agree with Reza Amrollahi's remarks in his recent  interview. However, Tehran's wish to (?link) itself with the  world of Islam, which can recently be seen, is also reflected in  these remarks. If one can [word indistinct] speak about a type  of U.S. plot, it is highly possible that this plot is only  against Iran. But this plot must be regarded as a confrontation  between two unreconcilable ideologies.</p>

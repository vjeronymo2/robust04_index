			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 17 May (MENA)--The Palestinian General  Security Command issued its first declaration to the Palestinian  people today, on the eve of the Palestinian police's assumption  of their full powers in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.    The declaration specifies the duties of the Palestinian  police as the maintenance of security and public order and  ensuring peace and safety for all Palestinians within a  framework of democracy, political pluralism, and the rule of law.    The declaration announces that schools and hospitals have  been reopened and that various government institutions have  begun to function.    The declaration calls on the Palestinian people to cooperate  with the police to begin a new era and build a Palestinian state.    One hundred and seventy-six Palestinian police cars, sent by  the United States to Port Said a few days ago, crossed at the  Rafah border point today.    Meanwhile Israeli troops are preparing to evacuate all Gaza  areas by tomorrow evening. Later today the Palestinians and  Israelis will sign an official agreement transferring power to  the Palestinian Authority as of Thursday [19 May]. The  agreement specifies 38 different powers for the new Palestinian  Authority.    An official of the Palestinian Authority confirmed that the  Israeli Army will complete its withdrawal from Gaza on schedule  and not one Israeli will remain inside the Palestinian autonomy  areas by Thursday morning.    The Israeli Army placed Arabic, Hebrew, and English signs on  major roads and areas saying: "Attention. You are entering the  Palestinian Authority area. Entry must be coordinated with the  Israeli Army."    The Palestinian Authority in Gaza has begun to establish a  system for data processing and statistical programs. The  venture is carried out by a Palestinian-Egyptian company based  in Cairo. Engineer 'Ali Nabil Sha'th, the company's  representative, said that the company has opened branches in  Gaza and Jerusalem and that a number of Palestinian young people  have been trained in the use of the data processing equipment,  which has been reprogrammed to meet the needs of the Palestinian  administration.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: Design for living IN THE MIRROR OF THE PA LECTURES AND ADDRESSES 1978-1990 by Ivan Illich Marion Boyars Pounds 16.95, 231 pages THERE WAS a time, so the Editor assures me, when no self-respecting dinner-party conversation was complete without mention of the latest Illich. One of the most widely read polemicists of the 1960s and early '70s, in works such as Celebration of Awareness, Deschooling Society and Tools for Conviviality he challenged many of society's most revered institutions - education, medicine, its economic structure - and urged modern man to rethink the basic tenets of his moral existence. Now, thanks to this latest collection of lecture circuit offerings, a new generation has the chance to evaluate Illich for themselves. To call Illich utopian is no reproach. From Plato onwards, writers have used a perfect world to prick man's conscience about his existing one. Illich finds his lost world in the writings of the Middle Ages, when philosophers ascribed a wholeness to the art of living. In modern times, he contends, the mirror of the past has splintered into a confusion of competing disciplines, governed by 'experts' who can formulate systems but who have forgotten how to live. But what would Illich's perfect world be like? Self-sufficiency is the key, progressive industrialisation the enemy: 'Man should realise that for the good of the individual as well as society, it is best that people keep for themselves only as much as is sufficient for their immediate needs', he says in an inaugural speech at the Ashram founded around Gandhi's hut. In transport planning the motor car should come second to the bicycle. We should dispense with architects and build our own houses. Architects can design machines for living in but have forgotten what it is to dwell. Economics draws forth Illich's bitterest tirade. Economics turns what were traditionally accepted as blessings and banes into questions of scarcity and provision. It means people lose their human dignity as 'persons'; they now simply lay claim to 'lives': 'A Life' is amenable to management, to improvement and to evaluation in terms of available resources in a way which is unthinkable when we speak of 'a person.' He argues that medicine has encouraged the pursuit of healthy bodies to the point at which life has become a new fetish. In-vitro fertilisation and life-support machines have meant that doctors have exceeded the boundaries between quickening and dying which traditionally defined their domain. Physicians in the Hippocratic tradition 'had to accept nature's power to dissolve the healing contract between the patient and his physician.' An art of living only makes sense alongside an art of dying. What a culture bequeaths to each generation in terms of human goods, values and excellences, economics merely flatten into needs: 'Society is now organised on the utilitarian assumption that man is born needy, and needed values are by definition scarce. In Japan, the old simply live in the household, regardless of any perception of their needs. There the old are given something best described as 'hospitality', but they 'need' neither formal nor informal hospitalisation or care.' Discussing employment, he argues for replacing wage-labour with 'unpaid activities which provide and improve livelihood.' As for education, Illich would still 'deschool' society: we should learn only what we need to know to make us happy and competent in our immediate concerns. What these essays demonstrate is that Illich has lost none of his power to provoke and engage. On many issues, especially medical ethics and the environment, time has proved him prophetic. He is brilliant at dismantling the false images of the Age. He is less good at describing alternatives, save for something smacking too much of hippy idealism. Perhaps we need an updated study of the human virtues. More digging around in the works of those medieval philosophers might help.</p>

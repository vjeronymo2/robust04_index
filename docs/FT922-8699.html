			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Inquiry into ICI and Du Pont deal The European Commission has opened a one-month preliminary inquiry into the agreement between Imperial Chemical Industries and Du Pont of the US to swap their nylon and acrylics businesses. Such inquiries are triggered automatically if the merger crosses EC thresholds on turnover. If the Commission decides after a month that it has 'serious doubts' about the deal's effect on competition it will mount an in-depth investigation, which could last up to four months. If it is still unsatisfied, the Commission can then block the merger or impose conditions.</p>

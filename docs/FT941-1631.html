			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Allied Dunbar to take over Hill Samuel's life sellers Hill Samuel, part of the TSB group, is to close the life and pensions part of its financial services arm to new business. Most of its direct sales force will be offered jobs at Allied Dunbar, the BAT subsidiary. In return for what Allied Dunbar called a small payment, it will have the option to recruit the 600-plus sales force. The move is a sign of much-expected rationalisation within the crowded life industry. The transfer will mean a significant increase in size for Allied Dunbar, which has 4,300 sales agents. The decision also marks a further step in TSB's strategy for Hill Samuel, which is to focus on its merchant banking and investment management activities. The Hill Samuel concern will be saved the cost of attracting sales, although it will continue to service existing life and pension policyholders. The funds will be managed by its investment management arm. In the year to October 1993, profits in the financial services business fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 13m - despite higher sales of unit trusts - as customers switched out of life products. Hill Samuel will continue to market products such as unit trusts through independent financial advisers. Mr Hugh Freedberg, Hill Samuel group chief executive, said the restructuring, which will take place next month, followed a strategic review begun last year. This concluded, he said, that a life company needed 'a warm, captive customer base, or direct selling with sufficient size and scale to be able to compete profitably and effectively'. HSFS had neither. Mr Sandy Leitch, Allied Dunbar chief executive, said the life company was determined to occupy a 'dominant' market position. The acquisition was its first for more than 10 years.</p>

For information on the estimated net subsidy, please see the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Suspension of Liquidation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the publication of the preliminary determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4682), the following events have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We conducted verification of the responses submitted on behalf of the Government of Italy (``GOI''), ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), and the European Community (``EC'') from February 7 through February 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 22 and March 28, 1994, we received case and rebuttal briefs, respectively, from petitioners and respondents. Neither petitioners nor respondents requested a hearing in this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 29, 1994, we returned to petitioners certain factual information submitted in their briefs because it was untimely pursuant to &sect;355.31(a)(i) of the Department's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This investigation concerns the following class or kind of merchandise: grain-oriented electrical steel (``electrical steel'') from Italy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The product covered by this investigation is grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, which is a flat-rolled alloy steel product containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.56 millimeter, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, as currently classifiable in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS'') under item numbers 7225.10.0030, 7226.10.1030, 7226.10.5015, and 7226.10.5065. Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Injury Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Italy is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') is required to determine whether imports of electrical steel from Italy materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. On October 12, 1993, the ITC preliminarily determined that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Italy of the subject merchandise (58 FR 54168, October 20, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Corporate History of Respondent ILVA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to 1987, electrical steel in Italy was produced by Terni S.p.A. (``Terni''), a main operating company of Finsider. Finsider was a government-owned holding company which controlled all state-owned steel companies in Italy. In a restructuring of the Italian steel industry in 1982, Terni took over two plants, Lovere and Trieste, from Nuova Italsider, another Finsider-owned steel producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of a subsequent restructuring in 1987, Terni transferred its assets to a new company, Terni Acciai Speciali (``TAS'') which thereafter held all the assets for electrical steel production in Italy. As part of the restructuring, Lovere and Trieste became TAS' two principal subsidiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RAINSTORM BRINGS FLURRY OF ACCIDENTS ON FREEWAYS  </P> <P> A powerful storm that brought the first significant rainfall of the season also  contributed to a flurry of accidents on freeways in northern Los Angeles  County, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> There were no reports of fatalities in any of the incidents, but foul weather  and speeding drivers kept officers busy late Monday and early Tuesday. "We had  12 to 15 fender-benders and about a dozen people" were taken to hospitals, said  Sgt. Robert Callahan of the CHP's Newhall office.  </P> <P> At least four major accidents occurred on the southbound Golden State Freeway.  </P> <P> About 1 a.m. Tuesday, a trailer came loose from a semitrailer truck north of  the Foothill Freeway and an auto slid beneath the trailer, seriously injuring  the car's driver, Uehara Minoru, 46, of Los Angeles. He was taken to Holy Cross  Medical Center, where he was in serious condition, hospital spokeswoman Reenie  Collins said.  </P> <P> About 11 p.m. Monday, a motorist speeding south on the Golden State Freeway  near McBean Parkway lost control and struck the center divider and a second  vehicle, the CHP said, blocking two southbound lanes of the freeway for two  hours.  </P> <P> The driver of the first car was identified as Tristan Emil Gunnett, 20, of  Redwood City. The driver of the second car was identified as Anh Quang Hoang,  43, of San Francisco. Gunnett, Hoang and Hoang's passenger were treated and  released from Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday, a small speeding car "spun out of control and hit  a dual-wheel pickup truck carrying persimmons," spilling the fruit onto the  highway south of Calgrove Boulevard, Callahan said. There were no injuries.  </P> <P> Shortly before 10 p.m. Monday, four semitrailer trucks were involved in two  accidents in the truck lanes of the Golden State Freeway near the Antelope  Valley Freeway, closing the lanes for more than two hours.  </P> <P> Two trucks collided and when a third stopped to avoid the wreckage, it was hit  by a fourth truck. There were no serious injuries, the CHP said.  </P></p>

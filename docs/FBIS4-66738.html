			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The large Arak petrochemical project is one of the fruits of  the victory of the magnificent Islamic revolution led by Imam  Khomeyni and the sacred blood of the precious martyrs of Islam,  and is the result of the round-the-clock efforts of the experts  of the National Petrochemical Industries, particularly Arak  Petrochemical Company.    In the vast country of Iran, the abundant potential in the  industrial, agricultural, developmental, and cultural sectors  provides very good conditions for investment in the  petrochemical industry. In addition, the existence of vast raw  material resources, a market for absorbing the products  domestically and abroad, the prospects of the production of an  extensive spectrum of products, and finally high technical and  economic value are among the important incentives in the  development of this industry.    For this reason, the petrochemical industry is especially  important to the overall economic, social, and cultural  development of the country.    In connection with the general policies for the development  of this industry and related industries, and in harmony with the  economic and social goals of the First Five-Year Plan, the Arak  Petrochemical Complex is in the final stages of completion and  becoming operational.    The operation of this large complex will mark a new chapter  in the industrial self-sufficiency and independence of the  country. This complex will make possibile the production of a  vast spectrum of petrochemical and chemical products, which are  very critical technically, economically, and even strategically.    The creation of this complex, which will convert raw  petroleum materials into useful materials and is the main source  for a great variety of petrochemical products, is a pivotal  point in this industry.    We congratulate the grand leader of the Islamic revolution,  the honorable president, the committed Muslim employees of the  Ministry of Petroleum, and the Muslim and martyr-nurturing  people of Iran for the important victory of Islamic Iran in  joining the ranks of those who possess the main segment of the  petroleum industry.  <H5>  Brief History </H5>   This project to create Arak Petrochemical has been discussed  from 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] on the basis of plans by  the National Petrochemical Industries Company to make suitable  use of the existing raw materials in Iran, achieve  self-sufficiency, meet the increasing demands of the domestic  market, and ultimately replace the export of crude oil with the  export of petrochemical products. It was placed at the top of  the programs of the National Petrochemical Industries Company.  Initial studies concerning this project began in 1362 [21 March  1983-20 March 1984], and it was ratified by the Supreme Economic  Council in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985]. After a great  deal of effort, in Azar 1364 [22 November-21 December 1985], the  first line of credit was opened for the design and engineering  of the Alfin Unit, which is the heart of the complex.  Subsequently, agreements were signed for the design,  engineering, and purchasing of machinery for other units. The  task of industrial construction and installation began in 1368  [21 March 1989-20 March 1990].    In order to strengthen the financial sources for the project  and encourage the people to participate as much as possible in  investment in production, while the designing and engineering of  the processing units were under way, on 19/01/1366 [8 April  1987], the Arak Petrochemical Company was established, with the  participation of the National Petrochemical Industries Company,  with 51 percent of the shares, and the Melli Bank of Iran, with  49 percent of the shares. The administration of the project  through its final stages and up to full operation was conferred  on this company.    With the efforts and joint support of the National  Petrochemical Industries Company and the Melli Bank of Iran, and  the round-the-clock efforts of the employees, by the grace of  God, in the second half of 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993],  operation of the water, electricity, and steam units of the  complex began and, subsequently, other service units and the  olefin and polyolefin production units reached operation, and we  are now witnessing its official inauguration.  <H5>  Geographical Situation </H5>   The Arak Petrochemical Complex is located next to the  Seventh  Refinery, at Km 22 on the Arak-Borujerd road, at an elevation of  1,888 [meters] above sea level. Initially, 523 hectares [ha] of  land were obtained to create the processing units, the service  units, and the general and primary facilities. For the  developmental projects and for facilitating access to the road  for the loading and unloading of the raw materials and products  of the complex, 215 ha west of the complex are being acquired.    The main factor in the choice of location is its proximity  to  the refinery (the main supplier of the complex); access to the  network of roads, railroads, and the main natural gas pipeline;  and its nearness to the consumer centers for [distribution of]  the products.  <H5>  The Units of the Complex </H5>   The Arak Petrochemical Complex consists of 14 processing  units, six secondary service units, 14 general facilities, and  integral and general building sections, as described in Chart  No. 1.  <H5>  A.

Auxiliary Service Units </H5>   These units provide for the operational needs of the complex  in terms of water, electricity, steam, compressed air, precision  instruments, oxygen, and nitrogen.  <H5>  C. General and Joint Facilities </H5>   These facilities are designed for the establishment of  contact between the processing units and the auxiliary services  and for providing the common needs of the units of the entire  complex, which include 14 untreated water and supply systems of  the complex, a fire department, natural gas fuel, liquid fuel,  the collection of excess water and refining of waste water,  electricity distribution, a communications network with 1,600  telephones, 140 km of pipelines between units, areas for  chemical storage, areas for hydrogen storage, a system for the  collection of water from condensation, and the torch system [as  published] of the complex.  <H5>  D. General Buildings and Ground Work </H5>   Since the start of the implementation operations of the  complex, ground work and the construction of general buildings  have been carried out in the form of dozens of large and small  projects by Iranian contractors or in the form of direct  government management. The designing and engineering of these  projects have been carried out by or under the supervision of  the Engineering Affairs of the Arak Petrochemical Company. Their  implementation has come under the supervision of the Unit for  Overseeing Civic and Ground Work and involves a central  workshop, with full equipment for the technical service  buildings; a central laboratory; a central office; a restaurant;  a prayer hall; four product unit warehouses, which consist of  52,000 square meters; 10 covered warehouses, with 38,000 square  meters under construction; a fire department; a plastic bag  production unit; a 58-unit guest house inside the complex; 57  three-bedroom residential units; an industrial treatment center;  a Melli Bank building; a gasoline station; 40 km of roads inside  the complex; the widening of the Arak-Shahr-e Mohajeran road;  and putting up a 10-km-long fence around the complex.  <H5>  Raw Materials for the Complex </H5>   The main supply for the complex is light and heavy naphtha,  which will be delivered from the Esfahan and Arak refineries via  pipelines to the complex.    At the present time, the major portion of the naphtha supply  is transported to the complex in tankers from Esfahan.    Natural gas is needed in the complex, both as a raw material  in the processing units and as a fuel, and is received via the  main natural gas pipeline that passes near the complex and is  sent through the distribution system to various consumer points.    Untreated water needed in the complex is provided from  underground reservoirs and from nine wells.    Ammonia needed in the complex is procured at the level of  6,000 tons annually from the Shiraz Petrochemical Complex.  <H5>  General Characteristics of the Project </H5>   In addition to the fact that the most advanced technologies  and processing methods will be used in the Arak Petrochemical  Complex and the highest standards of design have been used in  it, this project has distinct characteristics, which are the  result of the latest scientific, technical, and safety  innovations and experiences and make the Arak Petrochemical  Complex a unique and advanced complex compared to similar  complexes in the most advanced countries in the world.  <H5>  The General Characteristics of the Complex Are as Follows </H5>   Most of the units of the complex use very advanced precision  control systems and instruments, called DCS (Distributed Control  System), which are computerized, and every unit has an  independent control room and a separate computerized control  system. Also, in this complex, there are 59 PLCs (Programable  Logic Controls). In other words, in terms of control, it is one  of the most advanced systems.    Very strong, resistant reinforced concrete is used for the  passive defense of the whole complex. This concrete is more  complicated, both in terms of design and construction, than that  used in mixed metal and concrete structures.    Connecting the units is a system of underground concrete  canals, which in terms of passive defense and also in terms of  repairs and aesthetics are very efficient.    In terms of the complexity of the work in the complex, the  changes in temperature can be considered significant. In the  Arak Petrochemical Complex, the temperature changes from -190  degrees C. to 1,650 degrees C. For this reason, it requires  various materials with various properties and also requires a  very precise control system. The pressure changes in the complex  range from 120 times to vacuum [as published].    In terms of the general layout, the complex is very  aesthetically designed. The access and main roads are of very  modern design and are arranged in the form of boulevards.    The very advanced industrial waste water refinery will  generate a minimal amount of pollution. The processed water is  returned to the cooling towers, and some of it is used for the  irrigation of the green areas. In regards to the green areas, in  the northern section of the complex, a large number of trees  have been planted and are growing well.    The complex has one of the most well-equipped stationary and  mobile fire extinguishing systems.  <H5>  Method for the Implementation of the Project </H5>   After the completion of comprehensive marketing studies, in  order to determine the spectrum and capacity of needed products  and complete the technical and economic feasibility studies for  the plan, the need for the clarification of an implementation  plan for various stages of the project suitable to the mottos  and gains of the magnificent Islamic revolution was noted. In  this connection, minimum dependence on foreign countries and  maximum use of committed Iranian experts and the implementation  of the task at high quality and low cost were given the most  prominence. The choice of licenses, the basic engineering and  detail work, and the purchasing of goods from abroad under the  supervision of petrochemical experts was carried out so that 14  advanced technical licenses and six first-rate technological  licenses were obtained for the processing and auxiliary service  units, respectively.    Agreements were signed with about 15 reputable international  companies to obtain licenses, develop designs, provide  engineers, and purchase machinery.    In all agreements, the preservation of the maximum interests  of the company and the maximum transfer of technology have been  included.    Iranian experts have been overseeing all design,  engineering,  and purchasing phases. In this regard, these experts have gained  valuable experience.    The right of arbitration is given to Iranian courts.    The right for Iran to create similar units has been  safeguarded.    The guarantee to provide spare parts for a period of 10  years  is conferred on the contractor.    The training of Iranian personnel in similar units of the  contractors has been included in order to ensure readiness for  operation.    To guarantee the design and quality of manufacture and the  dependable operation of the equipment sold, the design  contractors and manufacturing companies or sellers of the  equipment are responsible to supervise the installation and  start of operations.    The standards and technical specifications needed have been  drawn up, and the contractor is obliged to observe them for  purposes of coordination.    All the purchased equipment weighs 150,000 tons.    The technical inspection of the equipment during  manufacturing and delivery was carried out by Iranian experts.    In special cases, the guarantee for long-term procurement  catalysts were obtained.    Access to advanced technology by those who offer it is  included for the long term.  <H5>  Installation and Construction </H5>   To complete the installation and construction of the  complex,  it was decided to grant the construction of six production units  and all the auxiliary service units in addition to the general  and common facilities to foreign contractors. To implement this  decision, after a study was made of reputable international  companies, a short list of those companies that were able to do  this work was prepared, and the bid of the Italian company,  Filippo Fuki, was accepted, and an agreement was signed. This  company was required to use 70 percent of its labor force from  the domestic work force, but in practice, 85 percent of its work  force has been comprised of domestic workers. In this regard,  fortunately, beneficial practical training was carried out. In  terms of acquiring skill and technology transfer, Iranians have  benefitted significantly in various phases of the installation.    In addition to those individuals employed directly by the  Fuki Company, a large number of domestic contractors also signed  contracts with the above-mentioned company and have been active  in the construction of the complex. A list of the contractors is  included in Chart No. 2.    In addition to the plans to make maximum use of the Iranian  work force, the decision was made to make use of the resources  of large contracting companies in Iran, to which end the  installation of five production units and some of the work of  auxiliary service units and general and common facilities also  were conferred on domestic contractors. In this connection, the  Tehran Jonub, Namgan, and Ramsaz Companies have had the greatest  share. As the work progressed, the contract with the Tehran  Jonub Company was terminated; other companies replaced it; and  work continued under the direct management of the Arak  Petrochemical Company.    All the general work and construction has been conferred on  domestic contractors or carried out by the government under the  direct supervision of the Arak Petrochemical Company. In this  regard, about 350 large and small Iranian companies have been  used.    The designing of all offices and auxiliary buildings of the  complex, such the central workshop, the central laboratory, the  warehouses, the technical service buildings, and so on, has been  done by the personnel of the Arak Petrochemical Company.    In order to reduce foreign currency expenditures, in the  course of the project, some of the work with foreign contractors  has been cancelled and conferred on Iranian contractors. In  total, at the height of the work on this complex, the work force  consisted of 13,000 persons, 1,000 of them foreigners and 12,000  Iranians.  <H5>  Start-Up and Operation </H5>   The start-up and operation of this complex has been handled  totally by the personnel of the Arak Petrochemical Company. The  presence of a minimum number of representatives of the owner of  the license and the designing contractor alongside the operating  personnel has been projected to carry out the guarantee of the  operators, as reflected in the contract.    In keeping with the progress of the installation work,  operation personnel were hired, and the related organization was  prepared.    The safe and uneventful start-up of the processing and  service units of this large complex, including the very  sensitive olefin unit, at the hands of domestic forces who have  had no experience in this area is a proud golden leaf in the  petrochemical industry and the entire country.    The operational personnel have acquired the necessary  training in several phases.  <H5>  The Financial Status of the Project </H5> <H5>  A. Investment </H5>   Investments in this project are as follows:     -  Cash investments, 300 billion rials [R]    -  Funds from the Melli Bank, R200 billion    -  International funds from the National Petrochemical  Industries  Company, R740 billion    -  Needed through banking funds or the sale of material, R260  billion    -  Total, R1500 billion    -  Of this amount, about $2 billion has been in foreign currency  and the remainder in rials   <H5>  B. Economic Return </H5>   On the whole, investments in petrochemical industries have a  high rate of return. In this complex, as well, calculating the  price of the import sales in recent years and the actual foreign  currency rate, calculating the international price for supplies  and consumption, the economic indicators are summarized as  follows:     -  Level of sales (with 100 percent production), R554 billion    -  Level of profit, R186 billion    -  Ratio of profit to cash investment, 66 percent    -  Ratio of profit to total investment, 13 percent    -  Rate of domestic return, 32 percent   <H5>  C. Important Gains of the Implementation of the Project </H5>   Foreign currency conservation.    The creation of jobs.    The training and transfer of technology, self-sufficiency,  and economic independence.    The added value and growth of national revenues.  <H5>  Training During Design and Engineering </H5>    -  Specialized training and active participation in the  supervision, engineering, and basic and detailed design of the  units, 136 persons (1,354 persons [per] month) abroad [as  published].    -  Training of personnel in engineering, estimating, planning,  managing, and provisional work, 75 persons [per] month abroad.    -  Training of more than 2,355 engineers, senior technicians,  and  skilled workers during construction and installation and the use  of their expertise during the implementation of the project.  Training has been generally on-the-job, and ultimately the skill  of the individual has been emphasized, which in practice has  resulted in the reduction of foreign manpower. Also, training in  welding, especially practical and theoretical training, has been  provided, and ultimately the trainees have received certificates  to perform the work according to international standards.   <H5>  Training of Employees for the Operational Period </H5>    -  On-the-job training in the complex, 522 persons [per]  month.    -  Training of engineers, senior technicians, and technicians in  the complex and other training centers, such as the  petrochemical complexes, refineries, power plants, universities,  and other research centers, for the operational units of the  complex.    -  Training abroad for the employees of the operational units to  familiarize them with the units that have been installed in the  complex, 182 persons and 490 persons [per] month [as published].   <H5>  Housing Manufacturing Projects </H5>   The Arak Petrochemical Company, in conformity with the  policy  of the Ministry of Petroleum and the Government of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and in order to reduce the pressures of housing  demands and also to provide relative comfort and absorption of  expert forces, is preparing a large employee housing  construction project. In this connection, 18 apartment units and  a complex of 120 unfinished apartments were purchased from the  Ministry of Housing and Urban Development in the city of Arak  and are now being used.    For the residences of foreign and domestic experts, 57  housing units have been built in the complex and are being used.    The next phase is the Gerdu Township Project, which is for  company experts in the city of Arak. The land has been acquired  through the Urban Developmental Organization, and 104 apartment  units have been built on it. But the company's main plan in the  area of providing housing for the employees is the large housing  manufacturing project in the city of Mohajeran, which is located  on Km 28 of the Arak-Borujerd road. This large project includes  984 apartment units, 1,531 residential units (a total of 2,515  units), and a large number of secondary buildings, such as  mosques, schools, educational space, commercial centers, motels,  clubs, athletic and recreational facilities, a covered pool,  clinics, and water treatment plants.    Of the residential units, so far 500 units have been  completed, occasionally by employees, and the rest are about to  be completed.

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> DISTRICT PICKS SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> The seven-month search for a superintendent for the Orange Unified School  District has ended.  </P> <P> Dr. Norman Guith, superintendent of the Alvord Unified School District in  Riverside County, was selected from 43 applicants in the nationwide search to  replace John Ikerd.  </P> <P> Ikerd resigned last November after school board members expressed a lack of  confidence in him.  </P> <P> Guith called his appointment "the biggest opportunity of my life" and said he  relishes the challenge of stepping into a troubled district like Orange  Unified. The district has experienced bitter union conflicts, financial scandal  and fiscal instability in the past decade.  </P> <P> "When I ask anyone to tell me about Orange, they start talking about the  problems here," Guith said. "Yet I look at their test scores and I see an  education system that's very strong."  </P> <P> Guith, who has spent 14 years as a school superintendent, said "everything I've  learned I'll be able to put to use in Orange. And I should be able to help them  make the district the best in the county -- if not the state."  </P> <P> Guith will take over immediately for interim superintendent Stan Corey, said  Tom Neill, a spokesman for the district. Guith, 50, was superintendent of the  Central School District in San Bernardino from 1978 to 1982 and was  superintendent of the Borrego Springs Unified School District from 1975 to  1978.  </P> <P> He received a doctorate in educational administration from the University of  Southern California in 1974. He and his wife, Melani, live in Alta Loma and  have eight children.MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banco Santander aims to earn half its profits abroad MR EMILIO BOTIN, chairman of Banco Santander, has announced that the Spanish bank plans to step up its strategy of international expansion, with the aim of increasing net profits earned abroad to 50 per cent of the group's total. Mr Botin told the bank's annual meeting at the weekend that international business contributed Dollars 205m to consolidated net profits of Dollars 577.1m in 1992. 'The time will come when half our assets and profits will be abroad,' Mr Botin said. 'That is our objective and that is where we are going.' As part of this strategy Santander was considering exercising warrants in First Fidelity Bancorporation which would increase its shareholding in the New Jersey bank from 16.5 per cent to 23 per cent. An equity stake of more than 20 per cent would mean the consolidation of First Fidelity's results with Santander's and boost the Spanish group's already strong balance sheet. Mr Botin said that despite a very difficult year Santander had achieved a 'satisfactory' growth of 12.5 per cent in operating profits. This was due more to a growth in fee income, which rose 21.8 per cent to Dollars 602m, and control over operating expenses, than to higher margins. Santander's total dividend was increased by 8.33 per cent, year on year, to Pta260 (Dollars 2.24) a share. The Spanish government has created four limited companies called Sociedad Estatal de Patrimonio I, II, III and IV, in a move that prepares the ground for big disposals of state-owned shareholdings. Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, said up to 25 per cent of Argentaria, the banking group, would be placed on the market 'immediately'.</p>

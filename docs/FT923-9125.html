			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Japan fails to kick the export habit: The country's current account surplus is soaring again A VERY large current account surplus has returned to haunt the Japanese government. After sharp falls in the late 1980s, the surplus this year is set to surpass the record Dollars 87bn in 1987 and to intensify international pressure on Japan to prove that its markets are genuinely open. The sharp appreciation of the yen after the Plaza Accord in 1985 was supposed to have blunted the surplus, as was investment abroad by leading exporters such the electronics and car industries. But a slowdown in the domestic economy has weakened demand for imports and encouraged manufacturers to export, enlarging the surplus to its old, daunting size. In the first half of this year, it rose by 94 per cent to Dollars 56.2bn, and while the sheer size of the figure suggests that nothing much has changed from the mid-1980s, there are differences. Instead of selling the whole product, companies are exporting components to new factories abroad, and east Asia has replaced north America as Japan's most important market. However, these patterns have not lessened trade tension with the European Community and the US, rather they have created new frictions with Asian trading partners and have placed further pressure on the Japanese government to show there are no 'structural impediments' to imports. When the Japanese economy expanded rapidly in the late 1980s, the current account surplus fell in tandem. After the customs-cleared trade surplus reached Dollars 82.7bn in 1986, the figure declined to Dollars 77.5bn in 1988 and to Dollars 52.1bn in 1990. The government claimed credit for orchestrating the fall and even expressed concern that the surplus, regarded as an important measure of economic strength, was disappearing too quickly. But just as the 'bubble' economy grossly inflated land and stock prices, so the decline in the surplus was exaggerated. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), admits the 'adjustment process' was distorted in the late 1980s, and that some manufacturers misread their markets. 'We can say that some companies invested too much in new capacity,' he says. Adjustment was distorted by unsustainable imports of luxury goods, including French impressionist paintings and European cars, and by manufacturers presuming that a hungry domestic market would become even hungrier. In addition, rapid growth in overseas travel helped reduce the current account surplus. The cycle ended as the Tokyo stock market peaked in December 1989, the official end of the easy money era. In the first half this year, European car imports were down 4 per cent year-on-year, after a 23.4 per cent fall last year, and art imports were down 65 per cent. A current account surplus equivalent to 1.1 per cent of gross national product in fiscal 1990 rose to 2.6 per cent in 1991. Another important factor is that Japan's imports are heavily weighted towards raw materials, partly-processed materials or low value-added goods. In the first six months, machinery of all kinds accounted for only 18.8 per cent of the import total, while foodstuffs, raw materials and fuels amounted to 49.6 per cent. While imports remain low value-added, Japanese exporters have continued to add value to their products. In the first half, the volume of car exports rose 2 per cent but their value rose by 14 per cent. And as the economy idles, inventories are rising, capacity utilisation is falling, and manufacturers have good reason to turn to export markets. At the same time, foreign producers attempting to expand market share face increased competition and cut-throat pricing in the overcrowded domestic market. Semiconductors provide a good example - the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market has stalled at around 14 per cent, while Japanese producers increased their chip exports by 16 per cent in June. Under a US-Japan semi-conductor pact, the foreign share is supposed to be 20 per cent by the end of the year. The US trade representative recently concluded that there had not been 'sufficient progress' and that action might be taken against Japan. The Japanese government fears that this and other disputes will force the Bush administration to take tougher action in the lead-up to the US presidential election. Japan's exports to the US rose 5.3 per cent in the first half and imports from the US fell 1.7 per cent - the deficit with Japan accounted for 62 per cent of the total US deficit in May and for 74 per cent of the April deficit. Meanwhile, the European Commission, annoyed by a similar increase in the Japanese surplus with the EC over the past year, wants talks on removing 'structural impediments' to trade. The demand echoes the US-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative and reflects concerns that the Japanese market is restricted by the country's corporate culture. Realising that stimulating the domestic market could solve some of these problems, Tokyo has promised to deliver a supplementary budget this month, while companies are being quietly cautioned against flooding foreign markets with products that cannot be sold at home.</p>

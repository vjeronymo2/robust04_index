			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Hopes rise amid trade gloom THERE is a small crumb of comfort in yesterday's worse-than-expected UK visible and current-account trade figures for April. The respective Pounds 470m increases between March and April in the seasonally adjusted visible trade deficit to Pounds 1.36bn and in the provisionally estimated current-account deficit to Pounds 1.06bn suggest that UK domestic demand is reviving at last. The first-quarter decline in gross domestic product, disclosed last week, may mark the end of the recession. The bad news in yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office is that the UK's trade figures have taken a sudden turn for the worse long before recovery has become firmly established. There were no such deficits at this stage of the business cycle after the recessions of 1973-75 or 1979-81. Nor could the CSO's statisticians find any extraordinary factors in yesterday's figures to explain the worsening trend. On what is often considered the most reliable indicator of underlying trends - trade volumes minus oil and so-called erratic items such as aircraft, ships, oil rigs and precious stones - UK exports continued to grow in the three months to April. They were 2.3 per cent higher than in the three months from November to January and 4.2 per cent higher than between February and April last year. However, import volumes less oil and erratics were 4.3 per cent higher in February to April than in the previous three months, and 7.4 per cent higher than in the February to April period last year. Import volumes in the latest three-month period have been growing at roughly twice the rate of export volumes. Trade between Britain and its European Community partners has been especially disappointing in recent months. Exports were only 0.8 per cent higher in value terms in the three months to April than in the November to January period. At the same time, imports from other EC countries grew by 4.4 per cent. Britain's exports to Germany, the UK's biggest trading partner, were virtually unchanged in the latest three months, while imports from Germany rose by 5 per cent compared with the preceding three months. Between March and April, UK imports from Germany rose by 4.5 per cent while exports to Germany fell by 9.5 per cent. Another concern was the way the increase in imports last month was fairly evenly spread across all product categories. According to Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburg Securities in London, the import figures were 'pretty punchy and flagging a widening deficit to come'. One month's figures can - as the Treasury always points out - be deceptive. It may be that last month's 3.5 per cent jump in imports into the UK reflected wholesalers' and retailers' expectations of an increase in UK demand rather than an actual rise in demand. In that case, the April trade figures may be a reflection of increased stocks. If, on the other hand, the figures reflect genuine strong demand for imported goods, they pose serious questions about how far the UK's recovery from recession can be sustained before it runs into a balance-of-payments constraint.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CURRENT ACCOUNT (POUNDS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Visible Trade Balance                             Less oil         Current               and                            Invisibles         Balance    Total    erratics    Exports     Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990     -15.4    -18.6       -21.0      102.0        120.7     +3.2 1991      -4.4    -10.1       -13.4      103.7        113.8     +5.7 Qtr 2     -0.2     -2.2        -2.9       26.0         28.2     +2.0 Qtr 3     -1.2     -2.3        -3.5       26.4         28.8     +1.1 Qtr 4     -0.6     -2.6        -3.5       26.3         28.9     +1.9 Nov       -0.3     -1.0        -1.3        8.7          9.7     +0.6 Dec       -0.1     -0.7        -1.0        9.0          9.7     +0.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Qtr 1     -2.2     -3.1        -3.6       26.2         29.3     +0.9 Jan       -0.9     -1.2        -1.3        8.3          9.4     +0.3 Feb       -0.7     -1.0        -1.1        9.0         10.0     +0.3 Mar       -0.6     -0.9        -1.1        8.9          9.8     +0.3 Apr       -1.1     -1.4        -1.4        8.8         10.2     +0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for January to April 1992 are projections.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Return to Duty and Follow-Up Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1988 final antidrug rule included the category of ``testing after return to duty'' (former paragraph F, section V, appendix I). Under this provision, individuals who had been hired to perform safety-sensitive functions, or returned to the performance of safety-sensitive functions after receiving a verified positive drug test result on or refusing to submit to an FAA-mandated drug test, were subject to unannounced testing. As noted above, the threshold test required before returning to duty was characterized as a pre-employment test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters concurred with the FAA's assessment that the FAA's prior use of the term ``return to duty'' testing has caused confusion in the industry. The FAA also wishes to ensure consistency in terminology with the alcohol misuse prevention program rule. For these reasons, the antidrug rule has been revised to provide that an individual who had a verified positive drug test result on a pre-employment test, or refused a pre-employment test, must take another pre-employment test and obtain a verified negative drug test result before performing safety-sensitive duties and would then be subject to follow-up testing. An employee who had a verified positive drug test result on another type of test or refused to submit to another type of test ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , random) must take a return to duty test and obtain a verified negative drug test result before returning to the performance of safety-sensitive duties, and would then be subject to follow-up testing. Like all FAA-mandated tests, return to duty and follow-up tests must be performed in accordance with the requirements of appendix I and the testing procedures in 49 CFR part 40.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA also proposed two other changes that would parallel the provisions of the alcohol rule. The first proposed change was the addition of a mandatory minimum of six follow-up drug tests during an individual's first 12 months after being hired for or returning to the performance of safety-sensitive functions after the individual has refused to submit to or had a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated test. Commenters generally opposed this proposal, believing the determination of the appropriate number of follow-up tests should be a matter for the MRO's discretion. Based on these comments, the FAA has revised the follow-up testing provision. As revised, although follow-up testing is required for any person who refuses to submit to or who has a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test, a minimum of six tests over 12 months will be required only for an individual who is determined in an evaluation conducted under this rule to be in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with illegal use of drugs. This modification ensures that those employees most in need of monitoring will be subject to at least a minimum number of tests over the first year after returning to duty, the period during which recidivism is the most likely to occur. The remaining employees would be tested at the MRO's discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second change permits the employer to direct the individual to undergo alcohol testing, as well as drug testing, if the Medical Review Officer determines that such testing would be appropriate. No commenters addressed this change, and the final rule includes this provision as it was proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Medical Review Officer Functions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed to substantially revise section VII of appendix I. First, changes in the DOT final rule (49 CFR part 40), which establishes the duties of the MRO in the verification process, have superseded the FAA's rule. Rather than reiterate the duplicative provisions of the DOT rule, which are subject to change, the revised MRO section cites to the applicable provisions of the DOT rule and incorporates them (and therefore any future amendments) by reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MRO duties have been revised to require the MRO to inquire whether an individual holds a part 67 airman medical certificate, to process requests for split specimen testing, and to evaluate or refer the individual to a SAP for evaluation, as discussed previously. The MRO's duties in the case of an employee or applicant who holds a part 67 airman medical certificate or who would be required to hold such a certificate to perform a safety-sensitive function for an employer are also specified. In response to comments, the requirements for submission of the reports to the Federal Air Surgeon have been revised. The final rule provides that an MRO has 10 working days following verification of a positive drug test result in which to make a determination regarding drug dependence. All documents pertaining to the test result, verification, dependency, SAP evaluations, and return to duty recommendations, if any, must be forwarded to the Federal Air Surgeon within 12 working days of verifying the positive drug test result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule also includes specific recordkeeping requirements for the MRO. This change makes explicit the previously implicit requirement that MROs maintain records necessary for accomplishing their duties. While the records are created on behalf of and remain the employers' records, the new recordkeeping section reflects the fact that, of necessity, there are records that must be maintained by the MRO if the MRO is to fulfill his or her regulatory role. The provision regarding forwarding of MRO records has been revised slightly from the NPRM to clarify that it is the employer's obligation to ensure that MRO records are forwarded to a new MRO, even if the employer is obtaining MRO services through a consortium. The change reflects the FAA's position that records associated with a particular employer's antidrug program remain the employer's records, even if the records are maintained by the MRO and even if the employer does not contract directly with the MRO. The FAA recognizes that a consortium may effect the actual transfer of records; however, the consortium does so only as an agent of the employers using its services to implement their programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

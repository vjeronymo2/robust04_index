			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): The power of the payout - Other Companies PowerGen, the electricity generator, is expected to announce half-year profits of Pounds 105m-Pounds 110m on Wednesday, up from Pounds 95m. City attention will focus on the dividend. Following a change in cover policy, analysts expect the payout to rise by at least 15 per cent annually over the next few years. But with the industry regulator considering whether to refer PowerGen and National Power to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, there is pressure to be conservative.                          *      *      * Northern Foods: Interim results, due on Tuesday, are expected to have a downbeat tone, although pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 68.4m to around Pounds 73m. The company has encountered worsening trading conditions since the second quarter. Deepening competition among the supermarkets has led to double-digit falls in doorstep milk volumes and put pressure on corner shops.                          *      *      * Thorn EMI: The music and rentals group announces half-year results on Tuesday, with pre-tax profits expected to be flat at around Pounds 105m, after roughly Pounds 10m of exceptional costs related to disposals. Interest will focus on compact disc pricing in the UK and US. Further questions are possible about the US subsidiary Rent-A-Center, which allegedly used unorthodox methods to extract money from late-payers.                          *      *      * Tate &amp; Lyle: Full-year results from the sweeteners group, out on Wednesday, were foreshadowed in September when the company warned profits would fall short of the Pounds 230.8m made in 1991, but show a marked improvement on 1992's Pounds 189.5m. Analysts are expecting around Pounds 220m. However, much of the gain will have come from favourable exchange rates.                          *      *      * Kwik Save: The UK's largest discount food retailer is expected on Wednesday to reveal an increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 125m-Pounds 128m. Although that is a healthy rise from last year's Pounds 110.6m, analysts have downgraded their forecasts from as high as Pounds 136m and are keen to hear Kwik Save's response to growing competition in the UK food market. There are fears that it is being squeezed between hard discounters and price aggression of the superstores.                          *      *      * International: In the US, today is expiry date for cable group Viacom's friendly tender offer for Paramount Communications. In Europe, the French government's public offer of shares in chemicals group Rhone Poulenc closes tomorrow. Nestle, the Swiss foods and mineral waters group, holds its autumn press conference on Wednesday.</p>

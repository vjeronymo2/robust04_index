			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 8 (KNS-KCNA) -- Japanese young people  have denounced the U.S anti-DPRK moves.    A resolution condemning the U.S. moves against the  Democratic  People's Republic of Korea was adopted at the Tokyo Youth Study  Session for Solidarity Between Japan and Korea held on April 25.    Noting that the United States was increasing military threat  and economic pressure against the DPRK and creating tension in  Northeast Asia, it called for a continuous movement for the  denuclearization of Northeast Asia.    On April 28, representative members of the executive  committee of the Japan Youth and Students Festival for Peace and  Friendship called at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and strongly  demanded that the United States immediately decide to  discontinue the Team Spirit joint manoeuvres, stop the  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, put an end to  military exercises and provocations, threat and antagonism  against the DPRK and seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear  issue through dialogue.    They staged a protest in front of the South Korean puppet  embassy in Tokyo.</p>

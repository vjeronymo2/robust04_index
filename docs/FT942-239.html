			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Japan's industrial output set to rise again after 32nd straight fall Japanese industrial output fell 1.4 per cent in the year to May - or 0.8 per cent from April, William Dawkins writes. This is the 32nd month in which annualised production has fallen, a record downturn. However, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast that it would rise by 1.9 per cent from May to June, to give a 0.3 per cent annualised rise for this month. Quarterly figures suggest that production may have started to turn the corner at the beginning of this year, heralding recovery. It rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent from the last three months of 1993 to the first quarter of this year and could rise by 1 per cent again in the second three months, said Miti. An official warned, however, that the yen's volatility against the dollar could upset that prediction. 'There are still ups and downs,' he said. Inventories of unsold goods reached 17.8 per cent of annual sales in May, down 2.2 per cent over the year. 'There was still a sense of excess' and industry needed to cut inventories still further, an official said. Stock levels are watched closely because an end to inventory adjustments has presaged a sustained rise in industrial output in previous recoveries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the </F> Abkhazian Supreme Council, by HOLOS UKRAYINY special  correspondent Lyudmyla Kokhanets in Abkhazia; date not given:  "We Were Ready To Die in Order To Live" -- first paragraph  published in a box]    [Text] The Chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme Council  Vladislav Ardzinba is 48 years old. In the West, he is  considered to be a sensational politician. He is  historian-ethnographer by profession and an expert in ancient  history, doctor of historical sciences. Incidentally, he also  heads the Abkhazian Institute of History, Ethnography, Language,  and Literature. In fact, the institute no longer exists:  During the time of the war, its building and the extremely rich  resources were almost completely destroyed.    [Kokhanets] They say that history repeats itself: First as  a tragedy and then -- as a farce. What we see in Abkhazia  indicates that history has repeated itself as a tragedy. From  the point of view of a historian, why, do you think, the past  has not taught people anything and why could the tragic analogy  not be avoided?    [Ardzinba] History did, in fact, repeat itself in Abkhazia.  A similar situation took shape in May 1918, right after the  Georgian Democratic Republic was created. Its troops occupied  our land, and the occupation lasted until 1925, when the  sovereign Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia was born. Then  there was the year 1992. The Georgian invaders again want to  teach the unruly Abkhazians a lesson with their weapons and  remind them, at gun point, that they are "not a people, but an  ethnic minority," so they should not press for rights. It is  true that, this time, the "reminding" with tanks did not last  too long -- just one year. Why does history not teach people  anything? Perhaps because a new generation is growing up, a  generation that has a poor knowledge of history and which was  brought up in the atmosphere of the propaganda asserting that  Abkhazia has always been an integral part of Georgia. As you can  see, there is nothing original about the style of our "big  brothers."    [Kokhanets] Excuse my poor knowledge of history, but the  majority of our people draw an analogy between Abkhazia and the  Crimea and not between Abkhazia and Ukraine....    [Ardzinba] They are deeply mistaken. One should not accuse  a people that has a long history of statehood, of separatism.  Back in the sixth century, the early feudal principalities of  Abkhazians, Apsylians [apsyly], and other Abkhazian tribes  united into the Abkhazian Kingdom with Leon I at the head.  Following the dynasty marriage between Leon I and daughter of  Georgian King Mirian, who found asylum in Abkhazia after  escaping from the persecution by cruel Murvan "the Deaf," the  kingdom also included lands of the present western Georgia. One  thinks sometimes that had Leon I known what that noble gesture  would cause to his descendants, he would not have been in any  hurry to warmly hug the persecuted neighbor.... However, these  are lyrical digressions. If one proceeds from historical  scientific facts, the assertion that "Abkhazia has always been  an integral part of Georgia" only makes one wonder how competent  its authors are.    Of course, there has been much in the long history of our  mutual relations: Joint struggle against various conquerors and  confrontation. However, I will not burden you with lessons in  Abkhazian history. I will say one thing: When somebody tries  to suppress a people, the latter develops immunity to that  force. This is confirmed by facts of recent history. During  the last decades of the existence of the [Soviet] Union,  Abkhazia remained one of the most turbulent regions.  Practically every decade, there used to be mass popular unrest:  Abkhazians painfully reacted to the suppression of their  national culture and language, mass resettlement, and  destruction of the national elite. The well- tested method that  Stalin and Beria had used to deal with the hated people --  assimilation -- nearly destroyed our people's roots, but when  there appeared tanks on the streets, the patience of the  Abkhazians was exhausted. They achieved freedom and  independence. You know, in many Abkhazian families, people even  raise toasts to invaders: Thanks for waking us up....    [Kokhanets] The Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is looked upon  as a war of Christianity against Islam.    [Ardzinba] This is ridiculous. Abkhazia is one of the  oldest Christian countries: The spread of the Christian  religion to our land started as early as the second century. At  present, Orthodox faith and Catholicism develop very actively in  our country. There is a synagogue and a Buddhist temple,  but..., unfortunately, not a single mosque. This is Islamic  expansion for you. I used the word "unfortunately," because I  believe that in any civilized society, all religious faiths must  coexist, and people must decide for themselves where to pray to  the Creator.    [Kokhanets] There exists a medical notion -- "the narrowing  down of consciousness." A person becomes fixed on a certain  thought or action and does not perceive anything beyond that.  War is also characterized by the "narrowing down of  consciousness." What do you think was the reason for the  "disease" in those who raised weapons against civilians? I  looked through the chronicle of the first days of the war --  bullets fell on beaches and streets of the town.... Not only  Abkhazians perished....    [Ardzinba] Not only. The war unleashed by Tbilisi was not  only a crime against the Abkhazian people, but also against  other people residing here, especially against those Georgians  who lived in Abkhazia. The cause of the "disease" is known, we  have already discussed it with you: Massive propaganda imposed  upon Georgians over many years: Abkhazia is ours and Abkhazians  are also Georgians, but only second-rate ones. When one is  exposed to the hypnotic action of such propaganda, one tends to  develop such a "narrowing down of the consciousness."    [Kokhanets] Another version of the reason for Tbilisi's  conflicts with its autonomous republics is the following: As  soon as a war among Georgians themselves starts in Georgia, the  cunning politicians transfer the center of tension to provinces  -- Abkhazia, Adzharia, or South Ossetia. It is as though the  march on Abkhazia was an attempt on the part of Tbilisi to  quench the fire of its own civil war with the gasoline of the  Abkhazian conflict. Do you agree with such a version?    [Ardzinba] I believe that this is one of the main reasons  why Georgian troops were sent to Abkhazia. Every time, when it  is necessary to distract the people's attention from the  internal political struggle, a slogan is put forward:  "Everybody get ready to march on...." This can even be  followed by numerous examples of the recent period. I think  that, with a sensible approach, it was possible to avoid  bloodshed both in South Ossetia and in Abkhazia. This is also  possible today, if the leaders had enough courage to tell their  own people the truth.    [Kokhanets] Do you believe in such courage?    [Ardzinba] You know what particularly disturbed me during  this war? That there was not a single person who would question  the need to bring troops to the territory of unarmed Abkhazia as  a just settlement of tension in our relations. Not a single  voice, can you imagine? Not a single protest -- what are you  doing, stop! That aggressive silence simply killed me.  However, this is perhaps the state of our society. The events  that recently took place on the territory of Georgia, once again  confirm this distressing diagnosis. A president was elected in  Georgia -- whether good or bad is another question. I am not,  personally, a supporter of Gamsakhurdia. However, he was elected  by the people, and he should have been deposed in a lawful  manner. Instead, a coup d'etat took place. Its main initiator  was, of course, Shevardnadze, who seemed to have found himself  on the fringes of politics, but did not lose strength. As a  result of that coup, Shevardnadze came to power in an iniquitous  way. Yet, the international community recognized it as a lawful  procedure and enabled Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] to  conclude that he could clear his path toward the goal by force.  That force showed itself in Abkhazia.    [Kokhanets] Did it not occur to you, when you saw tanks on  the streets of Sukhumi, that Shevardnadze could not, on his own,  adopt the decision to bring in troops?    [Ardzinba] No, it did not. I am convinced that he had  received full consent to that. Obviously, leaders of the most  powerful states had discussed that issue. I can assume that  Shevardnadze had assured them that the troops were brought in to  guard the railroad and they pretended that they believed him.  So he did not have to wait too long for permission. We are not  naive: We understand very well that one phone call was  sufficient to halt the tanks. Judging by everything, there was  no such call. On that day, 14 August 1992, I tried to get  through to Tbilisi, but nobody picked up the receiver. I  realized that the "big brothers" were demonstrating: Abkhazia  is a graphic example of how others will be punished if they  contemplate seceding with their age-old territory.    Shevardnadze later asserted that the Abkhazian leadership  and  I in particular had given permission to bring in the troops.  This is blasphemy. The day before, on the 13th, when we  learned that the troops of the State Council were heading for  Mingrelia, I telephoned the Georgian leader and asked him what  was the purpose of that and whether the tanks would proceed  further to Abkhazia. Mr. Shevardnadze assured me: No, by no  means! On the 14th, the tanks appeared on our streets.    [Kokhanets] The state of transition from peace to war is  accompanied by the feeling of irrationality in what is going on.  I felt that throughout the week of my stay in the land, where  there only remain traces of war. What I see around me is  incomprehensible. Where is that boundary between war and peace?    [Ardzinba] One can only comprehend and feel this in full  measure if one experiences all of this. When we look back to  August 1992, we realize how naive we were. I remember a  colleague of mine tell his family by telephone: Stay at home,  do not go into the street, they will not come to the house....  Awful. We still hoped that it was possible to come to an  agreement through negotiations, that it was possible to convince  them: Take away your troops and tanks. Unfortunately, too  late, only after we became sure that those people had come to  kill us and kill us in our own homes, did we proceed to active  defense. We had no other alternative. That process of  transition from the state of peace to war was very difficult.  However, I admit, the opposite process -- from the state of war  to peace -- was even more difficult.    [Kokhanets] With whom, on the other side, do you think it is  possible to hold a dialogue? To whom is it possible to turn, at  a simple human level, for informal conciliation -- Georgia, for  example, has always been famous for its wise intellectuals.    [Ardzinba] We are ready to talk with anyone who looks at  things soberly and is prepared to critically analyze everything  that happened. Unfortunately, I do not see signs of growing  sobriety. If only their leaders tried to tell the truth -- not  to us, but to their own people that the bringing in of troops  and the war that was unleashed were a mistake and that they are  ready to take the responsibility upon themselves. Attempts to  mislead everybody are continuing. This is also attested to by  Eduard Shevardnadze's last speech at the UN Security Council  session. Again the same crafty political tricks: We guarded  the railroad, we fought against terrorists.... It is impossible  to conduct a policy through deception. Although I am sure that,  deep in his heart, the Georgian leader realizes that he  miscalculated.    As regards intellectuals.... I am sure that such people  exist. I know them. However, I would not like to name them, as  I do not want to bring disaster upon them. The only way to save  the hurt ambition of the Georgian people is, I reiterate, to  tell them the truth.    [Kokhanets] In Tbilisi, I met with refugees from Abkhazia.  It was difficult for many of them to grasp the truth -- they  tell of terrible things -- torture, persecution, and murder of  women and children. Just recall at least the forced escape  through the snow- covered mountains of Svanetia....    [Ardzinba] Unfortunately, war is always associated with  violations of human rights and with large numbers of innocent  victims. I could quote thousands of cases of similar violations  of human rights by our adversary. Besides, the Georgian side is  deliberately stirring up passions. You were probably told about  mass atrocities at the stadium in Gagry, about dismembered  corpses and severed heads.... People do not know that, at the  worst time of the war, we sent our soldiers to guard Georgian  villages, so that nobody would try to take revenge upon the  population for the relatives who had been murdered. One more  fact. Whereas during the war, Abkhazians could not speak their  native language in the street for fear of death, just go to the  market place today -- Georgians freely sell their merchandise  there, and they work in the town and speak Georgian, and nobody  threatens them with death for that. One must simply stop being  biased and try to understand that if, some day, tanks had  entered Tbilisi, Georgians would have reacted in exactly the  same way. Of course, there are incidents of persecution against  Georgians. It would be a lie to deny this. However,  authorities decisively condemn this. Dozens of criminal cases  have been initiated in our country to investigate facts of  violation of human rights. Even sentences have already been  announced -- the death penalty.    [Kokhanets] Does the fact that individual UNSO [Ukrainian  National Self-Defense] fighters participated in the war on the  Georgian side affect your attitude toward Ukraine?    [Ardzinba] Ukraine is a great power, and we should not spoil  relations with it on the basis of just one fact. I think that,  by fighting for the territorial integrity of Georgia, the UNSO  members did not antagonize Russia, but supported its imperial  encroachments upon Ukraine. However, forget about them....    Representatives of Western powers told me that in Geneva an  organization exists called "Friends of Georgia," which is  represented by the most powerful world powers. Is it really a  worthy occupation for the whole world to fight against such a  small people? On the contrary, it must be protected. Moreover,  if somebody really wants good for Georgia and strives to play  the role of a peace-keeper, let him create the committee  "Friends of Georgia and Abkhazia." This will really be a  struggle for establishing peace in the Caucasus. However....  Unfortunately, the one-sided position still marks international  diplomacy.    We are interested in developing most friendly relations with  Ukraine. There are two sanatoriums on the territory of Abkhazia  and they will continue to be the property of Ukraine. Let your  people come and have rest in our country. Tension will not  prevail here forever. Ukraine provided humanitarian aid for us,  and we will always be grateful for that to its great and  beautiful people.    [Kokhanets] Things are clear with Ukraine. How can you  comment upon the statements by the Georgian side to the effect  that Russia helped Abkhazia win this war?    [Ardzinba] I think that this is the fantasy of the Georgian  politicians, who are ashamed to admit that small Abkhazia  defeated them. The defeat from strong Russia is much less  painful for their pride. On the contrary, one of the reasons  for unleashing the war was the fact that, in accordance with the  Tashkent agreement, Russia transferred to Tbilisi those weapons  that had been deployed on the territory of Georgia (this was  forbidden with regard to those countries where there were  interethnic conflicts). When Tbilisi acquired tanks, aviation,  and artillery -- and there was an unarmed people nearby -- it  was difficult to resist the temptation to resolve all problems  by armed force. Therefore those who gave the weapons to the  aggressor bear much of the responsibility.    Of course, there are different forces in Russia. I am  convinced that the people are very well disposed toward us.  With regard to leaders, I will not make a secret out of the  fact that there are forces interested in maintaining tension in  Abkhazia. We know what these forces are.    We have two alternative ways: Abkhazia's complete  independence and a possible search for compromise with Georgia.  However, we will not allow our further relations to be based  upon the principle of relations between the center and a colony.  Of course, this must be discussed at a negotiating table and,  possibly, through a referendum, but not by pressure or physical  annihilation.    [Kokhanets] You are speaking about the possibility of a  referendum?    [Ardzinba] Yes. The main form for determining our future is  through studying public opinion. However, now, we cannot hold a  referendum: That part of the Georgian population, which, in  accordance with the agreement, must return to the territory of  Abkhazia, has not yet returned. All those people who did not  fight against us, did not kill Abkhazians, and did not plunder  our homes, will have such a possibility.    [Kokhanets] What are the criteria for determining guilt or  innocence?    [Ardzinba] In the course of military actions, we seized  lists of those who had belonged to armed formations of Georgians  and participated in the war on the Georgian side (many  Georgians, like also, incidentally, local Ukrainians, fought on  the Abkhazian side). We have testimonies of victims and a whole  card-index of documents and statements. Of course, the gate on  the Inguri [River] will not be opened to war criminals or  bandits.    [Kokhanets] Do you have problems with Abkhazia's Russian-  speaking population?    [Ardzinba] Unfortunately, we do. Quite a number.  Incidentally, when Russia declared its economic blockade of  Abkhazia, this primarily affected local Russians. In words, the  present Moscow politicians promote the protection of Russians  throughout the world, but in fact, they do everything so that  those Russians have problems.    [Kokhanets] I will ask you an indiscreet question, Vladislav  Grigoryevich. During these days, I became convinced that the  people -- from the very old to toddlers -- love you very much:  Without exaggeration, they almost idolize you. Will not yet  another personality cult result from such nationwide adoration?  Are you not alerted by this?    [Ardzinba] Perhaps much depends upon the person. However,  you exaggerate about nationwide adoration. Even if it had been,  it is possible to avoid the personality cult: It is very  important to build the structure of the state apparatus in such  a way that the people would be able to control any power. It  seems to me that this is precisely what will happen in our  country. I will tell you honestly, I am not afraid of creating  my own cult, because it is not supreme power or omnipotence that  I am dreaming about, but my return to the Institute of History,  Language, and Literature. My place and my destiny are there. I  will, in every way, take advantage of favorable circumstances in  order to go back to my favorite occupation....    [Kokhanets] Tell me, are you afraid of death?    [Ardzinba] Simply stated, during the time of the war I  became convinced that life is much better. We were ready to die  in order to live.</p>

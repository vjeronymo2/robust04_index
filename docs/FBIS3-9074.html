			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text of the agreement on the federation of Croats and </F> Bosniak-Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina" signed in Washington on  18 March -- read by announcer]    [Text] Today we confirm the proposed constitution of the  Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as a preliminary  agreement concerning future economic and military cooperation  between the Federation [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] and the Republic  of Croatia.    These agreements mark our common commitment to restoring  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and throughout our region. We have  agreed to step up our efforts in the search for an overall  political settlement that ensures the protection of human rights  and the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of all states in the region.    The Bosniak and Croatian delegations affirm their commitment  to propose this constitution to a Constitutional Assembly as the  basis for a federation ensuring full national equality,  democratic relations, and the highest standards of human rights  and freedoms. All delegations lend their support to the  principles of the confederation, which can lay the foundation  for a more prosperous and secure future for the peoples of the  region.    To broaden our cooperation, we have decided that we will  immediately do the following:    1. Form a joint group to be the sole representative of the  Bosniaks and Croats in all negotiations with the Serbs  concerning an overall settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    2. Ask the CSCE to appoint an ombudsman to begin work in  Bosnia-Herzegovina with the mandate described in the proposed  constitution.    3. Invite the European Union to organize its administration  of the district of Mostar as soon as possible.    4. Continue the full and immediate implementation of the  measures agreed by the military transition team in Split on 12  March, and encourage steps for the further disengagement of  forces.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Iliescu heads for re-election MR Ion Iliescu, Romania's president, looked to be heading for re-election after yesterday's presidential election run-off against Mr Emil Constantinescu. By 6pm 60 per cent of the 16.4m electorate had voted - a turnout not far below that recorded in the election's first round on September 27. Political analysts had believed Mr Constantinescu could only score well if urban voters and especially the young, many of whom did not vote in the first round, turned out in higher numbers than rural voters. Mr Iliescu, once a close aide to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, emerged a firm favourite after the first round in which he won 47 per cent of the vote, 16 points more than Mr Constantinescu, his nearest rival. He then outpolled Mr Constantinescu by 2-1 in the countryside where nearly half of Romania's 23m inhabitants live. The president, who this time needs only a simple majority to secure a four-year second term, was also expected to pick up most of the 11 per cent polled by Mr Gheorghe Funar, a anti-Hungarian nationalist, who finished third in the first round of voting. Mr Constantinescu, a university rector, refused to give up the fight in the two weeks following September 27 but received little support from the Democratic Convention (DC), the loose coalition of 18 reform-minded opposition parties which nominated him for president. Instead, many DC leaders admitted openly that Mr Constantinescu, a hitherto unknown academic, had no chance of beating Mr Iliescu, a skilled politician whom many Romanians credit with engineering the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989.</p>

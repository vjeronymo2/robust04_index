			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Marielba Nunez] </F>   [Text] Recognition of about 240,000 hectares of land  located south of Caicara del Orinoco as Piaroa territory is  currently being requested by the representatives of that  indigenous community, as they fear that concessions covering  that area will be granted. This would threaten the ecology and  the development plans they have been undertaking in recent years.    This is according to statements by Jose Gregorio Rodriguez,  Miguel Gonzalez, and Guillermo Tovar, representatives of the  Piaroa community and members of the civic association called  Original Peoples of the Chivapure Forest Reserve, Porfochi.    "We want the different governmental agencies to recognize  the  Piaroa people of the Suapure, Parguaza, and Guaniamo River  basins as the legitimate inhabitants of these lands. Our future  is uncertain in this region because there are plans to exploit  the lumber on these lands."    They add that they cannot agree with this possibility  because  it would mean the end of the organization that the Piaroas have  achieved there. So far, to prevent the exploitation of lumber,  they have approached the National Agrarian Institute, the  Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, and the agrarian court,  which are the agencies that oversee matters concerning  landholding among the indigenous people.    "We need an opportunity to continue our self-managed  development project, which includes the rational use of natural  resources, such as extracting seje [a kind of palm tree] oil, a  medicinal product that can be used to cure different types of  illnesses; producing honey; and raising buffalo. We have done  all this through cooperatives."    They add that they know of the plans to grant concessions in  these areas, and they have been denouncing this situation for  the last four years. On several occasions they have submitted  documents requesting that their territory in the Suapure area be  recognized.    "Legally we are basing ourselves on Article 77 of the  National Constitution, on the rights of the indigenous peoples;  Article 2 of the Agrarian Reform, which establishes the  recognition of the indigenous peoples' right to land; and  Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization. This not  only establishes our right to the land, but also our cultural  right to conserve our language and customs."</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GRACE': THE GANG THAT COULDN'T FIT IN  </P> <P> Director Phil Joanou's wildly indulgent and artily self-conscious gangster  melodrama, "State of Grace" opens with a St. Patrick's Day parade in grainy  slo-mo. It's not only a ringer for Ivan Passer's opening scene in "Cutter's  Way" -- a movie that worked -- but the way each moment is held suggests  cinematic overkill and nothing that follows contradicts that impression.  </P> <P> "State of Grace" (citywide) is played against an interesting background: the  Irish-American gang known as the Westies whose turf was New York's reeking  Hell's Kitchen. Or what used to reek and used to be called Hell's Kitchen until  gentrification hit, sometime in the late '70s.  </P> <P> After that it was called Clinton, and as one local says mournfully, "The  neighborhood's disappeared in a tide of yuppies and dog (droppings)." Left  beached by that tide were its Irish gangsters, a singularly cold-blooded  collection of murderers, even by the pathologic standards of street gangs.  Bitter and alienated, they finally tried to ally themselves with the Italian  Mafia, and on this hangs part of "State of Grace's" plot.  </P> <P> Frankie Flanner (Ed Harris) now heads the Westies from the safe environs of  upscale New Jersey, while his hotblooded and decidedly unstable younger brother  Jackie (Gary Oldman) remains behind, taunting the Mafioso at every turn. The  Flanners' younger sister, Kathleen (Robin Wright), has turned her back on their  violence, to live uptown and work at a Park Avenue hotel.  </P> <P> Taking Westie Terry Noonan out of that background for a dozen years, then  dropping him back among his floundering gang members is a not-bad idea; having  Sean Penn play him is an even better one. As the troubled Terry, whose last 12  years have been in a very different setting, Penn has one of the most complete  and complex characters since his father-son partnership with Christopher Walken  in "At Close Range," and he is marvelous. While hanging out with Jackie, Terry  also rebuilds his passionate relationship with Kathleen -- straining his  loyalties even further.  </P> <P> "State of Grace" has a poetic script by the late playwright Dennis McIntyre,  who has an ear for the lingo ("I'm an old man and I'm eatin' stewed tomatoes  out of a can," pensioner Burgess Meredith says, about his reduced  circumstances.) McIntyre also has a taste for mixing grim hilarity with sudden  mayhem. His view of these lethal, crumbling Irishmen is that they are a  hopeless lot: on their way to back up Frankie as he parlays with a Mafia  chieftain, the whole, sorry gang fits in the back of a panel truck and once  loaded, no one has a clue how to get to heavily Italian Mott Street.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, what director Joanou makes of all these promising elements is  thudding pretentiousness. His first movie, "Three O'Clock High," should have  been a warning -- this was a young director playing with a million gimmicky  ideas, all of them awful. His second film, the documentary portrait "U2: Rattle  and Hum," for which "State of Grace's" lyric cinematographer, Jordan  Cronenweth, was also a cameraman, was a very different matter, but Joanou had  that charismatic band to work with. Now he is back dealing with actors and  every indulgence, including a two hour and 14 minute running time, is on  display.  </P> <P> Gary Oldman, who needs no encouragement, has been allowed to start his  performance somewhere in the stratosphere and spiral upward from there. Ed  Harris, as the world's most muddled gang leader, is uncharacteristically muted  and poor, lovely Robin Wright is reduced to sitting, back lit, in her  apartment, waiting for some new disaster to burst through her door. Invariably,  it does.  </P> <P> When Joanou stages his final, hyperviolent shoot-out, his gunmen rush at each  other, one firing from the left side of the screen, one from the right, again  and again. So that we don't forget the Irishness of it all, Joanou cuts in the  St. Patrick's Day paraders too, until we worry that one of them, 40 blocks away  uptown, is going to drop dead, caught in the movie's crossfire.  </P> <P> 'STATE OF GRACE'  </P> <P> An Orion Pictures release of a Cinehaus production.

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Budget extravaganza and electoral headache WHILE THE announcement of the general election may have caused some parliamentary stomachs to churn in Westminster, it has also generated a bout of gleeful hand-rubbing among tax accountants. A combination of the Budget, electoral uncertainty, and new-found aggressive marketing have created a platform during the last few weeks by which tax practices have gained a higher profile and sold more services than probably ever before. While the heyday of Budget-related marketing may now have been passed, the prospects of a change of government have given business a strong compensatory boost. Arthur Andersen was the first firm to land a slim summary of the Budget proposals in this writer's in-tray first thing in the morning after the Chancellor's speech, with the ink barely dry. The booklet - produced in conjunction with the Confederation of British Industry - was arriving in Volvo showrooms and Holiday Inns at the same time. Others firms have been equally aggressive. Touche Ross had copies of its guide to the Budget on the QE2 and other Cunard ships the following day. Salvoes from other firms generated healthy income for the Royal Mail. There were evening presentations and next-day breakfasts for clients and journalists alike. The reason for the gimmickry is simple. As Mr John Barnsley, head of tax at Price Waterhouse, puts it: 'Tax is very big business. Internationally it pulled us more than Dollars 1bn last year.' Two years ago his firm sent its Budget day analysis by computer to New York, where it was printed and ready for the evening Concorde flight back to London. If media references are anything to go by, the Budget has pushed the profession into higher prominence than ever. Last month the top six accountancy firms were mentioned in 106 national newspaper articles on the budget. That compared with only 60 references for the same period last year and 54 in 1990. (Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte toppedthe 1992 list, followed by Touche Ross and Ernst &amp; Young.) As the firms hold their post-mortems on the marketing success of budget day, most are subdued. Mr Roger White, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick, points out that his firm's post-budget briefing was deliberately 'de-glossified' this year and that it has abandoned the 'lavish entertainment' of the past. That is due partly to a budget with a fewer significant changes than in previous years, and with fewer still translated into legislation in the Finance Act. It also reflects thinking that a new Budget may follow later in the year. The extravaganza has also become something of a victim of the relaxation of rules on marketing and advertising by the profession in the mid-1980s. Before then, it was one of the few chances accountants had to get their name out to the public. Now, in an era of intense price competition and ethical guidelines that allow firms to indulge in cold-calling, budget breakfasts look positively old-fashioned. 'We have discussed abandoning the Budget booklet, but the feeling is that our clients like to receive it,' says Mr David Marks, a tax partner with marketing responsibilities at Arthur Andersen. He says the booklet coincides with a more detailed internal document distributed to tax partners, which helps them instruct clients personally. That view is shared by Mr Peter Collier, chief executive of the Charter Group, which provides professional support services to small accountancy firms. Last month one of the services was 35,000 copies of a Budget summary distributed to client firms' doorsteps the morning after. 'There are two schools of thought,' he says. ''Everybody does a Budget summary, so why bother?' or 'If we're not doing one and everyone else is, there is a danger of not keeping our profile high enough.'' Most firms in his group have taken the latter view, much to his surprise: 'There are more important ways to show clients value for money, but it's very easy to be noticed as the one firm in, say, Rotherham which didn't produce a summary.' Even so, more subtle, discriminating marketing techniques still make great play of the Budget and its corollaries. Mr Barnsley of PW is sceptical about the spate of skimpy instant publications produced by accountants. This year he established a media hotline for the shadow Budget, which provided advice to journalists interpreting the proposals. He says the firm has also been quietly advising the major political parties about the implications of tax changes, while treading a delicate line in striving to remain apolitical and to ensure that its comments do not impinge on work for clients. Coopers earlier this week provided free of charge to national newspapers a detailed analysis of the fiscal 'holes'it believes exist in the manifestos. While the Budget may have had a subdued impact on accountancy firms, the strong possibility of a Conservative defeat in the election has helped increase work for their tax staff beyond the advice that is normal at the end of the tax year. Mr Peter Wyman, a tax partner with Coopers,says: 'People are now very worried. Up until the last two weeks they somehow thought the Conservatives were going to get back in. Now, if they are not panicking, they are certainly concerned.' MAI, the financial services group, admitted at the start of the week that it is paying bonuses to more than 300 staff in one of its money broking subsidiaries in gold bars through Jersey. That makes the payments exempt from National Insurance contributions. BHS, the retailer, has emerged as one of the latest in a series of employers to be paying bonuses to senior managers before the year end, which would escape any rises in income tax under Labour. At the same time there is evidence that some companies are deferring capital expenditure in the hope of greater tax relief under Labour - a consideration that is also delaying the prospects for economic recovery. Accountants are reporting an increase in inquiries as news of such tactics trickles out. Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield, national technical tax partner at Touche Ross, estimates that the election has generated perhaps five times the level of interest and activity normal at this time of year, and even three times that of the previous general election in 1987, when a Tory victory seemed more probable. It is not all good news for the tax practitioners this year, however. Mr Norman Lamont's Budget promised a shift from quarterly to monthly VAT remittances for the largest payers as part of moves to help progress towards the single European market. Several accountancy firms will be among the businesses required to provide cash more frequently. The proposal to bring together both the budget and the government's expenditure plans in December for future years (which has been echoed by the opposition parties) also means trouble for some accountancy firms. That month is one of the busiest of the year for audit work, and it will place considerable additional demands on staff already coping with extra tax work. Mr Peter Wyman from Coopers is one partner who concedes that a Labour victory would probably be good for his firm. Tax legislation is likely to be more complicated, and higher rates are likely to encourage more people and companies to seek advice on avoidance strategies. Much, however, that the Labour party would give indirectly to the accountancy firms through new tax legislation, it might well recoup directly in extra corporate and income taxes.</p>

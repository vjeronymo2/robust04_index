			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CORONER LISTS MCCALLUM DRUGS  </P> <P> Jason McCallum, the adopted son of actress Jill Ireland, died after playing  "chemical roulette" by ingesting a combination of painkillers and muscle  relaxants, the coroner's office said today.  </P> <P> McCallum's death was attributed to a drug overdose late last month, but it was  unknown what drugs were involved until today's announcement of the results of  toxicological tests.  </P> <P> Coroner's office spokesman Bob Dambacher said the tests found evidence that  McCallum, 27, ingested codeine and a prescription muscle relaxer called  carisoprodol.  </P> <P> Two other drugs, morphine and meprobamate, were also found in his body. Those  drugs were not directly ingested by McCallum, but turned up in his body after  the codeine and carisoprodol broke down, Dambacher said.  </P> <P> "It's like a chemical roulette, you take one drug and then another drug and  they gang up on you," Dambacher said.  </P> <P> McCallum, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, was found dead in the  bathroom of his Hollywood Hills apartment Nov. 7.  </P> <P> His death has been listed as an accident.  </P></p>

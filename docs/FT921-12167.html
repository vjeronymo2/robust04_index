			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: Talking Heads - Comedy Theatre Whatever else may be said about Alan Bennett's Talking Heads, it certainly isn't funny. Adjectives that come to mind are racist, cruel, condescending and bilious. It is also quintessentially English. Talking Heads has the authentic English whinge; if there is anything to complain about, complain - not because you that something might be done about it, but because of the satisfaction of making the complaint. That may be unfair. Bennett's three monologues, part of a series first shown on television, are plainly meant to be about loneliness: in particular, the loneliness of the lower middle class, women who are not married and who see their expectations fading away. As you might expect from Bennett, the flavour is northern, dour: it is as if the second world war is still going on. The English are enjoying adversity; having a good laugh about it, or a good cry, as the case may be. People who saw the series on television have told me that it worked very well. I can report only on the stage version. The trouble is that it lacks both satire and sympathy. The formula is mechanical. It may well be true, for example, that many English people have resented the post-war influx of blacks and Asians to this country. It is inadequate, however, to make sniggering jokes either about the immigrants or reactions to them by the indigenous community. That is what Bennett does all the time in this triplet. 'They sell mangoes in the Post Office' or 'I smelled curry on my Woman's Own'. It is the same patronising attitude towards blacks as practised by Harold Pinter. It may be true that most English people are snobs, all the way down the class line. Yet what is funny about a man who exposes himself outside of Sainsbury's and the riposte of one of Bennett's characters, 'As mother says, Tesco's you could understand'? In short, this is abysmal stuff. There is a touch of English nostalgia in the woman who notes the number of policemen nowadays who wear glasses and another who remembers as she is dying that she has always been lucky with buses - 'I don't think I've ever had to wait for more than two minutes'. But that's about it. The first monologue by Patricia Routledge is the longest; one assumed that it was therefore the weakest. It turned out be the best. From then on, it is down hill all the way. Bennett does a turn himself as an unmarried son, still living with his mother and suspected of reading too much. Then Ms Routledge comes back as an arch/complainer letter-writer who discovers that she has never felt so free as when she is sent to prison. Possibly the message is that England's a prison. Certainly Bennett's England is. One is agog to see what his characters will do with a citizen's charter. In my review on Monday I referred to Brian Friel's Faith Healer at the Royal Court as a new play. It was first performed in 1980, but was new to me. I apologise.</p>

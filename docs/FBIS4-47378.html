V. Yefimov and A. V. Prusov, Sea </F> Hydrophysical Institute, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences; UDC  551.526:551.513 (261.1)]    [Abstract] Sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic,  the severity of winters in the northern hemisphere, and the  position of the intertropical convergence zone were analyzed to  reveal trends. It was found, for example, that anomalously large  shifts in the zone preceded anomalously warm winters in the  U.S., and anomalously small shifts preceded cold winters.  Low-frequency variability of sea surface temperature was  determined from 34 years of data. Data filtering and  normalization procedures are described. Low-frequency  variability of the surface temperature of the North Atlantic  demonstrates a significant spatial variability (up to 2C)  which is probably linked with the variability of ocean  circulation. Two types of remote links between the sea surface  temperature and meridional motion of the intertropical  convergence zone on interannual scales are found, and these  appear to be related to quasi-stable atmospheric anomalies. The  local interaction of ocean and atmosphere is probably dominant  in the generation of quasi-stable sea surface temperature  anomalies (as opposed to horizontal advective heat transfer by  ocean currents), but this conclusion requires further  confirmation.

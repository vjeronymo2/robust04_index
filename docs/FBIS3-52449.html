			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bina Barzel] </F>   [Text] This Wednesday [22 December], Yehudit Biton ordered  a bouquet of violets sent to the office of Knesset Member [MK]  David Levi. "It was his birthday yesterday," Levi's executive  secretary said, "I also ordered a cake for lunch as his friends  will be coming to issue congratulations."    Friends indeed showed up at the Tel Aviv offices of the  voluntary society for the election of David Levi, which are  situated in a ground floor apartment in an old building, rented  for three years and recently renovated, on Balfour Street. Rubi  Rivlin, Mikha'el Kleiner [former Likud MK's], Moti Mis'ani,  David 'Amar from Nesher, Gabi Lalush from Dimona, Yehuda Bros  from Yavne, Ya'aqov Bardugo from the Union of Local Authorities  in Israel, Aharon Abu-Hatzera [former Likud MK], Levi's sons,  Shim'on and Jackie, and his brother Armond. David Levi has  apparently not dropped out of the political arena, he has just  purposely adopted a lower profile.    At the entrance to the apartment there are shelves with  files. Yehudit has glued a picture of Levi on each file. There  is a ficus plant, artificial flowers, and potted plants on the  small desks. A modern print adorns the wall, and gray carpets  blend nicely with the black furniture.    David Levi, 54, has organized his network of contacts and  political activities from this apartment ever since the last  Likud convention. This is where one can find his friends from  all over Israel, every Thursday, which is "Tel Aviv Day" for  most of the political system. It has recently become apparent  that this apartment may also conceal a steadily ticking time  bomb, aimed at Binyamin Netanyahu.    This is because Levi, despite his self-enforced temporary  abstinence from power struggles inside the Likud, will soon face  decisions whose implementation may threaten Netanyahu's chances  to be elected prime minister. The very fact that Levi has  confronted Netanyahu and refused to accept his leadership are  already causing a steady erosion in the latter's standing.    Netanyahu's supporters claim that Levi's silence is no  silence at all, but rather a cleverly muted struggle, which  allows the members of Levi's camp to act against the Likud  chairman and thus harm him.    Levi: "I want you to know I do not sit around planning. I  do not deal with this."    David Levi holds his cards very close to his chest. It has  always been his custom to keep his moves secret until the very  last minute. Like many politicians, his assessment is that the  political situation will only be clear after the results of the  implementation of the Oslo agreement are known. A source close  to Levi says: "the assumption is that next January will be the  decisive month. It is clear that Rabin has invited the  Americans to pressure him on the Syrian track."    Another assessment is that Rabin will issue a call for  national unity, after implementing the first stage of the Oslo  agreement, the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Then  the Likud will face a real problem.    Speaking off the record, people in Levi's camp reveal their  uncertainties: Is it a good idea to initiate a move to hold  another round of primaries to choose the Likud candidate for  prime minister? Perhaps it would be better to push for a  national unity government? What can Levi's camp gain out of  generating internal struggles within the Likud? Is there no  alternative but to eventually leave the Likud, as was once  recommended by several members of Levi's camp, including his  brother, Maxim? What would happen if an effort was made to  garner the support of 75 percent of Central Committee members  for holding repeat primaries for the movement's leadership and  it failed, with Binyamin Netanyahu remaining at the head of the  party? David Levi does not seem to have any clear answers to  these questions.    One option he was prepared to reject categorically this  week was the possibility of moving over to Labor, either with or  without his group of MK's, as the late Moshe Dayan did at the  time. "Says who?" Levi laughs. "Look, I am the subject of all  sorts of predictions and speculation. They make me laugh. I  remain loyal to my own way. There is no way I will move over to  Labor."    However, some of Levi's followers are beginning to lose  their  patience and are pressuring him to take some action one way or  another. One follower says: "There is a real feeling that the  leadership is faltering, that Raful Eytan's standing in the  polls is better than that of Bibi Netanyahu. So far, Levi has  been biding his time in silence, but the day is getting near  when he will have to make up his mind."    Two trends can be seen in Levi's camp: Some of his men  believe he should join Bibi and take second place in the  leadership. If Bibi fails, Levi would naturally take his place.  These men are encouraged by messages reaching Levi, whereby  Bibi is prepared to give him pretty much everything short of the  leadership in exchange for his cooperation. This option is  apparently backed by Rubi Rivlin, Levi's brother Maxim, Aharon  Abu-Hatzera, and Dudi Appel. Off the record, activists say that  at this point Levi should desist from running for the  premiership, seeing that this is not a realistic option at the  moment.    A second option: to contest the leadership, either in  internal or external primaries and, at the same time, to openly  challenge the Likud chairman. Mikha'el Kleiner and Moti  Mish'ani are "pushing" for such a move. Kleiner: "In the first  round, Rabin would get 40 percent, and the rest would be split  between Levi, Raful, and Bibi. In addition to Levi's traditional  supporters, many middle-of-the-road voters appreciate Levi and  would vote for him. The same applies to religious and  ultra-Orthodox voters. There is a chance of Levi coming out  first among the right-wing candidates in the first round and  then getting the votes of the entire right-wing camp, which  would close ranks behind him in the second round."    Of course, another option is to keep the present situation:  to be considered the No. 2 man, but to stay outside. Given its  present condition, such a stance could lead to the Likud's  disintegration and force political activists to look for a new  home.    A victory party was held last week in the home of David  'Amar, head of the Nesher local council and an old-time  associate of Levi. Many leading members of Levi's camp are heads  of local councils. These men naturally dream of being part of  the list of candidates to the Knesset, and a gung ho camp could  promote them politically.    Small wonder that in the jolly get-together in Nesher some  people once again called on Levi to set out on a fight within  the Likud, using the excuse of the political situation, the  agreement with the PLO, and the Likud's stuttering response.  Levi's camp must see to the well-being of the Likud and the  country, they said. Levi was reluctant to become personally  involved in such a move, but he did not curb the initiative to  summon a Likud Central Committee session to discuss the issue.    Neither did Levi conceal his opposition to Netanyahu's  proposal that the Likud formulate a political plan in response  to the Oslo agreement. Without using Bibi's name, Levi said:  "The political issue is the most critical to the Likud, to its  performance and survival. When the government signed the  agreement with the PLO, the Likud should have displayed  determination, endurance, and loyalty to its own way. However,  the Likud did not pass the test. There were people who talked  about the need to discuss the Likud's policy and even to amend  its platform."    Levi survived the trauma of moving from the government to  the opposition relatively easily. His friends decided to keep  the organization set up to promote his election in the Likud  primaries. This organization also finances all the  expenditures incurred by his activities. Its members pay  "according to their ability," about $100 or more a month.  Incidentally, the initiative to keep the organization alive  came from Rubi Rivlin, "so that Levi need not depend on some guy  with big bucks."    Two of Levi's sons, Jackie (the acting chairman of Bet  She'an's local council) and Shim'on (a businessman), bought  daddy a Volvo and even drive him around when his chauffeur is  unavailable.    In his free time, Levi goes fishing in the canals in the Bet  She'an Valley. When the mood strikes him, he redecorates his  house, tearing down and building new walls.    Levi nurtures the political contacts he made when he was  foreign minister. He keeps in touch with the Jewish communities  in Europe, and visited them three times since the last election,  twice accompanied by his wife. He does work for the  drug-fighting association and large families.    Levi meticulously reports to important Knesset plenum  sessions. He does not make eye contact with Bibi, but he submits  numerous motions to the agenda. He is very involved in faction  meetings. He can be frequently seen in the Knesset cafeteria,  always surrounded by journalists.    Levi has become an important and appreciated spokesman of  the  right wing on foreign and security affairs, in addition to his  dedication to social issues. It was only last week that he led  the fight to secure jobs for hundreds of workers fired from the  'Of-Tov factory in Bet She'an.    Based on his experience in the contacts preceding the Madrid  conference, he constantly cautions about the dire consequences  of the government capitulating in the negotiations with the PLO,  warns against euphoria and the legitimization of the PLO. He  fears the way to a Palestinian state might be paved by "an  autistic government, that is incapable of reading the signs of  distress of the people." "There is anxiety in every household,  the government is teasing the people," he stated in one of his  latest appearances in the Knesset.    Nevertheless, David Levi has a real problem. If he joins  Bibi and helps him win, he will be securing himself the No. 2  position in the Likud but will be giving up his dream of  becoming leader of the Likud and prime minister. If he  challenges the leadership once again he might hasten Netanyahu's  demise, but he might also fall together with him and pave the  way for another candidate. He must also be careful not to be  blamed again for the Likud's failure.    Netanyahu would today seem to be aware of Levi's power. In  the first days after his impressive victory in the primaries,  the message of Bibi's men was that Levi was "a dead horse."  Bibi perfunctorily called on Levi to come over and work  together.    However, that picture soon changed. Messages started to flow  from Netanyahu's followers to Levi's camp about the need for a  reconciliation between the two men. These days, when the right  wing is in crisis, the two men should close ranks. A few months  ago, Gush Emunim members in Netanyahu's camp tried to pull off a  handshake between Netanyahu and Levi during of the  demonstrations they organized after the signing of the agreement  of principles. It did not work out. Bibi took the initiative  and personally phoned Levi in his Bet She'an home four months  ago. His wife Rashel quashed the attempt. "David is not at  home," she said. When Bibi called again he got the same answer.  Bibi asked that Levi phone him back, but Levi did not return  his call.    In intimate meetings, Bibi's men talk about the Levi-Bibi  axis as a necessary and desirable move. One of them told me  they realize that similar to the Peres-Rabin match they can  either rise or fall together. "Bibi will be ready to walk all  the way from Jerusalem to Bet She'an to make up with Levi," one  mediator told me. It seems that Bibi will also be willing to  promise Levi the job of acting chairman of the Likud.    However, Levi does not seem eager to make up. He feels ill  at ease with Bibi, and not just because of the videocassette  affair. Their relationship soured as early as in the days when  Bibi was appointed deputy minister in the Foreign Ministry, as a  Shamir "plant" -- at least that is how the Levi camp sees it.  "A media old rag," people in Levi's camp called Bibi in those  days.    Referring to reports about the proposal to appoint him  deputy  chairman of the Likud, Levi says: "These are rumors, and I do  not know who spreads them. What purpose do they serve? Are  they meant to confuse Likud members and create an atmosphere  whereby there are people who propose, give, and bestow while  others make demands and say no? In any event, those proposals  are not made candidly."    Advocates of the Bibi-Levi axis were encouraged recently  when  it emerged once again that the so-called Likud princes do not  consider David Levi their leader. Even if Bibi failed and Beni  Begin dropped out of the race, there is another candidate: Dan  Meridor.    When HA'ARETZ reported that many of Levi's men support  Meridor's candidacy, these hastened to his Tel Aviv office to  make clear they were not the ones. An investigation into the  source of the report was conducted in the corridor outside, and  suspicion fell on Ya'aqov Verdugo, spokesman of the Local  Authority Center and an associate of Maxim Levi. Verdugo denied  it all, of course. "David Levi is the joy and hope of my  generation," Verdugo told me in response to my question about  Levi's standing among Likud voters. However, the fact remains  that Levi's prolonged silence, the Likud's frustration and  general condition have left cracks, however thin, in Levi's camp.    When asked about his relations with Bibi Netanyahu, Levi's  pronouncements are convoluted and rather vague. He will not  even mention Bibi's name.    Levi: "I cut down the area of friction. There is a given  situation. I do not bother anybody. I demand absolutely  nothing. Let nobody say that I bother anybody. I have reached  the conclusion that genuine concern for the Likud cannot only  come from me. If a struggle is necessary and if there is cause  for it, this should concern everybody. I am not the only one  who should worry."    When his associates ask him about Bibi's performance, he  refuses to comment. However, at times he may be heard reciting  whole passages of snide comments made by other critics of  Netanyahu. "And that is the man of whom it was said that he  will bring the Likud to power," he ends with a smile.    [Barzel] You were offered, on Bibi's behalf, the No. 2  position and to be part of the leadership. If Bibi were to  approach you with a consolidated proposal, would there be  anything to talk about?    [Levi] Nobody is giving me anything, and I am not demanding  anything. There is a given situation. I am not bothering  anybody and I am not expecting any proposals.    [Barzel] Let us talk about your occupations outside the  Likud. How many hours a week do you go fishing?    [Levi] Fishing is not measured in hours. I have been a  fishing buff since childhood. I feel extraordinarily calm when  I am in contact with nature. It feels like yoga.    [Barzel] Do you have fishing rods and other equipment?    [Levi] Sure. I bring the fish, gray mullet and trout, to  Rashel and she cooks them in a special way with red peppers and  lots of garlic and parsley. These are my favorite fish. They  are fresh and I caught them. Even when I am abroad, I eat  mainly fish and fruit, both because of kosher rules and because  I love fish.    [Barzel] What's your wife's name, Rahel or Rashel?    [Levi] I call her Rashel. That was her name when I met her,  when we immigrated to Israel. It was the eve of Passover. She  came from Casablanca with a family of 12 children, and I came  from Rabat with my family of eight. We traveled by taxi, with  forged passports. When we reached the Strait of Gibraltar I saw  Rashel lifting some suitcases and I ran to help her. Later she  befriended my sister and my late mother. This relationship  continued in the immigrant camp in Marseilles.    Then the time came to immigrate to Israel, and our family's  turn came before hers. We separated, hoping to meet again in  Israel. We were sent to Bet She'an, and a few months later she  arrived here with her family. They wanted to live in Jerusalem,  but they were told that Bet She'an was close enough. I had gone  to send her a letter, to the camp in Marseilles. On my way back  home to our cabin I noticed a big commotion outside. I found  her and her family embracing my mother and sisters. It was the  biggest surprise of my life.    [Barzel] Do you consult her or your family?    [Levi] Our family grew with political awareness. If there  is a certain situation, the whole house gets involved and we  talk about it on Saturday. My children, including the married  ones, did not leave Bet She'an. One of my daughters married a  man whose family lives in France, but I trust that she will soon  bring her husband to Israel. Another daughter lives "far away,"  in Tiberias. All my children and grandchildren come on Saturday  to the warm nest we have built.    I do not only love fishing, but also building. Every year or  two I pull down a wall and start building. It drives Rashel  crazy. "Here we go again with the mess. I do not know how am I  going to deal with it," she says. But, all my sons and  daughters help out. Small renovation work I do alone, either at  night or on Fridays. Recently I pulled down a few walls in order  to enlarge the dining room, and thank God, now I have a big and  beautiful house.    I am happy that my sons and daughters stayed in Bet She'an,  that they decided the way they did. They remained faithful to  something I appreciate, togetherness. They pay a price for it  though. Shim'on, for example, gave up an important security job  which would have meant moving away. But, there are rewards.  Everybody here has known him from the day he was born. In our  town, people who make it do not leave. I did the same when I  was foreign minister. I used the official apartment in  Jerusalem only one Saturday. Every Friday afternoon we rushed  back to Bet She'an to get ready for the Sabbath.    [Barzel] And how will you get to Bet She'an when an autonomy  is established in Jericho?    [Levi] I will drive through Jericho. What is happening will  not block my way to Jerusalem. I think that losing the road  from the Jordan Valley to Jerusalem would be tantamount to  losing the natural connection between the entire north of Israel  and Jerusalem, and that is why this will not come to happen. My  feeling is that the road to Jerusalem will not be blocked.    [Barzel] When you were foreign minister you met heads of  state. When you were construction minister you built in Judaea,  Samaria, Gaza, and Jerusalem. Is it not hard for you now,  without all this activity?    [Levi] There is a proverb in Arabic which says: "When times  get tough, a man who worked all his life will smell his hands  and feel satisfied." I did something for this country.  Wherever I go people remember my dedication. Unfortunately,  within my own party people are trying to minimize and blur my  contribution. But friends remember. Wherever I visit, people  call me "Mr. Minister." I say to them: "Ex-minister." But  they insist: "You will always be a minister to us." That is  nice, never mind the belief that politics is ruthless. Only  people who have not been put to a test can be predators, without  any regard for rules, friendship, or loyalty.</p>

A joint communique to this effect was signed by Chinese  Ambassador to Kenya Chen Pingchu and J.T. Motsing, high  commissioner of Lesotho to Kenya, on behalf of each other's  government, in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, on December 30, 1993.    The full text of the joint communique is as follows:    "The government of the People's Republic of China and the  government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, in conformity with the  principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial  integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each  other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and  peaceful co- existence, have decided to resume diplomatic  relations at ambassadorial level effective from 12 January, 1994.    "The government of the People's Republic of China and the  government of the Kingdom of Lesotho have agreed to exchange  ambassadors and facilitate the resumption of work by each  other's embassy.    "The government of the People's Republic of China supports  Lesotho in its efforts to safeguard state sovereignty and  develop the economy. The government of the Kingdom of Lesotho  recognizes that the government of the People's Republic of China  is the sole legal government of China and Taiwan is an  inalienable part of Chinese territory. The government of the  People's Republic of China appreciates the above position of the  government of the Kingdom of Lesotho."    Lesotho established diplomatic ties with China in 1983 after  severing its "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan.    In April, 1990, Lesotho announced that it resumed  "diplomatic  relations" with Taiwan. China promptly announced the  termination of its diplomatic relations with Lesotho.</p>

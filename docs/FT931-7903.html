			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Westminster Health value may top Pounds 100m THE flotation of Westminster Health Care, the nursing homes group, will go ahead this spring and is expected to value the group at Pounds 100m or more. WHC also announced that interim profits before interest and tax had more than doubled to Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 2.1m) on turnover of Pounds 17m (Pounds 9.9m). The prospectus for the float will contain a profit forecast for the year to May 31. In the previous year it made Pounds 5.3m before interest and tax, on sales of Pounds 23.4m. The prospectus will also refer to law suits filed in the US against National Medical Enterprises, WHC's US parent. NME has been sued by insurance companies claiming overcharging. NME is defending the suits. The float, which is likely to raise at least Pounds 50m through a placing with a clawback to allow the public to buy shares, will reduce NME's stake in the group to a percentage in the low 40s. However, NME is not taking cash out of the business, rather it will repay WHC's debt and fund further expansion. The company aims not to ask shareholders for further cash for at least 18 months or two years. A fast rate of expansion is expected. WHC owns 39 nursing homes in the UK with 2,620 beds, mostly in purpose built homes, with a high proportion in single, ground floor rooms with ensuite bathrooms. WHC has another 9 under construction, adding 737 beds. Mr Pat Carter, chief executive, said that it planned to open 700 to 800 beds a year. By the financial year end it expects to have 3,230 beds making it one of the larger groups in the industry, although still relatively small in the private sector nursing home market, valued at Pounds 2.2bn a year. New openings are likely to mean that second half profits do not rise as fast as in the first half. WHC's prospectus will also describe the changes taking place in the industry from April 1 as a result of the government's reforms of community care. These shift the funding responsibility for patients who cannot afford private care from central to local government. Mr Carter said that local authorities are now preparing for the new system, setting prices and giving patients choice within available funding. WHC takes a higher proportion of private patients than most of the operators in the industry. The leading quoted operator of residential nursing homes is Takare, whose shares trade on a multiple of over 20 times analysts' earnings forecasts for 1992. Barclays de Zoete Wedd is sponsor to the issue, and de Zoete &amp; Bevan is broker.</p>

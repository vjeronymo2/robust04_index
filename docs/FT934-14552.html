			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Ruling council chosen in Malawi OPPOSITION leaders in Malawi yesterday gave qualified approval to the appointment of a three-man presidential council to take over executive authority. The appointment appears to mark the effective end of the rule of President Hastings Banda, who is in South Africa recovering from a brain operation which was carried out 10 days ago. Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, who was appointed secretary-general of the ruling Malawi Congress party only last week, heads the council. Its other two members are Mr John Tembo and Mr Robson Chirwa, both cabinet ministers. Spokesmen for opposition parties represented on a National Consultative Council (NCC), which is negotiating an election timetable and procedure with the government, have supported the decision to form a presidential council as a necessary interim measure. But they claim that the NCC has an agreement with the government according to which the presidential council will reconvene parliament within seven days. They also say it is pledged to amend the constitution to allow a neutral, caretaker president, with limited powers, to hold office until elections in May. Mr Chakuamba, a former government minister imprisoned on charges of sedition in 1980, was granted an amnesty in July. The amnesty followed a referendum in which a majority voted to switch to a multi-party political system. Before his elevation to the key post in the party, Mr Chakuamba had been actively lobbying on behalf of opposition groups. Referring to the pledges, Mr Mordecai Msisha, for the Alliance for Democracy, said: 'If they don't do this, there will be a crisis'. However, in an interview with the FT yesterday, Mr Chakuamba denied that any specific undertaking had been made. While recognising that 'the NCC has a major role to play', he claimed: 'I have not looked at their proposals yet'. Asked whether the presidential council would reconvene parliament to amend the constitution, he said the triumvirate had not yet had an opportunity to discuss the matter, since Mr Tembo was in South Africa with Dr Banda. Reports from the clinic where Dr Banda is recuperating say his progress is satisfactory.</p>

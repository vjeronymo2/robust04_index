			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Fiery Buchanan attacks 'unfair' Airbus subsidies MR Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing Republican challenger to President George Bush, is calling for trade retaliation against Airbus Industrie as part of a stiffer 'America first' trade message to win over voters in next week's New Hampshire primary. In a speech in Concord, Mr Buchanan accused Japan and Europe of spending billions of dollars on unfair subsidies in an effort to destroy US high-technology businesses, particularly the aerospace industry led by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. As president, he would tell the British, French, German and Spanish governments who back Airbus that 'we are going to protect Boeing because they built the planes that kept you free (during the Cold War).' The US is a world leader in civil aviation, one of the few high-technology industries unchallenged by Japanese competition. The Bush administration has filed two complaints about subsidies of Airbus to the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but Mr Buchanan said he would introduce countervailing duties to raise the price of Airbus aircraft. With five days remaining to next Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire, the first in the 1992 election campaign, Mr Buchanan, with roughly 30 per cent support, trails Mr Bush by 15 points. But many voters remain undecided, and the Bush camp is fearful of a recession-inspired backlash. Political experts calculate that Mr Buchanan needs between 35 and 40 per cent of the vote to keep his challenge alive in the southern primaries. Bush supporters are inflating his likely vote next Tuesday in the hope that, even if he scores an embarrassing 35 per cent, he will be written off by the press. Mr Buchanan, a former speech writer to Presidents Nixon and Reagan, drew a crowd of more than 200 people at Concord on Monday night. Many were middle-income Americans worried about the local economy. The Republican challenger called for an end to all US foreign aid, the removal of most-favoured-nation trade benefits for communist China, and the withdrawal of all US troops from Europe in response to the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'It is time to tell the big boys in Europe who steal our markets around the world that they should look after themselves.' The Boston Herald, a conservative-leaning tabloid newspaper, joined the right-wing Manchester Union Leader yesterday in endorsing Mr Buchanan in a front-page editorial. The Herald said Mr Bush's support of a tax increase in 1990 meant he had betrayed those who voted for him in 1988. In his speech Mr Buchanan evoked memories of the 1950s, when the US dominated the world economy and led the struggle against Stalinism. The US won the Cold War 'but the victory has left ashes in our mouths. There is a social and economic crisis in America today,' he said. Referring to national opinion polls indicating that three out of four Americans are worried about the future, Mr Buchanan said he would cut taxes, support term limits for Congress and slash the federal bureaucracy. He quoted Abraham Lincoln's words on the eve of the Civil War: 'There is a storm coming.'</p>

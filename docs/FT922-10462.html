			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (1): The key to growth  -Asia's expansion has outstripped the ability of its infrastructure - communications, transport and energy capacity - to cope. But the need to spend on improvements comes as budget deficits are growing and aid from industrialised countries is becoming ever harder to obtain THE project: to take Asia, the world's fastest-growing region, to a new stage of development in which living standards rival those of the industrialised world. The cost: more than Dollars 600bn in the principal developing countries of north and south-east Asia alone. Asia's rapid expansion has outstripped the ability of its infrastructure - transport, energy and communications capacity - to cope. Cities are choking, ports cannot handle the increased flow of goods. Growth has also produced labour shortages in some areas and has raised environmental concerns. Crawling traffic, restricted power supplies and lack of telephone lines are not just irritations. They restrict the flow of goods and services and reduce the potential of economies to grow. Just as important for economies which have grown principally because of private investment in manufactured exports, infrastructural bottlenecks are discouraging foreign companies from making new investments. The businessman who, after a long flight, is delayed by airport crowds and a slow taxi ride, and then cannot get a telephone line, will begin to wonder whether he might more profitably spend his company's time and money elsewhere. The Asian Development Bank, in its 1992 outlook for developing member countries, says: 'The greatest challenge facing governments in the 1990s is to find adequate resources for the provision or promotion of physical infrastructure, human resource and technology development, and environmental protection.' Physical infrastructure, the ADB says, 'has become a binding constraint among the rapidly-growing newly-industrialising economies and south-east Asian economies, with the possible exception of Singapore.' Governments have recognised that the problem needs attention. Fiercely competing with each other for investment and export markets, they realise that their standing among their neighbours depends a lot on their economic progress. Their hold on domestic political power has also relied to a large extent on their countries' growing prosperity. Public spending on infrastructure is an important instrument of social policy, even in economies which have been driven generally by private sector enterprise. In Taiwan, for example, the aim is to attract people out of the main cities into new development areas. In Japan, the ambitious airport being built on reclaimed land off Osaka aims to bring business to the surrounding region. The spending is also an economic policy instrument, useful at a time when recession in some industrialised countries has dented export growth for Asian countries. But in some of them it will raise questions about the durability of economic growth. Governments cannot afford not to improve infrastructure, but the effort may risk overheating and take fuel away from the engine of export-led growth. The ADB notes that the need to spend comes while budget deficits are growing and aid from industrialised countries is becoming harder to obtain. The newly-industrialising economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, with per capita gross national product averaging Dollars 10,000, have been the most successful at following in Japan's footsteps towards industrialisation. Behind them come Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia which saw a boom in foreign investment in manufacturing in the late 1980s. Coming up fast are southern China and Vietnam, with low labour costs attracting manufacturers to invest just as they did in the now richer neighbouring countries in previous decades. All these countries have targetted significant infrastructural schemes with the aim of providing the base for a shift to the next level of development. Some of them already have a highly developed infrastructure. Hong Kong's growth has depended on continual reclamation of land and provision of transport systems ahead of time. The world's largest airport construction project - with associated expressways, railways, bridge, tunnel and container terminal - is an important symbol of confidence in the territory's prosperity as a hub for southern China after Beijing assumes sovereignty in 1997. Singapore, also with a relatively small area, has planned its economic growth. Construction of the roads, telecommunications and other systems to support the economy have been part of the planning. New projects will seek to stay ahead of needs. Larger countries, however, cannot predict their needs so easily. They have to counter established bottlenecks with projects which exceed current demand. The most ambitious of these by far is Taiwan, which intends to spend more than Dollars 300bn on infrastructure by 1996. The Kuomintang Nationalist government's extraordinary six-year plan, the central plank of its policies, includes social development as well as construction projects. South Korea's planned projects total half Taiwan's, also a huge amount even though the Korean economy is seriously overheated. Even Japan, with a well-advanced infrastructure, has pledged to spend more than last year's gross national product on improvements over the next decade, with the aim of boosting general living standards to levels compatible with its status as a leading industrialised country. Thailand, despite its continuing dynamic economic growth, is the best example of how much-needed infrastructural spending can get caught up in politics and stall. Even after years of the notorious Bangkok traffic problem, there is still no clear idea of how it will be dealt with. Yet the government has ambitious programmes. Malaysia, which Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, plans to be a developed country by the year 2020, has less serious problems but they bite precisely in the areas where foreign investment has been concentrated. Indonesia is suffering in similar ways. The pressure on them to provide adequate roads and other support will come increasingly from competition from southern China and, eventually, Vietnam, which offer plentiful, cheap, hard-working labour forces for manufacturing companies and can still easily qualify for concessional finance to improve their infrastructure. Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers are investing heavily in south China and Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has talked of Guangdong province as a new 'dragon'. When the US embargo on Vietnam is lifted, international institutions such as the World Bank and ADB are likely to pour money into the country for basic projects. Spending on infrastructural improvements in Asia thus offers the potential for a bonanza for construction, engineering, communications and equipment companies around the world. The extent to which they can participate will vary considerably between countries and industrial sectors. Companies which can provide technology not available locally, for example in telecommunications, will clearly be at an advantage. Japan and Korea can be expected to handle the bulk of their needs without outside contractors, although there are opportunities in Korea for advanced technology and design work on, for example, airports and power stations. Taiwan is actively seeking foreign contractors. Malaysia has used foreign advisers on, for example, its north-south expressway project. Can all this expenditure be afforded? Asian countries are generally in a better position to pay than most others. But there are risks involved. Public finances are likely to be stretched just as economies face external pressures. The aim will be to seek private rather than public investment wherever possible. Projects may be spread out over a longer period than currently targeted, especially in Taiwan. But the message which most countries have grasped is that they have to make the commitment to better infrastructure if their dynamic growth is to continue.</p>

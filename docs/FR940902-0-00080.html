			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Department notes that the objective assessment process for title II&hyph;B may be different in scope than that for the regular title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C program, as indicated in &sect;628.515(b)(2). This may also be the case for limited function programs (such as literacy programs) mounted under section 123, although this is clearly an exception to the normal expectation in conducting an assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Individual Service Strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 628.520 establishes the requirements for the Individual Service Strategy (ISS). The ISS is an individual plan that is developed based on information obtained through the objective assessment. It is the framework within which decisions regarding individual participants are recorded. It should be considered a living document that reflects decisions concerning the appropriate mix and sequence of services to be provided leading to, and including, a realistic employment goal. Several commenters requested clarification of the outcomes to be sought in the development of the ISS for youth. The Department agrees that there is a need to focus on youth returning to or remaining in school and, thus, that the ISS should focus more on education as it relates to a long term career. In title II&hyph;B and II&hyph;C, the employment goal should be interpreted broadly for those individuals returning to school and may reflect long-term career goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters asked for clarification of what had to be listed in the ISS. The ISS should briefly note any need for financial resources or supportive services and record the amount of each. The expected outcome of each activity should be indicated with a notation of the provision and schedule for each. Referral to other programs, and referral out of title II must be noted on the ISS. The rationale or justification for other decisions may be referenced in the ISS, but need not be recorded there. The Department provides further clarification of the use of the ISS for recording referrals out of title II by revising &sect;628.530(c), as was requested by several commenters. This section now states that further tracking or follow-up is not required for referrals out of title II. This section is also revised to correct language in the interim final regulations that indicated referrals out of title II would not be calculated in performance standards only if an ISS had not been completed. Since, as commenters noted, an ISS is to be developed for each participant, this section now allows recording the referral in a partial ISS without any effect on performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters indicated confusion over counseling and the development of the job goal in the ISS. The provisions of this section reflect the need for program-related application of career counseling, but the Department cautions program operators to prudently provide career counseling related to the realistic goals of the JTPA program. While the objective assessment/individual service strategy process is customer-centered, JTPA services are expected to guide participants toward realistic employment goals for which training and job demand are available in the community. Pure career counseling for its own sake should be left to other, more appropriate, sources. Development of a final employment goal may be delayed where the objective assessment indicates a need for further career exploration or assessment. In this case, a career cluster should temporarily be indicated in place of the employment goal. The ISS should be revised to reflect the employment goal prior to the start of specific occupational skills training. The employment goal may be revised if the continuing objective assessment indicates a need to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of comments were received concerning participant signatures on the ISS. This requirement was perceived as an unnecessary administrative burden. Section 628.520(c) is revised to indicate that there is not a requirement for a participant signature. However, the decisions reflected in the service strategy about goals, objectives and services to be provided are to be made in partnership with the participant and are to be determined in conformance with applicable civil rights provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

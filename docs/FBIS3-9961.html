			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peasant and the New Antinarcotics Strategy"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton recently announced a  drastic change in the U.S. Government's antinarcotics strategy.    The idea is to emphasize prevention rather than repression  which, generally speaking, has been used since, or even before  the tenure of President George Bush.    One reason for the change of strategy is that the one used  so  far has proven ineffective and only increased the number of  consumers by an average of 140,000 new addicts per year to the  incredible current number of 10 million consumers.    At the same time as it announced the so-called New National  Antinarcotics Strategy, the White House also asked the U.S.  Congress to approve a $13.2-billion allocation to implement this  program. This includes a substantial increase in the funds  earmarked for cooperation with drug producer countries.    This directly concerns us because Peru is the world's  biggest  coca leaf producer and the money allocated for cooperation is  earmarked for eradicating plantations and destroying  laboratories.    U.S. Government officials have said that this money -- which  will not reach Peru or Bolivia until October -- will also be  used to strengthen the Peruvian and Bolivian judicial systems  and to train their respective specialized police units.    Despite a relative increase, and the strategy implemented in  Peru, the main changes by U.S. officials do not seem positive.    Iban de Rementeria -- a UN expert in narcotics affairs and  agricultural development who termed the U.S. strategy "a  complete turn around" -- has stated that although it is right  that the United States has admitted for the first time since  1904 that the drug problem is a domestic problem, there are  other aspects that reveal faults in the new strategy as far as  our countries are concerned.    Rementeria said: "There should be no illusions because we  continue alone in this field," adding that prospects for Peru  and Bolivia are not good because "in their capacity as producers  they will be abandoned to their fate, they will be given no aid,  and no importance will be granted to the alternative development  crops."    To a certain extent, the current international agricultural  policies upheld by the GATT are even more serious because the  recent Uruguay Round has institutionalized the subsidy system in  developed countries, condemning agriculture in the Third World  "to failure."    Bolivian Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal  has  mentioned the serious social conflicts that would be unleashed  in his country following a cut in the alternative development  program.    As we can see, it is not just a matter of a mere  substitution  of plantations, which to a great extend has failed because a  series of complementary aspects -- such as guaranteeing peasants  access to market -- were overlooked.    Alternative development is what is sought and needed now; so  that the coca grower's problems will be tackled in a  comprehensive way, that the peasant will by no means be regarded  as a delinquent or an accomplice, but merely a producer with  limited possibilities and without an "alternative" -- for the  time being -- to survive.    The solution to the immensely complex trafficking problem  must, therefore, contemplate the problem of the peasants -- who  are on many occasions involuntarily and exploited producers of  the raw material -- whose needs and interests must also be  considered.</p>

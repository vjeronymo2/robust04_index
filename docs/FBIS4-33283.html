			<p>BFN     [Text] Implementation of Decree-Law 149 gains momentum in  Matanzas Province with the start of legal proceedings in seven  cases of ill-gotten wealth, thanks to the work of the Unified  Vigilance and Protection System in each municipality.  Authorities are holding, among other things: six automobiles;  one truck; one farm; one home; dozens of head of cattle, sheep,  and pigs; and a great number of domestic appliances. The active  response to this law, which this operation requires, relies on  the people's support. The Committees for the Defense of the  Revolution, the attorney's office, the Interior Ministry  organizations, and the Finance and Prices Ministry, in  coordination with other entities, have joined to conduct a  process whose last step will be the total confiscation of  ill-gotten goods. Decree-Law 149 is supported by Articles 61  and 62 of the Constitution, which condemn obtaining wealth  illegally and which mars the fairness of our socialist society  and reflects the need to strengthen control on state resources,  as well as complying effectively with our laws.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Losses mount at Reed Executive THE PERFORMANCE of Reed Executive, the loss-making employment agency, worsened in the first half of 1992 with losses reaching Pounds 3.7m, a 14 per cent increase on the same period last time. The family-controlled Reed board, chaired by Mr Alec Reed, said the poor results meant the company was unable to pay an interim dividend. Mr Reed said there were signs of a tentative recovery although turnover fell 7 per cent to Pounds 40.8m in the 26 weeks to June 28. He added that there had been an upturn in demand for temporary office workers and that margins were slowly moving back towards previous levels - Reed last made a profit in the first half of 1990-91. Mr Reed said: 'We are still trading at a loss and expect to do so for some time yet.' Concern at the mounting losses prompted the chairman and executives to take pay cuts of up to 42 per cent earlier this year.</p>

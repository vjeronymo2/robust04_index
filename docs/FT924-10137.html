			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: A mission to find a place for reverence - Architecture If a recession can be called a pause for thought, then there is one person in Britain who has made very substantial use of the not so short intermission. It is eight years since the Prince of Wales made his memorable speech to the Royal Institute of British Architects on their 150th anniversary, and in that time many of the Prince's thoughts about architecture have been translated into action. While the slump in the building industry has slowed the progress of both development and innovation  -it has given time for some thoughtful changes in architectural theory and education. Last week, the Prince of Wales inaugurated an entirely new school of architecture in London and paid it a couple of visits to meet students and sit in on a lecture. Although two houses in Regent's Park and 31 Foundation Course students may be only a modest acorn rather a giant oak, it is a remarkable beginning achieved in an often pointlessly hostile critical climate. I thought that there was a remarkable atmosphere at the opening event last week; one of quiet and thoughtful determination among the staff and students. It is a perfectly fair question to ask: why another school of architecture ? I think that the Prince gave the answer; 'If there has been any single thing wrong with the architectural profession in this country over the last century, it has been that they have become cut off from people who are not architects, from compatriots in the building process. I would like my Institute to make the most of its independence, and its freedom from sectional interests, to try and effect some reconciliation between these fragments. So, while it will teach theory, it will be rooted in good building practice; while it develops the aesthetic sensibilities of the builder and the architect, it will not be at the expense of remembering that there is a 'builder' in each one of us'. The school is already something of a remarkable animal. It is the product of endless work, much of it voluntary, from people who are committed to architectural literacy without rigid dogma. It was a welcome sight to see the President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Mr Richard MacCormac, present at the opening of the school. Bridge building is the order of the day; recognition that there can be different standards of excellence, and an understanding that architectural quality depends upon shared roots. The Prince is sometimes unfairly mocked for even daring to mention values that exist beyond the merely material plane. Architecture is, at its best, like any other fine art, concerned with the place of mankind in the world and of the world in the universe. Architectural language deals with this through a sense of order and proportion. That is not some mystical sixth sense but something which can be learned and, once mastered, applied to the art of creation. To quote the Prince's opening speech: 'In architecture, in music, and in nature as a whole, there is, I believe, a fundamental order or hierarchy, the recognition of which is essential both to appreciation and to our own creativity.' However, recognising this sense of order is only the beginning. There is another area that is harder to define and is often ignored out of a kind of Protestant embarrassment. This is what the Prince and others have called, 'reverence'; a mixture of humility and aspiration. Without this quality, artistic creation has a rough ride through the jungles of egomania and self promotion. An artist like Rembrandt is one of the clearest examples of the demonstration of reverence; how can architects and architects in training be taught to embody that sense of observed respect for humanity that Rembrandt transforms into art ? That is the challenge which the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture is beginning to be equipped to face. Earlier this month in the northern Italian city of Bologna, the Prince of Wales inaugurated an exhibition of architecture entitled 'A Vision of Europe'. I hope that this exhibition will tour in Europe because the curators, Liam O'Connor and Gabriele Tagliaventi, have assembled a remarkable range of built and unbuilt projects that illustrate a continuing urbanist and architectural tradition that nonetheless accommodates the activities of the end of the twentieth century. The European range that is fascinating and some particular architects who are not especially well known stand out. I was impressed by the work of the French architect Christian Langlois with his completion of the cathedral square at Orleans and the buildings he designed in the 1970s for the French Senate in the Rue Vaurigard in Paris. There is an impressive block of flats in Olot, Barcelona, Spain which shows that there are new ways of using the classical language to deal with modern problems. The architect is Ramon Fortet and his work is far more sympathetic and humane than the fashionable giantism of his compatriot Bofill. The range of work in this exhibition is inspiring; I hope it will soon be seen in the UK. There is a unique opportunity for lovers of European architecture and culture to demonstrate their own sense of reverence in a practical way in London on November 10. There are still seats available for the concert at the Royal Festival Hall being given by the compelling pianist from the former Yugoslavia, Ivo Pogorelich. The purpose of the concert is to raise funds specifically for the International Monuments Trust Croatia Appeal, with the proceeds being specifically earmarked for the City of Dubrovnik. It is hard to think of a more worthwhile way of spending an evening, listening to the works of Chopin, Ravel and Rachmaninov, knowing the funds raised are going to help repair the mad and wanton damage recently inflicted upon the 'jewel of the Adriatic'. This international cultural appeal deserves support and tickets can be obtained from the Royal Festival Hall. It is hard to realise the extent of the damage recent fighting has inflicted upon our common European heritage. There can be no other place at the moment where reverence for European culture is more sorely needed.</p>

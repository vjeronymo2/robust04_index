			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Another Challenge -- Commenting on Report by </F> British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee"]    [Text] Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of  the British Parliament published a report to express its opinion  on current British-Chinese relations and the Hong Kong issue,  and to express full support for the "constitutional reform"  being carried out in Hong Kong by the British Government and  Chris Patten.    The document was not so much a report as a letter of  challenge.    It advocated the British side's "independent action" in the  "pre-1997 electoral arrangements" and in the "legislation on  affairs before the handover of sovereignty."    It advocated playing the "international card," and called  for  "continuing to seek international support" for Britain's  position on the Chinese issue, and "especially cooperation with  European allies and the United States" on this issue.    It also called for "coming into contact with the Legislative  Yuan of Taiwan," "reviewing the status of the Taiwan  representative office in Britain," and "relaxing the  restrictions" on it.    The "report" did not wear any guise. It simply challenged  China, and even interfered in China's internal affairs in an  undisguised and even frenzied manner. Any people with a sense  of justice and with judgment can easily see its essence.    The "international card," the "human rights stick," and the  "Taiwan chess-move [qi 2759]" all are nothing but tricks played  by the British side since becoming helpless after being strongly  condemned for its Hong Kong policy; such tricks will get Britain  nowhere. Facts in the past more than one year prove this.    It was not beyond people's expectation that the Foreign  Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament would "fully  support" Patten's "constitutional reform package." In November  1993 and in January 1994, the committee held hearings on the  Hong Kong issue. It attacked China by saying, without grounds,  that China "tried to impose a corruptive electoral system on  Hong Kong" and also proved, without grounds, that Patten's  package did not violate the Sino-British agreements. The  committee was, in fact, Patten's mouthpiece and said only what  Patten wanted it to say.    The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the  British Parliament was written according to a series of hearings  between July 1993 and February 1994, and according to the  conclusions it drew from its visits to China, Hong Kong, and  Taiwan. It proved that Patten had "chosen a correct line."  This certainly could not deceive anyone.    Here, we do not discuss whether the members of the committee  listened to the voices criticizing Patten when they visited Hong  Kong and the Chinese mainland. Within Britain, the business  circles generally were opposed to Patten's package. Some people  of insight in political circles also criticized the British  Government's Hong Kong policy. Percy Cradock, the former  foreign affairs adviser to the British Government who  participated in the Sino-British talks and was involved in  signing the Joint Declaration and the following agreements, also  repeatedly criticized Britain's Hong Kong policy for taking the  wrong course after October 1992. In his written opinion  submitted to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, he criticized  Patten's handling of Sino-British relations and pointed out that  this practice had led to confrontation and had harmed Hong Kong.  He advised the British Government to "adopt the only option, of  maintaining cooperation with Beijing when handling Hong Kong's  future." After that, he again sent a letter the Foreign Affairs  Select Committee, pointing out that some of Patten's testimony  at the committee's hearing was untrue. However, the committee  not only rejected more objective and responsible opinions such  as those expressed by Cradock, but also denounced such opinions  as "both untenable and dishonorable." As it treated different  and even correct opinions in this way, could people believe that  the report's conclusions were correct and tenable?    The continuing Sino-British disputes were provoked by the  British side. It was again the British side that undermined the  Sino-British talks aimed at solving differences and at reaching  an agreement on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong.  From beginning to end, the British side had no sincerity for  cooperation with the Chinese side at all, and it had made up its  mind long ago to act perversely and unilaterally. The report  pretended to be serious by saying that "if China does not  cooperate,...it is necessary for the government to act  independently." It made an unfounded countercharge and tried to  make people feel that the British side's "independent action"  was caused by "the Chinese side's unwillingness to cooperate."    The Chinese side's sincerity for cooperation was clearly  demonstrated in the document published by the Chinese side about  the truth of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political  arrangements. The British side's practice of closing the door  to the talks and rejecting cooperation on the issue of the  political structure also was laid bare by its own White Paper on  "Representative Government in Hong Kong." Here we quote two  passages from the White Paper for our readers to make their own  judgments:    "The objective of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong  Government in the talks was to establish whether an  understanding could be reached with the Chinese side on a set of  electoral arrangements which they could commend to the  Legislative Council in Hong Kong."    "When it became apparent during Round 17 that it would not  be  possible to reach agreement on the issues covered in the British  draft Memorandum of Understanding, the British representative  made plain that his instructions did not give him the authority  to continue discussion of a first-stage understanding."    The two passages made it plain that the Sino-British talks  had to follow the will of the British side, and when it was  impossible to reach an agreement according to the British side's  opinion during Round 17 of the talks, the British representative  simply refused to continue the talks. Look! Did the British  side have any bit of sincerity for the talks and for cooperation?    No matter how the Foreign Affairs Select Committee tried to  conceal the British side's behavior in undermining the talks and  rejecting cooperation, it was simply to no avail. The British  side may "independently" arrange the 1994-95 elections and  "independently" conduct legislation on affairs before the  transfer of sovereignty, but all this will come to an end on 30  June 1997 and will never be able to extend beyond that date. No  matter whether Patten believes this or not, the facts will  provide him with a merciless answer.</p>

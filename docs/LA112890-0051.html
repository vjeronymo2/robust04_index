			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY FINDS DRUG TEST VALUE EXAGGERATED;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: AS EXPECTED, WORKERS WHO TESTED POSITIVE BEFORE HIRING HAVE MORE  INJURIES AND ABSENCES. BUT THE RATES ARE FAR LOWER THAN EARLIER ESTIMATES.  </P> <P> People who test positive on pre-employment drug screening are more likely to  have work-related problems than those who test negative, but the benefits of  the controversial screening programs have been exaggerated, according to a  study of 2,537 Boston postal workers published in today's Journal of the  American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> Researchers found "an association" between a positive drug test for marijuana  or cocaine and problems such as industrial accidents, injuries and absenteeism,  but the relationship "is more modest than what people seem to want to hear,"  said Dr. Craig Zwerling of the University of Iowa. Zwerling, the principal  author of the study, previously worked as a physician for the U.S. Postal  Service in Boston.  </P> <P> Others said the figures in the report are substantial and support the need for  pre-employment drug screening.  </P> <P> The researchers found that the 7.8% of postal employees with marijuana-positive  urine samples had 55% more industrial accidents and 78% more absences when  compared to other employees. The 2.2% of postal employees with cocaine-positive  urine samples had 145% more absences and 85% more injuries.  </P> <P> According to the report, these percentages are far lower than earlier  estimates, publicized in scientific journals in the mid-1980s, that workers who  use drugs are involved in 200% to 300% more industrial accidents, sustain 400%  more compensable injuries and use 1,500% more sick leave than workers who do  not use drugs.  </P> <P> This led the researchers to conclude that "many of the claims cited to justify  pre-employment drug screening have been exaggerated."  </P> <P> "It seems a little ludicrous to me that we spend loads of money to find the  marijuana user in the employee population and we largely ignore the serious  drug abuse problem in the criminal population," said Eric D. Wish, a  substance-abuse researcher at the University of Maryland. Wish wrote an  editorial for the medical journal on the study.  </P> <P> Others took a different view.  </P> <P> "Even if you take the lowest numbers, they are still significant," said  Jonathan Segal, a management attorney with Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp;  Solis-Cohen in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The numbers "are substantial," said Joel S. Trosch, an assistant postmaster  general. "The results of the study support (pre-employment) drug screening" by  the Postal Service.  </P> <P> Over the last several years, an increasing number of companies, including The  Times, have established mandatory pre-employment drug screening programs.  Typically, job applicants who test positive for drugs without a valid medical  reason are not hired.  </P> <P> The new study is one of the first to scrutinize the effectiveness of the  practice. The researchers note that earlier estimates of the problems caused by  drug-abusing employees were not based on solid data.  </P> <P> The study, conducted between 1986 and 1989, was a "blind study," which means  employees, hiring officials, medical personnel and management officials were  not informed of the results of the urine drug screens and the test results had  no effect on hiring decisions. The Postal Service has since instituted a  national policy of pre-employment screening.  </P> <P> In the study, urine drug screens were performed on nearly 5,000 applicants for  postal jobs. Positive tests were confirmed by additional testing.  </P> <P> The work performance of individuals who were hired, including absence rate,  work-related injuries and accidents, disciplinary actions and terminations,  were followed for an average of 406 days.  </P> <P> "Those with marijuana-positive urine samples had increased risks of  termination, accidents, injuries and discipline compared with those with  negative urine samples," the report said. The results for those with  cocaine-positive urine samples were similar, except that these individuals were  not at increased risk of being fired.  </P> <P> The Postal Service has subsequently confirmed these findings in tests conducted  at 21 sites around the country, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> A key shortcoming of the study is that it did not take into account the  possible role of alcohol abuse, in addition to drug use, in poor work  performance. The researchers did not perform blood or urine tests that might  have detected alcohol abuse. They also did not ask job applicants about alcohol  because they thought the applicants were unlikely for give accurate  information.  </P> <P> Zwerling said the study was not meant to tell companies whether to perform  pre-employment drug screening, but to "provide an empirical background" for  discussions.  </P> <P> Segal, the management attorney, said that as more employers establish testing  programs, companies that do not test "run the risk of attracting a higher  percentage of employees who use drugs. . . . Job applicants know which  companies test and which don't."  </P></p>

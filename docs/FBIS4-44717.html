			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marco Tavasani: "An Aeronautical Studies </F> Center"]    [Text] A branch of the armed forces like the air force has  a need to invest large sums to test and study the equipment and  materials that it possesses and those that it will adopt in the  future.    Even the human factor (the pilots and the specialists)  represent an important heritage that needs to be optimized; this  leads to the need to unite the research centers dedicated to  in-flight testing, the chemistry of materials, armaments,  computers, and aerospace medicine under a single command in the  aeronautical research, study, and testing center that is located  near the Pratica di Mare base, on the Lazio coast south of Rome.    Rather than being a large military unit, the testing center  is a complex laboratory where the aircraft and all related  systems (including armaments and electronic equipment) are  tested before being assigned to the flight divisions.    Under certain aspects the Pratica di Mare division can be  defined as being the Italian version of the Edwards Air Force  Base, because among the 687 military and civilians that work  there are also 15 testing pilots whose responsibility it is to  test the Air Force aircraft and helicopters in flight, but also  those of the other armed forces and government bodies. The  in-flight tests are conducted not only on newly-acquired  aircraft (the more recent ones are the AMX fighter bomber and  the P180 executive twin engine), but also the modifications that  experience suggests should be made, and the upgrading during the  operating life.    The most complex phase definitely concerns the flight tests  and prototype approval: thanks to a sophisticated telemetry  system, up to 400 parameters ranging from the aerodynamic  performance to engine temperature and performance, to the  behavior of external loads (bombs, missiles, containers for  recognition instruments) are transmitted to the aircraft,  processed by a series of computers and displayed on the monitors  of the ground stations.    Here it is possible to follow the behavior of the aircraft  moment after moment, and to intervene, suggesting to the pilot  which corrections should eventually be made. One of the most  interesting divisions is the laboratory for the chemistry of  materials, which courts resort to increasingly for the delicate  technical appraisals and investigations following aircraft  accidents.    The center works closely with the leading Italian  universities involed in aerospace research such as the Milan  Polytechnic, La Sapienza University of Rome, and the University  of Pisa, as well as with companies working in the sector of  aeronautical constructions and advanced materials.    The studies often have a direct spin-off in the civil  sector:  this is the case of research into new fuels and lubricants that  are of interest to the automotive industry for new generation  engines, or into composite materials where it is important to  explore the break points with revolutionary methods of  investigation, such as laser holography.    The most interesting programs underway include the  modification of some Tornados into an electronic war version  using Texas Instruments antiradar Harm missiles for the  suppression of enemy antiaircraft defense, and the testing of  defense systems against infrared missiles (attracted by the heat  of engine exhaust gases) for possible use on the G-22  twin-engine transport aircraft. An aircraft of this kind  belonging to the 46th Pisa Air Brigade was shot down by a SAM-9  Soviet infrared missile during a humanitarian flight to Sarajevo  two years ago. The laboratories of the division even determined  what the missile was by analyzing a 5-millimeter shell found in  the engine exhaust nozzle, thanks to the use of an electronic  microscope.    An important section is the aeronautical and space medicine  division that has focused its studies primarily on stress and  immunity and on the problem of the sleep-waking rhythms and the  attention levels. This research began with the pilots used on  the Tornados during the Gulf War (1991) when the missions began  at four o'clock in the morning.    The consequent need to rest during the day, at the end of  the  flight, led to the identification of a drug that lets people  sleep at unusual hours without any collateral effects on the  organism. This drug can also be taken by students suffering from  stress before an exam.</p>

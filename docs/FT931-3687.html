			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Brussels warns of tit-for-tat war with US on trade: Row centres on Dollars 50m of federal contracts THE RISK of a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war rose yesterday after senior EC officials warned that the Community might retaliate if the US were to bar European companies from bidding on telecommunication and public procurement contracts. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, called the Clinton administration's unexpected withdrawal from talks on the procurement dispute 'a very negative step' which was 'surprising and completely unnecessary'. His criticism followed Friday night's decision by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, to call off talks scheduled to take place in Brussels today, and a clear US threat to impose sanctions later this month. Sir Leon avoided threats of retaliation, but other EC trade officials said Mr Kantor's abrupt move made it difficult to avoid a confrontation on March 22, the deadline which the US has set for the EC to dismantle allegedly discriminatory procurement rules for water, gas, electrical and telecoms contracts. Mr Kantor said on Friday that the administration would bar European companies from between Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) and Dollars 50m of federal contracts if the EC failed to waive Article 29 in the EC utilities directive, which came into force in January offering EC companies an advantage in contract bidding within the Community. A senior EC official said the scale of US sanctions was minimal in comparison to the multi-billion dollar public procurement market, but the timing could not have been worse. It comes near the climax of the French parliamentary election campaign and with the Gatt Uruguay Round trade talks poised on a knife-edge. The official warned that the EC might be forced to make a political gesture in response to 'blatant political pressure', raising the risk of a retaliatory trade war. The US and EC have been sparring over government procurement rules for months. The US claims that bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn were offered to EC contractors under the Gatt government procurement code in 1990, compared with Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts open to US companies. The EC agrees that in absolute terms the 1990 Gatt figures confirm that the US is more generous, but Brussels officials argue that the value of EC contracts open to US companies rose sharply between 1985 and 1990, while the value of US contracts fell over the same period. Sir Leon was apparently not informed of Mr Kantor's announcement before it became public. Speaking from Prague, Sir Leon suggested that the US had missed an opportunity to discuss constructive ideas which might have led to a resolution of the dispute. EC officials said these ideas revolved around introducing reciprocity in EC-US government procurement, with the EC using Article 29 as a bargaining chip to gain access to lucrative transport and energy contracts at state level, or so-called 'sub-Federal procurement'. A spokesman for Sir Leon said in Brussels yesterday that the Commissioner was determined to avoid public threats of retaliation. 'We are going to play the game properly right down to the wire.' However, the spokesman agreed that Mr Kantor's threats of sanctions had raised the stakes in US-EC relations, putting even more pressure on the US trade representative's planned talks with Sir Leon in Brussels on March 29.</p>

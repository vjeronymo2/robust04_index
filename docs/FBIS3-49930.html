The government coalition consists of the Civic Democratic  Party (ODS), Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), Christian  Democratic Party (KDS), and Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL).    This view is not shared by two opposition parties, the KSCM  (Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia) and the Left Bloc (LB)  as they consider it danger for the Czech Republic's sovereignty.    Vera Zezulkova, a spokesman for the KSCM, expressed fear  that  the project, as a first step to NATO membership, will make it  possible to "engage the Czech Republic in possible future  conflicts serving the interest of the powers." She notes that  the scheme envisages joint maneuvers as well as stay of foreign  troops in the Czech Republic. "This, of course, does not  correspond at all to the interests of most Czech people, either  with respect to our security or to expenses."    A pan-European system of collective security, not NATO, is  necessary for "new European Security," Jaroslav Ortman, a deputy  for the LB told CTK.</p>

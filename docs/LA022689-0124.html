			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION ARREST  </P> <P> It was with sad resignation that I read about Paul Bloom, Channel 39's reporter  for the "Crime Watch" program, and his decision to have William Hammond  arrested during a television interview ("Activist Couple Question Ethics of TV  Reporter in On-Camera Arrest," Feb. 11).  </P> <P> Bloom has been dropped as anchorman and now appears to be joining a growing  trend toward sensationalist (I hesitate to use the word) journalism. In his  defense, Bloom avers that Hammond was "a wanted criminal" and he was only doing  his civic duty by setting up the public arrest of this man. It also seems clear  that Bloom believed this leader of San Diego's homeless to be a "dangerous" man  who should be returned to prison.  </P> <P> One can only wonder, then, that if these assertions are true, why didn't Bloom  urge Hammond's immediate arrest prior to air time? Surely if the authorities  felt him to be a major threat to society, hopefully they wouldn't have waited  until the taped interview. To wait, however, until the time of the interview  and then in a coordinated fashion have the arrest be the highlight of the  program can only underscore the desire of this reporter to join in a growing  trend with others who seek to be more TV "personalities" than empirical,  critical and professional purveyors of the news.  </P> <P> ASBURY L.

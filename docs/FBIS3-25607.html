			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports from Digfer Hospital, Mogadishu, say the  bodies of two Somali men killed by Pakistani soldiers are lying  in the hospital. Neither the Pakistani troops nor UN Operation  Somalia [UNOSOM] have commented on the killing of the two men,  who were killed near the university on 11 and 12 February. The  incident was actually hidden from the media.    Malyuun Abdulle Mohamoud, mother of one of the dead men --  Abdullahi Abdi Ogle -- who was speaking at the hospital this  morning to our health affairs reporter Abshir Nur Ali, said she  had been going to the Pakistani barracks for the last nine days  asking to see the body of her son. The identity of the second  man is still unknown. Some people believe that bodies of people  killed are being hidden in UNOSOM camps, particularly in  Pakistani one, with the aim of hiding them from reporters.</p>

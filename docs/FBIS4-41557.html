			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Open appeal by labor collective of Russian Federal Nuclear </F> Center--All-Russia Scientific Research Institute of Technical  Physics to Russian President B.N. Yeltsin under the "Nuclear  Center Warns..." rubric: "Creators of Nuclear Weapons Have  Passed to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA a Letter for the Russian  President"]    [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    We employees of the Russian Federal Nuclear  Center--All-Russia Scientific Research Institute of Technical  Physics [RFNC-ARSRITP] are deeply concerned at the situation  which has taken shape in the nuclear weapons complex. While  conscious of the whole complexity of the economic situation in  Russia, we are nevertheless forced to draw your attention to the  inadmissibility of the current process of virtual destruction of  such a unique project as our enterprise.    The RFNC-ARSRITP, one of two Russian federal nuclear  centers,  was formed in the city of Chelyabinsk-70 (now a closed  administrative-territorial formation, Snezhinsk city,  Chelyabinsk Oblast) in 1955. The past decades of peace and  creative building in the life of our state have shown that  active pursuit of nuclear weapons projects, including the years  of work on creating appropriate nuclear weapon systems, is the  most effective means of deterring any aggression. More than 50  percent of the nuclear weapon systems now in our arsenal include  nuclear charges developed at the RFNC-ARSRITP.    In recent years there has been a substantial change in the  state authorities' attitude to the military-industrial complex  as a whole, including the two federal nuclear centers. The  RFNC-ARSRITP is currently being funded at such a low level that  there is a real threat that work on the state defense order will  cease, not to mention the development of conversion areas. At  the same time three similar centers in the United States are  continuing to function at the former level -- they are  recognized as the country's national asset.    Constantly inadequate and late funding has brought the  RFNC-ARSRITP to crisis point. The enterprise's debts run into  tens of billions of rubles and are increasing, owing inter alia  to enforced expenditure on paying fines and credits.    The equipment is aging physically, and there is a  catastrophic shortage of materials, tools, and special clothing;  energy suppliers have repeatedly warned that they will cease  supplying gas and electricity. As a consequence, there is a  growing risk that emergency situations will arise, even  involving technologically dangerous production sections.    Systematic delays over paying wages to employees over the  past two and a half years are creating a very complex,  physically and morally difficult social situation in the labor  collective. People simply do not have the wherewithal to live  or to feed their children. In such a psychological state they  have to work under particularly harmful and dangerous conditions  -- which can have grave consequences.    An extremely complex situation is also occurring in the  social sphere. Medicine ekes out a pitiful existence, the birth  rate has fallen, and the level of sickness and mortality has  increased. There are no funds to improve the health of working  people and their children. Housing construction has virtually  stopped, the number of needy people is growing, and there are  families with three children living in a hostel. The subsidiary  agricultural enterprise has been forced to reduce the numbers of  livestock and poultry, cannot supply the working people with  food, and is essentially falling apart.    Concerned at the current processes and at the threatened  loss of the technical and scientific potential which had been  attained and which it will be impossible to restore, the  leadership and the trade union committee of the RFNC-ARSRITP  have repeatedly asked various state organs to examine questions  of the enterprise's financial and economic position. There is a  draft government decree on funding the federal nuclear centers  which has been discussed repeatedly in the Ministry of Finance,  the Ministry of the Economy, and the Ministry of Labor. But the  majority of the labor collective's appeals have gone unanswered,  and the draft decree remains just a draft.    We once again ask all state management bodies and you  personally, Boris Nikolayevich, to consider our problems and to  adopt corresponding decisions without delay, primarily on these  questions:    approval of the Russian Federation Government decree on  funding the federal nuclear centers;    repayment of debts and payment of delayed wages;    allocation of the necessary funds for housing construction,  medicine, and other areas of the social sphere.    We are sure that Russia needs our labor, and we are ready to  give our knowledge, strength, and experience in the name of our  motherland's independence and might. We hope for wisdom and  farsightedness from the president, the government, and Russia's  other administrative bodies.    The appeal is signed by 7,369 employees of the RFNC-ARSRITP.</p>

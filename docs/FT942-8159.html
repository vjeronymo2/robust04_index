			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Flush funds Within the past six months, three new investment trusts pulled in about Pounds 1.5bn of investors' money between them: the Mercury World Mining fund (December 1993, Pounds 426m); Kleinwort European Privatisations (February 1994, Pounds 500m); and Mercury European Privatisations (March 1994, Pounds 575m), writes Bethan Hutton. With such enormous sums to dispose of, it is perhaps no surprise that the managers of the funds continue to hold large amounts of cash. Kleinwort European has been quicker than most to invest its money but, as its shares were issued half-paid, there was less to start with. It will receive another inflow in August. About 90 per cent of the first tranche is invested, mostly directly in equities. Mercury European fund is 40 per cent in cash - but that is not because of any difficulty investing the money. It is deliberate policy based on the manager's view of the market, and appears to be working so far: the net asset value per share has grown from 95.5p to 97.52p, while markets have fallen. Of the money invested, about a third is in futures rather than shares. The Mercury Mining fund is now about 80 per cent invested. The process has been slow in this case because the fund's aim is not to buy the larger, more liquid mining shares but, instead, to seek much smaller stocks.</p>

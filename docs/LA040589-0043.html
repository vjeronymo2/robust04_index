			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Pepsi is hedging on its support of Madonna. The much-ballyhooed ad the singer  made for Pepsi, which aired only once in a splashy debut on March 2, will not  be shown again because it is tied in the public's mind to the controversial  "Like a Prayer" video, a spokesman for the cola giant confirmed Tuesday. As for  the financial support of a Madonna concert tour that was also included in the  reported $5-million deal Madonna signed with Pepsi earlier this year, the  company's Tod MacKenzie would say only: "No comment." PepsiCo, a conglomerate  that also includes such businesses as Frito-Lay, Kentucky Fried Chicken and  Taco Bell, had been targeted for boycott by both the conservative American  Family Assn. and Catholic Bishop Rene Gracida of Texas. The association's Rev.  Donald Wildmon said this week that he would end the boycott after being told by  Pepsi that it would pull the ad and cancel the tour sponsorship. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

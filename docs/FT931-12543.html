			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Consultation paper on rail privatisation The Department of Transport's consultation paper on rail privatisation and passenger rolling stock envisages a time of healthy leasing in new and second-hand trains. There is one big problem: operators will be reluctant to take out a 15-year lease on a train if their franchise expires after five years. A four-pronged transitional arrangement is proposed to overcome this: Companies might win franchises for longer than five years if they promise to re-equip a line with new trains. The franchising authority might agree that if a franchisee investing in new trains failed to win renewal the successor would be required to take over the trains. The government might be prepared to underwrite a proportion of the losses suffered by a train lessor who failed to find a buyer or lessee for trains made redundant by the loss of a franchise. Public sector train leasing companies might be set up as interim measure, though the government would aim to privatise them soon.</p>

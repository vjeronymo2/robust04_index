			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 22 Jun--Poland welcomes with satisfaction  the fact that Russia, as the 21st state, has joined the  Partnership for Peace program under the conditions defined in  its framework document, says a Foreign Affairs Ministry  statement conveyed to PAP on 22 June.    The statement says: This is an important step along the road  toward strengthening the stability of our continent, compatible  with the philosophy of the program. It is suited to new  European conditions and the new tasks of the Atlantic Alliance.    Poland, which joined the Partnership for Peace on 2 February  and submitted its presentation document on 25 April of this year  and is now close to coordinating an individual partnership  program with NATO, hopes that Russia's participation in the  program will also promote partnerlike Polish-Russian cooperation.    We invariably believe that good cooperation between NATO and  Russia, pursued with respect for the interests of all partner  states, irrespective of their size and military potential, is of  fundamental significance for security and stability in Europe.  Poland is convinced that this cooperation should be accompanied  by a gradual expansion of the Alliance to interested states that  share its objectives and values. This would promote the  implementation of Alliance tasks and the stabilization of the  European situation, the Foreign Ministry statement says.</p>

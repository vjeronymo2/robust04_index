			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Strong TV interest in host nation's debut game The first World Cup game played by a US team on American soil was watched by a surprisingly large domestic television audience, according to preliminary ratings. Although the US-Switzerland game at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, last Saturday started as early as 11.30am, it attracted a 5.8 rating on the ABC network in the 29 largest US television markets. One rating point is the equivalent of 941,000 homes. The US national team's World Cup opening game ended in a 1-1 draw. In comparison, ABC's broadcast later the same day of the third round of the US Open golf tournament - traditionally a strong draw among sports fans - earned a 5.0 rating. The 5.8 rating for US vs Switzerland was an average for the two-hour broadcast. The data showed that as the game progressed, more people turned on their sets to watch it, with the final 30 minutes earning a 7.2 rating. ABC, which normally does not broadcast sports programming so early on a Saturday, was surprised by the strong rating for the US-Switzerland game. Mark Mandel, director of sports information for ABC, said the network was 'very pleased . . . particularly as the game was on so early.' He added: 'We're off to a great start.' Corporate sponsors of the tournament were also delighted with the rating for the first US game. Eric Kraus, a spokesman for Gillette, which is advertising heavily on television during the tournament, said: 'The high rating shows that there is a great deal of enthusiasm for World Cup soccer in the US, and that it is really catching on.' Jackie Woodward, director of sports marketing at McDonald's, another big advertiser, said: 'We're thrilled.' Although the US-Switzerland rating proved the pessimists who said Americans were not interested in the World Cup wrong, it is still too early to judge whether enthusiasm for the tournament is broad-based, or sustainable. The preliminary ratings for the weekend games shown on ESPN, the cable sports channel which is sharing World Cup coverage with ABC, are not yet available, and the real test for ABC will come when it broadcasts a game not involving the US team.</p>

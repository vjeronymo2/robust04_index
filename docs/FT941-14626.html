			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Brother declines to Y603m Brother Industries, the typewriter manufacturer and Japan's largest sewing machine maker, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the year to November 20 down 45 per cent to Y603m (Dollars 5m) from Y1.09bn. The Nagoya-based group said the results had been pulled down by the weak Japanese and European economies. Turnover fell to Y144.5bn from Y160.8bn, a drop of 10.1 per cent. Domestic sales were particularly weak, down 19.5 per cent to Y41.41bn. Exports, whose value was undermined by the strength of the yen, fell 5.7 per cent to Y103bn. European demand had been poor, said the company. Net profits for the year dropped 12.2 per cent from Y826m to Y725m. Earnings per share fell from Y3.08 to Y2.7. The group, which initiated a cost-cutting programme in June last year, is maintaining its dividend at Y7.5 per share for the year. It predicted pre-tax profits for the 12 months beginning 21 November 1993 of Y1.2bn on sales of Y131.5bn. Net profits would be Y600m. Last year Brother transferred production of its portable typewriters from Japan to the US.</p>

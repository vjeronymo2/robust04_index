When it gave up last October dumping liquid radioactive  waste  into the Sea of Japan, the Russian side counted on foreign  assistance, specifically that of Japan, in building a storage  for this waste in the Far East. However, so far Russia has not  been rendered such assistance. For this reason, the issue of  dumping radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan is left open.    According to the ministry official, Japan did not restrict  its initiative by offering Russia one tanker only. The other  day, two more tankers have been offered, which are to be  examined by Russian experts in near future.</p>

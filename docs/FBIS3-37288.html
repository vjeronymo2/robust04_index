			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- The treaty signed  today by the Russian Federation and Tatarstan shows that  "dictates from the center are being replaced by mutual respect  for the interests of the Russian Federation as a whole, and for  each component of the federation, in particular," Boris Yeltsin  said at the signing ceremony.    The president emphasized the importance of the formula  arrived at during the drafting of the treaty. The treaty's  preamble states that the Republic of Tatarstan is unified, as a  state, with the RF by the constitution of the Russian  Federation, by the constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan,  and by the treaty on delimitation of responsibilities and mutual  delegation of powers. The Republic of Tatarstan takes part in  international relations and foreign economic activity.    "This formula," the president said, "also reflects the  actual  unity of the Russian state, as it exists now, and its new  federal structure. It is developed on the basis of the  constitution of the Russian Federation, backed up by treaty  procedures, that is, by harmonization of interests."    The head of state stressed that "treaties of this kind are,  basically, the sole constitutional way of removing  contradictions between the Russian Federation Constitution and  republican constitutions in a civilized way, without twisting  anyone's arm."    "Everyone should see that this is not a conspiracy among  bosses, another carve-up of powers, but a positive political and  economic development," the president said.</p>

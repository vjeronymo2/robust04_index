			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Cantab poised for listing in London CANTAB Pharmaceuticals, the UK bio-pharmaceutical company quoted on Nasdaq in the US, is to come to the London market through a placing or open offer likely to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. In July last year the company sold 1m shares at Dollars 10 (670p) in an initial public offering, since when the stock has slipped to about Dollars 8 in line with a fall that has hit much of the US bio-technology sector. The company also raised Dollars 5m through a private placing in the US earlier this year. Mr Paul Hancock, chief executive, said it had always been the group's intention to raise money in its home market. Like many of the bio-technology companies that have come to the market, Cantab is some way from developing a marketable drug. The candidate drug it currently believes most likely to make it to market is LM-CD45, a white blood cell modulator which it is developing in collaboration with Baxter Healthcare, the large US corporation. The drug, if successfully developed, would be used to prevent rejection of kidneys after transplant operations and could replace the use of immuno-suppressive drugs. The product is currently in stage 2 clinical trials which means that at the earliest it will make it to market in 1997. The three other products Cantab expects to go into clinical trials shortly would not be on the market before 1998. The group was co-founded in 1989 by Mr Alan Munro, former head of immunology at Cambridge University. It is pursuing research in organ transplant rejection, cervical cancer, genital herpes, genital warts and inflammatory bowel disease. In the six months to June 30 1993, Cantab lost Pounds 1.2m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.4m in the year to end-December. It has cash of about Pounds 8.1m. Barclays de Zoete Wedd is adviser to the issue. A prospectus is expected within the next two weeks.</p>

At the moment, a total of 1,720,000 citizens have been  registered in the republic. Meanwhile, the country's population  amounts to 2,648,000 people, according to the data of 1991.    Vidzups said the foreign passports of the former Soviet  Union  will be granted to republican citizens in 1994. Only  non-citizens residing in the republic will be able to obtain  them. Therefore, Latvian citizens intending to travel abroad  will have to obtain a passport of the Latvian republic.    The work of the visas and passports department is hampered  by  the fact that the Latvian parliament has not decided yet on the  status of foreigners and aliens residing in the republic,  Vidzups said.    As known, until now Latvian citizens acquiring the  republican  citizenship for the first time at the age of 16 years old are  given a passport of the non-existing Soviet Union.</p>

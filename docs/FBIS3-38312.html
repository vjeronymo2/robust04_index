DIKO [Democratic Party] deputy Markos Kiprianou raised the  issue of handing over left-wing Turks and Kurds to Turkey, where  they face certain imprisonment or death, at yesterday's closed  House Legal Affairs Committee meeting.    Mikhailidhis, who was present yesterday, told the committee:  "If a Kurd's life is in danger for political reasons then he  will not be handed over to the Turks."    Kiprianou also asked the minister to study other cases  brought up by the Kurdistan solidarity committee.    There are accusations that Turks and Kurds were being sent  back to instant death after entering the free areas illegally.    Kiprianou wanted to discuss with Mikhailidhis the procedures  followed when Kurds or Turks enter the free-areas illegally.    According to the Turkish Cypriot press, two Turks who  entered  the free area illegally through Famagusta recently were sent  back by the government.    One of the Turks, according to reports, was a member of the  Turkish National Liberation Party and a PLO member.    Police say it's their policy to send back those who enter  the  free areas illegally.    The Kurds argue that such action is unacceptable because  dissidents are treated as deserters and face the death penalty  on their return.    "The major thing is that lives of Kurds are not put in  danger, if it is known they face death on being returned to  Turkey or the occupied areas," said Kiprianou afterwards.</p>

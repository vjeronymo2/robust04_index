			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Row over Treuhand's flagship railway sale  -East Germans say rolling stock group is being sold too cheaply The collapse of Russian and east European markets continues to haunt Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA), the giant manufacturer of railway rolling stock and one of the last industrial complexes under Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency. Once flagship of the former communist East Germany, the enterprise built 29,000 wagons for the Russian market after 1948. 'We were entirely dependent on exports to Russia,' says Mr Peter Witt, DWA chairman. Over nearly 40 years, DWA expanded rapidly. By 1989, turnover had exceeded DM2bn (Dollars 1.27bn) and the future of the 24,500 workers seemed secure. But the union of the two Germanys in 1990, followed by the collapse of Comecon, the socialist trading organisation, entirely changed the circumstances of the enterprise. 'Gradually the orders to Russia dried up,' says Mr Hans-Joachim Ratsch, deputy head of the workers' council at DWA's plant at Ammendorf in Saxony-Anhalt. 'Russia has no money to pay for its orders. We have to find new markets. But time is running out.' The Ammendorf plant reduced its work force from 4,700 before 1990 to 1,800 today. A further 800 jobs will be lost over the next few years. In an attempt to save DWA, one of the few remaining manufacturing outlets in eastern Germany, the Treuhand and the finance ministry allocated substantial aid to the company. Since 1991, DWA has received credits amounting to DM4bn to help find new markets. A further DM250m was earmarked for investments, and last September an additional DM500m was allocated to provide liquidity. In the meantime, the total workforce has been reduced to 6,600, which DWA officials admit is still too large. The collapse of the Russian and east European markets and exposure to competition has seriously affected DWA's turnover. Sales this year will amount to about DM800m and losses will rise to DM43m. Turnover is expected to slip to DM500m during 1995, unless there is any positive shift in the Russian market. But the collapse of the eastern markets, coupled with overcapacity in the railway manufacturing industry, has in turn also made it difficult for the Treuhand to find a buyer for DWA. For political and social reasons, the Treuhand could not afford to close down DWA completely. Nor could it split it up into separate entities and sell each one off. Instead the Treuhand opted for privatising it as a whole. Mr Witt denies this policy delayed the sale of DWA. 'DWA could not exist as a name or as a company if it was split up and sold off in separate parts,' says Mr Witt, adding that this was exactly what several west German companies wanted. 'The big western companies were afraid of DWA becoming competitive.' But now, after 38 companies have looked at but shied away from the sheer size of DWA, the Treuhand is confident it has found a a buyer. Advent International, the US-based venture capital investment group, is drawing up a contract with the Treuhand to buy five of the remaining eight subsidiaries of DWA. According to DWA and Treuhand officials, Advent will buy 100 per cent of DWA, will take Siemens, Germany's largest electronic and electrical company, as its technological partner, and will eventually list DWA on the stock exchange, possibly by 2005. Advent is not prepared to comment until the contract is signed and sealed. But the purchase price - and the number of workers Advent intends to retain  -have caused a political row in eastern Germany. DWA officials confirmed this week that Advent will pay, over time, DM112.8m for DWA, will guarantee 2,400 jobs, and invest DM250m. 'We have not given away DWA to Advent,' says Mr Witt. 'This is no present. We have found a buyer which will allow us to pursue our strategy of finding markets, introducing new products and become competitive.' Mr Witt also insists that Advent will pursue 'a hands-off' management style and will not interfere in the company. Consultants involved in the negotiations between DWA and the Treuhand contest this view. 'Advent is answerable to its investors, it manages those funds on behalf of its institutional investors, who in turn will expect a return on their investment,' the consultant says. 'Moreover, Advent is a hands-on investment group. If the management of DWA thinks otherwise, it is mistaken.' Despite the differences in expectations of management style, Mr Witt remains confident that DWA can be turned around by Advent. He says DWA, against strong competition, has won orders from Berlin to build carriages for the city's train system, and is co-operating with Siemens, AEG and other companies. But he also knows that any big improvement in turnover, and attempts to save more than 2,400 jobs, will depend on receiving large orders from Russia. On that point, few at DWA, or the Treuhand, are hopeful. 'If we want to survive and prosper, we have no other choice but to become competitive in the European markets. I think it can be done. But I know we have to rationalise even further,' says Mr Witt.</p>

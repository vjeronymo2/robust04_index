			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The profits warning from Fisons sent an early shiver through stock index futures, and dominated trading in stock options writes Joel Kibazo. The steady opening of the June contract on the FT-SE at 2,633 did not last for the profits warning from Fisons sent June tumbling to 2,612, the day's low point. A clutch of down gradings in the equities market also played a part in weakening sentiment. The release of figures showing a fall in the underlying inflation rate in the UK helped curtail further falls in June and light buying led to a modest mid session advance. The firm Wall street opening led to further buying activity in the afternoon though a loss of nerve as the market closed once again saw sellers assume the upper hand. June eventually closed at 2,613 down 16 on the previous session and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover at 8,111 lots was reasonable. Fisons dominated trading in the options, which recorded a total of 33,623 contracts. The FT-SE option traded 12,472 lots. Fisons traded a total of 5,746 contracts.</p>

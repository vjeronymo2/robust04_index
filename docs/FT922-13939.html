			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Retailers accused of penalising credit customers BARCLAYS BANK attacked high street retailers yesterday, accusing them of blackmail and holding their customers to ransom in their efforts to prevent banks raising their credit and debit card charges. The claim followed revelations earlier this week by Tesco, the food store which chairs the Debit Card Users Group, that banks charge substantially more for electronic debit card transactions than they do for cheques. Tesco's managing director Mr David Malpas, speaking on Tuesday after the company announced increased annual pretax profits, said his company might fight the increased prices for card services on its customers' behalf - if necessary by banning card payments. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays Central Retail Services Division, the largest credit and debit card organisation in the UK, said: 'Over the last three years card processing charges levied on retailers have reduced sharply - by over 25 per cent on credit cards and over 40 per cent on debit cards. Consumers have not seen the benefits of these reductions in the prices they pay at the point of sale.' Mr Reay-Smith said that retailers were threatening to penalise customers by refusing to accept cards or by charging extra for transactions. 'High Street shoppers will take a dim view of blackmail by some retailers which could prevent them buying goods with credit and debit cards or force them to pay more through surcharges,' he added. Banks claim that retailers enjoy substantial benefits through accepting cards, including quicker guaranteed payment, reductions in processing and security costs, and a flow of extra customers who prefer to pay by card. 'These far outweigh any extra cost to the retailers,' Mr Reay-Smith said. Barclays confirmed yesterday that banks charge some retailers more for debit card transactions than for cheques. 'Our minimum charge for cheque transactions is about 4p, though it can rise to 63p for small business customers,' a Barclays spokesman said. Debit cards carry a flat transaction charge of 12p reflecting the increased security and convenience of these payments.</p>

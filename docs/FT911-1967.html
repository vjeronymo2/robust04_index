			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (14): Make haste - but slowly - Profile: Jerzy Eysmont 'WET' and 'dry' are relative terms in Poland. But, with unemployment rising, wholesale closure of factories imminent and autumn elections on the horizon, it would be extraordinary if the 'Balcerowicz plan' with its emphasis on the fight against inflation, tight money and balanced budgets did not face strong internal opposition. It does. Mr Jerzy Eysmont, the 54-year-old head of the Central Planning Office, one of only two ministers from the main-stream Centre Alliance in a government dominated by 'liberal' free-marketeers, is the main advocate of an alternative, 'riskier', economic policy. He worked with Mr Balcerowicz on an earlier, abortive plan for radical economic reforms in 1979-81 and was an economic adviser to Solidarity during martial law. 'The Finance Minister wants inflation down to 1-2 per cent per month. I'm not so tough. I want inflation to be lower than 1990, and without the big monthly variations, but I'm more concerned with breaking out of the recession,' he says. While the government aims for annual inflation of around 32 per cent this year Mr Eysmont says a reduction from 250 per cent in 1991 to 'no more than 100 per cent this year and 50 per cent in 1992' would be more reasonable given Poland's fragile political and economic situation.' I think Poland will be politically more stable if the private sector, in particular, can still grow.' But,'if the government does not change its policy it risks being thrown out', he warns. While conscious of the need to comply with Poland's IMF agreement the intense university professor, who specialised in the macroeconomic application of computers to economic forecasting, questions the commitment to a balanced budget. 'I think it is better to have a moderate deficit and create conditions for growth rather than a balanced budget accompanied by recession,' he argues. 'We must take risks. The greatest danger is stagflation. We have to give dynamism to society, but if we concentrate too rigorously on lowering inflation we will employ brakes which are safe but tie our hands,' he argues. His view seems to reflect the thinking of President Walesa who recognises the international credibility won by Mr Balcerowicz, but is no economist and places his faith in foreign investment attracted by broader political arguments rather than confidence in Polish economic management per se. As to exchange rate stability, another element of the Balcerowicz strategy, Mr Eysmont believes that 'a floating rate is desirable in the near future.' Mr Eysmont, who was deported to Khazakstan as a child and was sacked from the planning ministry after martial law, cites the collapse of exports to the Soviet Union as the main reason for abandoning the acknowledged anchor function of a fixed exchange rate, but also cites the difficulty of exporting to western markets. 'We need a solution which allows rapid modernisation of technology and this means incentives for foreign investment,' he says. 'But the main aim must be to develop the economy with Polish capital.' A strong supporter of rapid privatisation, Mr Eysmont argues that selling state enterprises and encouraging house building would ease inflation and channel higher incomes into investment rather than consumption. With elections looming, the case for monetary and fiscal relaxation is bound to look increasingly attractive. The hardest test for Mr Balcerowicz, is yet to come.</p>

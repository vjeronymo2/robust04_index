			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: An unfair way to pay for TV Sir, A point not mentioned by Christopher Dunkley in his fascinating overview ('The BBC at bay', April 20) of the BBC's place in contemporary society is that the current method of financing the corporation severely limits the viewer's choice. Legally, if he wants to watch television at all, he must pay the licence fee. Even if he abhors the BBC's offer ings, high-brow or low-brow, and watches only ITV, Channel 4 or satellite, he must buy a licence. All of us, in fact, are compelled to sup port the corporation financially. I find this unfair and unreasonable. If some other method of financing the corporation were to be devised which offered the choice of watching and paying or not watching and not paying, then I would be happy for the BBC to continue enjoying its reputation. But why should we be compelled to pay? The licence fee is akin to a form of taxation which almost all must pay whether or not they avail themselves of the corporation's broadcast services.

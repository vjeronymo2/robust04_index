Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 29, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to make certain amendments to Rule 1047A regarding index option opening rotations, halts, and reopenings. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Notice of the proposal, including Amendment No. 1, appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 15, 1993. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On July 13, 1993 the Phlx amended the rule change proposal to adopt a floor procedure advice to parallel the provisions of the proposed rule in order to make the procedures readily available to floor members in their advice handbooks. See letter from Edith Hallahan, Attorney, Market Surveillance, Phlx to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated July 8, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). On January 19, 1994 the Phlx amended the proposal to remove the proposed provision that would have required index options to be halted from trading whenever securities representing more than 50% of the current index value had been halted or suspended from trading on the primary market. Rather, as amended, under such circumstances, the decision to halt index option trading would be left to the discretion of the Exchange or one of its floor officials. This amendment would also be reflected in the proposed floor procedure advice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, Phlx to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Options and Derivatives Branch, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated January 19, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33025 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 53604. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx has proposed amending Phlx Rule 1047A: (1) To require specialists to open an industry index option for trading once securities representing 90% of the current value of the index have opened for trading on the primary market; (2) to permit specialists to open such industry index options once securities representing 50% of the current value of the index have opened; (3) to permit specialists to halt index option trading, subject to floor official approval, once securities representing more than 10% of the current value of the index are halted or suspended upon; and (4) to permit specialists to reopen halted options once securities representing 50% of the market value of an index are opened or the Exchange determines that the conditions that led to the trading halt are no longer present. Although the text of Rule 1047A would be reorganized, the following provisions would not be substantively changed: (1) The provision in Rule 1047A(a) that the Exchange may halt index options trading in the best interests of fair and orderly markets if certain conditions are met would appear in Rule 1047A(c); (2) Rule 1047A(d) would be renumbered as paragraph (e); (3) Rule 1047A(c), to be renumbered as paragraph (b) would be retitled as ``Modified Rotations and SORT''; and (4) the third paragraph of Rule 1047A(a) would contain the provisions formerly in paragraph (b) regarding the procedure for opening. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, with respect to reorganization, Rule 1047A, currently titled ``Traded Rotations, Halts or Suspensions'' would be retitled ``Trading Rotations, Halts or Reopenings.'' The proposal would also reorganize the paragraphs to logically follow the procedure of the opening, halting and reopening of trading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Commission Findings and Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of sections 6(b)(5) in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade as well as to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the proposal will, under the applicable circumstances, help prevent investors from being exposed to index options trading based on incomplete pricing data in the underlying securities by setting forth specific standards for opening and halting trading. For example, in providing that a specialist may open industry index options for trading when securities representing 50% of the current index value of all securities underlying the particular industry index have opened for trading on their respective primary market, industry index option market specialists will have the discretion to determine if adequate pricing information is available in order to ensure that pricing of industry index options at least substantially reflects the current market value of the traded index's underlying securities. The proposed requirement that specialists must open their assigned industry index options when 90% of the current index value of all securities in the index have opened reflects the appropriate determination that such a level should permit index option pricing that accurately reflects the value of the underlying index components, upon the index option opening. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

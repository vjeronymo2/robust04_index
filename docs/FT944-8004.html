			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / The odour of rising damp If they had privatised the Conservative party its board would be in a right old pickle. Think about it. There they would sit, the dignitaries of Tory Promotions plc, dog-eared copies of the latest consultants' report spread out before them. Report? That is not the word. The note prepared by Mr John Maples is the most devastating indictment of a sinking enterprise since Noah was informed, following in-depth qualitative research, that there was a distinct odour of rising damp about the place. The deputy chairman of the party did not intend that his charge-sheet should be published. He might have known better. My colleague Robert Peston reproduced its main points in yesterday's FT. It says, very nearly in so many words, that the government has been seen through by a significant proportion of the voters who supported it in April 1992. 'We must deliver improved results in the four key areas of the economy, law and order, education and health,' writes Mr Maples. Quite so. But does he fully appreciate what he is saying? Sure he does. He is as an affable and apparently straightforward fellow. He is telling Mr John Major, for whose perusal the note was intended, that after 15 years of Conservative rule, four of them under the prime minister, people feel insecure about jobs and living standards. They doubt the government's competence, and suspect its motives. They are nervous about the prospects for treatment in hospitals. They deplore the collapse of families, values and morality, wince at school closures, and - unkindest cut of all - believe that Labour would be more likely than the Tories to restore law and order. Nor is the boss himself spared. 'Special consideration and planning is needed for the prime minister's activities to give meaning and focus to everything else we do,' he writes circumspectly on page 12, echoing page 2's call for 'purpose and direction'. There we have it. Mr Maples's thesis is a cry of despair. He has analysed the results of detailed interviews with 80 people who voted Tory last time, but who doubt that they will again. Every Tory MP with a majority under 20,000 knows why. 'So, what can we do . . .?' wails the deputy chairman. He hopes that better news management will help the party explain that 'four or even five years of recovery with no rise in living standards' is 'good for the longer term'. You can appreciate the difficulty by noting one particular paragraph in the appendix to his memorandum. Voters, it appears, have come to believe that 'although in the 1980s the Conservatives seemed to promise a classless society of opportunity, the reality is now that the rich are getting richer on the backs of the rest, who are getting poorer'. Funny about that. Fate has so arranged matters that Robert Peston's scoop appeared on the same day as the announcement by British Gas that its top managers are to pay themselves up to 75 per cent more. This self-improvement plan is exceeded in the modesty of its aspirations only by the delicacy of its timing and the tact with which it has been conveyed. It follows the latest round of gas price increases, which will be higher for those who fail to pay by direct debit. Clearly, British Grab likes to have its hand in your pocket. It feels more comfortable there. The voters who told Mr Maples that they worry about their jobs will note that the performance indicators upon which privatised industry directors are basing their handouts to themselves move sharply upwards whenever employees are sacked. Hence the motto of the 1990s: downsizing equals upbonusing. Labour cannot lose on this one. All it has to do is remark in tones of injured innocence that the government could give the regulators of privatised monopolies stronger powers. Mr Major has time in which to act. His publicly owned administration is sitting on a five-year contract. A private-sector Tory Promotions board would feel less secure. Its members would be trembling at their deputy chairman's report. The poor boobies would not know whether to resign or award themselves double pay, triple bonuses, and universal options. Do not misunderstand me. Labour could yet lose the next election, even against this imperfect government. It is good at losing. Bear with me as I shuffle my files. Yes. Here it is. Any Southern Comfort?, the mirror-image of the Maples report, was published in September. This Fabian pamphlet, by Giles Radice and Stephen Pollard, noted the failings of the people's party. It, too, drew on focus-group research into potential Labour voters. It found that while Labour is better regarded than it was, it is still on probation. White-collar and skilled manual employees are worried about crime, jobs, health care, their children's futures. Labour has not yet convinced sufficient potential converts that it will make the streets safe and enlarge the employment market without raising taxes or restarting inflation. See? Mr Tony Blair's repositioning of his party has indeed only begun. Yesterday Mr Pollard, he of the Radice-Pollard pamphlet, argued, in a paper published by the Social Market Foundation, that Labour should explicitly embrace the market. In The market and Clause IV he offers an idealist's version of the statement of aims that will shortly be put before Labour's national executive. He wants references to trade unions and nationalisation out, and a statement that the market is the only efficient means of allocating resources in. Mr Blair may do all that, but not so starkly. He could waffle on about ethics and little else, but that would be to dodge the issue. He could resort to cloudy talk of public ownership in auspicious circumstances, but then he might as well keep the present quasi-Marxist formulation. Whatever he does he had better not dilly-dally. Next week the chancellor will deliver what may become the last budget before tax cuts are back in fashion. That will lay the groundwork for a 'responsible' act of brigandage. Next year, or the year after, or in both years, Mr Kenneth Clarke, finance director of Tory Promotions plc, will try what has worked so well in the past. He will bribe the shareholders with their own money. The Maples memo can then be shredded. Glued to the national lottery, this nation of suckers may once again get the government it deserves.</p>

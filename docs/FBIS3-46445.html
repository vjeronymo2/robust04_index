The U.S. Senate voted by 62 to 38 yesterday to urge the  Clinton administration to lift expeditiously the U.S. embargo on  trade with Vietnam.    The department spokeswoman Christine Shelly told a regular  news briefing that "no decision has been made there on the  lifting of the trade embargo and there isn't any time frame for  reaching such a decision."    Shelly said, "It's something which remains under review, and  the administration has indicated that it would consider the  views of all sides of this issue," including the Senate  resolution.    She also said there are some who believe that U.S. should  move on to the normalization of relations with Vietnam and there  are others who think that the continued accounting for the POWs  and the MIAs absolutely must come first.    "There are arguments that can be made on both sides," Shelly  said, "but I don't think the administration has specifically  taken a position on one or the other."    However, she noted that "the President has linked further  progress in our relations with Vietnam to achieving the fullest  possible accounting on the POWs and the MIAs."    "The key thing for us is to get to the point where we are  completely satisfied with the accounting for the POWs and the  MIAs and then to take things from there," Shelly added.</p>

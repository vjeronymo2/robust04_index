			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH SALUTED AS NARRATOR OF 'PETER, WOLF'  </P> <P> Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North won hearty applause for his musical stage  debut Friday night as narrator of "Peter and the Wolf," but among the  youngsters in the audience he was clearly upstaged by the wolf.  </P> <P> "It was right nice," said Aquil Robinson, 12. "What I liked best was when the  wolf ate the duck."  </P> <P> North, 46, who is appealing his May 4 conviction on three felony charges in  connection with the Iran-Contra affair, accepted an invitation from Maria  Fisher, president of the Beethoven Society, to read the narration for Sergei  Prokofiev's musical tale for children.  </P> <P> The retired Marine colonel and former White House national security aide wore a  tuxedo for his half-hour performance in the main ballroom of a downtown hotel  before about 1,000 spectators.  </P> <P> The audience included North's probation officer, Ralph Ardito, and 100  inner-city children from the Save Our Youth anti-drug program in Washington,  where North is serving his sentence of 1,200 hours of community service. He  also was given two years' probation and fined $150,000.  </P> <P> North read with lively expression and never missed a cue from the orchestra  conductor. He said it was his first stage appearance since he played "the bad  guy" in a high school production of "How the West Was Won" in his hometown of  Philmont, N.Y., nearly 30 years ago.  </P> <P> "It was wonderful," said former North associate Robert W. Owen, who saw the  show with his 2-year-old daughter Katie. "Ollie may have a new profession,"  said Owen, who once served as North's liaison with the Nicaraguan Contras.  </P> <P> "He was very good," said conductor Richard Weilenmann. "Some narrators are  exaggerated and overblown, but North read very naturally, as if he were reading  to his own children."  </P> <P> North, who reportedly charges $25,000 for every speech he makes, narrated  "Peter and the Wolf" for free, Mrs. Fisher said.  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (7): In staff moves, no two cases are the same - As Royal Mail employees relocate from London to nine new regional divisions, executives discover that there is no such thing as a mass exodus ROYAL MAIL knows a thing or two about moving around the country. It handles 60m pieces of mail a day, and faced with a need to restructure its letter business and move staff out of London to nine new regional divisions including the capital, it had to apply its specialist knowledge to its own staff. The decision to cut its London headquarters staff to 140 from 2,000 and create regional divisions is the result of identifying a need to become more responsive to customers and to create a new management structure under Royal Mail's Business Development Plan. A total of 600 staff are in the process of moving to the new regions - Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, Gloucester, Chelmsford, Brighton and Reading. The choice of the new centres was dictated in part by the natural geographical regions of the country. However, other factors played a part in the decision, including consideration of properties already owned by Royal Mail. For example, the decision to site the south-west region in Gloucester was in part influenced by the fact that the company already owned an old training college in the city, which could be converted. Similarly, an unused property in Brighton helped pinpoint the town as headquarters for the south-east division. The staff moves are being co-ordinated by an in-house team headed by Ms Angela Colyer, equal opportunities development and training manager, whose responsibility it is to deal with the human side of relocation. The team was drawn from Royal Mail's personnel department, which itself has already moved from London to Croydon and faces a further move to Chesterfield in Derbyshire under the business development plan. The team has its own budget, and works under its own logo and the slogan 'A First-Class Way to Move.' 'Staff were told of the plans in December 1990,' says Ms Colyer. Each member of staff was assessed and asked to indicate their preferences on willingness to move and locations they would be prepared to go to, as well as being asked if they would like to change jobs once the scheme moved into action. 'There was some unhappiness about the relocation scheme,' says Angela Colyer, who herself has moved to Croydon, and faces the further move to Chesterfield. She quotes her own experience of hearing the news from her line manager and then breaking the news to her husband, who was initially opposed to moving. However, it was thanks to help from National Startpoint, a Staffordshire-based independent relocation consultancy, that her husband, who ran his own construction business, was won over. National Startpoint, owned Mr John Poole, exists to help companies with relocations such as Royal Mail's; its other clients have included Barclays Bank, British Coal and IBM. It produces guides about areas which include statistical details about population and business to advice on which areas to avoid when looking for houses. 'Their guides are very good,' comments Ms Colyer. They encompass details of just about anything someone moving to a new area might need to know. This includes details of the local road networks and public transport, as well as central offices and services such as electricity, gas and water, Citizens Advice Bureaux, and health services. They also cover details on local entertainment facilities, including sports, theatres, cinemas as well as local radio stations and newspapers. Residential areas are also covered, including information on noise levels and pollution, traffic levels and congestion, as well as the 'social desirability' of areas, as Mr Poole puts it. The decision to use National Startpoint was taken after Royal Mail came into contact with the company at a Confederation of British Industry relocation conference early last year. Although the company offers many services including presentations to employees and specific research on sites, Royal Mail decided to use only its core service of information guides. These are produced from National Startpoint's computer database. Staff proposing to move to the new centres had to make their own arrangements to visit the areas, says Ms Colyer, although they could claim hotel accommodation and travel costs for their families. Angela Colyer says that one of the things the team had to do when considering moves for families was to update the concept of the family - 'instead of the old married/single definition, we changed it to accompanied/alone,' she says. This broader definition takes on board one-parent families, divorced parents, families with other dependents including older relatives and single-sex households. The team also had to cope with the problems faced by staff of selling property in the midst of a recession - 'obviously we couldn't reimburse losses, but we could help with interest-free loans,' adds Ms Colyer. Other problems faced by staff included the timing of moves to fit in with children's schooling, which the team coped with by scheduling moves for those affected in school holidays. Finding appropriate schools for children is part of the service offered by National Startpoint, a service which Angela Colyer and her family is taking advantage of. Her potential move to Chesterfield means that her two children, aged nine and six, have to move schools. As a result of the NS guides, she and her husband are 'looking at village schools'. Royal Mail expects to complete its relocation early next year. A total of 400 have already made their moves or are in the process of moving, and the team will be kept busy with the remaining 200 staff. On the whole, Angela Colyer believes, the move is going well. However, some lessons have been learned from the experience - 'I would like to have more staff in a relocation team,' she says, 'and I would like them to have had a training in counselling.' All members of the relocation team were drawn from personnel, and had experience of the kind of contact with people the task demanded, but Angela Colyer believes that a trained counsellor would have been a valuable addition. Also, says Ms Colyer, she has learnt that moving 600 people is not 'a mass move', but that every case has to be looked at individually. 'People have mortgages, pets, grannies, aunties, children and husbands, and they all have to be taken into consideration. No two cases are the same.'</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Insurer sells bulk of Seven-Up stake PRUDENTIAL, the US insurance group, plans to sell most of its remaining 20 per cent stake in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the US soft drinks maker that was the subject of a leveraged buy-out in 1998, writes Richard Waters in New York. On yesterday's closing share price in New York, of Dollars 17 3/4 - down Dollars  3/4 following the news - the deal would realise the Prudential Dollars 195m before fees. The sale of 11m shares will be through an underwritten secondary offering, with 8.8m shares offered in the US and the rest internationally. The Prudential said the disposal was in line with its normal policy of realising investment gains in the medium term. 'Generally, we like to be involved for around five years,' it said. The insurer invested Dollars 600m in the Dr Pepper buy-out, in the process taking a 49 per cent interest. All but 20 per cent has been disposed of already, the Prudential said. After the latest sale, the company plans to retain just under 2 per cent of the company's stock. Dr Pepper went public in January.</p>

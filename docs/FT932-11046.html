			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: US denies visa application by Sinn Fein chief THE US State Department has once again refused to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, reversing a campaign commitment made by President Bill Clinton before his election last year. A State Department spokesman confirmed yesterday that Mr Adams's visa request had been refused under rules that exclude people who have been involved in terrorist activity. Mr Frank McCloskey, a Democratic congressman from Indiana, said he was very disappointed by the decision. 'Generally speaking freedom of access and people is the best route to go,' he said. The refusal coincides with a visit to Washington by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. In a radio interview in the US capital yesterday, Sir Patrick refused to rule out re-starting talks on the political future of Northern Ireland without the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party. 'I would not want to anticipate any particular format,' Sir Patrick said. Mr Paisley says he will not enter talks until the Irish government makes further concessions on its constitutional claim on the six counties. He also wants Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to stop talks with Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick was due to meet attorney-general Janet Reno yesterday, as well as with a number of members of Congress interested in Northern Ireland, including Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Adams, who has had visa requests refused several times under previous US administrations, had hoped to visit the US for a book promotion tour. Last April, during a hard-fought primary election in New York state, candidate Clinton told a gathering of Irish-Americans that he thought it would be 'totally harmless to our national security and would widen the political debate in this country' to grant a visa to Mr Adams. He added, however, that he would support a visa for Mr Adams 'or any other properly elected government official recognised by the US.' Two days later, Mr Adams lost his seat in the British parliament. Mr Clinton's initial promise to appoint a peace envoy to Ulster has been scaled down since his election to a fact-finding mission, then becoming a 'willingness to send some kind of representative . . if both parties believe it would help move talks forward.'</p>

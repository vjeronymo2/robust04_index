			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Observer: Trading down In a stunning display of solidarity with the embattled Princess Diana, President Boris Yeltsin has traded in his Mercedes for something less flashy. The Russian Information Agency reports that he has returned to his old ZIL limousine - a vast, armour-plated black vehicle, shaped like a mobile version of Lenin's mausoleum. The reasons are somewhat similar to those ascribed to the Princess. Yeltsin has gone back to his ZIL 'after receiving criticism on one of his trips round the country that he was using a foreign make'. But Yeltsin may also have drawn a lesson from the experience of his predecessor Mikhail Gorbachev, one of whose expensive limos has just been stolen. That said, Yeltsin is likely to be making a lone stand. Citing sources in the government car pool, the agency reported that vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, acting Premier Yegor Gaidar and top presidential aides Gennady Burbulis and Yury Petrov had all gone off their ZILs - but did not say what they used instead. As for Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary leader, 'he prefers a Mercedes' - in spite of his much advertised concern for the fate of Russian industry.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERYL STREEP  </P> <P> I applaud Meryl Streep's speaking up on women in the movie industry ("Meryl  Acts Up," by Hilary De Vries, Sept. 9).  </P> <P> I rarely go to the movies for the reason that movies like "Pretty Women" exist.  They are insulting to my intelligence. It is the exception when a movie comes  out that portrays a real woman, rather than a male fantasy. It is evident in  Streep that strong, humorous and, above all, intelligent women exist.  </P> <P> LOIS LYNN TURNER  </P> <P> Soquel  </P></p>

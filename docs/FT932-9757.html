			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Packer sells 8% stake in Westpac Banking MR KERRY Packer, the Australian media entrepreneur, has sold an 8 per cent stake in Westpac Banking Corporation to Lend Lease Corporation, the financial services group. The shares changed hands at ADollars 3.50 each for a total transaction of ADollars 490m (USDollars 352.5m). Mr Packer said yesterday his company, Consolidated Press Holdings, would make an ADollars 100m profit on the disposal. The purchase increases the Lend Lease group's stake in Westpac to almost 10 per cent. The group, which is likely to go up to 12 per cent by buying Consolidated Press's remaining 2 per cent, has been granted federal government approval to eventually take its shareholding in Westpac to 15 per cent. The deal leaves Westpac with two large financial institutions as dominant shareholders. AMP Society controls 15 per cent of the bank. Lend Lease has agreed to pay Consolidated Press half of any profit if it sold Westpac shares over the next 12 months, up to a maximum of 50 cents a share. Mr Packer accumulated his 10 per cent Westpac stake late last year, prompting an invitation from the bank to take a seat on the board. However, Mr Packer resigned from the board in January, just one week after joining, following a disagreement over the bank's recovery programme. Mr Packer said his company had been approached by Lend Lease late last week. He said Lend Lease, which included a big insurance business through MLC Life and Australian Eagle, would bring added stability to Westpac's shareholder base. After a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue last May and a ADollars 1.56bn loss for the year to September 1992, Westpac's share price was trading at ADollars 2.40 last November against a pre-rights issue peak of ADollars 4.63 in January 1992.</p>

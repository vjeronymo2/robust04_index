			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / EC car makers' recycling plan EC CAR manufacturers yesterday unveiled proposals for a vehicle 'waste management' programme which they hope will head off legislation making them responsible for recycling every car they sell within EC borders. Pressure for mandatory recycling programmes is being led by Germany, which has already asked its domestic-based manufacturers, Volkswagen, Daimler-Benz, BMW and Opel, to come up with firm proposals within the next few months on how vehicles might best be completely recycled. The EC Commission is taking particular interest in the progress of the intended German legislation. This is not just for environmental reasons, but because of the internal trade barrier implications of German makers being required to recycle cars ahead of similar requirements being made of other car makers. Currently, the EC industry average is for about 75 per cent of car content to be recycled. German legislation is expected to require much closer to 100 per cent recycling - a stance likely to be adopted eventually by the EC itself.</p>

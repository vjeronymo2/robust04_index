			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BPB plans Berlin plasterboard plant - Eastern Germany has become Europe's fastest growing construction market Plans to build a Pounds 50m plasterboard plant in Berlin were announced yesterday by BPB Industries of Britain, continuing the heavy investment by European building material companies in eastern Germany. The region has become Europe's fastest growing construction market as authorities seek to satisfy demands for improved living standards in the east and accommodate the many immigrants who have flocked to west Germany in the past five years. Last month Lafarge Coppee of France, Europe's second largest plasterboard maker, behind BPB Industries, announced the construction of a DM75m (Pounds 30m) plant at Lubbenau, eastern Germany, to serve the local market and eastern Europe, particularly the Czech republic. The French company since 1990 has spent approaching FFr2bn (Pounds 233m) to acquire and modernise eastern Germany's biggest cement works at Karlsdorff, near Leipzig, supplying about 30 per cent of the region's increasing demand for cement. RMC of Britain, the world's biggest concrete producer, expects to have spent nearly Pounds 500m by 1995 acquiring and modernising cement works, aggregate quarries and ready-mixed-concrete plants in eastern Germany. The big rise in German housebuilding shows no sign of slackening. The five eastern states, in the first three months of this year, issued building permits for the construction of 23,500 homes, up 121 per cent on the corresponding period last year. In western Germany the number of new building permits rose by about a fifth during the first quarter, to provide some 115,000 homes. Total permits, including new building, flat conversions and homes in non-residential buildings, last year rose 14 per cent, to 524,000, in western Germany and 223 per cent, to 82,600, in eastern Germany. In Britain, by contrast, work started on 185,500 private and public sector homes last year, an 18 per cent increase on the previous year's 156,500 housing starts. Redland, another large British building material group and Europe's biggest roof tile producer, last year earned more profit in eastern Germany than it did in the whole of the UK. The company, through its 50.8 per cent-owned German subsidiary, will by the end of this year operate seven tile plants, two chimney making works and one brick plant by in eastern Germany. BPB, announcing its plans for the Berlin works, said Germany buys about 160m sq metres of plasterboard a year. It expects this to rise to 240m-250m sq metres within 10 years. Mr Alan Turner, BPB's chairman, said the Berlin plant would be able to produce 50m sq metres, making it one of the worlds largest single line plasterboard factories. It may also supply eastern European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic, and is expected to be operational within two years. Plasterboard is a prefabricated, light, easy-to-use material, ideal for the inner walls of homes and for partitioning offices. It is widely used in the US and Scandinavian countries and has been gaining market share in Britain and France and to a lesser extent Germany. The eastern region of the country is likely to continue to lead the growth in German overall construction demand, with total orders rising by 35.5 per cent during the first three months of this year. The federal government last year invested more than DM18.3bn upgrading the region's infrastructure, a rise of 15 per cent on the previous year. Private companies invested DM35.3bn in the non-residential property, up 22 per cent. More than DM33.9bn was invested in private housing, a rise of 42.2 per cent.</p>

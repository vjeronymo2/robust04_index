			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Murat Arenov, director of the Information Center </F> of the Supreme Council of the Republic: "Kazakhs Understand the  Apprehension of Russians"]    [Text] Almaty--[begin boxed item] Specialists of the  Information Center of the Supreme Soviet in May and December  1992 and January 1994 conducted a probing poll of various social  groups of the population in eastern, western, northern, and  southern Kazakhstan oblasts. The polling area was broadened in  1994 owing to the inclusion of Karaganda and Almaty Oblasts. A  total of more than 2,500 persons took part. [end boxed item]    The high degree of trust in each other among all ethnic  groups that was noted in 1992 is also characteristic of the  beginning of this year. Sixty-four percent of respondents  answered in the first poll that they trust the people who live  with them in the same locality (the sum of affirmative answers:  "yes"--42.5 percent and "sooner 'yes' than 'no'"--21.5 percent.  In 1994 this sum amounted to 62 percent (41.5 and 20.5).    People's perception and assessment of the condition and  quality of interethnic relations also did not change. In 1992,  70.1 percent of those polled characterized them as friendly  (27.2) and peaceful (48.0). The result is the same today. The  number of Kazakhstan citizens who assessed the status of  international [mezhnatsionalnyy] relations negatively is  likewise almost unchanged.    Stability and absence of signs of interethnic  [mezhetnicheskiy] conflict are also indicated by the answers to  the question "Have you witnessed malevolent treatment of  representatives of your nationality or quarrels and disputes on  national grounds?" The number of witnesses to these kinds of  cases dropped by 20 percent.    Data such as these point to the profound international  character of interpersonal and group relations: 88.4 percent of  the residents of the republic older than 16 years of age have  friends of various nationalities, and a third of families are  international. Of those Kazakhstan residents who responded, 83.2  percent live in multinational collectives, 85.4 percent live in  multinational microrayons, and 93 percent have lived a large  part of their life in Kazakhstan. More than 80 percent of  respondents answered that their parents also live in Kazakhstan,  and if it is at the same time taken into account that one-fifth  of those questioned are people older than 50 years of age, it  can be asserted that more than 90 percent of Kazakhstan  residents are natives who have lived here for more than one  generation. The results of the poll confirm that they really  lived and continue to live in a peaceful and friendly situation:  More than 76 percent did not take part in any kind of actions in  defense of their people, and 15.7 percent took part in arguments  in this regard.    Analysis of ethnosocial relations in a national context  showed that in 1993 certain new trends appeared in the mood and  behavior of representatives of various ethnic groups, their  treatment of one another, evaluation of their own social  situation, and their reaction to the processes occurring in  society. Two of them are of particular interest to the largest  ethnic groups of the republic--Russians and Kazakhs.    For the Kazakhs it is a realization of their responsibility  for the preservation of international peace and accord and an  understanding of the need to observe equal rights and  opportunities for representatives of all nationalities that  populate the republic. The dynamics of the indicators of  national feelings, moods, and stereotypes of thinking and  behavior of the Kazakhs show that there is an increase in trust  toward people, a reduction in the level of intolerance and  claims to special rights and privileges, and a realization of  the necessity of international coexistence. In other words, a  departure from ethnoegoism and ethnic narrow-mindedness, which  to a certain degree was characteristic of the Kazakhs in  1992--the first year of Kazakhstan's independence.    Despite the existence and strengthening of negative factors  (socioeconomic and foreign, in the first place), the Kazakhs  sensed that it was vitally important for them to maintain  international accord and peace in the country.    The number of Kazakhs who on the list of the most alarming  contemporary problems named an exacerbation of relations between  nationalities increased by 7.3 percent. But on the whole this  problem was singled out by 22.6 percent of Kazakh respondents.    There was a 10 percent decrease in the number of Kazakhs who  prefer to live in a family of one nationality, and a 15 percent  decrease in those who prefer to work in a multinational  collective, but only 19 percent prefer to live in isolation from  other nations--less by a factor of two than in 1992. But this is  already at the level of other nations: Russians--13.7 percent,  Germans--15.2 percent, Uzbeks--16 percent, and Koreans 14.3  percent. To the question: "Do you think that people of your  nationality should enjoy an advantage?" more than half of the  Kazakhs last year answered in the affirmative from the  standpoint of elections to organs of authority. Only 32.5  percent think this way this year. A decrease of 11-18 percent  occurred among Kazakhs who think that persons of their  nationality should have advantages in the provision of  commodities, privatization, allotment of land, enrollment in a  higher educational institution, and job promotion.    A year ago 28.7 percent of the Kazakhs supported the  departure of non-Kazakhs, this year--14.82. There is a change in  positions: While last year the number of those who supported the  migration of non-Kazakhs was approximately equal to those who  did not support it, this year there are three times as many of  the latter. On the other hand, a reverse change occurred in the  position of representatives of Russian nationality: There was an  increase by a factor of 2.5 in the number of supporters of  non-Kazakhs (the highest indicator among nationalities that live  in Kazakhstan).    Changes in the positions of the Russian population deserve  attention. In the main, they retain friendly and peaceful  relations with those people who live in the republic.    And for those who do not intend to leave Kazakhstan, and  this  is an overwhelming majority (more than 85 percent), there is a  characteristic understanding of the problems of national revival  of the Kazakhs, the formation of a republic as an independent  state, and the strengthening of peace and accord in society. At  the same time, the results of the poll show that a feeling of  alarm is growing among Russians over uncertainty in the future  and in migration and separatist attitudes, and the level of  trust in the people who live with them and in state structures  is falling.    Only 7.67 percent of Russians are confident of their own  welfare in the future--this is less by a factor of three than  optimists among Kazakhs (23.29 percent). While in 1992 the  proportion of potential migrants among Russians was at an  average republic level (7.7 percent), in 1994 it doubled (14.5).    More than two-thirds of Russians were in favor of dual  citizenship. In comparison with representatives of other  nations, trust in the organs of state authority among Russian  respondents was 10-12 percent lower, and the level of trust in  people who lived alongside them dropped by 7 percent.    Answers to the question "What do you think of the idea of  retaining the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan?" are an  indirect indication of separatist tendencies in individual  regions of the republic.    In North-Kazakhstan Oblast this idea is supported by 61.9  percent (79.7 in 1992), among the Russian population--only 51.7  percent (not supporting--23 percent, and 23.9 percent found it  difficult to answer). Thus in this region in the course of one  year a significant strengthening of separatist attitudes  occurred. In the east of the country the number not supporting  territorial integrity remained at the same level--10.6 percent.    Interesting data were acquired on the question "How is an  unfriendly attitude toward another people reflected?" While for  Kazakhs last year this attitude was reflected predominantly in  three positions: undervaluation of the people's past (18.8  percent), disrespect for traditions and customs (14.7), and a  haughty attitude toward language (13.7 percent), this year,  along with the first and third positions in the trio of leaders,  there was Kazakh dissatisfaction with respect to people's  preference for their own nationality in selection of  personnel--16 percent (in 1992--8.2 percent). Among Russians  this percentage increased by a third and is higher by a factor  of two than among Kazakhs. In the opinion of almost a third of  the respondents, the most unfriendly attitude toward them is  reflected exactly in the sphere of personnel policy. However,  this fact calls attention to itself--that the level of  dissatisfaction among other nationalities on the placement of  personnel according to national criteria is at the Kazakh level  (among Germans--9 percent, Uzbeks--16 percent, Tatars--18.8  percent, and Koreans--14.3 percent).    Moreover, if it is taken into account that the managers of a  majority of enterprises in construction, industry, transport,  communications, trade, and consumer services are Russian, then  the sharp dissatisfaction of Russians on the personnel question  can be explained by their reaction to the changes that are  occurring in the existing status quo in personnel placement and  also to the results of the propaganda of Russians and some  Russian-language mass media in the republic.    But on the whole the high percentage (22.1) on this position  apparently indicates that personnel placement has been turned  over to the control of managers, and also indicates a trend  taking place in the establishment of multinational collectives,  although this trend contradicts the polyethnic nature of our  society and is losing the support of Kazakhs--only 15.1 percent  of respondents would like to work in a collective where all the  people are of the same nationality (23 percent in 1992).    These are some of the first results of the research we have  conducted. Processing and analysis is continuing. Interesting  data were acquired on the largest nationalities after the  Kazakhs and Russians: Ukrainians, Germans, Uzbeks, Tatars,  Koreans, and also Cossacks. A conceptualization is required of  the attitude of Kazakhs toward various parties and movements and  religions. Finally, on the basis of the results acquired, light  will be shed on the reasons for and factors in ethnosocial  tension, and measures will be determined that could influence  its curtailment in different regions of the country.</p>

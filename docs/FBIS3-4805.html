			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Tuesday that he will make a decision Wednesday on  whether to immediately reshuffle his nearly seven-month-old  cabinet. Hosokawa made the remark to reporters following a  series of separate meetings with coalition party leaders to seek  agreement on his plan to shake up the cabinet.    The prime minister also hinted at pushing for the reshuffle  even if coalition partners remain divided over the matter,  saying "it is very difficult for all the coalition parties to  see eye-to-eye (on the issue)." Hosokawa said a cabinet  shake-up without receiving full consent from each of the  coalition partners is "theoretically possible."    The primary purpose of the cabinet reorganization is widely  believed to be the replacement of Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, top governmental spokesman and chief of  staff, who has been at odds with Hosokawa over several of the  government's important policy themes.    Takemura told Hosokawa in a meeting that a cabinet reshuffle  could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, sources  said. Takemura maintains he will not take another cabinet post  if Hosokawa changes his cabinet, the sources said.    The sources said the two men also have not seen eye-to-eye  over the course of the seven-party coalition, with Hosokawa  favoring closer ties with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito and Takemura against it.    Among the seven coalition parties, the Social Democratic  Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the  Sakigake (Harbinger) headed by Takemura are opposed to an early  cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito and Komeito are endorsing the  premier's plan.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked Hosokawa to drop his  intention for an early shake-up, saying he spoke of the need for  the cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues and expressed  his objection to Hosokawa's plan.    Hosokawa explained he wanted to focus on pressing economic  issues such as strained trade ties with the U.S. and economic  deregulation and sought the SDP's cooperation, Murayama said.    Murayama reiterated that the government must concentrate on  passing the fiscal 1994 state budget as early as possible as a  way to breathe life into the ailing Japanese economy.    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi also expressed his opposition to a  hasty cabinet reshuffle at a meeting with Hosokawa.    Ouchi told reporters he called on Hosokawa to discuss the  fate of Takemura.    Hosokawa also cited as a major reason for the plan growing  complaints within the ruling coalition and from bureaucrats  about Takemura's work as the top government spokesman and chief  policy coordinator, said Ouchi who serves as health and welfare  minister.    Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that  the party will suport the scheme to reshape the cabinet.    Hata, who serves as foreign minster and deputy prime  minister, said he notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting  at the premier's official residence.    "Behind the premier's plan is his desire to run the cabinet  more smoothly." We support that kind of notion," said Hata who  heads the core party in the alliance along with Ichiro Ozawa, a  chief coalition strategist.</p>

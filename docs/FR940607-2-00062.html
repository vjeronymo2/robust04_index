			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. The processing building is ventilated by roof-mounted turbine vents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. All tanks containing ignitable wastes meet American Society for Testing and Materials specifications for ignitables, and are grounded to prevent sparking and potential ignition. For these tanks, discharge valves are fitted with fusible links that close in case of a fire emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Procedures have been established to minimize, contain, and expeditiously remove any liquid spills (containing PCBs, ignitable liquids, or combinations thereof) that may occur within the facility. In addition, daily inspections for spills are conducted during regular operating periods by designated inspectors/supervisors (including monitoring tank volumes for undocumented reductions); all hoses, connections, and valves are inspected by systems operators prior to initiating an operation. Leaking drums are placed in overpack drums. The processing system is provided with a series of interlocks to prevent liquid spills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spill-removal procedures vary according to the size of the spill. If the spill is small, the hazardous liquid should be removed using designated sorbents and containers available in the processing area. During removal, the following safety precautions must be observed: Contact with the spilled material is to be avoided; unnecessary personnel must leave the area; protective equipment (descibed below in paragraph 14) must be worn; the area must be ventilated; personnel and equipment must be decontaminated thoroughly following exposure (eyewashes and bodywashes are available in the processing area for this purpose); and technical advice should be sought if necessary. Large spills should be contained using diking materials available in the processing areas. Safety precautions prescribed for controlling small spills should be used in large-spill situations as well. Where there is a high potential for spills, work is performed within diked or curbed areas. If the spilled material escapes, downstream authorities must be notified. A detailed Contingency Plan for managing spills may be obtained from Envirosafe at the address listed above in the first paragraph under I. Background.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The storage tank volume is checked prior to pumping ignitable liquids into the tank to assure that there is adequate volume to receive these liquids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Tanks are checked to assure that the proper tanks are being filled with flushed liquid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Personnel involved in draining and flushing operations receive specific, documented training for conducting these operations as prescribed by appendix 3 (``Training Plan/section 17, PCB Personnel Training Program''), volume I of the EPA's ``Final Approval for Disposal and Commercial Storage of Polychlorinated Biphenyls'' (hereafter, the ``EPA approval document''). This training includes emergency procedures for the general workforce ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  recognizing alarms, notifying designated authorities of the emergency, egressing from the facility), and specialized training for members of the fire bridgade in controlling and suppressing explosions/fires. (Members of the fire brigade are volunteers from among Envirosafe's local employees; these employees leave their regular jobs to respond to emergencies.) The EPA issued this approval document under Permit Number IDD073114654, September 20, 1991. Copies of training plans, including training plans for emergency procedures used by the general workforce and the fire brigade, may be obtained from Envirosafe at the address listed above in the first paragraph under I. Background.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

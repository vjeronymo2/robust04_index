			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemala  public administration today is semi-paralyzed because the  majority of its 140,000 workers have joined the one-day strike  called by the National Federation of State Workers Unions  (Fenasteg) to request salary hikes.    Fenasteg Secretary General Armando Sanchez told ACAN-EFE  that  the strike is general (and requests a 40-percent salary  increase), while government sources said it has had no effect.  Fenasteg stressed that some 140,000 government and municipal  employees are on strike as of 0800 hours local time (1400 GMT)  and will stage demonstrations on the capital's main access  routes to block traffic.    For its part, the National Federation of Public Employees  Unions (Fenasep), a public administration labor union which does  not support the strike, reported that the strike is partial.    Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli, told the  media that the strike will have no repercussions on the  government, as it is backed by a "minimal number of workers,"  those who maintain a radical position and exert pressure without  exhausting the possibility of a dialogue.    Luna said the strike will not undermine the development of  the referendum, to be held next Sunday, through which the  reforms to the Constitution should be ratified or rejected. The  reforms include the possibility of moving up the elections to  elect a new Congress and Supreme Court of Justice. The official  advised that, if the public employees carry out actions that  "clash" with the law, they will be punished.    He reiterated that the government will not grant any salary  increase to the workers because the state has no funds to meet  those demands, which shall be discussed by the Labor Ministry  Commission for Salary.    This is the first labor movement to confront the  administration of Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who took office in June  1993, after Jorge Serrano was overthrown following his failed  self-inflicted coup in May. The National Transportation  Confederation (CNT), also announced that it will stage a general  strike on 1 February to demand that the government authorize an  increase in the rates for their service. The CNT gathers  passenger and fuel transportation enterprises, which will mean a  lack of fuel supplies and the resulting paralysis of industrial  and commercial activities in the capital.</p>

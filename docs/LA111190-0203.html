			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPALDING GRAY;  </P> <P> HIS NEW FAVORITE SUBJECT -- HIM;  </P> <P> SPALDING GRAY'S LATEST MONOLOGUE, 'MONSTER IN A BOX,' EXAMINES HIS LIFE SINCE  'SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA' MADE HIM A CELEBRITY -- SORT OF  </P> <P> There seems to be some dissonance from a corner of the avant-garde.  </P> <P> "Narcissism?! It's taken such a bad rap. There are very positive aspects of  narcissism."  </P> <P> Monologuist Spalding Gray, the self-described "raving talking head," creator of  more than a dozen one-person performance narratives, including "Swimming to  Cambodia," which was made into a 1987 film, is talking about talking about  himself. Querulously.  </P> <P> "No, I think people are interested in a person, a man talking about his life,"  he says. "Not just because I'm self-obsessed, but because it includes all of  our lives. It's like my New England background -- certain things being  forbidden. It's refreshing to have people speak close to what's on their minds.  Like in my next monologue, I will speak a lot about my organs. My sex organs."  </P> <P> Within the iconoclastic ranks of contemporary raconteurs cut more or less from  the disparate traditions of Mark Twain, Lenny Bruce and New York's downtown  theater scene, Gray stands alone. Not because he is a box-office draw or for  the trace elements of controversy he generates, such as the anti-war sentiments  in "Swimming to Cambodia." Rather, Gray is unique among chic-come-round-again  one-person performers -- a list that ranges from Karen Finley to Lily Tomlin,  Eric Bogosian to Garrison Keillor, even Jackie Mason -- for being the most  persistent of navel-gazers. Not for him the avuncular imaginary musings of  Keillor or the schizophrenic character ravings of Bogosian or Tomlin. Gray's 13  monologues -- beginning with "Sex and Death to the Age 14," in 1979 and on up  to his latest, "Monster in a Box," which opens at Lincoln Center Wednesday --  are all spun from the loose flywheel of their author's personality.  </P> <P> "I'm different from other one-person performers," Gray says during an interview  in his downtown loft. "I'm not looking for Desert Shield jokes the way Jackie  Mason would, or any comic would. I'm doing oral journals. I'm looking inward."  </P> <P> Richard Christiansen, theater critic of the Chicago Tribune and one of Gray's  earliest champions, wrote in a recent review, "Gray's stories always begin and  end within his psyche . . . forever filled with the strange, fearful terrors he  has found therein."  </P> <P> If such post-Freudian self-absorption has been Gray's personal leitmotif, it is  also a mirror now reflecting changes in the actor's public persona. Co-founder  of New York's avant-garde Wooster Group theater nearly 15 years ago, Gray still  insists, "I thought I would spend the rest of my life collecting unemployment."  He is now pondering such Kierkegaardian excesses as "the dizziness that comes  from too much possibility."  </P> <P> Gray's Lincoln Center run, already sold out, has been extended into January.  Gray will perform an earlier monologue, "Terrors of Pleasure," with "Monster in  a Box" at the Los Angeles Theater Center next summer. He is booked elsewhere --  including a brief residency at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur -- until the  middle of 1992. His novel, which he is still editing, will be published by  Knopf within the next 18 months, and there are always film offers and cable  television specials to ponder. "Spalding is sui generis, but he is much more  nationally known now, and it is easier to exploit his fame," says Gary  Fisketjon, Gray's editor at Knopf.  </P> <P> Adds Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, where Gray was  in residence two years ago, "Spalding is unique among performers. The danger is  that by doing what he does, he's become a personality."  </P> <P> It is an issue that Gray addresses in this latest monologue. Performed in  typical Gray style -- flannel shirt, glass of water, a desk and a microphone --  "Monster in a Box" is ostensibly about the actor's attempt to write a  quasi-autobiographical novel about the death of his mother. But in typical Gray  style, the monologue is rife with narrative digressions, and "Monster in a Box"  becomes a work about not writing a novel. Rather, it is about the price of  success, how Gray coped with the spate of Hollywood roles he was offered after  being in Roland Joffe's film "The Killing Fields" and Jonathan Demme's 1987  film version of "Swimming to Cambodia." These included such opportunities as  the chance to interview on film some people who had been -- or thought they had  been -- captured by aliens. Roles that Gray accepted included parts in such  films as David Byrne's "True Stories," "Stars and Bars," "Clara's Heart" and  most recently, "Beaches," starring Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.  </P> <P> While Gray's monologues have been consistently well-received, his stage and  film work, particularly his lead in the 1988 Broadway production of "Our Town,"  have been greeted less enthusiastically. Ergo discomfiture on the cusp of fame.  "I want to work in films because of the health insurance -- three weeks in a  movie and you get a year's worth of major medical, including psychiatric," as  Gray puts it in the monologue, which is largely set in Los Angeles. "But I know  I shouldn't do too many more," Gray says in his loft. "I was brought out to  L.A. to do that (Taper) project, and while it appeared to be a very pleasurable  setting, I had no idea how difficult it would be  </P> <P> for me to live out there."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Gray assumes a Woody Allen mantle in this monologue, his dour  New England/New York sensibilities blinking in the Southern California light  while lifting an accusing finger at the usual suspects: earthquakes, power  lunches, Diet Coke, therapists and freeways. Even he admits "it's an old, old  story." Like someone invited to Spago who only orders coffee, Gray even spurned  the all-powerful Creative Artists Agency during his Los Feliz residency.  </P> <P> "No, I didn't sign with CAA," says Gray, pouring tea. "I was conflicted. I  didn't want to be star. I could no longer be a fly on the wall, and that would  have meant renouncing my monologues. Most actors can't talk about their lives  because they have to preserve this certain image. If I'm around a lot of fans,  I'm going inside myself to protect against their eyes. When I'm with strangers,  everything goes outward. All my feelers are up, I pick up all new material. I'm  alive. Celebrity would be death."  </P> <P> Gray says that "Monster in a Box" is "about resisting and grappling" with the  growing encroachment of fame. "I'm a peripheral celebrity. My work is not that  accessible. My father and stepmother won't come see me. My work is frightening  and odd to the mainstream viewer. This is not a new 'Spalding Gray Show' I want  to milk. It's the 13th monologue. I want to be done with it so I can get on  with the next monologue."  </P> <P> The one about the sex organs, the one with the working title "Gray's  Anatomies," will, like the best of Gray's monologues, attempt to go beyond  personal therapeutic ramblings. Indeed, if "Monster in a Box" is ostensibly  about the price of fame and Hollywood high jinks, it is also about the author's  coming to terms with his mother's suicide. It is his most personal monologue.  "I haven't come to terms with the whole story," he says, " -- there are still  too many missing links. But it is the first time I have told the story  directly."  </P> <P> And it is a story that Gray will pursue further in "Gray's Anatomies," which  will address the actor's growing sense of mortality as well as issues of faith  and medicine. (Gray's mother was a Christian Scientist, and for a while Gray  attended the Christian Science Church.) The central event of that monologue is  an eye operation that Gray had in August.  </P> <P> "Do you want a cookie to go with your tea? They don't have any sugar in them,"  says Gray, absently rummaging through cupboards. "I'm on a new diet. I gave up  drinking last summer. I told myself to do it. Partly because I had the eye  operation this summer. I have it on videotape if they would like to see it. The  doctor even put on titles, what are they called?" he says, turning to Renee  Shafransky, his longtime companion. From the far end of the loft comes the  answer: "Video Crayons." And then she adds, " 'Swimming to the Macula' . . .  macula, that's the center of the eyeball."  </P> <P> Shafransky -- a tall, dark-haired screenwriter best known in Gray's monologues  as the long-suffering, ever-wise "my girlfriend Renee" -- sweeps into the room  dressed in black. She has the accent and energy of a native New Yorker, a stark  contrast to the pale, hesitant actor. Shafransky, who is working on a  screenplay for Universal and who has produced films including "Swimming to  Cambodia," is directing Gray, for the first time, in "Monster in a Box."  </P> <P> "Yeah, they put a gas bubble in my eye and I couldn't lift my head for 10  days," says Gray, settling in at the kitchen table with the sugarless cookies  and an array of organically grown fruit. "I had to sleep face-down, I got books  on tape and got very depressed. But at least my vision is no longer blurred,  like I was looking through a jellyfish. But that's the whole monologue about  faith and medicine. I only do monologues about the serendipitous. I keep  thinking that I will focus on my taxes and go to Washington and do a monologue  about doing an audit with the IRS, but that would be contrived. It would be  like a reporter looking for a story. As soon as I look for a story, another  appears. I go blind or something happens."  </P> <P> It is his way, Gray says, of coping with "the chaos." And sitting here in his  loft with the pale northern sky backlighting his flowing gray hair and the pale  stubble on his cheek, Gray looks like a man who has seen a lot of chaos. He is  taller and thinner, far less robust than he appears on stage. His demeanor is  as flat as his Rhode Island accent, his humor sheathed in ice-cold irony. As  Shafransky says, "When I first met Spalding, I thought he was a Martian. He  revealed so much of himself onstage but he hardly ever talked to people in a  real emotional way." In June, Gray will turn 50. While he admits that he and  Shafransky are considering having a child, the avant-garde seems suddenly very,  very tired.  </P> <P> Of his work process, Gray says, "The only way I know it's working is when I  find myself in chaos. I start keeping a journal and the chaos becomes resolved.  I get a big cardboard box and I throw in everything that is relevant. Later I  see how it's organized." Later he will hone the monologue in front of audiences  for nearly a year, editing and rearranging the material.  </P> <P> It is a performance technique that Gray stumbled on during his early years as  an actor in New York. Born in Rhode Island in 1941 to an upper-middle-class New  England family, Gray suffered from minor dyslexia and some behavioral problems  as a child.  </P> <P> He didn't finish boarding school until he was almost 20, then attended Boston's  Emerson College, where he majored in theater and discovered he could make  people laugh with his storytelling. "It certainly wasn't on stage. I could  barely get up there," he says. Instead, in the kitchen of the tony Katherine  Gibbs School for secretaries, "I would hang with the help and tell stories to  the other Emerson students, the old Irish ladies and the Merchant Marine guys,  the reformed alcoholics. That's when I discovered I could be funny."  </P> <P> After graduation Gray drifted around the regional theater circuit for five  years before landing in New York at the experimental Performing Garage. "I  thought I would be a professional actor going from regional theater to regional  theater, living alone, being a bachelor, putting myself to sleep every night  with beers and spending the days pretending I was someone else," says Gray.  </P> <P> "But part of me knew that was a death trip," he adds when asked about the  transition into confessional monologues. "And it was the '60s and I wasn't  taking acid, but I had come to New York to work in underground theater. It was  New York in 1967, and I went to see (Richard Schechner's) 'Dionysis' and it  just blew my mind. I was terrified that these naked women on stage would come  and pull me down and do something terrible to me. All my concepts about theater  were just blown away by the Open Theater, Joe Chaikin's work and count  everything else into it -- Merce Cunningham, Meredith Monk, Charles Ludlum. I  just walked into a caldron of creativity."  </P> <P> For five years, Gray worked with a variety of downtown artists before forming  the Wooster Group with Elizabeth LeCompte, an artist and theater director whom  he had met in Saratoga, N.Y. "It was a community, we all went to each other's  work. That's how I found my form," says Gray. "I realized this was the place  for me to initiate things." Indeed, it was at the Wooster Group that Gray first  began using autobiographical material, in the company's early productions --  their performance trilogy, "Three Places in Rhode Island." Much of those pieces  were based on interviews Gray had conducted with members of his family after  his mother's death. "They were very revealing tapes," recalls Gray. "We played  them onstage as part of the performances."  </P> <P> "Always, Spalding told stories," recalls LeCompte, artistic director of the  Wooster Group, whose headquarters are across the street from Gray's loft. "A  lot of what he did at the beginning he did as therapy. His work is more complex  now. But Spalding was never a naturalistic actor. He works very well with a  mask, even if it's a mask of himself playing himself."  </P> <P> By 1979, Gray had spun off from the Wooster Group and was performing his first  autobiographical monologue about coming of age in Rhode Island, "Sex and Death  to the Age of 14" and began earning comparisons to Mark Twain.  </P> <P> "I first saw Spalding perform at a theater conference 10 years ago," recalls  Gregory Mosher, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theaters. "I was at the  Goodman (Theater in Chicago) then and after five minutes I was laughing so hard  I was crying. I had to block the aisle to keep other directors from getting to  him first."  </P> <P> Since then Gray has worked steadily at small theaters and college campuses  around the country, churning out performance pieces. By the mid-1980s Gray had  caught the attention of British director Roland Joffe, who cast the actor as  the American ambassador's aide in his Vietnam War film, "The Killing Fields."  "That film swept me out of the Garage," says Gray. "It was my magic carpet out  of Soho. It gave me a whole new outlook on the world." That film was quickly  followed by Gray's most acclaimed performance piece to date, "Swimming to  Cambodia," a four-hour, two-part monologue about the making of "The Killing  Fields" that earned Gray an Obie Award, was published as a book and later made  into the critically hailed film.  </P> <P> "I shot 'Swimming' and the whole thing took off," Gray says now. "Things just  started happening." One of those things included an offer from Mosher, who was  by then in New York, to play the Stage Manager in the Broadway revival of  Thornton Wilder's "Our Town."  </P> <P> It was a performance that, despite Mosher's expectation that Gray would be "the  Stage Manager of the '80s," was roundly savaged by the New York critics.  "(Gray's) blase Tribeca hip-ness belongs to another planet," wrote Frank Rich  in the New York Times. That production -- including the tar-and-feathering by  critics -- provides the oddly touching denouement to "Monster in a Box."  </P> <P> "I am very excited that I will get to quote the critics," says Gray, suddenly  enthusiastic. "This is going to be a first, an actor in a show who gets to talk  about the critics while they are there sitting on the other side."  </P> <P> Suddenly Gray stands and dumps a pile of pear cores into the kitchen sink.  There is a technical rehearsal uptown at the theater in half an hour, and  Shafransky, clearly the ballast of the duo, is hurrying him along. But like a  man who can't stop talking about himself, Gray hurtles on. "I was brought out  to L.A. to do that theater project and a big chunk of it is in this monologue  about how I found it difficult to live out there. Why? I don't know if it was  an excess of pleasure or a lack of contact with people in arbitrary and chance  settings that I devour here in New York.  </P> <P> "One story about L.A. that isn't in the monologue about L.A. was how I was out  there for a long time and then I came back and New York looked horrible -- no  birds, no flowers. It was Mother's Day and I decided I would visit my therapist  on 104th Street and Central Park West and I walked from here. And what I  discovered was that while New York may not have nature, it has human nature. I  spent the whole walk talking randomly with people, fans, friends, strangers.  I'm not against L.A. but . . . you have to go there in a car. Nothing is more  depressing for me than riding in a car in the dark and looking out at other  cars in the dark. That's my version of hell."  </P></p>

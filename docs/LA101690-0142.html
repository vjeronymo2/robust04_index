			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CRISTIN ROSSMAN  </P> <P> School: Marina High  </P> <P> Sport: Volleyball  </P> <P> Position: Middle blocker  </P> <P> Class: Senior  </P> <P> There have been few times this season that Marina's volleyball team needed  points worse than it did in the fifth game of its match against Fountain Valley  last week -- and when Marina needs points, Rossman is usually there. Trailing,  14-10, a point away from dropping into second place in the Sunset League, the  Vikings set it to Rossman on nearly every point despite the fact that she often  had three defenders marking her. Rossman, who missed much of her junior season  because of a couple of ankle injuries, had 10 of her match-high 32 kills in  that final game, which Marina won, 16-14. Rossman, whose sister Tricia is one  of three sophomore starters on the team, leads the Vikings with 91 kills for  the season. Rossman is at her best against Marina's toughest competition and  that has allowed the Vikings (9-2, 7-0 in the league) to rise to No. 6 in the  Orange County rankings. "She's not the highest jumper," Coach Dennis Creighton  said. "She's not the quickest kid but she's determined and she hits the ball  hard."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> Michelle Berkowitz, who won all nine of her singles sets to help Fountain  Valley win two of its three tennis matches last week, is undefeated in the  Sunset League and 35-4 overall this season.  </P> <P> Missy Clements, who had 28 kills in La Habra's five-game volleyball victory  over Sunny Hills Tuesday. Clements also helped La Habra, the No. 1 ranked team  in the state, defeat Sonora Thursday.  </P> <P> Kay Negota, a Woodbridge runner who finished in 17 minutes 49 seconds to win  the invitational race of the Orange County Cross-Country Championships  Saturday.  </P> <P> Martha Pinto, who ran the fastest girls' time of the day, 17:26 for three  miles, to win her fourth title at the Orange County Cross-Country Championships  Saturday.  </P></p>

[passage omitted]    While there have been reports of previous violations of the  cease-fire and the heavy weapons exclusion zone, this would  appear to be the first time civilians had been wounded in a  shell attack on Sarajevo since early February. The United  Nations Protection Force could not confirm Saturday that a shell  had been fired but said military observers had been sent to the  site to investigate. Major Jose Labandeira, a UN spokesman, said  that whatever the cause, it was an "isolated incident". It was  very difficult to control all the 40 to 60 millimeter mortars  which can be carried around by an individual, he said.</p>

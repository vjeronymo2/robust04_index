			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / MMC to investigate video games makers The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate whether video games manufacturers, notably Sega and Nintendo of Japan, are over-charging consumers and unfairly restricting competition. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of Fair Trading, said yesterday that he had ordered the probe after an increasing number of consumers had complained that prices of new games were higher in Britain than in the US. Retailers had complained about manufacturers' distribution practices, while software publishers were frustrated by the licensing arrangements for production of games used on the leading brands of hardware. The move was welcomed by the Consumers Association, which has repeatedly criticised manufacturers' prices and marketing practices. Sega and Nintendo said they would co-operate with the MMC but insisted the market was fully competitive. The two companies account for about 90 per cent of the British video games market, worth more than Pounds 700m last year, three times more than in 1991. Games hardware costs between Pounds 50 and Pounds 300, while games prices range from Pounds 10 to Pounds 60 for new releases. Sega said it was surprised by the inquiry, and Nintendo said the UK video games market was the most competitive in the world. Conditions were particularly fierce at Christmas, when about 40 per cent of all toys sold were video games. There have recently been signs that some prices are softening. Dixons, the electrical retailer, said last week that it expected lower profits this year, partly because of a price war in video game consoles launched by the Woolworths and Comet chains. However, some independent surveys late last year found that retail prices of new games were as much as 50 per cent higher in Britain than in the US. The MMC, which is due to report by the end of October, is expected to focus on complaints by retailers and independent software publishers, which produce about half the games sold by Nintendo and Sega. Some retailers have told the Office of Fair Trading that they have been compelled to buy exclusively from the two companies and prevented from obtaining the same items more cheaply from other sources abroad. Some small retailers, particularly rental outlets, have also claimed that they are supplied with new games only after they are on sale in bigger chains. Independent software publishers have complained that Sega and Nintendo use licensing arrangements and their policies of manufacturing all the games used on their machines to restrict the supply of new products to the market.

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Venables offers Pounds 3.25m for Tottenham Hotspur stake MR TERRY Venables, manager of Tottenham Hotspur, the London football team, has opened the scoring on the refinancing of the debt-weary club. But the Pounds 3.25m offered yesterday by a new consortium, Edennote, involving Mr Venables and his business partner Mr Paul Riviere, falls far short of the Pounds 20m that Mr Venables was originally trying to assemble to take over the club and relieve its Pounds 10m-plus debt to Midland Bank. Edennote has offered to buy 5.4m new shares at 60p each, giving it a 35 per cent stake. No response came from the Tottenham board yesterday. Messrs Venables and Riviere recently took a controlling stake in the Scribes dining club in Kensington. The club was to have been the venue for a press conference elaborating on the deal yesterday evening, but Mr Riviere said it had been postponed so as 'not to contravene Stock Exchange regulations'. Mr Venables showed a little less concern for the niceties of approaching a quoted company - albeit one whose shares have been suspended for six months  -when he made a personal statement to the Press Association sports desk on Sunday night. This sparked some complaints to the Takeover Panel. He spoke vaguely of a package that would enable the club to keep England international Mr Paul Gascoigne, for whom the Italian club Lazio has offered around Pounds 8m, and answer the refinancing requirements of Spurs. He ended by saying: 'I hope the board and Midland Bank accept my offer which I believe secures the future of Spurs'. After this, the Panel suggested the consortium make an announcement. 'If this goes any further, there will have to be a shareholders' meeting and a circular sent beforehand.' Yesterday's statement from Edennote said the offer had various conditions. One was 'certain board changes'. As Mr Irving Scholar, football club chairman and holder of 26 per cent of the shares, is no longer on the board, was the request to remove any of the rest? Mr Paul Bobroff, ex-chairman? Mr Nat Solomon, newish chairman? Mr Ian Gray, chief executive? Mr Tony Berry, former chairman of Blue Arrow and a go-between in earlier discussions? Or was the purpose to bring Mr Venables into the team? Mr Riviere would not elaborate. Another was that the Takeover Panel should waive the rule triggering a bid when a holding surpasses 29.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received]--The press service of  the Ukraina democratic association reports that the association  has written to presidential candidates Valeriy Babych and Petro  Talanchuk, urging them to withdraw from the presidential race  for the benefit of Leonid Kravchuk. The statement points out  that, "in view of the threat to our state's independence, the  Ukraina democratic association has resolved that the  situation can be improved only if the current president, Leonid  Kravchuk, who has proved himself to be a consistent champion of  Ukrainian statehood and the country's democratic development,  wins the 26 June election."    The Ukraina democratic association has prepared documents in  support of Kravchuk, signed by the leaders of most of the  association's parties and organizations. Support groups  campaigning for the current president will soon leave for  Ukraine's eastern and southern regions.    The press service of the Ukraina democratic association told  UNIAN that the appeal to the presidential candidates was sent on  15 June, but no reply has been received thus far.</p>

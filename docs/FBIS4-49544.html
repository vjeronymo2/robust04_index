			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 7 KYODO -- Four leading members of  the Shanghai Association for Human Rights have apparently been  arrested this week and their whereabouts remain unknown,  pro-democracy activists said here Saturday [7 May].    Detained are Association President Li Guotao, 40, Secretary  General Wang Fuchen, 38, painter Lin Muchen, 46, a member of the  board of directors, and another board member who was not  identified.    The activists said the clampdown on the association may aim  at curbing dissident activities ahead of the fifth anniversary  of the suppression of pro-democracy demonstration at Tiananmen  Square in Beijing on June 4, 1989.    Wang left for the southern island of Hainan on Wednesday and  nothing was heard of him since. Li disappeared Monday, while the  unnamed board member was arrested Tuesday, the activists said.    Painter Lin was arrested at Shanghai Airport Tuesday before  leaving for the United States, where the artist planned to study.    Only a month ago, police in Shanghai temporarily detained a  number of activists including Wang in advance of the arrival of  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to the city.    Wang was also detained during the visit to China by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in March.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has said unless China makes  substantial progress in human rights records, he will not extend  China's most-favored-nation trade status in the U.S., which  guarantees Chinese goods access to U.S. markets at lowest  tariffs, when it comes up for renewal in June.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTRAGEOUS BACK-ROOM DEAL  </P> <P> Earlier this month, when he found the Board of Supervisors had conspired to  disenfranchise Los Angeles County's 2 million Latinos during its last  redistricting, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon gave the supervisors a  chance to redeem themselves by drawing boundaries that would meet the demands  of equity and law.  </P> <P> Wednesday, minutes before the judge's deadline, the majority -- Mike  Antonovich, Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum -- gave the court a plan whose only  impressive feature was its breathtaking contempt for the public interest.  </P> <P> In an attempt to create a district with a Latino majority, while still  maintaining the current board's five-seat configuration, the supervisors simply  have gerrymandered a 3rd District. Not only are its boundaries geographically  absurd, but it also contains a popular, well-financed incumbent, Ed Edelman,  who will be difficult for any challenger to unseat. Judge Kenyon now will have  to draw rational districts himself -- a process that probably will begin with  expansion of the board to seven or more members.  </P> <P> The other act of malice committed by the board's majority Wednesday may be  harder to undo. In a secret 3-2 vote, the supervisors agreed to immediately pay  its law firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, $500,000 to represent a  "third-party citizen," who will appeal or "collaterally attack" Kenyon's ruling  all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The secret pact "designates (retiring)  Supervisor Peter F. Schabarum or his delegate as the citizen who shall pursue  the litigation." If the law firm, which also is pressing the board's own appeal  of the ruling, is found to have a conflict of interest, Schabarum simply will  be allowed to take the public's money and hire the lawyer of his choice.  </P> <P> This back-room deal obviously is aimed at blocking a legally elected board from  ending the wasteful appeal of Kenyon's ruling upon which the current majority  has embarked. This cynical, secretive, ruthlessly self-interested raid on  public funds is without precedent. Recall would not be too strong a step to  take against those who carried it out.  </P></p>

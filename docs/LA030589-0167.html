			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: WALK THIS WAY  </P> <P> Given the success in Griffith Park of the new Gene Autry Western Heritage  Museum, designed by Widom Wein Cohen, and the new entry to the Los Angeles Zoo,  designed by John Aleksich, it was only logical that something better than a  parking lot connect them.  </P> <P> Now being shown to the necessary public agencies and potential private donors  is "Dream Walk," an engaging pedestrian way softened by furniture, plantings, a  kiosk and fountains. Featured at intervals of the 900-foot walk would be an  orientation center to the park, a water sculpture in the form of children's  toys and an entrance court to the zoo.  </P> <P> "With a steady stream of people, particularly children, now wandering between  the museum and zoo I thought the walk would make the experience a safer, and  more attractive one," says designer Chet Widom.

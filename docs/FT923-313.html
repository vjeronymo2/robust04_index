			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: AGF falls 24% on weak international performance ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), one of France's largest state-controlled insurers, suffered a 24 per cent fall in net profits during the first half of this year due to the poor performance of its international insurance interests and a banking activity. Michel Albert, chairman of AGF, said the decline in interim net profits  - from FFr1.83bn (Dollars 366m) in the first six months of 1991 to FFr1.4bn in the same period this year - should be seen in the light of the slowdown in the French economy and the 'catastrophic' situation in the UK and Scandinavian insurance sectors. The profits fall from AGF, the first of the big French insurers to have published its figures in the current interim results season, comes at a time when the French insurance industry is under pressure because of the sluggish state of the domestic market which has depressed demand for insurance products and also affected the value of the insurers' industrial investments and property holdings. AGF managed to increase consolidated sales by 11.5 per cent to FFr30.2bn during the first half due to strong growth from its interests outside France and from its reinsurance business. Life insurance in France saw sales grow by 6.4 per cent to FFr9.5bn but made static profits of FFr1.05bn. The non-life insurance division saw net profits slip to FFr127m on sales up 9.9 per cent to FFr8.3bn. AGF has been one of the leaders among the French insurers in raising non-life tariffs to try to alleviate the pressure on profitability. Mr Jean Daniel Le Franc, chief executive, said AGF should benefit from the tariff rises in the second half. AGF's activities outside France went into the red with a loss of FFr191m, against net profits of FFr8m, after sales growth of 17.2 per cent to FFr9.9bn. The group, which recently won its fight to exercise its voting rights on its stake in AMB of Germany, fared well in Belgium and the Irish Republic but suffered in Spain and Italy. The reinsurance business moved back into the black with net profits of FFr44m from a loss of FFr1m, on sales that rose by 15.7 per cent to FFr2.5bn. But AGF's banking and financial activities fared badly, moving from net profits of FFr104m into a loss of FFr58m mainly due to heavy losses of FFr245m from Banque du Phenix. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Ostrovskaya report: "Firms Will Compete for Right </F> To Build Nuclear Waste Reprocessing Facilities for Us"]    [Text] Vladivostok -- The Pacific Fleet is not going to  pour any liquid radioactive waste -- a by-product of the  destruction of nuclear submarines -- into the Sea of Japan  before the end of the year. That is the only specific accord  reached during the work of the Russian-Japanese commission on  the problem of liquid radioactive waste. A statement to that  effect was made by Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the Maritime  Kray Administration Natural Resources Committee and member of  the Russian-Japanese commission, on his return from Tokyo.    Prior to Tokyo the commission, under the cochairmanship of  Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, and  Amano Yukiya [name as transliterated], head of the Japanese  Foreign Ministry Nuclear Energy Department, visited Vladivostok,  then the city of Bolshoy Kamen which, as is well known, is where  old navy tankers full of radioactive water stand moored at the  Zvezda Plant, and also Sysoyev Bay. The latter is the site of a  support center, the so-called sedimentation ship division and  the base where Pacific Fleet submarines are cut up for scrap.    The Maritime region was included in the itinerary solely at  the Japanese side's insistence, which is perfectly  understandable. Since the problem of recycling liquid  radioactive waste is going to be resolved using resources  allocated by the Japanese Government, it is clear that it is  time to put an end to the secrecy and display the potential  sites for the construction of the reprocessing complex. No one  doubts that one is needed today. After all, even though the  process of cutting up nuclear submarines is still going on at  the Zvezda Plant, all the liquid radioactive waste tanks are  full and there are approximately 2,000 cubic meters of  radioactive water stored there at present.    According to the specialists, the most logical thing of all  would be to set up the complex for the recycling and  reprocessing of nuclear waste right here at Zvezda. But the  inhabitants of Bolshoy Kamen opposed this method of resolving  the problem and the Russian-Japanese commission decided to look  for another solution.    Without coming to any definitive or irrevocable decision,  the  commission has arrived at two preliminary options.    Option one is the construction of a mobile complex for the  recycling of liquid radioactive waste, in other words a floating  installation capable of moving freely at sea and taking waste  products from ships and from shore-based storage facilities.  Such an installation could be produced in six months, according  to the assurance given by the Japanese.    Option two includes the construction of additional fixed  containers for liquid radioactive waste and a shore-based  reprocessing complex in Sysoyev Bay. The containers could be  built in three months, the complex in a year.    It will become clear by mid-May which of these is the  preferred option. By that time representatives of the Crown  Agents, a British firm of consultants who took part in the  commission's work, have pledged to produce an estimate of the  cost and economic expediency of each option.    When the final choice has been made it is proposed to put  the  best plan out to tender. In the commission's opinion the  contract will go to whoever can guarantee to fulfill all the  necessary technical and economic conditions at the lowest cost.  Anyone will be allowed to tender. It is presumed that this  will mean Japanese, Russian, and U.S. firms above all.    So, if everything goes according to this plan, it may be  hoped that within about four months the ill-starred and  ramshackle TNT-5, the subject of much discussion for six months  now, will finally be separated from its liquid radioactive  cargo. But what about now? After all, if the Maritime Kray  Administration is to be believed, this vessel is only notionally  seaworthy because it could spring a leak at any moment or sink  to the bottom without warning. To avoid protest actions by  local inhabitants on the one hand, and problems in dealings with  neighbors in the Sea of Japan on the other hand, the commission  came up with what it believes is a compromise solution: The  TNT-5 will be towed further away from the Bolshoy Kamen  protesters. It is hard to guess right now just where that will  be and how it will be done because the tanker is dilapidated and  was written off two years ago. Perhaps it will be towed out  into Sysoyev Bay....    Here is an interesting detail. For the first time in the  history of this question, the very highest Russian authorities  gave the Japanese permission during the commission's work not  only to visit the Zvezda Plant but also go aboard the legendary  TNT-5. However, the prudent visitors declined to visit the TNT  after they had checked it with their personal dosimeters and  registered a reading considerably above the radiation  background. I wonder what was felt at that particular moment by  those people who, by the whim of an evil fate, were unlucky  enough to be doing their fixed-term service aboard this  dangerously radioactive tub? Perhaps the sailors and commanders  of the illustrious Pacific Fleet feel that for six months they  have been guinea pigs who have helped to show the effect of the  prolonged exposure of the human body to small doses of radiation.</p>

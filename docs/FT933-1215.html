			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (11): Flotations return to favour - UK regional funds THE LAST six months have been the most profitable in the 33-year history of 3i in Manchester. Mr Phil Goodwin, local director of operations says it is the ideal illustration for the recent improvement in venture capital exit routes. The best performer was Metrotect, a pipeline coating company bought out by management for Pounds 6m in 1988 with the backing of 3i Manchester and the local office of NatWest Ventures. This summer it floated on the stock exchange for Pounds 30m. Taco, a manufacturer of plastic film in Cheshire, was subject to a Pounds 10m management buy-out last year. It was sold to Briton, an emergent packaging group, for Pounds 27m, further swelling 3i Manchester's bottom line. This November Mr Goodwin, together with Murray Johnstone's Manchester managers, expects to do well from the flotation of Canadian Pizza, a Salford food company which has achieved the rare distinction of successfully selling chilled pizza cases to Italy. November will also see the flotation of Lilliput Lane, the Cumbrian miniature model maker rescued by North of England Ventures and Lazard Ventures in 1990 after a diversification programme ran into trouble because of rising interest rates. Mr Peter Folkman, managing director of NEV who is generally regarded as a guru of regional venture capitalism in Britain, is expecting to receive Pounds 7m for the sale of 25 per cent of the company. NEV is keeping 5 per cent to ensure future returns and influence when Lilliput expands. ACROSS the north and Scotland - the areas of Britain least damaged by recession - management buy-out teams have been delivering good returns to venture capital backers, merchant bankers and lenders. Mr Charles Richardson, who this month joined 3i's London office from his post as its northern regional director, says: 'There was a worry that flotation might have lost its attractiveness as an exit route because not long ago the market was not interested in anything worth less than Pounds 50m. 'Some of the managing directors of companies we had backed were beginning to wonder if the game was worth the candle. All that has changed. We have been involved in 12 flotations in the north and in Scotland this year and we have several more coming up. Most were management buy-outs three or four years ago.' Mr Folkman adds: 'In the last six months the stock market boom has helped us all feel better. Portfolios are looking stronger.' This is none too soon for most regional funds. In spite of being well backed by institutions and larger national funds, most are relatively small by London standards. Their portfolios are limited in size and it does not take many failures to make them look unhealthy. One or two small funds have disappeared from the FT's yearly list of principal sources of regional capital, having been absorbed by bigger parents or neighbours. New entrants are usually backed by national institutions with deep pockets. Profits are now being made, but the scope for reinvestment in new projects appears to be limited. At the same time, senior debt - the working capital element of most deals - is less freely available because the clearing banks which provide it are still cautious. 'The great irony is that at the present low cost of borrowing, leveraged buy-outs should be easier to do than ever before, but they can't be done easily because the banks are still worried about lending,' says Mr Paul Mitchell of Rickett Mitchell, the Manchester corporate finance boutique. Mr Mitchell also warns of the problem presented by prices. Private companies have always sold for about five times earnings but the price of public companies - in this instance usually subsidiaries within large groups - has been more variable. The returns being achieved by the flotation of some management buy-outs are so good partly because managements bought their businesses cheaply: their parents were slimming down quickly to cope with recession. Many companies were sold for less than 10 times earnings, at a time when earnings were depressed. Earnings are now rising and Mr Folkman says 10 times earnings is regarded as a the starting point for negotiations. As venture capitalists aim to float at 15 times earnings to recoup their investment at a tidy profit, margins and opportunities look limited. Mr Lindsay Forbes, manager of the British Linen Bank - the merchant arm of the Bank of Scotland - in Manchester, says: 'We are certainly not seeing a great increase in the number of do-able deals coming across the desk. 'There is now too much money available for the number of good projects worth backing - and possibly everything is still too geared up for management buy-outs. It is the people who run businesses who count and there is a limited number who are really good enough to deliver. IS the management suitable? This is the question that Mr Forbes and his colleagues always ask. If a buy-out is relatively cheap, a moderate management must look promising in terms of return on capital for venture capital backers. In more expensive buy-outs the management must be very good to make a deal work for its backers. The economic climate is also a factor. 'In good years you have more chances of a bad decision working,' says Mr Forbes. Most of the regional venture capital industry has moved in the relatively easy market of management buy-outs from motivated vendors for the past few years, and fund managers now face a stern test of their mettle. To make good returns they will have to do what everyone thinks venture capitalists are supposed to do - back entrepreneurs with new businesses or back existing companies which need to advance with risk capital rather than potentially crippling borrowings. Given Mr Forbes's warning about the perpetual shortage of good entrepreneurial managers, nerves will be tested, especially if people feel under pressure to do something - anything - with the piles of money they will be sitting on from this year's flotations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report based on data of the Russian Federation </F> State Committee on Statistics: "Results of Russian Industry  Operations for 11 Months"]    [Text] In January-November 1993 the volume of industrial  production as compared to the analogous period of last year  declined by 16 percent, including by 15 percent in November.    The output of sectors producing for the consumer market  declined by 12 percent, and of those manufacturing producer  goods--by 18 percent, which to a certain extent is the result of  diminished investment demand.    In the chemical and petrochemical, timber, woodworking, pulp  and paper, and light industry, output fell by 18-25 percent as  compared to 11 months of last year; in the fuel and raw material  sectors (power generation, gas, coal, ore mining for ferrous  metallurgy), output fell by 6-9 percent.    During the last few months, in the fuel and energy complex,  one sees a characteristic increase in output of major energy  resources.    Over 11 months the output of gas amounted to 560 billion  cubic meters; coal--277 million tonnes; and oil--314 million  tonnes (including gas condensate), which is less than over the  analogous period of last year by 4 percent, 10 percent, and 13  percent, respectively. The volume of power generation declined  overall by 5 percent, and at thermal electric power stations by  8 percent.    In ferrous metallurgy as compared to 11 months of last year  output of finished rolled metal dropped off by 7 percent, and of  steel pipe by one-quarter. At the same time, certain structural  changes are taking place in the sector. While total steel  smelting fell off by 12 percent, output of converter steel  declined by 3 percent. The share of this advanced method in the  total volume of production currently is 38 percent as compared  to 34 percent in 1992.    In machine building, over January-November 1993 as compared  to the same period of last year, production of construction  cranes declined by almost one-half; freight railcars and large  electric machinery--by one-third; main line diesel  locomotives--by more than one-quarter; and metal-cutting machine  tools and alternate current electric motors--by almost 20  percent.    In the chemical and petrochemical industry over  January-November of 1993 the output of chemical fiber and thread  amounted to 74 percent of that for last year, and automotive  tires--89 percent; the output of mineral fertilizer has not  exceeded 80 percent of the level of the corresponding period of  last year. At the same time, positive structural changes are  manifesting themselves in their production: The share of mineral  fertilizer in granulated form has increased from 58 percent to  63 percent.    In 1993 there were structural changes in the production of  chemical fiber and thread. The share of artificial thread and  fiber requiring less expenditure of material resources increased  (from 43 percent in January-November 1992 to the current 49  percent), as did the production of those closest in quality to  natural thread and fiber--rayon textile thread (from 6.5 percent  to 8.1 percent) and rayon fiber (from 28 percent to 34 percent).    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry over  the elapsed 11 months, output of cardboard and sawn lumber  declined by one-quarter; of woodchip board--by 12 percent, and  plywood--by 18 percent. There was also a decline in the  production of window and door units, mine props, prefabricated  homes and sets of home-building components made of wood, and  wood containers.    Despite the seasonal increase in the production of  commercial  wood that began in November, its monthly output ended 27 percent  below that of last year, and over January-November overall--28  percent.    At the same time, the decline in paper production slowed  down  somewhat--from 25 percent in the first half of the year to 13  percent in July-November. The output of writing and notebook  paper, as well as some varieties of printing paper produced  predominantly for the domestic market, declined by 25-43 percent.    In light industry the output of footwear declined by almost  one-third as compared to January-November of last year; of  fabrics, knitwear, and some varieties of sewn items (coats and  short coats, jackets, and shirts)--by 25-29 percent; and of  hosiery--by 13 percent. Production of items for children  declined to a greater extent--by 31-49 percent.    In the cultural, personal, and household goods market the  situation is more favorable. To a certain extent due to new  capacities being brought on line and conversion of defense  enterprises, production of a number of complex appliances and  machines increased over January-November 1993 as compared to the  analogous period of last year; this includes freezers, two- and  three-chamber refrigerators, kitchen food mixers, color  television sets, goods for use on private farms and auxiliary  and garden plots--modular engines, motorized cultivators, and  mini-tractors. At the same time, the low degree of  attractiveness of domestically produced goods as compared to  imported ones and the population's limited buying power resulted  in a reduction of output in the communication industry--such as  video cassette recorders, radio receivers, and tape recorders  (18-38 percent), and of photo cameras by instrument-making  industry enterprises (by 46 percent).    In the food processing industry output of basic foodstuffs  is  characterized by the following data:    Product          Production                          November (average                                                       daily output) as %                                                       of                    September    October    November    November    October                                                       1992        1993   Meat,            319          324        274         77          85  including  category I  subproducts,  thousand  tonnes   Whole-milk       600          608        578         88          98  products  recalculated  as milk,  thousand  tonnes   Granulated       397          923        722         115         78  sugar--total,  thousand  tonnes   Vegetable oil,   39.1         78.4       88.4        93          116  thousand  tonnes   Bread and        1,277        1,265      1,143       96          93  bakery items,  thousand  tonnes</p>

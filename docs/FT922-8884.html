			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Annual net losses at Pirelli Tyre grow to Fl 511m PIRELLI Tyre Holding, the Dutch-listed tyre-making arm of Italy's Pirelli group, saw annual net losses widen to Fl 511m (Dollars 275m) in 1991 from just Fl 9m in 1990. The downturn was caused by difficult conditions on most world tyre markets, reorganisation costs in Europe and the US, and a downwards revision in the market value of Pirelli Tyre's 5 per cent stake in Continental, its German rival and one-time takeover target. Pirelli Tyre, which is to omit its dividend for the second year running, said it expected results to reach break-even point during 1992. However, it said it could not say whether this would happen early enough to pull the company out of the red for the full year. Mr Guiseppe Ferrari, finance director, said Pirelli Tyre, which is 80 per cent-owned by the Pirelli group, had made some headway in the 1992 first quarter. 'So far, the results are encouraging, showing that we are improving the situation compared with last year.' In November and December, the company pushed through price increases on the car-tyre replacement markets in Europe and North America, and followed this up in May with rises for truck and agricultural equipment tyres in both these regions. Sales of 'original equipment' tyres to automotive producers fell in 1991 as a result of sluggish car sales. Overall, Pirelli Tyre's sales eased to Fl 6.1bn last year from Fl 6.2bn in 1990. Of last year's loss, slightly more than Fl 200m represented losses on normal business operations, particularly in the US, while a further Fl 250m was set aside for restructuring provisions. At the same time, the value of the company's holding in Continental was revised downwards by more than Fl 40m. The stake, originally seen as a strategic asset in Pirelli's attempt to merge with Continental, is now regarded as a financial asset. Mr Ferrari said the recovery in the tyre industry may, in the medium term, enable Pirelli to recoup some of the costs of its investment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] India has called for a more equitable distribution  of the earth resources. The environment minister, Mr. Kamal  Nath, told the UN Commission on Sustainable Development that  there should be a change in pattern of consumption, favoring  lesser use of energy and lesser waste. The minister was  addressing the commission in New York yesterday. Mr. Kamal Nath  said unless the gap between the quality of life in the  developing world and that in the developed nations is narrowed  down, there can be no sustainable development. Mr. Kamal Nath  said developing countries cannot be expected to be frozen at  some marginal level of subsistence. He said even a marginal  reduction in consumption by rich people in advanced countries  could make a large number of poor people better off without  affecting the rich. He welcomed the beginning made with the  Global Environment Facility, the GEF, but cautioned that the  gains of the GEF will be overwhelmed if they are not followed  expeditiously.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis by Sarmite </F> Elerte, Ainars Dimants and Aivars Ozolins; place and date not  given: "Somebody Has To Lead the Team Forward"]    [Excerpts] [Elerte] After your and Mr. Birkavs' press  conference, at the end of last week, it was quite clear that you  are pretty sure that Russia will admit the fact of occupation,  as well as that Russia will comply with the concluded  agreements. What makes you feel so positive about this? To  what extent is this a concept conveyed by Yeltsin, Gratchev, and  Kozyrev? Are there any democratic forces in Russia's background?    [Ulmanis] Mr. Birkavs gave a very precise answer at the  press  conference: The only thing one can be absolutely sure of is  death. I could answer any question connected with Russia in the  same way. Consequence in the realm of politics deals with the  same kind of question.    I went to Moscow with the idea that President Yeltsin would  talk to us for 20 minutes and then turn his back and walk away,  and all the rest would be settled through the ordinary  bureaucratic system -- as has happened to many country leaders  who have visited him. Russian officials themselves warned us:  Do not get annoyed should talks turn out to be very brief, and  the rest is carried out by clerks. However, an hour passed,  then another, then a third, and Yeltsin did not show any signs  of withdrawing. He did not look tired and did not avoid any of  my questions. I asked him all the questions I had in mind:  Concerning the occupation, and the repressions, and Karlis  Ulmanis [Latvia's last prewar president, grand-uncle of Guntis  Ulmanis], and the KGB. The only question we never mentioned was  human rights. He was in an extremely creative and rational  mood. At first, I thought we would talk tete-a-tete, but later  we asked our assistants to be present, so that he could  instantly issue orders concerning all matters brought up by me  -- on `chekist' archives, on the grave of Karlis Ulmanis, on  admitting to Stalin's repressions in 1940 and 1949.    [Elerte] Also on admitting to the 1940 occupation?    [Ulmanis] Concerning the occupation -- as you roughly  mentioned -- we both left this topic for another time. I had  the feeling that we had already achieved much, and that this was  enough for the present, otherwise the tension would have become  too strong. It might have harmed what we had already gained.  Yeltsin talked extensively about the tragedy of the Russian  people, and he definitely condemned imperial thinking. On my  way to Moscow, I was prepared for their imperial way of  thinking, and for having to point out that Latvia is an  independent state. But no, on his own initiative, he declared  that Russia endeavors to do its best to eliminate imperial  thinking. Although, he said he was not absolutely sure whether  they will succeed. Russia is tired of internal fighting. He  told me about Bashkiria, Tatarstan, about other autonomous  states. He said: It is all very well that you have regained  your independence, and we do wish to withdraw from this region  as quickly as possible, and to settle this issue between us.    This might be a diplomatic game in part. We should take  energetic and pragmatic action immediately, so that what was  said by us would not fade into emotional memories. In any case,  I do not have any illusions that the most difficult matters are  already completed. The most difficult part is still ahead of  us. This was only the first time that we undertook to form a  new relationship with Russia, and that Russia spoke frankly with  Latvia.    [Dimants] What is your opinion regarding Russia's next move  concerning admitting to the 1940 occupation? When will  Yeltsin's official announcement regarding this issue take place?    [Ulmanis] My wish is that admitting to the occupation would  be expressed in actual support of Latvia's sovereignty -- that  the Army would be withdrawn, and that the situation with the  military personnel would become stable. As soon as Russia will  prove through its actions that it respects us as a sovereign  state, and will cease its ideological pressure on Latvia, then  admitting to the 1940 occupation will follow as a natural result  of eliminating the consequences of the occupation. By the way,  one of Yeltsin's promises was that the Russian side -- as much  as it will be possible to stop the propaganda machinery -- will  not throw any more dirt on Latvia; the television, press, and  embassies abroad cannot continue to refer to Latvia at every  possible occasion as a virtually semi-fascist state.    I feel an internal contradiction while talking to Yeltsin,  because I realize they are struggling to build a new country,  with a new mentality, trying to free themselves of the heritage  of the Soviet Union and of Soviet Russia. While they are  building something totally new, I would be telling them at the  same time: This something new is not sufficient; you should  first admit to the occupation by the USSR! In private  conversations, they do admit it. But on the state level -- we  still have work to do.    [Dimants] But who admits it? Yeltsin or, as you stated at  the press conference, in talks with others?    [Ulmanis] Look, I cannot be incorrect toward persons with  whom I held confidential talks. They said: There are no  doubts, that is how it was. But as soon as we speak on an  official level, they are not ready to admit it. Now, I cannot  declare openly that they have admitted the occupation, because  if I did so, they would be forced to deny it, due to their  internal situation. I should have given myself the benefit of  the doubt. When one has met and talked so much on such a level,  about one third of the contents of what was said should be kept  to oneself, for further work in the future. In due time, it  will develop and become public.    [Dimants] At the press conference you stated that in the  near  future there could be a change expected in this regard. What did  you mean by that?    [Ulmanis] Yes, we spoke about it -- if everything will go  smoothly with the withdrawal of the army. Also the European  processes are very important. Both Yeltsin and I touched upon  the NATO issue. He is thinking and having doubts. We looked at  each other in such a way -- how would we look as partners in the  framework of NATO. Probably it seemed somehow strange to him to  imagine me as his partner in NATO, because I do not possess a  single tank or a decent airplane, whereas he has plenty of them.    I came to two conclusions. First, we did the right thing by  not delaying our meeting with Russia. Second, it is essential  that Russia preserve its standpoint for the time being while the  baby born during our talks has time to grow up.    I must have confidence, because somebody has to lead the  team  forward. The result of the battle might not be known even to  the commander, but he still believes that he will win. I also  believe that I shall win. When I was leaving for Moscow, I was  feeling bad, but now I am determined not to quit the process  which I have begun, because I have the inner conviction that the  current year will be crucial for Latvia. Let us not make  guesses as to whether Yeltsin will stay or not. After meeting  with him, I am sure that neither Zhirinovskiy nor Rutskoy will  ever take his place. For the time being, the Kremlin is ruled  by reasonable people.    [Ozolins] Did you get any feeling as to who could replace  Yeltsin, should he leave his post?    [Ulmanis] Yeltsin looked so firm the thought never for a  moment occurred to me.    [Dimants] You mentioned you were also discussing issues  concerning Europe and NATO. Did you feel any discouraging  attitude toward Latvia's integration into Europe?    [Ulmanis] No. This was a separate question I was constantly  analyzing -- if there were any hidden meanings. But I did not  notice any. Naturally, before my trip, I had read many memoirs  about visits to Russia in the 1930's and 1940's by our envoys.  And I wondered if I shall be met with the same cunning and  false politeness, and if in the end I shall be the loser. But I  understood that they have many more difficult and serious  problems, that the elite that currently holds power in Russia,  is busy with different problems. Therefore, I thought: In the  meantime, while they are occupied with other problems, we should  take advantage of the moment to stabilize our position. Maybe a  year from now they will say that they overlooked something.  Kozyrev seemed to be quite indifferent when we talked to him.  I did not feel that he was hiding some tactical maneuvers up  his sleeve. Of course, it might have been a stalling tactic.  But if it really was, then we must work with much greater  intensity.    [Ozolins] You talked with Mr. Yeltsin about his possible  visit to Riga...    [Ulmanis] He spoke about it very cordially, recalling his  pleasant memories of Riga and Jurmala [seaside resort in Latvia].    [Ozolins] But was it his idea?    [Ulmanis] When the conversation drifted to more lyrical  topics, we talked about his previous visits to Latvia. I had to  convey to him regards from Mr. Gorbunovs, who was his host at  the time. Yeltsin remembered very well his stay in Jurmala and  Riga. By the way, he said he would be pleased to have a rest  there again.    [Ozolins] Do you foresee that during his visit to Riga, if  it  took place for instance next summer or at any other convenient  time, Yeltsin would officially, from the rostrum -- just like he  did in Hungary and in Poland -- let us say in front of the  Saeima [parliament], condemn the 1940 occupation?    [Ulmanis] Maybe, we shall keep this in mind. We would  welcome it. I have already been thinking of what you suggested.  At present, I am preparing a letter to Yeltsin. At first, I  thought it would be the usual letter of gratitude after a visit.  We shall prepare it as such, but, with a prospect for the  future, we shall emphasize the idea of another possible meeting  when a deeper moral vindication could take place. As you see, I  do not abandon this thought.    [Ozolins] To the last moment, Mr. Birkavs maintained that  he will definitely not go to Moscow, but in the end he decided  to accompany you. Was it perhaps a violation of diplomatic  protocol in some way?    [Ulmanis] No. International agreements, attributed to a  foreign army, can be signed, without the authorization of the  Saeima, by three people -- the state president, the prime  minister, and the minister of foreign affairs. The minister of  foreign affairs was "buried" one day before our journey. By  means of the "sacks" [KGB archives] the foreign minister was  practically excluded from the game. If it was not formulated in  the draft decision -- to give the president the powers to sign  -- I could sign without any doubt, because in principle I do not  need any authorization. But the Saeima rejected this  authorization in general, because there was no quorum.    I could take a risk. But then a group of lawyers arrived  from the the Saeima and said: Mr. President, you may take the  risk, but then there will be a Constitutional Court, and we  shall claim your signature on the documents was illegal. We  decided with Birkavs that we shall not undertake any risky  decisions. At the same time, if we wanted to sign the first  document, we needed the signature of the Russian president. In  addition, according to the Latvian Constitution, the president  can sign any document, if it is countersigned by the government,  because the Constitution does not foresee political  responsibility on the side of the president.    Actually, it is not important, who signed the documents. The  game is now being played on a new level, where the president and  the government together are bearing responsibility for the  processes that are developing in connection with the agreements.  Both Birkavs and I do not stress who signed which agreement.  This is now a team game. We are not having any further  discussions because the responsibility is taken on by the entire  team.    [Ozolins] I understand this, but all the same it looked a  bit  strange that on behalf of Russia the agreements were signed not  by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, but by his First Deputy Soskovec.    [Ulmanis] Chernomyrdin had departed for Orenburg. Russia is  a big country, and such trips are planned long in advance. Mr.  Yeltsin said to me -- if the first deputy does not suit you, we  can postpone all this for a few days and ask Chernomyrdin to  come, he has no hidden agendas. Actually, the document was  signed by the Russian Cabinet of Ministers. To exclude any  possible doubts, Yeltsin said: Chernomyrdin will certainly come  to your country and sign all other economic agreements. The  prognostics can vary. Time will show, why they were so correct,  so composed, and so calm.    [Elerte] How do you assess the possibility of regaining the  missing KGB archives, which was also discussed during the Moscow  talks?    [Ulmanis] Yeltsin put it this way: We have returned such  documents to Poland, and Hungary, and there is no reason why we  should not return them to you. This is what he said, but we do  not know, what the Russian middle level is thinking. Maybe they  are plotting something, and maybe it is in their interest to  keep certain parts of the documents. There are opinions, that  the most important documents are being kept in Moscow. In the  next few days I shall get in touch with Mr. Skrastins [Latvian  General Prosecutor], who on his part will get in touch with the  Russian General Prosecutor. I think Yeltsin has already given  orders to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other ministries  connected with this matter. In any case, Kozyrev, Gratchev, and  Yeltsin have promised to help. [passage omitted]    [Ozolins] But does it not seem now, that we have left  Estonia  alone, in a deadlock situation?    [Ulmanis] It was essential for Latvia to conclude these  agreements because Latvia is situated in the very center of the  Baltic region, not only politically but also militarily. The  center of the activities of the Russian Army is located here,  the headquarters and all the generals reside here -- all the  arteries of the Russian Army go through Riga. If this is  removed, who will support the infrastructure in Estonia? They  will be forced to find a solution to this situation very soon.    And there is another circumstance. Maybe the ambition and  principality of the Estonians has led them to such a position,  from which they cannot get out. The fact that we have moved  forward, that we have the agreements now, and that no tragedy  has resulted from it, on the contrary -- stability has  increased, which will help Estonians assess the situation and  accept a normal solution. [passage omitted]    [Dimants] To what degree, when speaking of these problems,  do  you represent the LZS [Farmers Union]?    [Ulmanis] None at all. I am simply careful not to forget  about the future. I think of what will occur in two or five  years. Sometimes, we have consultations, but usually they do not  ask my advice, and I do not pressure them, because I have  formally refused to participate in the activities of the party.    [Elerte] To phrase the question concerning a possible crisis  more precisely -- I understand that currently you do not feel  that you should seek a person who would be entrusted to  construct a new government?    [Ulmanis] No, I have no such feeling. Yet, I am thinking  about it. I have to consider such a possibility. I had very  uneasy thoughts when the deputies voted with their feet [they  left the session and there was no quorum]. They had calculated  then, that the opposition will always be able to win, by voting  with their feet. Even if 49 deputies would vote "for," and not  one would be against or abstain, there would be no possibility  of accepting a decision when the rest vote with their feet.  That night I understood -- now they have found a trick, and if  they repeat it again and again, I shall be forced to announce  that the Saeima is not able to continue its work.    [Ozolins] Mr. President, are you not afraid that the  opposition might use you as a means of overthrowing the  government, if they were to set their minds to it?    [Ulmanis] Well, there is a deadlock. If the opposition acts  in this way, it is refusing to work. The deputies have been  elected by the people, and I have the moral grounds to dismiss  them. Still, I hope they do not go that far, because the people  will simply scorn them. Moreover, some of them are quite  reasonable people. I think they will have the reason to now  behave in such a manner. Besides, I am not sure that the  opposition would be pleased if parliament were dismissed.    [Elerte] What will be the next important question for the  president, in which he could express his fundamental and, in a  sense, decisive opinion?    [Ulmanis] Upon my return from Moscow, I thought to myself --  may God allow me to work on this Russian question during my last  two years in office. I would like it to be possible to resolve  all of these problems, to stabilize our relationship, and to  prove that the fourth agreement will not turn out as envisioned  by the opposition. We still have to await ratification. I can  tell you frankly, that no one is going to establish a  joint-venture with Russia on the basis of a hospital. No one  intends to give away apartments or building sites.    I think that, from a political point of view, Russia needed  these agreements. For the military personnel, it was like a  drop of water in the ocean. They just had to prove to the world  that this is yet another Russian victory: We achieved the legal  protection of our people and we did it in a civilized manner,  hurrah!    From the point of view of recognizing the 1940 occupation,  we  have kind of lost, but at the same time we have grabbed hold of  a gigantic lever -- we can decide for ourselves what the fate  will be of these military personnel in Latvia.    The institution of president in Latvia is the weakest in  East Europe, in terms of legal backing, and has the least amount  of power. I have only moral levers -- moral categories, if you  will -- at my disposal. It may be that the Latvian president,  regardless of whether it is me or somebody else, by introducing  the institution of a moral category, will turn it into a  powerful force in our country. To me, this might show the  cleverness of our Constitution. Because, if I had the power to  give orders to the administrative branch, I might have chosen  the easiest way -- to summon, order, and punish if something has  not been done. But I do not have the power to give orders to  anyone. I can only show the way toward fulfilling my ideas and  aims.    [Dimants] Returning to the question of a candidate for the  post of prime minister -- would he come from the right wing of  parliament?    [Ulmanis] No, not at the moment. Let them work, let them  create their shadow cabinet. At present, I do not see anyone in  the right wing who could form a team and lead the country.    We can quarrel with one another, but we have no rights to  risk anything when it comes to the most important factors --  Latvia, the Latvian people, and the future of our state. In my  opinion, the right-wing forces do not often understand this,  they are just playing with any toy they can get their hands on.  They do not treat anything seriously.    You see, after the vote of confidence, the government became  even more "leftist," because the result of the vote was decided  by the "Concord for Latvia" faction. This time, it was the left  wing that saved the government. They unmasked me, before I had  time to frighten them. The Concord understood that the moment  the vote came out negative, I would have had Birkavs form a new  government. They were afraid the we would succeed in creating  an even more successful government, and they would remain the  losers. That explains why they voted for us in the  no-confidence motion.    [Dimants] Will the conclusion of the agreements with Russia  strengthen the government and the coalition?    [Ulmanis] That all depends on their implementation.    I would like the Farmers Union, in its opinions and  political  thinking, to become more stable. Sometimes something comes over  them, and half of them "for" something and half vote "against"  it.    Still, there are people who are against these agreements,  people for whom they are inconvenient. The withdrawal of the  Russian Army was the center of all our hatred and problems.  Now, all of a sudden, this focal point has vanished. The right  wing has lost their footing. They have to look elsewhere, for  something new on which to harp. I do not know yet what, if  anything, they will find. If they start to look for national  harmony, this could become their focus.    [Ozolins] The question of citizenship will be coming up  soon.    [Ulmanis] I am of the view that there is a rational enough  model for this, and we should accept it sometime in May. We now  have a positive image throughout Europe, and they are sending us  cables of congratulations. If we, for example, accept this law  in a couple weeks' time and Russia begins to howl, it will not  be easy for Europe to turn against us.    [Elerte] If the West views these agreements as an inevitable  and clever concession on the part of Latvia, the pressure on the  citizenship law may not be very strong?    [Ulmanis] We often think that we have won the war, that we  have at least the same power as Russia, that we are talking to  the USSR or, at least, to Red Russia. We keep forgetting,  however, that this is a new, democratic Russia, which is  practically our only salvation. We should help them in every  way possible, but this is seldom emphasized. We have now added  to Russia's political prestige. Being small -- almost as small  as the tip of a needle -- we have helped build the international  prestige of Russia. They understand and appreciate this.    [Dimants] I would like to put a question to you concerning  the right-wing forces. Is there a threat that they could turn  and support a socialist way of developing the Latvian economy?    [Ulmanis] It is perfectly clear that one cannot last long on  nationalism alone. Nonetheless, the intellectual sector is also  essential. We should find our approach to the young people.  Thus far, we have neglected this aspect -- the aspect of  molding the young people of our country. We model ourselves  after the old ones -- Berklavs, Lambergs, Krastins, Kirsteins,  and Milbergs. I can name hundreds of people about whom  everything is clear. But where are the young people from 1989,  from 1990? Where will they lead Latvia?    This spring, I shall begin a new tour around Latvia. It will  be orientated a little differently -- more toward intellectuals  and young people. Human emotions are no longer sufficient for  me, and I seek something more difficult. Just in this  situation, right after concluding the agreements with Russia, I  wish to rush to Aluksne, to Gulbene, and meet thousands of  people, looking them in the eyes. Let them express their  dissatisfaction right away -- I am of the personal conviction  that I shall be able to explain my actions to them -- to all  those who are willing to listen.    You know, sometimes I think about the popularity rating of  the president. I would like it to reflect only this one aspect.  I am indifferent to the other directions. I would like to feel  that on the basis of this rating, the Farmers Union will get  stronger. Then I could be sure that I have achieved my mission,  and can put an end to it.</p>

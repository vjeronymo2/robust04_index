			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Indian imports of oil set to fall India's oil imports are expected to fall by 6m tonnes in the current financial year (April 1994-March 1995), following an increase in domestic crude production, saving the country nearly Rs23bn (Dollars 733m) in foreign exchange at current international prices. Crude oil imports are expected to drop to 24m tonnes this year, from 30m tonnes in 1993-94, according to figures released yesterday by Indian Oil Corporation, one of India's largest public sector units, and the canalising agency for the import of crude oil and selected petroleum products. However, petroleum product imports were expected to rise to 13m-15m tonnes, from 12.64m last year. This increase is due in large measure to the increase in demand for diesel (for tractors) when the country has had a good monsoon. Mr J L Zutshi, chairman of Indianoil, yesterday announced the corporation's net profit of Rs7.72bn during 1993-94, through its refining and marketing operations, up 14 per cent from last year.</p>

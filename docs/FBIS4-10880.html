			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin </F> Posada in Madrid by Dario Arizmendi in Santa Fe de Bogota; from  "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] What is the outcome of your trip, during  which you even met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin?    [Sanin] After a complete collapse of the Berlin Wall, we do  not have the proper political or legal instruments for a  bilateral and multilateral relationship between Latin America  and these countries of eastern Europe.    [Arizmendi] What can you tell us about President Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Colombia?    [Sanin] He was interested in visiting Latin America,  especially Colombia, but obviously every visit by a head of  state has to be a productive step forward in relations. It  cannot be just a visit to make a speech or a visit for protocol  reasons. A visit of this type has to result in significant  opportunities for improved cooperation. He asked me to prepare  15 agreements, and once they are prepared, he would be delighted  to visit Colombia.    [Arizmendi] What about the rest of the countries you  visited,  Romania and Hungary?    [Sanin] Important processes are being conducted in the Czech  Republic, for example. There is a great consensus on the  political and economic reforms. The transformations being  carried out in that country in a few years since the 1989 velvet  revolution are impressive. It is impressive to see how the  parliament, the president, the prime minister, the foreign trade  minister, the foreign minister, and the people have united to  transform their society. Shops are opening up every day. The  arts are developing today more than ever. There is a different  political education here. Freedom is in vogue and it is leading  to the flowering of each one of man's expressions. It is  marvelous to see this awakening.    In Romania the situation is different. There is a little  more controversy, but it is marvelous to see what President Ion  Iliescu and his government are doing. The parliament is also  working to achieve political and economic transformations as  soon as possible. They are awakening to this new economic  reality. Their privatization process is slower, but it is  evident that their economy, political opportunities, and  freedoms are opening up. In Romania, I stayed at the house  where Nicolae Ceausescu used to live. It was quite impressive.    [Arizmendi] Did spirits show up around you? Perhaps Dracula?    [Sanin, laughing] Ceausescu's spirit may have been around  us.  We were scared.    [Arizmendi] You are not easy to scare. Not even Dracula can  frighten you.    [Sanin] The spirit of Ceausescu can scare anyone.    [Arizmendi] During your visit to Moscow, you made a historic  achievement. You were able to get the Russians to condemn the  armed struggle in Colombia. How important is the Russian  position for the Colombian Government?    [Sanin] It is very significant politically because, as we  discussed it there, for many years Russia and the former USSR  promoted the armed struggle in Colombia. It was a way of  intervening in the internal affairs of other countries. Today,  they recognize our democracy and they recognize opportunities  for freedom. They have also changed to believe it is best to  work through proselytism, regardless of what their ideology may  be, than to resort to the use of arms. We all want revolutions  and more just societies to meet the needs of the people.    [Arizmendi] The Ibero-American Summit will be held in  Cartagena on 14 and 15 June of the present year. Mrs. Maria  Emma Mejia, the Colombian ambassador to Spain, had the  opportunity to talk about the extent of this meeting the day  before yesterday. What heads of state have already confirmed  their attendance?    [Sanin] All of them. All heads of state and presidents will  attend the summit. Spanish King Juan Carlos I will also attend  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. I want to praise the efforts  of the Colombian ambassador to Spain and the efforts of all  embassy officials who worked hard for two and one-half months to  show our works of art, science, and literature during a  Colombian exhibit in Madrid. I also want to congratulate  Caracol journalist Carlos Penaloza, who has made a great effort  to demonstrate Colombia's real image in Spain and Europe. They  are portraying an image that is not one of violence as is  sometimes depicted by the media. They are demonstrating our  country's values abroad.</p>

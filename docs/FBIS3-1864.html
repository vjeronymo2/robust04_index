The national  economy continued to grow, and the people's living standards  continued to improve. The major improvements can be observed in  the following:    First, gross domestic product [GDP] exceeded three trillion  yuan, topping the figure from the preceding year by 736 billion  yuan. On a constant price basis, the growth rate was 13.4  percent higher than that of 1992 and was the highest since 1985.    Zhang said: [Begin Zhang recording] The output of major  industrial and agricultural goods set record highs, the  infrastructure became stronger, the scientific and technological  progress was greater, and the state's foreign exchange reserves  increased. All this was favorable for achieving sustained  national economic growth.    Second, the people's living standards continued to improve,  and their incomes continued to grow. In 1993, urban and rural  dwellers' incomes grew by 10.2 and 3.2 percent, respectively.  The scope of their consumption continued to broaden; and the  standards of their clothing, food, spending ability, housing,  and transportion continued to rise.    Third, the nation's reforms continued to deepen. The various  reform programs carried out around the main goal -- namely  building a socialist market economic system -- continued to  deepen during the past year. New progress was made in reforms  carried out in rural areas and state-owned enterprises and in  reforms relevant to wages, social security, housing system,  macroscopic regulation and control, and prices. Fairly  significant breakthroughs were made in two areas: 1) The  efforts made to rationalize prices through correcting the  perennially low prices for primary goods and infrastructure  services have played an important role in forming market  mechanisms. 2) While exercising macroscopic regulation and  control, the nation did away with conventions and achieved  positive results and gain valuable experiences from conducting  experiments in introducing new measures at the right time and  adjusting the degree of intensity.    Fourth, the nation's opening up programs continued to  broaden. In 1993 China's opening up programs continued to deepen  in all sectors and in all directions. Import and export volumes  continued to expand, and the mix of import and export goods  continued to improve. The use of foreign capital grew  substantially. New records were set both in the number of new  accords signed on the use of foreign capital and in the actual  amounts of foreign capital used. Fairly substantial progress  was also made in developing economic and technical cooperation  with foreign countries and in promoting international tourism.    The key economic problems were: The decline of actual  incomes of some people owing to rising commodity prices in the  market; excessive investment in building fixed assets; and  incompatibility between the development of basic industries and  infrastructure on the one hand and rapid national economic  growth on the other. On the whole, however, the economic  situation in 1993 was satisfactory. The new changes appearing in  various sectors are favorable for the nation to seize the  opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world,  promote development, and mantain stability in 1994. In 1994, we  must continue to implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th  national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee; always pay attention to properly  handling the relationships among reform, development, and  stability; and continue to intensify and improve macroscopic  regulation and control. Priority will be given to appropriately  controlling investment in fixed assets and the growth of the  money supply and guarding against serious inflation so that the  targets set for reform and development this year can be  attained. [end recording]    Answering a question on commodity prices, Zhang Sai said:  The substantial increase in commodity prices is primarily  triggered by demand, especially the high demand for resources  needed for investment in fixed assets. Second, it is due to  rising costs. This is particularly noticeable as result of the  readjustment of the prices of primary goods. Moreover, price  increases were also caused by consumers' anticipation that  commodity prices would rise, as well as by unwarranted and  covert price rises and speculations. Thus, during the  transition toward a market economy, it has become increasingly  noticeable that market prices have been affected by the law of  supply and demand. During 1994, price controls, as an important  macroscopic regulatory measure, will still be useful for  controlling price rises at a level consumers can tolerate.    In respond to a question about China's economic growth rates  in 1994, Zhang Sai pointed out: Seen from the law governing  economic cycles, we still can expect a fairly high economic  growth rate this year, but the rate will not be as high as those  of 1992 and 1993. This is because of the increasingly obvious  restrictions from basic industries. The utilization ratios of  basic industries are already vary high, ranging from 80 to 100  percent in most cases, and communications and transport services  can only satisfy 60 percent of the needs. Because of the  restrictions from these bottlenecks, China's economic growth  will decline somewhat this year. We must stress, however, that  what is important is not high growth, but high economic returns.  Continual readjustments will be made until the best point has  been found for both growth and returns.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified male reporter] I am  reporter from [words indistinct], I want to ask Director Zhang a  question. Some people used to think that statistical figures  were inflated. This being the case, what positive efforts has  the State Statistics Bureau taken or will take to make the  figures more accurate? Can you [words indistinct] differences  of major figures can be controlled so that they can more  credible?    [Zhang] It is a common occurrence for statistics to be  confronted with skepticism in varying degrees in all countries.  If we observe specific facts, people more often than not  approach statistics with skepticism. Macroscopically speaking,  however, statistics can basically reflect facts because of the  development of statistical sciences. Today when we are moving  toward building a market economy, we have accomplished much in  the way of reforming our method of processing statistics, and we  have adopted some major measures for controlling the accuracy of  statistics. Generally, these reforms and measures are based on  1) science and technology; and 2) laws.    Regarding science and technology, we have, first of all,  established a scientific system for processing statistics. This  is a scientific, three-in-one system for processing social,  economic, and scientific and technical information. This system  has functions for controlling and verifying statistics according  to requirements. Second, we have a system for assessing the  national economic development. This system can process all  types of statistics in a way similar to assembling a large  machine. If a certain figure does not seem to fit, this figure  is considered to be incorrect and must be checked and verified.  Third, we have a scientific way to compile statistics. This  way is based on a number of methods, but primarily on surveys  and samplings. Fourth, we depend extensively on computers which  can distinguish correct from incorrect figures. Fifty, we have a  scientific management system which can reject interference from  various sectors when information is being processed. Because of  the development of modern science and technology, we can be sure  that our statistics are basically in line with objective facts.  In China, where statistical science has not been popularized,  it is understandable that people are skeptical of it. Even  people in developed countries often express doubts over  statistics. I think this is a normal phenomenon.    Then we have to count on laws. In addition to the PRC Law  for Statistics, all provinces and municipalities have their own  local statistics regulations, by which those who do not report  statistics according to state regulations or those who obstruct  statisticians from collecting statistics will be punished. So I  think you can be confident with our statistics. This is  particularly true for statisticians like ourselves. A Chinese  saying goes that a melon seller will certainly brag about the  melons he sells, but I think our statisticians can take pride in  their work of ensuring the accuracy of our statistics.

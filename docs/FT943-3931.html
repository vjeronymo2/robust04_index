			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: The flamboyant troubleshooter Jean-Marie Descarpentries is an enfant terrible among French managers. Unusually flamboyant, voluble and opinionated, his reputation as a turnround specialist is laced with controversy. His special talent is for provoking change in companies in crisis; managing in untroubled times is not his forte. 'Creative confusion' typically describes his style. He is fond of boasting that he has been fired from every job he has held with the exception of McKinsey &amp; Co, the management consultancy, where he worked between 1969 and 1976. The companies with which he has been involved include the glassmakers Saint Gobain of France and Glaverbel of Belgium. As chair-man and chief executive of Carnaud, a leading French packaging group, he first restored the company to health, then led the Pounds 780m acquisition of the UK's Metal Box Packaging in 1988. What Descarpentries did for Carnaud has been described as a textbook corporate turnround. It lost FFr159m (Pounds 19.3m) on sales of FFr4.6bn in 1981; by the time of the merger it was making FFr365m on sales of FFr7.23bn. The merged company, one of Europe's largest in the packaging business, proved less of a success as Descarpentries found that his cerebral theories about managers who behave either as horsemen or monks drew little response from the pragmatic British. Tensions grew within the company, senior managers left and performance fell away. Finally, after two years of increasing tension he quit. Critics say he underestimated how hard it would be to restructure Metal Box. Trained at the Ecole Polytechnique, he was a paratrooper while in the army. Stories abound of the tactics he uses to shock people into action. While he may have mellowed, he shows no signs of slowing down. At 57, he works extraordinary hours. Meetings often last until 10 or 11pm, explained only partly by the fact that during the week he lives by himself, joining his wife at the weekends at their 17th-century farmhouse south of Paris. For the average company doctor, Groupe Bull might be the last big turnround, but Descarpentries is already talking intriguingly about his next job.</p>

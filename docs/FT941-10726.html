			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT Stock market turbulence adds another twist of uncertainty to Granada's bid for LWT. But by itself it is unlikely to alter the outcome, despite the 3 per cent fall in Granada's shares. LWT lost the argument about being big enough to stand on its own the moment it started lobbying the government for a change in the franchise rules so that the industry could consolidate. A stand-alone LWT would look particularly exposed now that Carlton and MAI have grown so much bigger. With all possible white knights having seemingly fallen off their chargers, the battle boils down to a question of price. The market suggests Granada will have to raise its offer. The 10 per cent rise in LWT's January advertising revenue supports that view. Granada will surely try to squeeze a recommendation from LWT's board, but Granada's greater generosity still seems likely to fall short of LWT's evaluation of its own worth. Arguably, LWT's case has been bolstered by MAI's readiness to pay a price equivalent to 27 times Anglia's 1993 television earnings. But Anglia is a highly attractive television region with a growing and increasingly wealthy band of viewers. Its low franchise bid also ensures it retains a higher proportion of advertising revenue. Granada will find it hard to justify matching that multiple, especially given that LWT is so far removed from Granada's borders and only broadcasts two and a half days a week. A more modest 10 per cent increase in its offer may be sufficient to satisfy the market whether LWT approves or not.</p>

Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi returned from Tunis Thursday after talks  with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leadership. He  headed a seven-member team representing 120 Palestinian  officials and personalities who demanded democratic reforms  within the PLO structure and an end to PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat's "autocratric" decision-making style.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that during talks with the PLO  leadership and the Executive Committee, there has been a  positive response to the reformists' demands and he felt  satisfied with Mr. 'Arafat's support for the democratisation of  the PLO.    "I would say, in principle, in terms of matters of the depth  of awareness of our leadership, and of the people in general,  that the importance of democratising the structure of the PLO  and of adopting democracy in our political life as a whole have  been supported very much by the leadership," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi  told reporters.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held a meeting with around 60 reformists  at  the Palestine National Council (PNC) headquarters Saturday to  brief them on the outcome of the team's trip to Tunis.    He said the results of the team's talks with the PLO  leadership were "positive" and said: "Any talk about the  failure of our mission or any impression given that it was  negative would be inaccurate."    He said he felt there was response to the demands for reform  but not all demands as stated in a statement that was signed by  120 figures and sent to the leadership last month.    "I don't see any reason why reforms would not be  implemented.  However, reform is a long process," he said.    He alluded to the fact that Mr. 'Arafat remains to be the  only decision-maker in the PLO at this point and that the PLO's  democratic institutions and collective leadership bodies remain  inactive or dormant at this stage.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said the reformists submitted the  statement  again to the PLO leadership in Tunis and they provided it with  suggestions to implement reforms and democratisation. "There  was response to our demands, and the statement was endorsed by  the Executive Committee, but not all demands were accepted," he  added.    "Expanding the decision-making body and collective  leadership  cannot be done at this stage," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said. "It is  unacceptable that Abu-'Ammar ('Arafat) alone makes the  decisions."    Other members of the team felt satisfied with the fact that  the leadership had taken their movement seriously and accepted  to open a democratic deialogue with them in order to implement  changes. They are not under the illusion that reforms would  immediately take place, but they hope to remain a strong force,  working as an internal pressure group that would monitor the  leadership's actions and continue to call for democratisation  through popular pressure.    Popular insistence on carrying out elections in the occupied  territories was one way of achieving change, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi  said. "We will reject any delay to carrying out elections as  stated in the PLO-Israel accord."    "The democratic issue is not the decision of Abu-'Ammar  alone. It is a matter in which all the people should  participate." he said.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said the prospective popular dialogue that  will take place on a wide scale among Palestinians inside and  outside the occupied territories will also have an impact on the  leadership and allow for reforms. He was referring to a  decision by the PLO leadership approving a dialogue between all  Palestinian factions, inside and outside the framework of the  PLO, to work towards uniting the Palestinian people. Mr.  'Arafat designated Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi to initiate this dialogue  and Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi accepted.    Dr. 'Abd-al-shafi said that he found the spirit of the  Executive Committee "not rejectionist to our calls for  democratic reforms but not actively supportive. But I can say  our mission was successful."</p>

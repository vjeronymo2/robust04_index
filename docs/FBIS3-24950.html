The IFP  Information Centre's Ed Tillett said Thursday the unprovoked  attack came after six months of relative calm in the area. He  feared it could mark a resumption of "African National  Congress-spearheaded violence" and that Bruntville township  would once again be plunged into violence.    Police confirmed the shooting and believed AK-47 rifles were  used. Captain Henry Budhram said the men were on their way from  a Mooitex factory at about 10.40pm when bullets rained into the  vehicle.    Shot dead was Bethuel Phungula, 30, while William Dlamini,  30, was hit by four bullets, in the chest, knee, forearm and  thorax.    Alfred Dludla, 45, was hit in a lower leg and Jotham Lamula,  35, was struck in an upper arm and left eye. The wounded men are  in estcourt hospital.    No arrests have been made.</p>

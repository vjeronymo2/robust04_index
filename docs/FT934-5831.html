			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Distinctly upper crust - Philippa Davenport samples the foreign flavours on Britain's bread boards Britain might not be the gastronomic centre of Europe but it scores closer to the bullseye in one respect than many other EU neighbours - bread. Eating in hotels and restaurants on the continent, I have been struck by the omnipresence of side plates laid with cardboard cut-out rolls that bear no resemblance to real bread. They are lightweight, anaemic, textureless and tasteless. In Britain, however, any eating establishment with a mite of pride takes the trouble nowadays to welcome diners with a choice of increasingly good breads. Shopping for bread also has become fun and, for variety alone, Britain seems to have become the bread basket of Europe. Yet, sliced white was the norm less than 15 years ago; indeed, sliced white was the only bread on offer in many outlets - a fact so depressing that it prompted Michael Bateman and Caroline Conran to launch a campaign for real bread in the Sunday Times. Now, mills are being restored busily, village bakers are bouncing back and supermarket bakery sections are expanding faster than Chorleywood dough. The whiff of freshly baked bread wafts from in-store ovens and cash tills are ringing merrily. Lincolnshire plum bread, Irish soda bread, Scotch pancakes and barley bannocks are all selling well but, above all else, the trend is international. Look along the shelves and you will see loaves with claims to French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, Armenian, Russian, Indian and other foreign origins. Every week, newcomers swell the ranks of this bready tower of Babel. Only yesterday I spotted a label that made me laugh out loud: 'Mediterranean bread' imported from Canada. There is a lot of good bread in Britain now and a lot of absurdities. Some designer breads coming into the shops are a triumph of style over flavour. Parallel with all of this, interest in home baking is growing apace and two new books are devoted to the subject. One is The Complete Bread Book, by Gail Duff (Pavilion Pounds 17.99), sub-titled '150 traditional recipes from round the world.' Duff is a competent cook, noted for her wholefood and vegetarian writings. The other is The Bread Book, by Linda Collister and Antony Blake (Conran Octopus Pounds 9.99). It is sub-titled 'a step-by step guide to making over 130 delicious breads' and appeals more to me than Duff's, partly because it does not attempt to cast its net so wide. Blake is one of those photographers who is so good at illustrating the written word rather than seeking to dominate it. Collister is an accomplished baker and totally trustworthy as a recipe writer. She inspires confidence by virtue of her quiet, unflamboyant style and attention to detail. She always mixes and kneads doughs by hand 'because I enjoy it physically.' She accepts, though, that others may prefer to use a food mixer and a dough hook. Similarly, although she would always choose fresh yeast, she acknowledges that others may find dried yeast granules or easy-blend varieties more convenient. Accordingly, she has tested her recipes using these sorts of yeasts as well. Although the majority of breads in this book are raised with yeast, unleavened breads are included, too. There are also quick breads made with baking powder (or bicarbonate of soda plus cream of tartar or acidic liquids) and sourdough breads, the chemistry of which she found particularly exciting to crack. It is an appetising collection and a very practical guide to the gentle art of good home baking. FRENCH SOURDOUGH LOAF This is Collister's version of the crusty, chewy loaf made popular by the famous Poilane baking family in Paris. She warns that the tea towel lining the basket used to mould the loaf must be linen, not terry-cloth, dry and heavily-floured: if the dough sticks while rising, it can collapse when inverted onto the baking tray for cooking. She points out that the first two or three batches will taste good but will not rise as well or be as successful as later batches when the starter becomes established. The loaf is an excellent keeper and tastes better as it matures. It is best sliced thinly and should be eaten within one week. For the starter: 8 oz stoneground wholemeal bread flour; about 8 fl oz lukewarm water. For the sponge: 5 fl oz lukewarm water; 8 oz unbleached white bread flour. For the dough: 2 fl oz lukewarm water;  3/4 oz sea salt; about 8 oz unbleached white bread flour; extra flour for dusting. To make the starter, put the wholemeal flour in a small bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in the lukewarm water and mix to make a very thick batter. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave at room temperature for three days, re-dampening the towel each day so the batter absorbs the natural yeasts in the air. After three days, the starter should be smelly, grey and only slightly bubbly. To make the sponge, pour the starter into a large mixing bowl. Stir in the lukewarm water and add the white bread flour. Beat with your hand for about one minute to make a thick batter. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave at room temperature for 24-36 hours until it is spongy and slightly bubbly. The longer you leave the sponge, the more pronounced the taste will be. To make the dough, stir the sponged batter well. Beat in the remaining water and the salt, then mix in enough of the remaining white bread flour to make a soft but not sticky dough. Turn out the dough on to a lightly-floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes until firm and elastic. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise at normal temperature until almost doubled in size: eight-12 hours. Knock back the risen dough. Cut off 6-8 oz and set aside for making the next starter (see below). Shape the rest of the dough into a ball and put it into a round basket 9 in wide and 4 in deep that has been lined with a dry, heavily-floured tea towel. (Use a greased 2 lb loaf tin if you prefer, or place the ball of dough directly onto a baking tray). Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise at normal to warm room temperature until almost doubled in size: about eight hours. Subsequent batches may take less time. Pre-heat the oven to 220'C/425'F (gas mark 7). Invert the loaf in the basket onto the baking tray. Using a sharp knife, slash the top of the loaf four times. Do not drag the knife or the loaf may collapse. Sprinkle with flour. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 190'C/375F (gas mark 5) and bake for 35-55 minutes longer until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. To keep a starter for the next batch, put the reserved 6-8 oz portion of dough into a greased plastic bag and store in the fridge for up to three days, or leave the dough in a small bowl covered with a damp tea towel at normal room temperature for up to two days, re-dampening the towel each day. To use, start at the sponging stage in the recipe above; you will have to add a little extra lukewarm water to make a thick batter. Proceed with the recipe.</p>

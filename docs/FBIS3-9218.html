The government denies involvement in the sackings of 129  employees from the state radio earlier this month. They  included some of the most experienced and best known journalists  and editors.    With national elections only two months away, the dismissals  are widely seen as an attempt to stifle criticism of the  government and the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum which is  trailing in the polls.    The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists  has strongly criticised the sackings and says its report "will  be the basis of political action". Gustl Glatffelder, a radio  journalist from German Sudwestfunk and chairman of the  investigating committee, said: "Nobody could destroy our  impression that indeed political reasons were behind it.    "The government gave (the head of radio) $1.02 million  (700,000 pounds) to finance the firings. They can't say they  haven't been involved."    Helsinki Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, has  already  sent a letter to the prime minister, Peter Boross, "to express  concern about dangers to freedom of expression with respect to  state radio and television".    The acting head of radio Laszlo Csucs, insisted the firings  were to reduce the heavy overstaffing of state radio but he also  referred to "ethical and professional reasons".    Opposition parties have accused the government of crude  political manipulation of the media. But the nationalist  politician, Istvan Csurka, and his supporters have welcomed it  as the start of a long overdue political cleansing of former  communists from the state- owned media.    The government came under heavy criticism last autumn when  the acting head of television axed Channel Two's evening news  programme and suspended its staff. He accused them of  manipulating a news report.    Since 1990, parliament has failed to pass a media law to  regulate state broadcasting and distribute frequencies for  commercial stations. The heads of state radio and television  are government appointees.    The report from the International Federation of Journalists  comes at an embarrassing time for the government as it prepares  to submit its application for EU membership. "Evidently there  are limits to how far the government can go. There are signs we  are close to those limits, from the information we get from  international bodies," Silvano Presa, from the European  Commission delegation in Budapest, said.</p>

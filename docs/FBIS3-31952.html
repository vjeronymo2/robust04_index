			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz has told ACAN-EFE that today's  referendum to reform the Constitution of Guatemala is proceeding  normally and added that there have been no sabotage or attacks.    Three hours before the closure of voting centers at 1700  (2300 GMT), the minister pointed out that there is absolute  normalcy nationwide and added that voter turnout appears to be  low. Ortiz, as well as the magistrates of the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal (TSE), attributed the apparent abstentionism to  citizens fearful of possible explosions and bomb threats, of  which there were dozens in the past weeks.    The police reported that a grenade, which did not explode,  was found today inside an abandoned car in the capital. It is  not known when it was planted there. The police attributed the  explosions to the guerrillas who urged the people to abstain and  boycott the referendum.    Ortiz said that the police assigned to voting centers are  protecting 3.4 million citizens, more than a third of the  population. The Army, which stays away from voting centers, has  also guaranteed security along highways and at bridges and  towns, but men in uniform are virtually absent in the capital.    Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna also reported  absolute normalcy during the referendum that will approve or  reject 43 reforms to the Constitution. Among other things, they  would allow legislative elections within three months and the  replacement of members of the Supreme Court of Justice.    TSE Magistrate Marco Guerra told ACAN-EFE that terrorist  actions promoted abstentionism, which could reach 50 percent,  according to Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger.</p>

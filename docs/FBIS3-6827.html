Facing a series  of political setbacks at home such as failures to introduce a  new tax and to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, as well as being  linked to a money scandal, Hosokawa would have liked to score  big on the diplomatic front to revamp his plunging public image.    Since his three-day China trip came at a highly sensitive  time on the international front regarding North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear arms and U.S.-China relations  over human rights, Hosokawa did speak out on these matters,  going a step further than he had before.    He criticized North Korea in unusually harsh terms for  refusing to let inspectors from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) conduct full checks on its nuclear facilities and  stressed the urgency of the situation. He also broached the  delicate issue of China's human rights.    Hosokawa told reporters aboard a government plane back to  Tokyo on Monday [21 March] at the end of his three-day trip that  he was able to engage in "substantial and meaningful"  discussions with Chinese Premier Li Peng and President Jiang  Zemin. But he apparently fell short of gaining anything new  from the Chinese leadership.    In addition, Hosokawa's bluntness rather exposed differences  of positions between Japan and China.    When Hosokawa said the international community's patience in  coping with the problems of North Korea is "nearing its limit"  and cited the possibility of the matter being brought up at the  United Nations Security Council, the Chinese leaders only  reiterated their previous position that the matter should be  resolved through "patient negotiations." China's Foreign  Ministry said China disapproves of the matter being taken up by  the Security Council and that the issue should be settled  through dialogue by "parties concerned," namely, China, North  and South Korea, the United States and the IAEA.    Japan was not included in the list of "parties concerned."    Hosokawa, pressed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, also urged China to improve its human rights  record. But he did so in a low-key way by pointing out that  human rights are a "universal value" recognized by the  international community and by referring to a declaration  adopted at an international conference on human rights last June  in Vienna. He refused to comment on specific cases involving  the detention of pro-democracy activists.    Hosokawa, who has been trying to stress that his  administration represents a change from those of his  predecessors, also failed to go beyond earlier expressions of  regret for Japan's wartime responsibilities, despite indications  by government sources that he might cite specific cases -- such  as the Nanjing massacre and germ warfare experiments -- when  offering an apology.    In talks with the Chinese leaders, Hosokawa merely repeated  the line in a policy speech last August in which he expressed  "deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese  actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused  unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people."    The only time he said anything new was when he visited  Shanghai's Pudong economic development zone.    When Shanghai officials called for Japanese companies to set  up operations in the area, Hosokawa, using his experience as  governor of the southern Japan prefecture of Kumamoto, gave them  detailed advice on how to attract Japanese firms, such as making  promotional videos. His comments were welcomed by Shanghai  officials with vigorous nods.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> A judge in Dublin, Ireland has waived a marijuana conviction for U2 member Adam  Clayton, in exchange for the rock bassist's agreement to pay $34,500 to  charity. Justice Desmond Windle discharged Clayton, 29, on Friday. Clayton was  arrested Aug. 6 in the parking lot of a pub near his home. He admitted to  possession of marijuana, and prosecutors later dropped a charge that he planned  to supply the drug to others. Clayton, who was accompanied to the hearing by U2  manager Paul McGuinness and drummer Larry Mullen, refused to speak to reporters  outside the court. The fine will go to the Dublin Women's Aid and Refugee  Center. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Japanese issues slide on exchange intervention INTERVENTION in the foreign exchange markets on Friday to push up the yen in favour of the US dollar duly showed through in the Japanese government bond market yesterday. The short upward swing in bond yields, which had accompanied the weakening yen as the week progressed, turned down smartly again. From Friday's close of 5.345 per cent, the yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.30 per cent and turned immediately lower, touching 5.27 per cent before rebounding. The domestic front also provided more ammunition to keep bond market afficionados happy. The Nikkei index of leading Japanese stocks turned down sharply, to reach its lowest since the autumn of 1990. The closer to 20,000 the Nikkei gets, the greater the threat to the capital adequacy of Japanese banks, and the more the market expects an interest rate easing to be brought forward before the financial year-end at the end of March. Mr Kiichi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, whose comments on Friday signalled official confirmation the downturn in the economy was intensifying, further added to the mood with comments that recent wholesale prices had stabilised. As a further indication of the economic slowdown, bankruptcies in December were more than double those of December 1990. WEAK industrial production data helped to push the French government bond market ahead yesterday, in what was a quiet day for bond markets generally. Production figures for last November showed a 0.6 per cent decline. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond declined from 8.41 per cent to 8.36 per cent. The German government market firmed slightly, also in quiet trading. The market is focused on talks due today over the steelworkers' pay claim: failure to resolve the issue could lead to a vote for a strike in a ballot on Sunday, while a successful conclusion could give the government bond rally a new lease of life. Details were also announced of a four-year bund auction this Friday. Observers said demand for such medium-term paper had been high recently. A firmer pound gave greater confidence to the UK gilts market yesterday. In a quiet day, with only 12,000 futures contracts traded, the Liffe March contract firms from 97.17 to 97.23. Weak retails sales in December added to the mood of political uncertainty around the market. Provisional figures for the month showed a 1 per cent decline - but a change in the basis of calculation exaggerated this decline. Rather than helping the bond market, the news was taken as a sign of the forthcoming electoral difficulties of the Conservative party. The market was quiet ahead of today's announcement of details of the next gilt auction. US markets were closed for a public holiday.</p>

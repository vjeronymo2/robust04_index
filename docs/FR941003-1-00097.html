			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) should not be defined on the basis of land ownership or control and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may include Federal and non-Federal land;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) may include geographic areas subject to indirect effects that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of ``permit areas'' or construction ``footprints;''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) should include alternative locations for elements of the undertaking,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations where the undertaking may result in disturbance of the ground,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations from which elements of the undertaking may be visible (if that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is important in regard to the property's significance), and locations where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the undertaking may result in changes in land use, public access, traffic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patterns, and similar indirect effects; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) to the extent feasible, should consider potential cumulative effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from incremental impacts of the undertaking which, when added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, may result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in adverse effects on historic properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Programmatic actions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For undertakings involving the potential effects of a program on historic properties and historic and cultural values, the area of potential effects should consider the nature of the program as well as the nature of historic property types most likely to be affected by it. Planning information should be developed from knowledge of existing historic resources, interviews with persons with special expertise or knowledge,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and modeling to anticipate the full range of historic properties involved and likely effects attributable to the program. For example, a program to replace or rehabilitate bridges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout a State needs to consider not only likely bridge locations and the direct effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of abandonment in place, demolition or dismantling, relocation, rehabilitation work, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those bridges, but also any associated archaeological sites which could be damaged or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed with ground disturbing activities such as construction equipment storage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abutment repair, pavement approach reconstruction, or bank stabilization; any nearby or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrounding historic districts whose character would be altered by replacement, new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, or changes in historic access patterns; and historic traditional use areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peculiar to the region (such as fish weirs or traps) that may be located in the stream itself  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at or near a new bridge location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management and maintenance areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For undertakings involving the potential effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of land-use planning or maintenance practices for specific management units, such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national park, national forest, military installation, Federal office complex, or similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrete area, the area of potential effects should consider land uses, associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management needs, and the range of potential uses of historic properties, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature of maintenance requirements on particular historic property types. A planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document should establish procedures to satisfy Section 110 requirements which, among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other things, provide for long-term protection, enhancement, management and use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic properties and early consultation with Native Americans and other interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties. For example, a military installation resource management plan needs to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate use zones (cantonment or built-up area, vehicular or infantry training areas, firing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges and impact area, airfields, hazardous or toxic materials storage areas, high security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vs. public access areas, and other special use areas). The range of uses and possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of actions in each zone on historic structures, archaeological sites, traditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultural properties, and other types of resources will vary considerably, as will the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's long-term management responsibility for and procedures for dealing with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties under Section 110 and other statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For undertakings involving the potential effects of a specific federally-supported, -assisted, or -permitted action or series of actions such as new construction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation, or transfer out of Federal ownership, agencies should at a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguish between two groups of undertakings. The first includes relatively simple,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small-scale undertakings affecting limited land area and a small number of resources. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second includes more complex undertakings affecting large land areas, multiple resources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and involving complex jurisdictional matters or other potential points of controversy. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area of potential effects for an undertaking subject to preparation of an environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact statement under NEPA, defined as a ``major Federal action significantly affecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quality of the human environment,'' may necessarily involve numerous alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations or project designs, and will thus affect the level of effort necessary to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic properties subject to effect (see 36 CFR Sec. 800.8 and Appendix 1.C. below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope of identification of historic properties subject to effect. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Following determination of the area of potential effects appropriate to the undertaking, and coordinated with the preparation of any Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) under NEPA:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Agency Official should determine whether the area of potential effects has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyed or otherwise inspected to identify historic properties, and review available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to decide:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) the likelihood that historic properties exist within areas subject to effect, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their characteristics, numbers, and probable significance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the likelihood that such properties retain their historic, cultural, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> architectural integrity, given what is known about historic and recent modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of land or structures in the area; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) the nature and severity of effects reasonably expectable as a result of the type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of undertaking involved, including both effects that will occur as the immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the undertaking, or near the site of a specific undertaking, and those that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may occur at a later time or greater distance, provided the latter are reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreseeable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

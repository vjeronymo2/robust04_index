Since its arrival here on February 8, the Albanian  parliamentary delegation led by Mr. Arbnori met Bulgarian Deputy  Foreign Minister Todor Churov, Bulgarian Patriarch Maksim and  President Zhelyu Zhelev. Its meeting with Deputy Prime Minister  Evgeni Matinchev initially scheduled for today was not held.  The Albanian guests yesterday had talks with National Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and representatives of the four  parliamentary factions. The bilateral relations, the situation  in the Balkans and the project for the construction of the  east-west trunk road were high on the agenda of the meetings.    "The major thing is that there is not a single issue in the  bilateral relations we cannot settle. We are in favour of peace  in the Balkans, a just peace in agreement with the international  principles for observation of human rights, we are in favour of  promoting our economic, political and cultural contacts with  Bulgaria and bringing our countries closer by means of the  east-west trunk road that will link Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria  and Turkey," Mr. Arbnori said after his meeting with President  Zhelev. He also said that Albanian minister of transport and  communications, as well as Albania's President Sali Berisha will  visit Bulgaria some time soon.    Following a meeting at the Foreign Ministry, Deputy Foreign  Minister Churov and Mr. Arbnori said that the two countries  share identical views on the Yugo-war, based on support for a  peaceful solution to the conflict and prevention of its  spill-over. Voicing a serious concern over the condition of  Albanians in Kosovo, the Albanian People's Assembly chairman  underscored the need for observation of their human rights. Mr.  Churov said that the Bulgarian side has expressed its principled  stand on the observation of human rights and the status of  Kosovo and has stressed that Kosovo should be prevented from  turning into a bridge between the conflict already existing and  a large-scale Balkan war.    The Bulgarian side reiterated the stance it has adopted at  the very outbreak of the conflict: This country is against the  setting up of ethnically-based states, the transgressing of  existing borders and forcible territorial gains, Mr. Churov  said. He went on to say that, on the other hand, Bulgaria is  ready to accept decisions taken by the sovereign will of the  countries immediately involved in the conflict.    Commenting on his failed meeting with the deputy prime  minister, Mr. Arbnori explained with understanding that Mr.  Matinchev has been urgently summoned in parliament to attend a  closed-door sitting on the 1994 security and defence budget bill.    The Albanian guests met Bulgarian Patriarch Maksim at their  request. Speaking on the national radio, Bishop Neofit of  Lefkia quoted Mr. Arbnori as saying at the meeting that the  Albanian Orthodox Church seeks to maintain good contacts with  the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and is supportive of extending  grants to Albanian students to study at Bulgarian theological  schools. Patriarch Maksim is reported as expressing a hope that  the relations between the two Orthodox Churches will be further  promoted in the future.    Tomorrow the Albanian delegation will visit cultural and  historical sites in the countryside.</p>

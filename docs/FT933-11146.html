			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merck seeks a new drugs formula  -Richard Waters examines implications of the Medco takeover THERE are two ways of looking at the proposed takeover of Medco Containment Services, the US's biggest drugs distributor, by Merck, the country's (and the world's) largest manufacturer of pharmaceuticals. It could be a straight grab for market share by Merck in the face of fast-falling margins on prescription drug sales. Or it could be the beginning of a process of vertical integration in the healthcare field, leading to a more efficient delivery of drugs to users, bringing down overall healthcare costs and improving the effectiveness of treatments. There is no doubt which of these interpretation Mr Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, was putting on his company's Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco, announced on Tuesday. A revolution in drug provision is about to reshape the industry in the US and elsewhere, he said. The beneficiaries will be the users of drugs and the governments, corporations and others who are increasingly the ones who foot the bill. Hospital admissions which result from misuse of drugs, duplicate treatments and the prescribing of excessive dosages together waste around Dollars 15bn a year, Mr Vagelos said. By creating a closer link between the patients, doctors, hospitals, pharmaceuticals companies and the people who pay for drugs, the Merck/Medco link would make the provision of drugs more efficient. Medco's contribution: a database on customers and drugs usage which is unrivalled and which would take Merck years to duplicate, said Mr Vagelos. Merck's vaunted claims for the takeover were directed in part at Washington, which could yet decide that the takeover violates anti-trust law. They also reflect an attempt to reassure two other powerful groups: Merck's competitors, whose willingness to supply drugs to Medco at discounted rates have accounted in part for that company's success, and Medco's customers, who rely on the distributor to find them the most suitable and cheapest products in the market, whoever the manufacturer. The market for anti-ulcer drugs could provide a litmus test for the future. A Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn market in the US, it is dominated by Glaxo's Zantac, which accounts for Dollars 1.5bn of the sales. SmithKline Beecham has its own contender, Tagamet, which sells Dollars 500m a year, while Eli Lilly has Axid, whose sales reach Dollars 150 to Dollars 200m. Merck's own drug in this category, Pepcid, has sales of Dollars 400m. Will Pepcid now become the standard anti-ulcer drug recommended by Medco? And will Glaxo and others take pre-emptive action by reducing the discounts they give Medco on their products? Both sides expect Medco's buying of Merck products to rise from its current Dollars 250m a year (or 9 per cent of Medco's total purchases.) Any increase, though, will result not from a desire to push Merck drugs, but from the fact the link-up would lead to Merck drugs becoming better designed, or better priced, to suit Medco customers, said Mr Martin Wygod, the distributor's chairman. The stock market's interpretation of Tuesday's announcement was rather more down to earth than the vision outlined by Mr Vagelos. By paying Dollars 6bn, Merck was diluting its earnings per share by 6 to 7 per cent, analysts said. The market was less clear about the benefits of integration, and a share price fall of Dollars 1 3/8 on Tuesday was followed by another Dollars  1/4 yesterday, to Dollars 30 1/2 at the close. The prices of all the big US pharmaceutical groups also lost ground on the news, which seemed to threaten an extra twist to the price war which has hit pharmaceutical company shares in recent months. Pressure on drugs prices - caused not by the proposed health care reforms of the Clinton administration, but by a push by big drugs buyers to cut their bills - has driven pharmaceutical companies' shares down in recent months. Discounts of up to 25 per cent are becoming familiar. According to Mr Viren Mehta, an analyst at New York-based Mehta and Isaly, some Dollars 4bn of Merck's sales come from six big products. Each competes with similar drugs from other companies (in the jargon of the industry, they are 'me-too' drugs') and so is vulnerable to severe discounting. A 25 per cent cut in these sales would wipe Dollars 1bn off Merck's turnover. Meanwhile, the shares of other drugs distributors rose on the news, buoyed by a belief other big manufacturers would feel impelled to protect their distribution channels. The trouble is, Medco stood head and shoulders above its competition: it is estimated to account for half the market in mail-order sales, and to account for as much as 10 per cent or more of all bulk-buying of drugs. Both competitors and customers were digesting the news yesterday. Big customers like General Electric said it was too early to say whether they would need to reconsider their links with Medco. Competitors, meanwhile, complained privately of the arrangement - though any retaliatory action would damage their own businesses, cutting them off from one the US's biggest distributor.</p>

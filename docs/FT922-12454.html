			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Triple-witching hour lifts Dow to new high Wall Street AFTER five days of solid gains, US stock markets appeared to be running out of steam on Thursday, although late buying linked to the expiration of stock index options and futures lifted shares to new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.74 at 3,366.50, having spent all but the last few minutes of the day's trading only a few points either side of opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended lower, down 0.27 at 416.01, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks gave up 8.32 at 591.81. Turnover on the NYSE was 235m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 899 to 817. Although the day's main economic data - an unexpectedly large 18,000 fall in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance in the first week of April - was positive, the news provided little inspiration for the market, which had begun to look overbought after a 172-point advance during the week. The late surge in blue chip prices was due entirely to an imbalance of buy orders linked to 'triple-witching hour', the monthly expirations of derivatives contracts which were brought forward because of the Easter holidays. When the orders were completed at the close, about 10 points were added to the Dow. General Motors featured with a gain of Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 in turnover of 4m shares on reports that the giant car manufacturer might post a modest profit for the first quarter. GM lifted the other car stocks, with Ford adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 42 and Chrysler firming Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 3/4 , both in heavy trading. Once again the big, cyclical stocks enjoyed some of the biggest gains. Alcoa rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 76 5/8 , United Technologies jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 56, General Electric added Dollars 1 at Dollars 79 and Allied-Signal rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 . On the over-the-counter market, Centocor again took a beating, losing Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 16 in turnover of 9m shares as investors continued to react negatively to the news that the Food and Drug Administration would not approve the company's Centoxin drug for the treatment of septic shock. Centocor's problems spread to other bio-tech stocks. Somatogen ended down Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 21 1/4 , Biogen slipped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 , Immunex fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25 1/2 and Amgen finished down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 57. The big computer technology stocks also gave up ground, with Microsoft, Wednesday's best performer, falling Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 127 5/8 , Intel dropping Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 and Apple closing Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 59. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed on Thursday as trading slowed before the three-day weekend. The TSE-300 composite index rose 3.8 to 3,415.1. Declines led advances by 270 to 260 on volume of 20.2m shares valued at CDollars 249m.</p>

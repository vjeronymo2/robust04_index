			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Oleg Velichko and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Leader of the Yavlinskiy-  Boldyrev-Lukin faction and economist Grigory Yavlinskiy  suggested a program of emergency measures against the inflation  and production recession at a news conference at the State Duma  today.    He informed correspondents of a forecast, according to which  the inflation may run out of control by fall 1994 to reach 50  per cent and the production recession may be equal to 52 per  cent of the 1989 level. 1989 was the last year of production  increase.    Speaking of priority measures against the inflation, namely  a  possibility to control the inflation at a level of 20 per cent  in 1994, Grigory Yavlinskiy stressed the need to bring the  dollar exchange rate in correspondence with the inflation  dynamics. He said the government should be responsible for the  exchange rate dynamics, which means the soonest conclusion of  futures deals on sales of hard currency at a certain exchange  rate.    The economist warned the government against the policy of  easy- term credits and direct subsidies. He said they should  immediately lower the interest rate under administrative  regulation of the credit amount.    Another priority is crucial changes of a policy on benefits  for exporters. He said Russia cannot allow hard currency to  flow abroad. He said 15 billion dollars flew abroad in 1993  alone.    He offered the government to cancel the tax on exchange rate  difference and said everyone having hard currency accounts  should not pay for the inflation, for which they carry no direct  responsibility. Yavlinskiy said the cancellation of this tax  may help to prevent money outflow.    The economist suggested to free statistics bodies from  government control.    Yavlinskiy told ITAR-TASS his faction is ready to form a  government capable of fulfilling this program within eight to  nine months.</p>

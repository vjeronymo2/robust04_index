			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the Joint Staff  Council and currently advisor to the Defense Agency [DA], spoke  at a lecture in Tokyo on 19 January, indicating Japan needs to  reexamine the current situation regarding the principle of  civilian control. He said this needs to be done as part of an  overall review of Japan's defense program which the government  has embarked on, primarily focusing on a review of the "National  Defense Program Outline" [NDPO]. Expressing his thoughts on the  issue, Sakuma stated: "Basically, Self-Defense Force [SDF]  officials should have control over unit operations and over  educating and training personnel." Concerning studies on legal  problems with regard to legislation for emergency situations,  Sakuma added: "Japan should now begin sufficiently studying how  it can cooperate indirectly with the U.S. military should an  emergency occur on the Korean peninsula."    On 1 January Sakuma became the first among former SDF  officers to be appointed a DA advisor at the recommendation of  Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of the DA, and  others. He is also considered to be one of the favorable  candidates for a panel which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  plans to establish for reviewing the NDPO. Consequently, his  remarks are expected to create a stir.    Concerning civilian control, Sakuma said: "There were valid  reasons when the two laws on defense (DA Establishment Law and  SDF Law) were enacted, so it could not be helped." However, he  insisted the SDF should have control over its own operations,  saying: "There should be both a military command and a military  administration." He also stressed role-sharing, adding: "The DA  (internal division) would take care of administrative duties  related to defense and act as a contact point with politics."    In connection with studies regarding legislation for  emergency situations, Sakuma pointed out that "a situation where  only Japan would be attacked is inconceivable." On the premise  of a military confrontation on the Korean peninsula, Sakuma  stressed: "Since Japan and the ROK would be involved, Japan  cannot remain idle if the United States responds to the  situation. We are at a time when it is necessary to conduct  preparatory studies on emergency situations which may develop  outside of Japan." Concerning collective defense, Sakuma said:  "I do not object to it, but I feel it is necessary to cut  current restrictions to a reasonable level."    Regarding the Japanese-U.S. Security Treaty, Sakuma cited  the  issue of a "one-sided alliance," saying: "So far the SDF has  concentrated on building its own defense capabilities, but now  it has become important to use such capabilities correctly. It  ought to be that Japan can support the U.S. military." He thus  stressed the need to conclude an agreement with the United  States on having Japan provide logistic support and labor for  which the United States would pay.    Sakuma summarized his recommendations as follows: 1)  reexamine the two laws on defense; 2) expand studies on legal  problems with regard to legislation for emergency situations;  and 3) formulate regulations governing the action of SDF.  Concerning review of the NDPO, Sakuma said: "If a valid system  were to be established regarding mobilization during emergencies  and reserve forces, I believe active manpower can be cut back in  times of peace. However, it is important to strengthen the SDF  so it can exist independently in its own right."    Sakuma held his lecture at a meeting of the "Japan National  Defense Association" -- a foundation under DA jurisdiction --  with former Soichiro Ito, former DA director general, as  chairman. Among the audience were DA officials and senior SDF  officials.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / All eyes on gap left by Moreira: Prospects for Brazil's economy THROUGHOUT yesterday, Mr Itamar Franco, Brazil's acting president, received a procession of state governors and leaders from most of the country's 17 parties in Congress, all wanting a say in policy and the appointment of ministers. The gap everyone is watching is that left by Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, newly resigned as economy minister. The current economy super-ministry is expected to be split into at least two parts, with a new ministry for industry and commerce. This would be warmly received by the powerful Sao Paulo business community, which feels not enough attention has been paid to this area. The remainder may be further divided into finance and planning ministries. The new minister is expected to come from the south, where Brazil's wealth is concentrated, quite possibly from Sao Paulo, and may be a businessman rather than a politician. Even so, Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the new foreign minister, said last night that the new economy minister would have to be someone who could 'pedal his bicycle through Congress', meaning there was a need for a person with good connections to a body in the ascendant now that it has asserted itself against the executive. The name of the sixth person to try running the economy in six years will give a clue to how Mr Franco intends to rescue Brazil from three years of recession, rising unemployment, an unmanageable budget, and monthly inflation of more than 23 per cent. Names being mooted include Mr Jose Serra, a leading Sao Paulo economist from the social democratic PSDB and an advocate of an independent central bank. Another possibility is Mr Jorge Gerdau, head of the largest private steel group in South America. Mr Franco has had little time to formulate his ideas. He has no party and no programme, but yesterday some things were becoming clear. Mr Pedro Simon, a senator and leading aide to Mr Franco, ruled out a widely rumoured economic shock plan. Instead, the new government is expected to take advantage of its wide-ranging coalition of support to try to implement a wage and price policy through a series of sector-wide pacts involving federal and state governments, business and unions, and to push through Congress an emergency tax reform. Through this, Mr Franco hopes to win some leeway to reduce interest rates from about 33 per cent a month, which are crippling industry and bringing investment to a standstill, and to try to resuscitate the government budget. This is in a parlous state, particularly after the inducements handed out by Mr Collor's lieutenants in recent weeks to try to swing Congress members' impeachment vote the president's way. The planned fiscal reform, expected to be announced in the next few days, is likely to focus on simplification of the complex tax system, introduce a stop-gap tax on financial transactions, and crack down on tax evaders. More controversial points, such as the revenue split for the federal government and the states, will probably be left for next year. Under Mr Collor, the Brazilian economy has been painfully abandoning the import substitution model, starting to open itself to the world and to cut red tape. In his two and a half years in office, Mr Collor made astonishing progress, creating a consensus in society behind previously heretical ideas such as privatisation, competition and the inflow of foreign products. Mr Franco's aides insist that the modernisation programme will continue, if with modifications. But yesterday, lobbyists from FIESP, the powerful Sao Paulo business federation, were in action, hoping for a slowdown on the tariff reduction timetable and for suspension of the next round of cuts, due today. Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the PMDB, Brazil's largest party, says: 'There is no reason for preoccupation over the modernisation programme. On the contrary, it will run much more smoothly as we will have far more competence to implement it.' Differences could come in the privatisation programme, where there is strong pressure to abandon the system under which companies are sold in exchange for domestic debt, known as 'rotten money', in favour of a short-term debt or a cash-only system. Mr Eduardo Modiano, Mr Collor's head of privatisation, argues that there is not enough cash available in the market and that using privatisation proceeds to fund current expenditure would deter people from implementing fiscal reform: 'It would be like selling your car to go to Disneyland for a month, having a fine time, and then returning to find that your outgoings are still more than your salary.' Mr Franco has given strong indications that he will pay more attention to social problems and improving Brazil's appalling income distribution gap - the greatest in the world, according to the World Bank - which resulted from the country's post-war economic development model. One of Mr Franco's most urgent problems will be to renegotiate with the International Monetary Fund targets of an agreement signed in January. Although Brazil has persistently failed to meet them, and thus drawn down only the initial tranche, the IMF has kept the agreement on hold.</p>

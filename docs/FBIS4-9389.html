			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, April 25 (AFP) -- The French Government on  Monday [25 April] ordered its helicopter crews involved in the  evacuation of wounded people from Gorazde to refuse to submit to  Bosnian Serb identity controls, the Foreign Ministry said. The  restrictions on helicopter flights put in place by the Serbs are  unacceptable, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna,  said here. "We have therefore asked the French helicopter crews  making these missions to refuse," these controls, she said.    "The French authorities note that UN Security Council  Resolution 913 demands an immediate and definite lifting of all  blockages on the free circulation of UNPROFOR," (the UN  Protection Force) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colonna added. Flights  by British and French UN helicopters between Gorazde and  Sarajevo were delayed again Monday by the Serbs.    According to the office of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) -- struggling to save the most seriously  wounded people in Gorazde -- travelling times have been  quadrupled by Serb controls. The delays were fatal for the most  seriously wounded patients at Gorazde hospital, an aid worker  said at Sarajevo.    Of the 600 due for emergency evacuation, 154 have been  evacuated from Gorazde since Sunday. Sixty nine people were  evacuated Monday up to the middle of the afternoon. [passage  omitted]</p>

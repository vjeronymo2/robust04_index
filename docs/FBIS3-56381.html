			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1200 GMT on 14 January broadcasts a report by Anton Grishin  on the news conference given by Ukraine President Leonid  Kravchuk at Ukraine's Embassy in Moscow today, which contains  recorded remarks by Kravchuk.    Kravchuk says: "I would like to express my satisfaction that  people have shown understanding of Ukraine's situation and have  not simply tried to force it to agree -- I really did not want  to use this expression, but it is being used in some political  circles -- I mean the idea of exerting pressure, of forcing  Ukraine to agree. We insisted all the way through that people  should understand our situation, our position, and we achieved  this without damaging other states' interests; on the contrary,  in a way beneficial to other states."    Grishin summarizes the agreements signed today, and adds:    "Leonid Kravchuk denied outright information that Ukraine is  to receive $1 billion in compensation for the uranium deal. As  for the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, the leader of Ukraine  said that Moscow and Kiev can settle the issue in a way that  takes account of both sides' interests, and that Ukraine is  ready for dialogue."</p>

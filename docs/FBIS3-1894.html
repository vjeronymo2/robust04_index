			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Qianli (1728 0578 6849)] </F>   [Excerpts] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Physical  Culture and Sports Commission held a tea party this afternoon at  Beijing's Shoudu Stadium to warmly welcome the Chinese sports  delegation which participated in the 17th Winter Olympic Games.  On behalf of the State Council, Li Tieying, state councilor and  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, attended the tea  party and congratulated the skillful Chinese winter sports  athletes who achieved good results at the games. [passage  omitted]    Speaking at the meeting, Comrade Li Tieying pointed out:  China's winter sports started relatively late. It only  developed and made great progress during the 15 years since  reform and opening up. Reluctant to be left behind, coaches and  athletes have continued to forward new goals as well as strived  to achieve them. These are exactly the characteristics in New  China's sports: work hard, keep forging ahead, and vie for the  nation's glory. [passage omitted]    He pointed out: It was not easy for the Chinese delegation  to obtain such results from a field of strong competitors at the  Winter Olympic Games. The spirit of unity and arduous struggle  they demonstrated was even more valuable. The unfair practice  [bu gong zheng zuo fa 0008 0361 2973 0254 3127] of obvious and  intentional shielding [ming xian di you yi tan hu 2494 7359 4104  2589 1942 5917 6233] of one side while accusing [ze nan 6307  7181] the other occurred in the short-track speed skating  competition. It aroused the righteous indignation [yi fen 5030  2001] of all fair-minded people while toughened and tested the  Chinese team. Zhang Yanmei overcame difficulty, triumphed over  disturbances, did well from start to finish to complete her  competition, and won a silver medal, winning praises from public  opinion.    Finally, Li Tieying expressed hope that China's winter  sports  athletes would earnestly sum up their experiences and lessons to  find out where they lag behind others, and address existing  problems. They should emancipate their minds; deepen reform;  boldly explore and innovate; draw on the experiences of nations  strong in winter sports and combine them with China's own  characteristics; seize opportunities; determine their  directions; implement outlined measures; and strive for progress  so as to achieve "zero" breakthrough in their quest for gold  medals in the next Winter Olympic Games.    Wu Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports  Commission, as well as He Zhenliang, Yuan Weimin, Xu Yinsheng,  and Liu Ji, vice ministers of the commission, also attended the  tea party and affirmed the Chinese delegation's achievements.  They pointed out the athletes' inadequacies and encouraged them  to strive for greater improvement and for the country's glory in  the future.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Auctioneer's shadow falls over Bull - The French computer maker's uncertain future The man in the red jacket bid FFr3,000 (Dollars 500) for the laser barcode machine. The woman in the blue jumper bought the chairs. Piece by piece, the contents of Groupe Bull's computer plant in Villeneuve D'Ascq on the outskirts of Lille in northern France were sold off to a packed auction room of businessmen and the local public. The closure of the Bull plant and last week's auction of its entire contents demonstrates the struggle faced by the French state-owned computer group as it seeks to restructure. The factory, designed to produce 550,000 computers each year, never achieved the target and failed to break even. Bull's mounting losses, which have exceeded FFr15bn over the past four years, and the government's order that it must stem the flow of red ink in preparation for privatisation, meant the plant could no longer be supported. If the fate of the plant has now been sealed, the moment of truth is fast approaching for the group as a whole. A recovery plan, finalised by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman, is due to be presented to Brussels within a few days. Failure of the plan, or its rejection by the European Commission, which has frozen FFr2.5bn of state aid to the company and is investigating a further FFr7bn injection pledged last year, could push Bull the way of its factory. Mr Descarpentries' recovery strategy, drawn up since he took over the group in October, is based on several elements. The principal ingredients include a reorganisation of the group's divisions to increase efficiency and productivity and to enable greater responsiveness to customers, a series of cost-cutting measures, and plans to privatise the group as quickly as possible. On the first count, Mr Descarpentries has split the group's operations into separate profit centres. Reporting procedures have been tightened and simplified and accountability has been increased. The performance of each of the group's six product and service divisions is to be assessed at the end of June. Those which fall short of expectations will face management changes, according to the Bull chairman. Costs are to be cut by the reduction of staff numbers and administrative charges. A plan to reduce the company's headcount by 6,500 in 1993 and 1994 is to be completed by the end of June when a decision will be taken on further job cuts. The company's 24 sites in Paris are to be combined into just two main offices, creating annual savings of about FFr530m. It is in the privatisation plans, however, that Mr Descarpentries is proposing some of his boldest steps. He says the state's 76 per cent shareholding could be reduced to below 50 per cent this year as a result of increased shareholdings by employees and the sale of a stake of between 15 and 20 per cent of the group to an industrial partner. Mr Descarpentries says that talks are under way with potential investors. Candidates include NEC of Japan, which already holds 4.4 per cent of Bull and which works with Bull on several joint projects, including the development of mainframe business computers. The sale of a substantial stake in the French computer group to a foreign company would be politically sensitive, but could receive the blessing of Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, who has set a target of two years for Bull to move to the private sector. A deepening of the alliance between Packard Bell of the US and Bull's Zenith Data Systems personal computer operation is also a possibility. Partners will only be enticed, however, if there is some prospect of a return on their investment. Bull's record of failed recovery plans, the severity of competition in the international PC market and the scale of the changes which need to be wrought at the French group, demonstrated by losses last year of FFr3.42bn, place a heavy burden of persuasion on the Bull chief. He argues that it is possible to return Bull to profit during 1995 and that this can be achieved without a fire sale of loss making businesses. 'We must break the vicious circle of closing operations and losing sales.' He points to some encouraging signs. January sales were up by 23 per cent, year on year. Even ZDS, the source of much of the company's losses since it was acquired in 1989, is experiencing an improvement in trading results, the company says. The increased concentration on services and consultancy activities will, according to Bull, increase its presence in higher value added business. If enticing industry partners will be hard, persuading Brussels to accept Bull's recovery plan could be even more difficult. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, has indicated he will take a tough line, demanding proof of a viable recovery plan. If the capital increase does go through it is sure to be for the last time. For Mr Descarpentries, therefore, the stakes could not be higher. All of his proposals, from improving productivity to the search for industrial partners, must fit together. Failure on any of the fronts of his battle plan could spell disaster.</p>

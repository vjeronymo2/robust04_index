			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian gold deposit written off PLACER DOME, the Vancouver-based gold producer, has decided to write off the Mt Milligan deposit and take other write-downs totalling CDollars 397m (Pounds 190m), thus acknowledging that it greatly overpaid for its interests in some of Canada's most highly publicised mineral discoveries. Two-thirds of the charge, or CDollars 266m, reflects the Mt Milligan write-off. Placer has also halved the CDollars 106m carrying value of its 22 per cent stake in the Eskay Creek gold property, also in British Columbia. The company now appears to be putting its faith in a new discovery in Nevada. Mr Fraser Fell, Placer's chairman, said yesterday that the company hopes to build an open-pit mine on the Nevada deposit, known as the Pipeline project, 'within a few years.' The deposit, which is part of the Cortez joint venture in north-central Nevada, contains an estimated 2.7m troy ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.237 ounces per tonne. Placer has a 60 per cent stake in the project. Placer has affirmed its intention to maintain or increase its gold output, which reached a record 1.68m ounces last year. But Mr John Lydall, analyst at First Marathon Securities, said yesterday that 'management has a huge job to do to continue to replace ore reserves'. Placer bought the Mt Milligan property just over a year ago. It has now shelved plans to build a mine there, saying that returns would be insufficient to justify the CDollars 500m to Dollars 600m capital investment. It would require a gold price above USDollars 400 a troy ounce to make the project viable. Last night gold closed in London at Dollars 356.30. Recent drilling at the site has led the company to cut its estimate of gold grades from 0.017 to 0.013 ounces a tonne. Its estimate of the copper grade has risen from 20 per cent to 22 per cent. Placer said that, should Mt Milligan be developed in the future, its annual output would average 100m lb of copper and 250,000 ounces of gold over a 12-year life. Placer said the Eskay Creek writedown reflects a cut in the estimate of mineable reserves of gold and silver since it acquired its interest in mid-1990. The estimate has been lowered from 4.5m to 3.1m ounces of gold equivalent, and the mine is now expected to be an underground rather than open pit operation. Placer has taken smaller writedowns on its 64 per cent interest in the Paymaster gold property near Timmins, Ontario; its Dona Lake mine in Ontario; and its wholly-owned Sigma mine in Quebec.</p>

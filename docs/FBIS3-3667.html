Drawing on a wealth of accurate historical data and on the  situation in the 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, the book offers a rather extensive  and systematic exposition on the process of initiating and  developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and on the theory's basic contents and  innovative contributions. It also specifically analyzes the  historical process of reform, opening up, and modernization in  contemporary China, depicting the basic form of socialism with  Chinese characteristics which is currently being practiced.    The book also discusses Deng Xiaoping's role as an architect  and leader in various fields of work undertaken by China to  promote reform, opening up, modernization, development,  political stability, and reunification of the motherland. It  analyzes Deng Xiaoping's realistic and innovative ways of  thinking in philosophical terms, extensively describing the  chief architect's historical status and tremendous  contributions. The book is yet another compelling work by Wen  Lequn, a professor at the People's University of China,  following the publication of his book "The Early Life of Deng  Xiaoping" last year.</p>

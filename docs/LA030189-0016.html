			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION I BASKETBALL SEMIFINALS;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO HAS ENOUGH TO ADVANCE  </P> <P> In a jigsaw puzzle, a tree with a missing piece is still as tree, just not as  aesthetically pleasing.  </P> <P> In basketball, a team with one of its top scorers out is still a team, just not  as effective.  </P> <P> In Tuesday night's Division I boys' basketball semifinal at Torrey Pines -- in  which San Diego defeated Valhalla, 79-67 -- all personnel were accounted for  but not present.  </P> <P> Never mind, said San Diego Coach Dennis Kane. What matters is the kids on the  court when it counts.  </P> <P> "I'm tired of talking about the kids who are playing and the kids who aren't  playing," he said.  </P> <P> Who was playing: Clark James and Milton Miller for San Diego and Tony Clark for  Valhalla. Clark finished with a game-high 35 points. James had a team-high 26  points and Miller added 21.  </P> <P> Who didn't play: Rafid Kiti for Valhalla and Raynard Wells for San Diego.  Earlier in the day, Kiti suffered a collapsed lung, a condition that kept him  out of six games in the regular season before he helped the Norsemen reach the  round of four.  </P> <P> Wells has been ailing academically and has been ineligible since early  February.  </P> <P> Kane admitted that Kiti's presence would have made for a closer game.  </P> <P> "With Kiti there, it's a different story, but we just had more then they did  tonight."  </P> <P> Valhalla played with San Diego in the first quarter but then fell further  behind as the clocked ticked away.  </P> <P> The Cavers pushed a 17-14 lead after one quarter to 37-32 at the half.  </P> <P> Any kind of a Valhalla comeback was then stifled by James (who scored four  consecutive times for the Cavers to push them in front, 45-38 with 4:20  remaining in the third) and Miller (whose four baskets in a row early in the  fourth gave San Diego a 66-55 lead before Valhalla called a timeout with 4:23  left).  </P> <P> "When we started hitting," James said, "I knew we could keep it up. Coach said  with their 2-3 zone, we could get any shot off we wanted. And we did."  </P> <P> "I don't make any excuses," Valhalla Coach Manny Silva said. "Miller and James  were unbelievable tonight. I didn't feel that they outplayed us though."  </P> <P> Miller said he almost wished Kiti had been there. "I think it would have been a  real great game if he had played." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli warplanes staged several sorties over the  south this morning, specifically over the al-Nabatiyah and the  Iqlim al-Tuffah areas. They staged two mock raids at low  altitude and broke the sound barrier.    The eastern hills and the outskirts of Kafr Rumman came  under  heavy machine-gun fire at 0800 today from the Israeli forces'  positions in al-Dabshah.    In the central sector, the outskirts of the town of Yatar  came under intensive machine-gun fire at midnight last night  while the sky overhead was lit by flares.    In the Marj 'Uyun area, an agent Lahd [South Lebanese Army]  unit combed with machine-gun fire the main road that links Marj  'Uyun with the Zumarayya crossing point and that passes through  the al-Khiyan junction and the Nab' al-Hasbani.    According to information received from the occupied strip,  the SLA command interrogated a number of its members following  the explosion of a device under one of its patrols at the  entrance to Marj 'Uyun three days ago. The explosion killed  recruit Faris Ilyas Jabbur from Kawkaba and injured another.</p>

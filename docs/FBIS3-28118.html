Takemura told a press  conference, "it may be difficult for the government to decide on  the contents of the package by the end of the day."    The ruling coalition is split over whether or not to  introduce a new national welfare tax to finance the planned tax  reduction, the focus of the economic pump-primer reportedly  worth 15 trillion yen, the largest ever.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force in the  coalition, is dead-set against the proposal and has threatened  to withdraw its officials from the cabinet if the government  pushes ahead with the plan.    Takemura also said the Democratic Socialist Party, another  component of the coalition, urged Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa to give up the new tax idea and give further debate to  the issue on how to offset the tax cut.    A government source said Hosokawa is unlikely to rethink his  decision on the proposal. "The prime minister is determined. I  don't think he will change his mind," said the source.</p>

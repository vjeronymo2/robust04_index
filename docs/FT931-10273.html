			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News in Brief SUEZ, one of France's oldest industrial groups, and Pinault, the fast-expanding retail concern, yesterday refused to comment on reports that they are negotiating a cross-shareholding agreement, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The two companies, according to a report in yesterday's edition of Liberation newspaper, have for months been secretly discussing a deal whereby Suez would take a 22 per cent stake in Pinault in return for buying the latter's treasury stock and for ceding 5 per cent of its own shares. Pinault, which is trying to raise capital to reduce the debts incurred in its recent acquisitions, said it had 'absolutely no comment' to make on the issue. Suez, an old-established force in French finance and industry under pressure because of the Paris property crisis, also declined to comment. However, a Suez spokesman did not deny that the group was in discussions with Pinault. ***** SOCIETE COMMERCIALE de Reassurances, France's largest reinsurance group, is diversifying by buying a 20 per cent stake in Coface, the state-controlled overseas export credit guarantee agency. ***** ELF AQUITAINE, the French state-controlled oil group, is on course for a return to profits growth in 1993 according to Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent, chairman. The group's 1992 net profits are estimated to have fallen by 35 per cent from 1991's FFr9.8bn (Dollars 1.78bn) due to the weakness of the US dollar and lower oil prices.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: Lesson not learned on stocks Sir, Your report, 'More heavy job cuts expected soon at Daf' (March 16), of impending further job losses at Leyland Daf mentions the unacceptably high stock levels found by the receivers. Sophisticated organisations in both manufacturing and retailing sectors learned long ago the importance of obliging their suppliers to make deliveries 'just in time'. That Leyland Daf's management appears to have failed in this respect is a sad comment on its competence and justification for complaint by the workforce. It would be interesting to know what over-stocking arose from the import of components from the parent company and its overseas subsidiaries.

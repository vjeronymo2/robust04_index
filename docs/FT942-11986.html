			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / IBM to shake up PC side International Business Machines is to change the senior management of its Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.5bn) personal computer business which is facing intense competition. The changes come at a critical time for IBM's PC business, where sales rose 40 per cent last year to achieve a 12 per cent share of the worldwide market, according to market analysts. However, IBM is believed to have lost ground to Compaq Computer in the first quarter. Mr Robert Corrigan, president of IBM PC, who led a restructuring of the PC business that has led to a strong resurgence in sales, will retire. His responsibilities for running IBM Personal Computer go to Mr Richard Thoman, a former Nabisco International and American Express marketing executive who joined IBM last year. Mr Thoman's career moves have followed those of Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who also formerly worked at RJR Nabisco and American Express. Mr Thoman will now be responsible for the IBM PC company; the Power Personal Systems division, which is developing a generation of PCs based on IBM's microprocessor technology; and IBM's printer divisions. In other management changes, IBM assigned worldwide responsibilities to senior executives for marketing, product development and finance. Previously, these duties had been divided along geographic lines.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOCIALIST NAMED INDIA'S NEW PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> A socialist leader was named as India's new prime minister today and said his  government faces a "grim and challenging" task to quell widespread unrest that  helped topple his predecessor.  </P> <P> Chandra Shekhar, who led efforts to unseat Vishwanath Pratap Singh as prime  minister, pledged that his government will seek "to create a society of equals"  in a nation where thousands have died this year in battles over religious,  ethnic and class differences.  </P> <P> The clashes were used to rally opposition against Singh, the first Indian prime  minister to be ousted by Parliament. He lost a confidence vote Wednesday. The  63-year-old Chandra Shekhar is expected to be sworn in by President Ramaswami  Venkataraman on Saturday.  </P> <P> "In all humility, I would like to say that the task before us is arduous,"  Chandra Shekhar said. "It is so grim and challenging. But one has to make every  endeavor to retrieve the situation."  </P> <P> At least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in Hindu-Muslim riots  over a 460-year-old mosque that some Hindus claim was built on a site sacred to  the warrior god Rama. Hindus seek to raze the mosque in Ayodhya in northeast  India and build a temple.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at least 150 upper-caste students have committed suicide or died in  clashes with police to protest Singh's attempt to reserve more government jobs  for low-caste Hindus.  </P></p>

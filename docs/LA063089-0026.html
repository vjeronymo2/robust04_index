			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA SPRINTER PLANS TO ATTEND UCLA  </P> <P> Jeff Ingalls of Agoura High, third-place finisher in the 400 in the state track  and field championships at Cerritos College earlier this month, has made an  oral commitment to attend UCLA in the fall.  </P> <P> Ingalls chose UCLA over Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside. The Bruins will  provide him with a partial athletic scholarship.  </P> <P> "You can't beat the school," Ingalls said. "UCLA has just always been one of my  dream schools. I couldn't believe it when they started talking to me."  </P> <P> Having run 11.2 seconds in the 100, 22.56 in the 200 and 49.61 in the 400 as a  junior, Ingalls improved tremendously this year, clocking 10.9 in the 100,  22.19 in the 200 and 47.89 in the 400, the event in which he won the Southern  Section 1-A Division title.  </P></p>

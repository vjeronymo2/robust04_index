			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Economy as a lottery Sir, Surely you do not believe that the panel of 'wise men' (Leading article, February 23) was set up to serve the public and demonstrate the willingness of government to listen to its critics? It was really a cunning ploy to disarm its critics, by proving that even the best-paid experts don't know what's going to happen, nor what should be done to make it better. As Samuel Brittan showed recently with OECD forecasts, we could have done them as well by throwing dice. With the opposition barely differing from the Tories on economic policy, now is the time to hand over management of the economy to a truly independent body: the National Lottery.

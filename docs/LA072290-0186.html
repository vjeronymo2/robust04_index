			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: SOUTHLAND HOT SPOT: CONVERTING CO-OPS TO CONDOS  </P> <P> While much of the Southland's real estate market has ground to a halt, one  segment of the marketplace is speeding along with appreciation rates upward of  20% -- sometimes as high as 100%.  </P> <P> Long considered "white elephants" in terms of California's skyrocketing sales  and prices, the 10,000-plus stock cooperatives and community apartments  (own-your-owns) in greater Los Angeles are among the hottest properties around,  thanks to the trend of converting the properties to condominiums.  </P> <P> During the past 10 years, stock co-ops and own-your-owns have been difficult to  finance and virtually impossible to sell. Values have dropped. When unable to  sell or refinance original high interest rate loans, some owners have been  forced into foreclosure.  </P> <P> Why the sudden turnaround? Converting co-ops and community apartments into  condominiums offers many advantages. Financing is readily available. Eager  first-time buyers snatch up these properties -- still considered bargains in  California's high-priced market.  </P> <P> To date, in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas, more than 1,000  cooperative and community apartment units have been converted and 1,500 are in  the process of converting. What exactly is the difference between co-ops,  own-your-owns and condominiums?  </P> <P> In a stock cooperative, the corporation owns the whole project, including the  real property and improvements. The owners are shareholders in the corporation  and receive lease agreements that give them the right to occupy their units.  </P> <P> In an own-your-own, each owner receives a deed giving him or her an undivided  interest in the common area of the project along with a right to occupy a unit,  and an association is formed to manage and maintain the project.  </P> <P> With both the co-op and own-your-own, the homeowners do not actually own their  individual units. In a condominium, the homeowners do own their individual  units along with an undivided interest in the common area of the project.  </P> <P> Because a conversion to condominium must be undertaken for an entire building  or project, the first step for interested owners is to take a preliminary poll  to determine if sufficient interest exists to proceed.  </P> <P> Although most owners react positively to the possibility of converting, some  raise a variety of concerns:  </P> <P>  -- Potential property tax increases. Persons who have owned their units for a  number of years may be concerned that their property taxes will increase as a  result of the conversion.  </P> <P> Property taxes typically are unaffected by the conversion, because it is simply  a change in the form of ownership.  </P> <P>  -- Community control over property. Another concern of some owners is  maintaining the same community atmosphere and control after the conversion. In  practice, owners will have the same control; the same rules and regulations  apply to the condominium as were applied before the conversion.  </P> <P> The new condominium association documents only modify those portions of the  existing documents and rules and regulations as necessary to reflect the  condominium form of ownership and to comply with current law and lender  requirements.  </P> <P>  -- Income tax liability. A final, particularly significant concern is the  effect of the conversion on individual owners' income taxes.  </P> <P> While there is no effect for community apartments, some co-ops may be affected.  For co-op owners who occupy their units, conversion is generally a tax-free  transaction for federal and state income tax purposes.  </P> <P> But if a project contains a large number of rental units or second homes, the  income tax results may be different.  </P> <P> After all individual concerns are addressed, the project may begin the  conversion process. The three basic phases of the conversion are obtaining the  necessary approvals, redefining the project as a condominium, and changing the  legal documents and title for each owner.  </P> <P>  -- Required approvals. Generally, three approvals are required for the  conversion -- homeowner, local government and the California Department of Real  Estate.  </P> <P> While we recommend that at least 75% of the owners approve the conversion,  California law sometimes allows conversion with approval of only 51% of the  owners. In many cases, the conversion of a co-op or community apartment to a  condominium is exempt from the local government ordinances and it is not  necessary to file a conversion application.  </P> <P> This removes a major obstacle to conversion by eliminating any physical  requirements or modifications, such as additional parking or any other  conditions which could be imposed by the city or county.  </P> <P> Finally, the California Department of Real Estate conducts an administrative  review of the new condominium legal documents to ensure that they comply with  current laws and regulations.  </P> <P>  -- Forming the condominium. The second phase, which overlaps the approval  process, is redefining the project as a condominium project.  </P> <P> An engineer prepares the condominium plan, which is a diagrammatic plan of the  project and each unit. This becomes the basis for the new legal description of  the units as condominiums. The attorney prepares the new condominium management  documents including the covenants, conditions and regulations (CC&amp;Rs), the  bylaws and articles of incorporation. The attorney also prepares the documents  that will be used to change the owners' titles during the final phase of the  conversion.  </P> <P>  -- Owning the condominium. The final phase of the conversion requires the  services of both an escrow and title company. Basically, the owners exchange  their co-op or community apartment unit for a grant deed to their unit as a  condominium and receive a title insurance policy insuring that they have proper  legal title to the unit as a condominium.  </P> <P> During this phase, the units can be converted independently one at a time.  </P> <P> The conversion process can be completed in six to eight months for a cost of  $1,500-$2,500 a unit.  </P> <P> To begin the conversion process, the association needs to retain the necessary  personnel. The association may choose to hire a single company to coordinate  and provide all required services for one set fee. Alternatively, the  association may choose to hire an experienced attorney who will assist the  association in coordinating the conversion and hiring other personnel, such as  the engineer, escrow company and title company.  </P> <P> Sometimes a board member or homeowner may wish to be the "conversion  coordinator." However, the board should be cautious about accepting a  volunteer's help because the conversion is a full-time job and issues which  arise during the conversion are complicated. Those without sufficient expertise  who attempt to manage a conversion could make the conversion more costly and  lengthy than necessary.  </P> <P> The stock co-op and community apartment "white elephants" are on their way to  extinction, but no one will miss them. By changing the legal definition of  these properties to condominiums, thousands of owners are solving their  financing and sales problems while creating new affordable housing for  first-time buyers.  </P></p>

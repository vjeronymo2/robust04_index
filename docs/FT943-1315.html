			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Lenders rush to follow Halifax - Mortgage rates Halifax decided on its new standard mortgage rate this week, emboldening a host of other building societies to do the same. It has passed on almost the full half percentage point rise in base rates by increasing its standard variable rate to 8.1 per cent from 7.64. This applies already to new borrowers and for existing borrowers from October 1. Other building societies which have raised their standard variables rates to 8.1 per cent include Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and Chelsea. Barclays is one of the few banks to have announced its new rate, also of 8.1 per cent, with effect from October 1 for new and existing borrowers. Another batch of lenders are clustered around 8.14 per cent. These include Bristol &amp; West, Britannia, Leeds, Nationwide and Northern Rock. Abbey National and National &amp; Provincial are on 8.09 per cent, while TSB and Bank of Ireland are at the lower end of the market with 8.05. The TSB rate represents a rise of 0.6 of a percentage point - higher than the base rate increase - and comes into effect for new and existing borrowers from October 20. Woolwich is the largest society yet to announce its new rate and most of the banks also are undecided. Discounted rates You can avoid the higher rates by taking advantage of discounted rates still available from a large number of lenders including Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bristol &amp; West, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, National &amp; Provincial and Woolwich. These offer a percentage reduction on the variable rate over various periods and can represent substantial savings for new borrowers. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester offers a three percentage point discount for 12 months to those with a deposit of at least 20 per cent, or one of 2 per cent to those borrowing up to 95 per cent of the value of their home. The three percentage point discount amounts to a saving at present of Pounds 110 a month on a Pounds 50,000 interest-only loan, and of Pounds 235 a month on Pounds 100,000. These amount respectively to Pounds 1,320 and Pounds 2,820 over the year. Lenders, however, are using discounted rates to increase their market share rather than provide a better service to their customers. This is because they are available only to new borrowers (although some lenders, such as Halifax, do not make them available for re-mortgages at all). This means that existing borrowers are being left out. 'It has caused us the occasional slight headache, since some of our borrowers are raising their eyebrows over this,' says Abbey National. 'But we do not think it would be right to let our borrowers switch to lower rates just because it happens to be better.' What can existing borrowers do? Many lenders are offering to cover some of the re-mortgage costs of those tempted to switch lenders. Abbey National itself is offering to pay up to Pounds 320 towards the valuation and Pounds 250 towards legal fees. It is almost certain to be worth taking advantage of such offers in order to get the reduced variable rate, although it is important to calculate all the costs and balance these against the savings to see if it is worth switching. But one FT reader, reluctant to leave his present lender, claims he could move to another offering a discounted rate and then switch back to his original lender as a 'new' borrower, entitling him to get its discounted rate while incurring minimal costs. Before going through this rigmarole, though, it is worth talking to your lender - particularly if you are a highly-valued customer - to see if you can get the discounted rate. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester says the only way existing customers could secure the discounted rate is by re-mortgaging with the society. Abbey National is reluctant to endorse a similarly absurd, but at least flexible, position. It hopes that its customers will realise there is more to a mortgage than its interest rate, and that having a long relationship with a lender can reap benefits - such as further loans.</p>

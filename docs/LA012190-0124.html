			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE BUDGET PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian's proposed budget is a slap in the face to all those who spend  hours waiting at welfare offices every month to get a grant that puts them well  below the poverty line. The governor plans not only to freeze the AFDC (or  welfare) grant at an already unlivable level, but also to slash by 20% funding  for the Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program.  </P> <P> Even though it was designed to offer educational and job training opportunities  to welfare recipients to help them out of the cycle of poverty, the GAIN  program in Los Angeles has only 49 job training slots to offer the  approximately 3,700 participants.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's cuts -- to welfare, health care, and services to the elderly --  take aim at those of all ages who struggle with poverty. All this so that he  can set aside $1.2 billion for a "rainy day." The Los Angeles County health  system is attempting to deal with twice as many patients as it can care for  responsibly. The welfare offices are so understaffed that it often takes a  pregnant mother over three months to get the Medi-Cal she needs to receive  prenatal care. And this isn't rain?  </P> <P> MELANIE STEPHENS  </P> <P> Associate Director for Advocacy  </P> <P> Interfaith Hunger Coalition  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DENNIS BROWN WILL NOT RUN FOR ASSEMBLY  AGAIN  </P> <P> Declaring that the Lord "wants me to do something else with my life,"  Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) on Monday announced he will not seek  reelection. Brown, 40, a staunch conservative, was elected in 1978.  </P> <P> "I never intended to stay this long. Before I get too decrepit, I want to do  something else," said Brown, whose negative votes on a variety of issues earned  him the nickname "Dr. No."  </P> <P> His decision is expected to touch off a scramble to succeed him in the heavily  Republican 58th District, which includes parts of Long Beach and Signal Hill in  Los Angeles County and Seal Beach and part of Huntington Beach in Orange  County.  </P> <P> With Brown's dropping out, Friday's deadline to file election papers for the  Assembly seat will be extended until March 14.  </P></p>

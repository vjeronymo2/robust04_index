			<p>BFN     [Text] A number of the members of the parliamentary bloc  representing the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have issued a  statement in which they reiterated their strong and firm  adherence to Yemeni unity as the fate of our people, stressing  that no individual, group, or political force can encroach on  this unity. They condemned the sedition ignited by the  rebellious gang of apostasy in the YSP leadership among the sons  of the one people. The members of the YSP parliamentary bloc  also denounced the secession declaration, affirming its  political illegitimacy. They considered this declaration a  crime and high treason against our Yemeni people.    The YSP parliamentary bloc reiterated their adherence to  constitutional legitimacy based on the results of the  parliamentary elections held on 27 April 1993.</p>

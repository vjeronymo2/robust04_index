			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in French] </F>   [Excerpts] The diplomatic corps have answered resigning  Prime Minister Robert Malval's invitation to support the  legitimate Haitian Government. Several diplomats accredited to  Port-au-Prince say they do not favor a foreign military  intervention in Haiti to dislodge the military rulers. Let us  listen to Mirlene Joanis.    [Begin recording] [Joanis] The four countries that claim to  be Haiti's friends asserted once again at the residence of Prime  Minister Robert Malval that the rumors of military intervention  are unfounded. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing  reaffirmed the intention of the United States to carry on with  the negotiated, diplomatic path. [passage omitted]    [Venezuelan Ambassador Elsa Boccheciampe] The Venezuelan  ambassador to Haiti has the same opinion as the little Friends  of Haiti. "We are part of the group of friends; we make  decisions; and we share the opinions of the group of friends."    [Joanis] French Charge d'Affaires (Philippe Seltz) says: We  just support a deployment of MINUHA [the United Nations Mission  in Haiti]. But is the decision, made jointly by the military  rulers and some parliamentarians, not a slap in the face of the  international community? (Seltz) thinks Haitians are sovereign  in their country and they can do what they want.    [(Seltz)] "The Haitians are sovereign and [words  indistinct]."    [Joanis] If Haitians are sovereign, why is the French charge  d'affaires at the Malval residence?    [(Seltz)] "It is simply because he invited us to come today.  In fact, as he told you, we talked about issues relating to the  university. He wished to know our viewpoint on certain  proposals. When the legitimate prime minister asks me to visit  him, I do so, just as my colleagues in the diplomatic corps  would."    [Joanis] As for Canadian Charge d'Affaires (Louis Robert  D'Aigle), Canada is still on the diplomatic path for restoring  democracy.    [(D'Aigle)] "Here we maintain the same hope, the  (?conviction) that the crisis will be resolved in the general  interest of the Haitian people as they expressed it in (?1987)."    [Joanis] "[words indistinct] President Aristide will no  longer officially be president."    [(D'Aigle)] "Listen, we will see at that moment. It is  perhaps... [pauses] Politically, 12 months is an eternity. We  must always, we are going to support all efforts aimed at  restoring constitutional order."    [Unidentified reporter] "Canada does not favor a military  intervention in Haiti?"    [(D'Aigle)] "[words indistinct] expressed himself very  clearly about that. We have thought about adopting complete  sanctions, which will undoubtedly be enforced this weekend. We  will see at that time."    [Reporter] "Mr. Ambassador, are you optimistic about a  possible return of President Aristide to the country?"    [(D'Aigle)] "I have an optimistic nature."    [Joanis] Within the scope of the negotiated diplomatic path,  (William Gray), who replaces Mr. Pezzullo in the Haitian crisis,  will arrive in Haiti next week. Does this emissary intend to  meet either with the military rulers or with the de facto  government? Mr. Swing does not know.    [Swing] "I do not know yet. I do not know [words  indistinct]. I did not talk about that. I do not know what the  agenda upon his visit to Haiti will be. I do not know."    [Joanis] Whereas the Haitian crisis has reached a watershed  with the installation of Attorney Jonassaint to power, the four  countries that say they are Haiti's friends have stuck to their  positions. They have the same speech. The speech is not  renewed. Everyone is wondering what the country's democratic  future will be. Observers are very worried. But Prime Minister  Robert Malval has no reason not to believe in the good  intentions of the international community.    [Malval] "I have no reason not to believe in them. In  October, I expressed the reproaches I had to level at the  international community."    [Jonais] The friendly countries, the little Friends of Haiti  have taken a clear stand. For the time being, they are not  favorable to the idea of military intervention. They favor  instead a total and complete embargo, a sanction that will be  effective as of 22 May.

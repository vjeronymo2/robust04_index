			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japanese work practices can be successful in UK Sir, In response to 'Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices' (July 19), here is an alternative view. Oki's manufacturing site at Cumbernauld, Scotland, has adopted many Japanese working practices and combined them successfully with the best from western culture. The facility is committed to kaizen, or continuous improvement, and the close involvement of its staff. For example, every morning a meeting is held in each section where employees are able to discuss the previous day's activities and provide feedback to their supervisors. It is at these meetings, or chokai sessions, that everyone has an opportunity to participate in the company's affairs. The strong communications links between staff and management on a variety of issues is vital to the culture that has been developed at Cumbernauld. It is this culture that resulted in Oki being presented with the Investors in People Award. At the ceremony, an assessor from Investors in People in Scotland said: 'I have not previously come across a workforce that has been so motivated, committed and enthusiastic.' The 100 per cent commitment of staff and management has also brought tangible rewards in the form of new contracts. The key ingredient to such success is to select the elements that create the right working environment and to mould and build on them - not just to implement a rigid code that suffices business needs but does not take account of human requirements. If the companies involved in your article had truly embraced the principles of kaizen and chokai, the outcome may might have been different. I encourage them to try again and invite them to visit our factory to see Oki's management style in action.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  For general information on the DOE NEPA process, please contact: Carol M. Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight, EH&hyph;25, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585, (800) 472&hyph;2756 or (202) 586&hyph;4600. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> About the SWEIS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has a policy to prepare SWEISs for large, multi-facility DOE sites [10 CFR 1021.330], such as LANL. The purpose of a SWEIS is to provide DOE and its stakeholders with a comprehensive look at the environmental impacts caused by its operations and activities at a site. The NEPA process allows for Federal, State, tribal, county, municipal and public participation in the environmental review and resultant decisionmaking process. A SWEIS was last prepared for LANL in 1979 [DOE/EIS&hyph;0018]. The planned SWEIS would replace that document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A SWEIS is a useful tool for DOE to manage its facilities and operations. It provides the DOE decisionmakers, site management, and the public with comprehensive information on the cumulative impact of past, ongoing and planned activities at a site in order to plan for quality stewardship of the resources entrusted to DOE's care. A SWEIS can be used to establish an environmentally-sound operating envelope for site activities and establish thresholds of significance to identify future environmental impacts. The SWEIS is expected to support later NEPA reviews by allowing DOE to focus on project-specific issues and to narrow and simplify the scope of later reviews. This process is called ``tiering'' [40 CFR 1508.28]. DOE believes that the SWEIS analysis will generally provide adequate NEPA coverage for those activities and projects covered by the SWEIS. However, a SWEIS may not replace the need for future, project-specific NEPA reviews as future proposals for LANL facilities are developed. In accordance with 10 CFR 1021.330(d), DOE will evaluate the SWEIS at least every five years after its completion to determine whether it should be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site-wide Analysis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SWEIS will address operations and planned activities at LANL foreseen within the next 5 to 10 years. The SWEIS will focus on operating practices and facility management; DOE does not expect to be able to anticipate all future research and development projects that LANL may be called upon to support over the next ten years. The Department anticipates that the SWEIS will provide an analysis of all activities at LANL and all DOE land management activities related to operations at LANL. The SWEIS will also examine DOE's ongoing obligations to the surrounding community under the Atomic Energy Communities Act [42 U.S.C. 2301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .], including proposals to transfer certain tracts of DOE-administered land to Los Alamos County. The Department intends to use the SWEIS to develop: mitigation measures for operating and facilities management practices; a nuclear materials storage and handling strategy; a waste management strategy; an environmental restoration strategy; and a land transfer strategy for LANL. The SWEIS will include an analysis of the impacts of operating all major facilities at LANL. Specific research projects or facility proposals that are not included within the SWEIS analysis would be subject to project-specific NEPA reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Los Alamos National Laboratory's mission.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department coordinates and administers the energy functions of the Federal government. Among other things, it is responsible for the nuclear weapons program, research and development of energy technologies, and basic science research. The Laboratory is one of DOE's primary research and development laboratories. It was established in 1943 to provide research, design, and testing for nuclear weapons and nuclear materials and remains one of the three laboratories in DOE's nuclear weapons complex. Over the past 50 years, LANL's mission has expanded to include research in energy, materials science, nuclear safeguards and security, biomedical science, computational science, environmental protection and cleanup, and other basic science research. In addition to work done in support of DOE programs, LANL provides research and science services for other Federal agencies, universities, foreign countries, and private industry. The Laboratory is one of the largest multiprogram research laboratories in the world, with an annual budget of about $1 billion and about 10,000 contractor and sub-contractor employees. The Laboratory covers about 43 square miles of Federal land in north-central New Mexico in Los Alamos and Santa Fe Counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Energy has initiated an independent review to provide recommendations on the future missions of all DOE Laboratories. The SWEIS will incorporate any recommendations accepted by DOE regarding the future missions of LANL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Related NEPA reviews.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, certain of LANL's mission elements are being considered in several other broad-scale NEPA reviews. In addition, about 20 proposed projects at LANL are in the process of having either an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS (PEIS) [Notice of Intent, 55 FR 42633] will analyze the DOE plan to formulate and implement an integrated Environmental Management program. The Laboratory is one of the alternative sites proposed to store and process transuranic radioactive waste and store, process, and provide on-site disposal for low-level radioactive waste, possibly including material generated at locations other than LANL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration PEIS [revised Notice of Intent, 56 FR 39528] analyzes alternatives for the reconfiguration of the weapons complex due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department currently is considering how the scope of this PEIS should be revised further to reflect more recent budget and stockpile reduction decisions. At this time, the Reconfiguration PEIS and its related decisions are not expected to change the weapons mission at LANL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

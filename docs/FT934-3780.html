			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (6): Victim of the nation's success - Bangkok struggles with severe infrastructure problems / 'Bangkok's traffic congestion and pollution are just about the worst in the world - ever. Never in history have people had to live in the conditions we endure each day.' - Bangkok Post, November 18, 1993 Bangkok residents are obsessed with the city's traffic problems. The visitor is regaled with a grim menu of facts and figures - pollution levels in the city are twice the acceptable level and are officially classified as 'dangerous.' The city, along with its roads, is sinking. Each day about 500 new cars and 450 motorbikes join the traffic on the city's gridlocked streets. In most cities about 25 per cent of the land area is devoted to roads. In Bangkok it's only about eight per cent. During the great Bangkok traffic jam in July last year - after a heavy rainstorm - some schoolchildren were stuck in traffic for most of the night while a trip from the airport to central Bangkok, a distance of under 20kms, took five and a half hours. Despite the chaos, life in Bangkok goes on - just. People have adapted. To avoid peak hour traffic, children arrive at school at 6am for an 8am start. Secretaries go to work sitting side saddle on the backs of taxi motorbikes. Every business person has a mobile phone - some, a mobile office. Over-centralisation is the main cause of Bangkok's problems. More than two-thirds of Thailand's urban population lives in Bangkok. Political power rests in the capital. Bangkok is also Thailand's economic powerhouse: economists calculate that the city and its environs account for up to two thirds of the country's GDP. 'Bangkok is the victim of Thailand's success' says Mr David Hendrix, General Manager of Citibank, Thailand. 'The Thai economy has been growing at about 8 per cent each year. In Bangkok that translates to about 14 per cent - that's too much for anywhere to handle.' Bureaucratic inertia has been another factor contributing to Bangkok's woes. Mass transit systems have been talked about for more than 20 years. At present at least three projects are on the drawing board. Apart from some rather desultory piling work on one scheme, no work is going on. A maze of overlapping and rival authorities governs Bangkok - 'it's like driving a bus with 16 hands on the wheel,' says one official. Then there's been the dark hand of politics. Governments in Thailand have come and gone. Each has had its own agenda for solving Bangkok's problems. Deals have been made, then rewritten by a successor administration, then abandoned. Along the way, various politicians are reported to have made substantial amounts from contract awards. In the late 1980s the government decided to go ahead with two expressway projects in Bangkok on a build, operate, transfer, basis. The expressways are Thailand's first venture into BOT projects: both deals have run into serious problems. The Bangkok Expressway Co (BECL), a consortium 65 per cent controlled by Kumagai Gumi of Japan, entered into an agreement to build and operate a 20km stretch of expressway, plus an additional 12km to be merged with an existing network. The first Dollars 800m phase of the project was completed in March 1993. But from then till the beginning of September, the expressway lay empty - used only by joggers and cyclists. BECL and various government agencies had become involved in increasingly acrimonious disputes about toll charges, about who should operate the expressway, about the government's failure to deliver land necessary for the project on time - which resulted in big losses for BECL. When government efforts to persuade BECL to open the expressway failed, the authorities, armed with a court order, opened the road themselves. Motorists flooded onto the expressway, promptly causing yet another traffic jam. BECL, and Kumagai Gumi in particular, accuse the authorities of breaking virtually every contractual rule in the book. 'Either they don't understand BOT or they hate the whole idea,' says Mr Takao Ninomiya, BECL's managing director. For their part the authorities say BECL has misinterpreted the terms of the original contract. A stand-off has developed. The end-result is likely to be either a law suit between the various parties, or a forced buy out of BECL by local banks, supported by the government. Don Muang Tollway, stretching out towards the airport north of Bangkok, is another problem project, also BOT. One administration said funding for the Dollars 450m project could all be raised in Thailand. A successor administration said half the funding had to be raised offshore: that held up the project for several months. The project's planning seemed to be seriously at fault. The government refused permission to demolish existing flyovers which were in the way of the expressway's construction. Because of traffic problems, contractors are only allowed to carry out large scale work between midnight and 5am. The Don Muang Tollway is already well over budget and more than a year behind schedule. To add to the problems of both projects, the banks, frightened by the problems encountered, have curtailed their lending. Questions have been raised as to whether investors, particularly foreigners, will now be willing to become involved in similar BOT schemes, given the painful history of these two projects. But it is not all gloom and doom. Bangkok's problems have overshadowed the large scale infrastructure projects that have been successfully completed in other parts of the country. Other capital cities in the region, such as Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Manila, are facing similar, if not quite such critical, problems. The new Thai government has pledged to tackle, once and for all, the traffic congestion that is choking Bangkok to death. But residents, who show remarkable stoicism in the face of the deteriorating conditions in the city, are sceptical. 'Even if they started building a mass transit system now, the work would bring Bangkok to a standstill,' says one long-time resident. 'In the end, we'll just have to lock up, throw away the keys and move somewhere else.'</p>

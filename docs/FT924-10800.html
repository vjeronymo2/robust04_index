			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Borden to take Dollars 642m restructuring charge BORDEN, the US food and packaging company, announced yesterday that it was taking a Dollars 642m extraordinary charge, before tax, to fund a wide-ranging overhaul of its operations. The company said that around 3,000 jobs - out of 42,000 - were likely to be lost at about 10 plants over the next three to six months. The restructuring is designed to 'completely change the way Borden presents, sells and distributes its products, making us one unified company instead of a group of decentralised organisations and brands,' according to Mr Anthony D'Amato, chairman. It comes only three years after the company unveiled a similarly extensive restructuring programme, designed to shrink the dairy business and streamline other operations. The latest overhaul will affect both domestic and international operations at the New York-based company, which claims to be the world's largest pasta manufacturer and the biggest dairy group in the US. On the domestic front, Borden said it plans to withdraw from some of its unprofitable snack businesses in North America, and restructure its sales force. Closures and 'operational relocations' will help consolidate both the snack and domestic dairy businesses. Outside the US, Borden said it planned to modernise its ice cream and cheese businesses in Japan; step up attempts to integrate the sweet snacks and specialty breads business in Germany and central Europe; and to consolidate some of the packaging and industrial products operations, also in Europe. Borden's latest charge means that it is posting an after-tax loss of Dollars 376.8m for the third quarter of 1992. This compares with a Dollars 98.8m profit in the same period of 1991. Sales during the quarter totalled Dollars 1.86bn, virtually unchanged year-on-year. For the first nine months of 1992, Borden's net loss stands at Dollars 468m, compared with a profit of Dollars 251.8m last time. The nine-month figure is depressed by Dollars 229m of charges for accounting changes, as well as the restructuring charge. Even without the restructuring charge, Borden said that third quarter net income would have fallen 26 per cent. However, Mr D'Amato said that the company was now aiming for an average annual earnings increase of 18 per cent. This, he suggested, would put earnings per share at around Dollars 3.30 in 1996. In 1991, after the restructuring charge, the figure was Dollars 2. Mr D'Amato also suggested that 1992 earnings could stand at around Dollars 1.70 per share, with the 1993 figure rising to around Dollars 2.10. On Wall Street, some analysts welcomed the move, but others were mindful of the 1989 restructuring, questioning whether the latest move was guaranteed to generate the projected earnings gains. The shares fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 yesterday.</p>

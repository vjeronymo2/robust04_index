			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Welsh 'Tristan' in London - Opera Welsh National Opera's Tristan und Isolde, staged by Yannis Kokkos and conducted by Charles Mackerras, opened in Cardiff two months ago. Now at the end of its tour it has arrived in London together with the company's La Favorite, for two performances this week at Covent Garden. Tristan was last seen in London (at the Coliseum) in 1985 and any performance is an operatic event; the disappointment with Monday's, though, was very real. Max Loppert's first-night review found this Tristan fine in parts, unsatisfying elsewhere. In the larger expanses of the Royal Opera House one fancies the gap between the good and the less good may have been emphasised. Kokkos's sets, tailored for touring, fit well enough, though they echo just a little too closely the same designer's Pelleas et Melisande so recently seen there, definitely to the detriment of the Wagner. The details of his production, though, seem negligible; an essay in the WNO programme may be full of fine words and all the right theatrical references, but very little of that has been translated into stage action. Despite Kokkos's talk of a 'spiritual choreography', of creating 'bodily Leitmotifs which form a counterpoint to those of the music' most of the gestures and movements would hardly seem de trop in a concert performance. The emphasis then is placed even more firmly than usual in Tristan on the music, standing or falling by the durability of the principals and the coherence of the conducting. For long stretches in the first two acts on Monday, however, that coherence was lacking. There is no doubt that Jeffrey Lawton's Tristan is the most potent dramatic force, building from unprepossessing beginnings in the first act, gaining in authority through a distinctly tepid second-act love duet to a concentrated and intensely moving monologue in the third. The sound was never beautiful, nor did it pretend to be, but Lawton's concentration and his expressive honesty were much more than adequate compensation. His vividness gave an unusual tilt to the final act, with the Liebestod quite overshadowed; Anne Evans's Isolde was always carefully sung and painstakingly phrased, yet small-scale and unexpectedly detached, lowering rather than raising the emotional temperature in the majority of her interventions. Though Della Jones's Brangane was certainly committed dramatically she always sounded inappropriate in that role, while Richard Paul Fink's Kurwenal was strongly sung, without ever becoming eloquent. Peter Rose's Mark took the prize for German diction, and his firm delivery gave a lift to the end of the second act after the limpness of its climax. What the performances demanded was a corporate sense of purpose, yet Mackerras's account of the score seemed generally piecemeal and excitable with only an approximate sense of line. The lack of a convincing Wagnerian sonority in the strings and wind blending, and the uncertainty of some of the solo playing undermined stability yet more; watching such a music drama unfold while holding its audience at arm's length was altogether a troubling experience. Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; further performance on April 23</p>

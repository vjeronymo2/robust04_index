			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (52) Letter from W. E. Gilbertson, FDA, to M. K. Bruch, Dexide, Inc., coded LET90, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (53) Letter from M. K. Bruch, Dexide, Inc., to W. E. Gilbertson, FDA, coded LET91, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Comment on Hexachlorophene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. One comment urged reconsideration of hexachlorophene as an OTC ``handwashing agent and antimicrobial skin cleanser for use in the hospital, doctor's office, and by adult consumers.'' The comment stated that adequate data to support Category I status were submitted in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, but were only superficially discussed by the agency in comment 61 of the tentative final monograph. (See the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210 at 1220.) The comment submitted additional data to support the safety of hexachlorophene, including a retrospective study on 3 percent hexachlorophene in baby bathing (Ref. 1) and a study of hexachlorophene blood levels in infants receiving routine antiseptic skin care (Ref. 2). The comment also included a comprehensive review article on the safety and effectiveness of hexachlorophene (Ref. 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has reevaluated the data discussed in comment 61 in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1220) and evaluated the new data, and has determined that the data do not warrant changing the classification of hexachlorophene as a prescription drug. The infant data (Refs. 1 and 2) were discussed in detail in the tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial diaper rash drug products (55 FR 25246 at 25261 to 25263).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Summaries of handwash studies were also submitted, but no data were included. In one study, 3 percent hexachlorophene was tested as a surgical scrub under exaggerated use conditions (Ref. 4). Subjects (number not specified) washed their hands and forearms in 20 mL hexachlorophene for 10 minutes, 5 times daily, 6 days a week for a total of 58 days. No signs of toxicity were reported. The blood levels of hexachlorophene reached a plateau  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 3 days at mean levels of 0.07 &mu;g/mL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that it would be necessary to test a very large group of subjects (the number of subjects required to obtain a statistically significant result) with a variety of skin conditions to determine the true degree of absorption. A similar study reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33103 at 33118) reported blood levels of 0.5 &mu;g/mL or higher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the other study, subjects washed their hands and face three times daily for 3 weeks with either 2 or 5 mL of 3 percent hexachlorophene (Ref. 4). Blood concentrations reached a plateau within 7 days at mean levels of 0.21 &mu;g/mL for the 2-mL group and 0.22 &mu;g/mL for the 5-mL group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

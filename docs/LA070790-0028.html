			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANC LEADER NELSON MANDELA'S SOCIALISTIC VIEWS  </P> <P> Edwin Meese III and Bruce Fein misunderstand Nelson Mandela's socialistic views  ("Heroism Is No Ticket to Infallibility," Commentary, June 27). They state that  an "unchecked majoritarianism is a formula for tyranny over minorities."  </P> <P> Mandela is not calling for an unchecked majority, but a country ruled by  equals. A true socialist model (not the kind in Eastern Europe), based on the  concept of all for one and one for all, is structured to eliminate tyranny over  minorities by a small, elite ruling class. A just society is composed of  social, political and economic equals who are free to develop their human  abilities.  </P> <P> Meese and Fein are only partly correct in their statement that "the founders of  our Constitution went to great lengths to hold majoritarianism in check and to  protect the rights of minorities." The elite, property-owning class of white  Founding Fathers did go to great lengths to enhance national power to protect  their economic interests. Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution defends  one's right to own property -- slaves, that is. The founders' goal was not to  protect the civil liberties of slaves, indentured servants, women and common  men. Their goal was to maintain their economic power.  </P> <P> Mandela's wish for "one-person, one-vote" and redistribution of wealth from the  white minority to the black majority echoes socialists' desire for the people  to rule themselves through equality.  </P> <P> VICKY GOODHEAD  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

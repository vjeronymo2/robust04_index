			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> POLLUTION FEARS IN MERGER EASED  </P> <P> Fears that a proposed merger by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern  California Edison would generate more air pollution in the San Diego area are  unfounded, an air-quality official told the San Diego City Council's Public  Services and Safety committee. Richard Sommerville, executive director of the  San Diego Air Pollution Control District, said the merger is not likely to  cause the San Diego utility's plants to generate power at higher capacities. He  also said it was guesswork to say that San Diego's air quality would improve to  the detriment of air quality in the Los Angeles and Ventura County areas  because of the merger. San Diego's rigorous air-quality standards will keep  industry from moving to the city as companies attempt to cope with stiffer  emission regulations in the Los Angeles area, he said, and regulatory agencies  work to evaluate effects of the proposed merger.  </P></p>

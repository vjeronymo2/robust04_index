			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / People: Expanded role for Sach at RBS Derek Sach, 46, who joined The Royal Bank of Scotland two years ago from the 3i Group, has underlined his steady rise up the Scottish bank's management team by being appointed to the newly created post of director of group risk. Although not a main board director, Sach takes over many of the responsibilities of John Barclay, RBS's deputy chief executive who retired last summer. Sach will be responsible for the co-ordination of the management and control of risk throughout the Royal Bank Group. He will report to Bob Spiers, 58, a former finance director of Britoil, who took over as Royal Bank's finance director in July 1993. Spiers is expected to retire when he turns 60, which suggests that Sach may be being groomed to replace him on the Royal Bank board eventually. Sach, who used to run 3i's UK business, set up the Royal Bank's specialised lending services. The division, which has a staff of 300 and teams in Edinburgh, Manchester and London, has pioneered a number of techniques to rescue and assist customers in difficulty. One indication of the success of Sach's approach to a problem which dogs every bank is that the number of receivers appointed by the Royal Bank has fallen from 420 in 1992 to 150 last year and he expects this year's figure to be around 100. While Sach admits that the decline in the number of receivers is partly to do with the recovery in the economy, he also believes that it has something to do with the Royal Bank's 'completely new approach to customers with problems'. Sach will continue to be responsible for the specialised lending services division in his new role.</p>

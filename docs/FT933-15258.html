			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Euro Disney warns of summer loss EURO Disney yesterday warned that it would make a loss this summer and said it had sought financial support from Walt Disney, its US parent company, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, the chairman, said Euro Disney had decided to delay the construction of the second phase of EuroDisneyland because of its financial difficulties. The group's share price fell sharply after the announcement and ended the day down FFr870 at FFr5,950, their lowest level this year. In London, the stock closed 108p lower at 675p. Euro Disney, which opened the theme park in April 1992, originally hoped to be profitable from the beginning. But after a second-half deficit last year, it is heading for heavy losses in the current financial year. It has already announced a net loss of FFr1.08bn for the six months to March 31. An unexpectedly high estimate of FFr500m losses in the third quarter formed part of yesterday's warning. The company also said it would continue in the red in the fourth quarter. The spring-summer half contains the theme park's busiest period. Euro Disney said it had been affected by the European recession and by the French franc's strength against other currencies, notably the pound and the lira. Trips from the UK fell considerably, with the number of visitors to EuroDisneyland falling to 310,000 in the third quarter, a 50 per cent fall on the same period last year. The decline in foreign attendance was countered by an increase in the number of French visitors. The group is reassessing its plans for the second phase of EuroDisneyland, originally expected to include a second park and golf course. Mr Bourguignon said the group had to be 'prudent for the short term'. In the meantime Euro Disney is trying to restructure its debt in a refinancing deal which could include raising new capital. The rise in its net debt from FFr18.5bn to FFr21bn in the current financial year has raised concern about the cashflow position. Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of the equity, has agreed to help finance working capital requirements until next spring when Euro Disney hopes to have completed its refinancing. Lex, Page 22</p>

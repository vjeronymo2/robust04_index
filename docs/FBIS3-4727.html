			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The First Accomplishment of the Government"] </F>   [Text] It is good news for everyone that the Thai  Government recently implemented a policy of pushing leaders of  minorities from our neighboring countries out of Thai territory,  as these people were using Thailand as bases for armed struggle  against those governments.    This good news has been attested to by the report on  requests  by the Thai military for the police to arrest Lao General Vang  Pao, accused of having built a clandestine headquarters on Thai  territory to wage war against the Lao Government and Mon  generals who used strongholds on Thai soil to lead rebellion  against the Burmese Government.    This is a good omen because it indicates that Thailand is  readjusting its foreign policy in line with the global trend.  Formerly, Thailand used areas under the control of minority  rebels as buffer states to maintain distance from the neighbors  and used them as a shield against external aggression.    The Thai Government has come to realize that some of our  neighbors, although they may pursue different political systems  or be under the rule of a military regime or a single-party  system, are all pressured by internal forces to open their  economies for free trade. It does not matter how Thailand  manages to profit from more economic and trade ties with  neigbors, but the point is that it must first revise its policy  in dealing with them.    NAEO NA believes that as long as there are rumors about the  presence of minority rebels on Thai soil, suspicion and hatred  from neigboring governments will continue to linger. In other  words, Thailand will certainly lose to third countries the  opportunity to benefit from open markets in their neighbors. The  ongoing readjustment of the Thai Government policy is indeed  correct.</p>

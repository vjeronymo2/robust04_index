			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (12): Essential business tool - The EC company car market WHILE successive UK chancellors have sought to discourage the company car through taxation increases well in excess of inflation, its popularity, particularly as an executive perk, is growing apace in most European countries. At director level the widespread perception that the UK is somehow unique for the profligacy with which 'perk' cars are dispensed is not standing up to close scrutiny. As an extensive study of the European company car scene by the Monks Partnership makes clear, at director level there is a fairly small and ever-narrowing difference in the extent of provision between the UK and some leading Continental countries. Only in Switzerland, among a total of 14 countries surveyed, does the level of provision to directors fall significantly below 90 per cent. (Needless to say, Swiss directors are in a better position than most to fund their own cars out of salary.) At managerial level the gaps, as might be expected, widen - but even here provision is increasing, Monks partner Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt concludes. The highest increase in popularity in recent years has occurred in France, where 80 per cent more non-director senior managers were offered company cars last year compared with 1989. In Germany, which in unit terms has a larger company car market than the UK, the level of provision to directors is now the same as in the UK, at 98 per cent. Spanish middle managers, such as in sales or accountancy functions, fare least well in comparison with their UK counterparts, with 49 per cent being offered cars compared with 96 per cent in the UK, 86 per cent in the Netherlands and 80 per cent in third-placed Germany. However, while the UK proportion has actually dropped back marginally since 1989, only just over one third of Spanish managers were receiving cars in the late 1980s. Where UK business people do stand out - in company with their Spanish colleagues - is in their penchant for running expensive cars. Even allowing for exchange rate variations, in sterling terms the cars run by British managers are the most expensive. Last year the average, at managing director level, was Pounds 28,000 (Dollars 50,000) and at senior manager level, Pounds 20,000. In sterling terms, per-car spending on Spanish senior managers' vehicles was even higher than in the UK, at Pounds 21,600. The managing director, however, settled for one costing Pounds 26,500. In comparison, German directors and managers appear positively modest at average spending of Pounds 20,400 on the managing director's car and just Pounds 14,600 on senior managers'. This does not necessarily mean German managers are excessively self-denying  -part of the difference is accounted for by varying purchase taxation rates. Whereas these, including VAT, total around 14 per cent on the German car, British buyers, because of special car tax and higher (irrecoverable) VAT pay around double the German rate. In virtually all countries surveyed, the provision of free fuel for private motoring - a blatant 'perk' if ever there was one - is the norm rather than, as might be expected, the exception. At director level, four out of five Germans with company cars receive it, the Norwegians lead with 92 per cent, and even two-thirds of Swiss directors also receive the benefit. Middle managers in Norway fare much worse - provision is only about half the level of directors, but in most countries the level of provision is still well over two thirds. In spite of the increasingly burdensome taxation regime in the UK, the Monks survey, conducted after last year's Budget, concluded that there has been little reduction in the level of allocation and that company cars are still more prevalent throughout the corporate hierarchy than in any other European, or indeed industrialised, nation. This does not, however, prevent those operating within the UK vehicle provision industry from complaining about the British tax burden. For example, Mr Freddie Aldous, chairman and chief executive of TSB's Swan National vehicle leasing and rentals group - and a leading light of ECATRA, the European car and truck rental trade body - complains that UK company cars are now 'greatly overtaxed' compared with many other EC states. According to an analysis by Swan National, the assessed tax benefit to the company car user of his private use of the vehicle is substantially higher than in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands or Spain - the other countries studied in the analysis. The Swan figures examined only a slice of the sector, but the group argues that it is by far the most important - cars of 1.6 to 1.8 litres; less than four years old; in use by sales and marketing personnel and engineers, and typically covering around 15,000 business miles and 5,000 private miles a year. Such a user, Swan's figures show, faces a Pounds 2,650 assessed taxable benefit in the UK, compared with Pounds 2,400 in the Netherlands, Pounds 2,055 in Germany, only Pounds 1,250 in France and Italy and a lowly Pounds 950 in Spain. 'The government must recognise that the company car is an essential and irreplaceable business tool,' says Mr Aldous.</p>

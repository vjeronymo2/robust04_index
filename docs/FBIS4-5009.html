			<p>CSO     [Text] Prime Candidate for BOJ Governor Matsushita  Has Created Ripples in Financial Industry Circles, But Hope Is  Placed on Government and Private Industry Background    Now that a decision has been made to appoint Japan  Export-Import Bank President Mitsuhide Yamaguchi as the next  Chairman of the Board of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, negotiations  are progressing on the appointment of Sakura Bank Chairman Yasuo  Matsushita as the primary candidate to succeed Bank of Japan  [BOJ] Governor Yasushi Mieno when the latter's tenure expires at  the end of the year. If Matsushita is appointed to the BOJ  position, although he was a former career official of the  Ministry of Finance including service as a vice minister, he  will be the first governor with private banking industry  experience since Governor Jun Usami who served with the BOJ from  1964 to 1969 after an earlier career with the Mitsubishi Bank.  News of the strong potential for appointment of a governor with  a "private industry background" has already caused ripples in  financial circles.    Officials of the leading city banks worry that, "Perhaps the  appointment of a BOJ governor with private banking industry  experience when the condition of banks has weakened will pose  difficulties." Governor Usami who had gone to work for the BOJ  after serving as president of the Mitsubishi Bank won fame for  his actions in implementing a special BOJ loan and resolving the  difficulties of Yamaichi Securities in coordination with Prime  Minister Kakuei Tanaka during the securities market panic of  1965.    The current situation is similar in that we face a financial  recession following the collapse of the bubble, but the foremost  difference is that the recession is not limited to the  securities firms but encompasses the structural weakening of  banks. Government aid in the 1965 recession was limited to the  securities firms, but the current recession is expected to  require some form of aid for banks as well. There is the fear  that "if the BOJ governor is one that has a private banking  background, he may examine the banks with a prejudiced eye." On  the other hand, it is a fact that hope is being placed on the  appointment of a governor with solid experience in banking  operations as reflected by some who say, "Mr. Matsushita has  private banking experience as well as a career background with  the Ministry of Finance. He's the best candidate for the  position in terms of the coming age."    The Sakura Bank at which Mr. Matsushita serves as chairman  has avoided the issuance of official comments noting that, "An  official decision has not been made." However, other banks take  the view that, "Sakura Bank is not in a position to celebrate  the potential appointment on an unqualified basis."    Mr. Matsushita was appointed as president of the former  Taiyo-Kobe Bank in 1987 and collaborated with current Sakura  Bank President Kenichi Suematsu to complete a merger with the  Mitsui Bank in 1990. From prior times, there was a history of  coordinating roles played by former Ministry of Finance vice  ministers between the former Taiyo and Kobe Banks. Even after  the Sakura Bank was formed, Chairman Matsushita observed  procedures whereby he would first coordinate with officials  within the former Taiyo-Kobe Banks on important personnel  actions and then consult with President Suematsu. Some banking  officials take the position that departure of Mr. Matsushita who  has provided strong support for the former Taiyo-Kobe banking  system may "pose some difficulties for the Sakura Bank."    However, Sakura Bank officials stress that they have reached  the final phase of the merger actions to include the integration  of former Taiyo-Kobe and former Mitsui Bank personnel  departments in June and that, "Even if Chairman Matsushita  departs, we should have no problems." Even some rival banks take  the view that, "The departure of a coordinating official will  mean that parties concerned will cease to present parochial  positions and former Taiyo and Kobe Bank elements will exercise  a greater degree of solidarity."    Nine months remain before the appointment of the new BOJ  governor and many obscure facets remain in the race for the next  governor to include future political developments. The true  sentiment in private banking circles appears to be that "We are  not too sure that we can be positive about a BOJ Governor  Matsushita."</p>

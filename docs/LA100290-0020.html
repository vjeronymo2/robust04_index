Roseanne Barr and company will be  staying in Tinseltown for a while, instead of moving to Minneapolis next year.  </P> <P> Last week, Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold, announced they wanted out of  tabloid-infested Los Angeles, and would move production of ABC's "Roseanne" to  Minneapolis. But a statement released by the Carsey-Werner Co. with Barr and  Arnold said that after exploring the move the couple found the costs "too  prohibitive for the 1991-92 season." They said they plan to look into moving in  the future.  </P></p>

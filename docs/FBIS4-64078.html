			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Non-Stop" </F> column: "Duma Now Has Lobby"]    [Text] Yesterday a meeting of heads of the capital and  regional television and radio companies voted unanimously for  the creation of an Association of Television and Radio Workers.  The founder is the Journalists Union of Russia.    The reason for the gathering at Journalist House was the  drafting of a law on television and radio that parliament has  been poring over with enviable persistence for several days now.  After all, the future of a favorite plaything is being decided.  And those working for television and radio do not want to be a  plaything.    The main objective is to lobby Duma decrees: The future law  should only be passed if the association consents. It also  intends to work out principles for the development of the  television and radio market, and to oppose the Communications  Ministry's monopoly. The association will keep an eye on the  registration and re-registration of television and radio  companies.    The association will bring together representatives of  rather  varied interests: state-employed broadcasters and commercial  and independent producers. However, when it came to nominating  the association's chairman, the only candidate named was Lysenko  who represents state interests. The heads of regional  television and radio companies nominated their own candidates --  Kurkova and Shevelev. There was no time left to vote on any of  the candidates. Therefore they allowed Lysenko, who heads the  organizing committee, to be chairman ad interim. Having done  that, the gathering decided to break up until fall. Half the  participants were in a hurry to join a banquet in the adjoining  room.</p>

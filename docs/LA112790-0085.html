			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENT FINDS LAW PIG-HEADED;  </P> <P> ANIMALS: ROBERT RIDENOUR SAYS ARNOLD IS CLEANER AND SMARTER THAN OTHER PETS.  THE CITY OF BURBANK DISAGREES.  </P> <P> All this little piggy wants to do is stay in Burbank. But city officials say  Arnold, a miniature pig with a bulging belly, belongs on a farm, not in Robert  Ridenour's suburban home.  </P> <P> Ridenour was cited last month for keeping Arnold, a Vietnamese potbellied pig,  at his house on Grinnell Drive. Ridenour, however, is challenging the citation,  claiming that his foot-high, 45-pound pig is a far cry from the 800-pound  oinkers that win blue ribbons at the county fair and that city ordinances were  intended to prohibit.  </P> <P> Arnold is the victim of prejudice and misunderstanding, Ridenour said. The  citation, which would require Ridenour to get rid of his pet, is on hold  pending a review by the Burbank City Council.  </P> <P> The pig was given to Ridenour's roommate by Jackie Stallone, Sylvester's  mother. She reportedly bought it as a birthday gift for one of her sons, but  the surprise was not well received and she gave Arnold to Ridenour and Steve  Erhardt to watch until a permanent home could be found.  </P> <P> That was three months ago.  </P> <P> Since then, Ridenour and Erhardt have decided to keep Arnold, who they say is  cleaner and smarter than their dog, Oki. The housebroken pig has been trained  to come when called, sit on command and climb up stepladders.  </P> <P> Miniature Vietnamese pigs are short and black with round bellies that nearly  drag on the ground. They have become chic pets since they were introduced in  this country four years ago, with females selling for as much as $3,500, said  Phyllis Frisbey, founder of the Southern California Potbellied Pig Assn.  </P> <P> Frisbey estimated that several hundred Southern California residents own the  pigs but are reluctant to go public because they are illegal in many cities,  including Los Angeles. "Some people are pig prejudiced," she said.  </P> <P> Neither Ridenour nor Burbank animal control authorities were certain Monday who  squealed about Arnold.  </P> <P> The National Animal Disease Center, a branch of the U. S. Department of  Agriculture, has said Vietnamese pigs pose less of a health threat to humans  than cats or dogs and, when cared for properly, are cleaner than other domestic  pets. Even so, many cities refuse to allow the pigs as pets.  </P> <P> Although Burbank officials acknowledge that the pigs may make good pets, they  still are illegal under the Burbank Municipal Code. A pig is a pig and a pig is  illegal, according to Section 6-301, which outlaws more than 90 animals.  </P> <P> "We have an ordinance that says no pigs. It's as simple as that," said Fred  DeLange, superintendent of the Burbank Animal Shelter. "It doesn't say anything  about Vietnamese potbellied pigs. It just says no pigs."  </P> <P> The same ordinance also prohibits lions, tigers and bears. Horses are allowed  in some neighborhoods that have appropriate zoning.  </P> <P> Los Angeles prohibits farm animals except on land zoned for agriculture, but  Frisbey said her 60-member association is trying to persuade the City Council  to change the law.  </P> <P> In September, Monterey Park became the first city in the county to allow  residents to keep the pigs as pets, one per household. "We found that they made  pretty good pets," Monterey Park Police Capt. Jim Strait said.  </P> <P> Other cities have not been so flexible. In La Habra Heights, for example, a  couple said they would rather move than give up their two pigs, Elmer and Miss  Piggy.  </P> <P> Ridenour said that if the City Council does not allow the miniature pigs to  live in Burbank, he will challenge the ordinance in court.  </P></p>

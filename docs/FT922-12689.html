			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Book Review: A call for class action HORACE'S SCHOOL: Redesigning the American High School By Theodore R Sizer Houghton Mifflin, Dollars 19.95 Two American public high schools exist in the world's imagination. The first is the chronically under-funded inner-city school where many pupils drop out before gaining a diploma. It is dominated by teenage gangs, and its teachers have lost hope of providing a proper education to its poor, ethnic-minority pupils. The second imaginary high school is different. It is in the affluent suburbs attended by pupils from different backgrounds whose parents want them to go on to college. It offers an array of academic and vocational courses in orderly classes. Students cheer for the football team and dream of the school prom. The trials of the first American high school are so familiar that it is hard to envisage the second having problems. Opinion polls find most American parents are happy with their local school in spite of their worry about the state of education. They are happy for their children to enjoy its comfortable traditions. Yet it is hard to find an education pundit or a business leader who agrees with them. The suburban high school is attracting more and more of the blame for America's education malaise. Many of the 'lazy and ill-educated' workers criticised in Japan are the products of these happy institutions. The essential charge against the suburban high school is that it encourages complacency and laziness. Students can wander through the 'shopping mall' school taking undemanding courses. Outside the 'college prep' track, in which pupils prepare for college entrance tests by taking optional academic courses, there is little rigour. Even high achievers may have little experience in reasoning or applying ideas: the Standard Aptitude Test (SAT) for college is a multiple choice test of abstract facts. This litany of complaints has led to attempts to change schools. Being America, self help and local initiative have played as big a role in reform as state governments or even school districts. Probably the best known is the Coalition of Essential Schools led by Ted Sizer, a Brown University professor. The coalition was formed in 1984 after Sizer's first panegyric on schools in Horace's Compromise. He described the problems of a fictional high school teacher called Horace Smith. In the latest episode, Horace has the chance to lead a team of teachers redesigning Franklin High School from scratch. In spite of this rather unsophisticated device, the book feels like an authentic description of a high school and the tribulations of trying to reform it. One of the strengths of Sizer's approach is that he concentrates on teaching methods and curriculum, and shows how pupils can evade serious learning. Sizer puts the pupil problem clearly on the first page of the book: 'Many are lively, well-intentioned and adept at cranking out acceptable test scores, but they are without the habits of serious thought, respectful scepticism and curiosity about much of what lies beyond their immediate lives.' He attributes much of this to the style of teaching: a traditional method of learning by rote without much pupil involvement. Instead, he recommends 'learning by conversation' in smaller classes, and the blending of different subjects so students can understand concepts more practically. This has a familiar smell to the British reader. Indeed, one curiosity of educational debate in the US is the support for what the UK government regards with suspicion as 'progressive'. It is certainly hard to avoid the view that America might be better off with schools that encouraged a little more reasoning and a little less self-confidence. The bustle of ill-directed activity in high schools is a long way from the 'thoughtful place to teach thoughtful young citizens' that Sizer wants. Yet his solution seems less than complete. He recommends that pupils are tested by 'exhibitions' in which they would have to show a panel how they achieved solutions to complex multi-disciplinary problems. These 'exhibitions' would be used alongside standardised mass tests to ensure real learning. What about simply having better pen and paper tests instead of these mini-vivas? There is a raging debate about assessment methods in America at the moment, and most people agree that something better than the SATs could be devised. Sizer says this idea is pie in the sky because no one will bear the cost. But there is also a suspicion that he would prefer to leave matters in the hands of teachers anyway. He thinks schools can be rebuilt from the inside by well-intentioned parents and teachers. They do not need the heavy hand of national testing, or even business involvement in new forms of curriculum. That may be, but Horace had better act fast. It will not take too many remarks by Japanese politicians before questions about national achievement in maths and science overwhelm Sizer's wider concerns about authentic teaching. Then the teachers and students of all the Franklin Highs will be in for a rougher time. The author is a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund, NY.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA TRIAL DELAYED FOR NINE MONTHS;  </P> <P> COURT: JUDGE'S RULING IS BASED ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. DEFENSE LAWYERS  SAY THE DEPOSED DICTATOR WILL PROBABLY TESTIFY.  </P> <P> A federal judge, acknowledging the complexity of the case, Monday postponed for  almost nine months the trial of Manuel A. Noriega as attorneys for the ousted  dictator prepared a defense that they said would probably include Noriega's  taking the witness stand.  </P> <P> "Our principal objective is to have everybody ready for trial in a fair  manner," said U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, setting the new trial  date for Nov. 30. The trial had been scheduled to begin March 5.  </P> <P> But defense attorney David Lewis complained that even late November was "not  feasible, not possible" for trial on 11 counts alleging international drug  smuggling. He said defense lawyers must still obtain and study thousands of  secret U.S. documents that may relate to Noriega's past involvement as an  undercover informant for the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and  perhaps other intelligence agencies.  </P> <P> The former Panamanian strongman is expected to claim that U.S. agents  authorized or at least condoned his cooperation with Colombian drug gangs as  long as he furnished valuable information on many of their activities.  </P> <P> Taking note of Lewis' objections, Hoeveler said that "if expansion is needed,  expansion will be granted . . . but in no event will this trial start later  than January, 1991."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was learned that federal prosecutors are stepping up efforts to  persuade Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, a former confidant and military aide to  Noriega, to plead guilty in the drug-conspiracy case and become a witness for  the government against his former commander.  </P> <P> Del Cid is among five co-defendants in U.S. custody who are seeking a separate  trial from Noriega. Talks with Del Cid's Miami lawyer, Samuel I. Burstyn, began  shortly after Noriega's surrender to U.S. authorities on Jan. 3. But, in recent  days, "they're offering Del Cid the moon," according to a source familiar with  the discussions.  </P> <P> Burstyn acknowledged some progress but said that no plea agreement had been  reached. Del Cid could be a crucial witness for the government because,  according to the 1988 federal indictment, he was an intermediary who received  cash payoffs for Noriega from leaders of the Medellin drug cartel who wished to  use Panama as a transshipment point for U.S.-bound cocaine deliveries. The  cartel also established cocaine-processing laboratories in Panama with  Noriega's blessing, the indictment charged.  </P> <P> In commenting on reports of a possible deal, Noriega attorney Steve Kollin  said: "We'll wait to see if there's a plea before we worry about it."  </P> <P> Lewis, in discussing possible testimony by Noriega, said the general had  received substantial "foreign intelligence" over the years from countries other  than the United States, including Israel and Libya.  </P> <P> But James McAdams, a Justice Department attorney, told the court that such  intelligence would be subject to U.S. review before Noriega could use it at  trial.  </P> <P> McAdams asked Hoeveler to mandate such a review in an order he is preparing on  measures to prevent disclosure of secret materials at the trial. But Lewis  objected that such a directive would go beyond provisions of the federal  Classified Information Procedures Act, which Congress enacted 10 years ago to  govern the use of top-secret documents in criminal trials. Hoeveler took the  arguments under advisement.  </P></p>

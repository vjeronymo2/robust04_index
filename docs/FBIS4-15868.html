			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 Apr--In an interview with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent, Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian president's  administration, has confirmed the existence of a blacklist of  former Russian Federation people's deputies comprising 151  names. The list was drawn up by the presidential  administration's commission led by former People's Deputy  Aleksey Surkov. According to Filatov, the listed deputies are  not covered by some of the social guarantees granted in the  presidential decree of 23 September 1993.    The list includes those former deputies who had not stopped  attending the sessions of the former Supreme Soviet before 3  October and participated in mass disturbances on 3-4 October or  who incited those disturbances.    The head of the presidential administration recalled that  the  presidential decree of 6 October 1993 instructed him personally  to "establish which persons are not to be covered by the present  decree..., to make decisions single-handedly in the event of any  disputes."    Filatov said that the persons on the list would not receive  the lump-sum allowance amounting to a yearly salary, calculated  on the basis of the monthly salary at the moment when the  deputies' powers were terminated. In his words, it is a  question of 3 to 4 million rubles to be allocated to each deputy  out of the state budget, out of the people's money. As for  transferring accommodations in Moscow to the ownership of former  deputies, this issue will be dealt with on an individual basis,  the head of the presidential administration said.    He also stressed that "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is not a  man to give away municipal apartments for free", each worth  between 60,000 and 70,000 dollars at market rates. "Otherwise,  it will be difficult to explain to Muscovites why we are  allowing those who incited a civil war to retain their  accommodations," Filatov said.</p>

Limitations on Coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many streams and stream reaches in Alaska have been designated as part of the federal wild and scenic rivers system or as Conservation System Units (CSUs) by the federal government. Permittees should contact the district offices of the federal agencies that administer the designated area for additional restrictions that may apply to operating within the area. Many streams in Alaska where placer mining occurs have been designated by Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) as needing an ADFG Habitat permit with additional restrictions. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D.

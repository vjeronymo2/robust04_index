			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By station reporters (Liu Changjiang) and (Ren Youmin); </F> from the "News" program]    [Text] A seven-day regional conference on propaganda and  ideological work ended in Lhasa in the afternoon of 24 April.  The meeting pointed out: It is necessary for us to firmly  grasp the fundamental guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to  closely revolve our efforts around the central task of economic  construction; to subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall  situation of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening  up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; to  fulfill the tasks of the propaganda and ideological front in an  all-round way; and to provide an effective ideological guarantee  and a favorable environment of public opinion for accelerating  the establishment of a socialist market economic system, for  promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in  Tibet [cu jin wo qu guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa  zhan], for maintaining Tibet's social and political stability,  unity among nationalities, and unification of the motherland,  and for expediting Tibet's sweeping social and economic progress.    Deputy Secretary Danzim of the autonomous regional party  committee presided over the conference. Lieque, Buqiong, (Lu  Huimin), and Puqung, leaders of the autonomous region, attended  the conference. Du Tai, executive deputy director of the  Propaganda Department of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Party  Committee, delivered a concluding speech.    He pointed out: The regional conference on propaganda and  ideological work is a meeting that has a bearing on the overall  situation held at a crucial moment of Tibet's reform, opening  up, and economic development. It is a meeting held by the  autonomous regional party committee to stress the persistence in  grasping two links at the same time and the mobilization of the  whole party to step up propaganda and improve ideological work  to provide a more effective ideological guarantee and a more  favorable environment of public opinion for reform, development,  and stability. Through the meeting, we gained a clearer  understanding of the situation; reached a consensus; improved  our understanding; enhanced our vigor; boosted our confidence;  acquired a clearer understanding of the role played by  propaganda and ideological work; further defined the fundamental  guidelines and main tasks of propaganda and ideological work;  gained a clearer understanding of the responsibility and mission  shouldered by ourselves; and boosted our confidence in doing a  good job of propaganda and ideological work.    Du Tai said: Propaganda and ideological work have always  played an important role since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee. They are mainly manifested in the  fact that every time people's minds were emancipated to a great  extent, such emancipation invariably promoted great development  of the productive forces and sweeping social progress. It fully  proves that the more efforts we make to carry out reform and  open up, the more necessary it is for us to improve propaganda  and ideological work. Now is a crucial moment for us to deepen  reform, open up wider, and accelerate economic development.  Both the central authorities and regional party committee  proposed new tasks for and set new demands on propaganda and  ideological work. We must promote propaganda and ideological  work to a new level by making fruitful efforts so as to better  serve the drive to deepen reform and accelerate the  establishment of a socialist market economic system. All the  fundamental guidelines, basic principles, and ideas and overall  arrangements for the tasks of propaganda and ideological work  have been clearly defined for the present and for a certain  period of time to come. What counts now is that we must  conscientiously have a thorough understanding of and carry out  the guidelines of the conference, do solid work, and pay close  attention to implementation.    Du Tai pointed out: If we want to comprehensively fulfill  the tasks of the propaganda and ideological front and to promote  the work to a new level, we must further emancipate our minds,  seek truth from facts, and follow the road of reform and opening  up. Meanwhile, in compliance with the requirements raised by  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, we must arm the people with  scientific theory, use correct public opinion to guide them, use  noble spirit to mold them, and inspire them with excellent works  [of literature and art]. This is an important mission and a  glorious responsibility entrusted to us by the new period. Only  thus can we correctly propagandize the party's theories, line,  principles, and policies, and give prominence to the keynote of  our times.    To practically succeed in implementing the guidelines of the  conference, Du Tai stressed: The party committees and  governments at all levels must further improve their  understanding; treat the comprehensive implementation of the  guidelines of the conference as an important matter; practically  pay close attention to their successful implementation; draw up  and perfect various measures; and successfully handle the tasks  to be done now and in the future in a down-to-earth manner.  They must treat the successful handling of propaganda and  ideological work in agricultural and pastoral areas as the main  point for improving propaganda and ideological work in Tibet,  and handle it accordingly. They must strengthen the building of  contingents of personnel; they must raise the level of  propaganda and ideological work; they must improve cadres'  training and education; and they must continuously enhance the  political integrity as well as professional proficiency of  cadres engaged in propaganda and ideological work. If cadres  want to be qualified for propaganda and ideological work, they  must have a strong sense of responsibility for and dedication to  a revolution; unswervingly adhere to the party's basic line;  maintain close ties with the masses; uphold materialist  dialectics; have a keen political sense, remain sober-minded,  and take a clear-cut stand; maintain unity with the CPC Central  Committee in ideology and in action; and provide an effective  ideological guarantee and a favorable environment of public  opinion for Tibet's social stability and economic development.</p>

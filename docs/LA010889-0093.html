			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Forty-eight inmates in a San Jose jail locked themselves back in their cells  after the lone correctional officer passed out because of a suspected virus.  The prisoners then used an emergency phone to call for someone to help her. The  men were rewarded with ice cream at their next meal for following correct  emergency procedure, shown during a jail orientation film, according to Jail  Cmdr. Bob Conroy.  </P></p>

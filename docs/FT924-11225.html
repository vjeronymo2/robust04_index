			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Fokker acquisition talks near agreement NEGOTIATIONS between the government of the Netherlands and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany are to continue today in an effort to secure a definitive agreement on Dasa's planned acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch regional aeroplane manufacturer. Lawyers are working out the details of an informal framework agreement reached at the weekend on the three main sticking points in the long-running negotiations. These are the price to be paid for the Dutch state's shares in Fokker, the future of the 50-seater Fokker 50, and the price which Fokker will pay for aircraft components under the mooted industrial partnership. Dasa, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is expected to pay about Fl 37 (Dollars 21.15) per share for the Dutch government's 10.6m shares as well as for the 13.2m shares which Fokker will issue to its new controlling shareholder. Fokker's shares closed up Fl 2.40 at Fl 18.20 yesterday on expectations that the Dasa takeover, which has proved to be highly controversial in the Netherlands since negotiations first began in early 1992, would go ahead as originally planned. The Dutch company's shares have fallen sharply since the government provisionally endorsed the takeover in July, when the shares were worth about Fl 30.</p>

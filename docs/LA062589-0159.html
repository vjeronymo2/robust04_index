			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> New York will build the nation's first prison exclusively for drug addicts and  alcoholics as part of an $886.6-million plan to put 7,100 more inmates behind  bars, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders said. The deal calls for  construction of six new medium-security prisons scattered across Upstate New  York. It will also create seven "annexes" built onto existing prisons that  would provide drug treatment and counseling for inmates within two years of  parole eligibility. The new drug prison, to be built at a cost of $65 million  near the U.S. Army Depot in Romulus, Seneca County, will offer comprehensive  treatment.  </P></p>

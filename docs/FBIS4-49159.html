			<p>BFN     [Text] Harbin, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Expansion of Harbin  Airport will soon be started to prepare for the 1996 Asian  Winter Games, official sources here said.    Preliminary designs for the expansion had been completed and  approved, the sources said. Other preparations are either  finished or under way.    The present airport of the capital of northeast China's  Heilongjiang Province started operating in 1979. As the number  of tourists has risen drastically, the sources said, it could no  longer meet all the needs, and the opening of new routes has had  to be delayed.    The airport lounges are to be enlarged to 60,000 sq.m.  [square meters]. The plans also include building 155,000 sq.m.  of parking lots, a new air traffic control center and support  facilities.    The remodelled airport will be able to handle 6.6 million  tourists a year by the year 2005. Destinations will be  increased from 38 to 53 cities, including 11 cities in Canada,  the United States, Japan, the Republic of korea, Russia and Hong  Kong.    The 1.1-billion-yuan expansion work will be jointly financed  by the central and local governments.    Major expansion work will be completed by February 1996,  when  the Asian Winter Games will be staged, the sources said.</p>

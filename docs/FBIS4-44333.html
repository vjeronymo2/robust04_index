			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara --Uzbek President Islam Karimov wrapped up a  two-day visit to Turkey aimed at smoothing over tensions between  the two countries.    "There will be no problems between the two countries,"  Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said when asked by  journalists whether Karimov had expressed his "concern" over the  presence and activities of an Uzbek opposition leader in Turkey.  "Good ties between Turkey and Uzbekistan are very important for  the region," Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said following a  luncheon she had with Karimov and Turkish businessmen. Karimov  asked Turkish businessmen to "invest more" in Uzbekistan.  Rising to this request, Turkish business tycoon Sakip Sabanci  declared that he would send a delegation to that country in the  coming days.    However, Turkish sources said that Karimov had raised the  issue of his country's discomfort at the activities of  opposition leader Muhammed Salih and was told by the Turkish  government "not to worry as Turkey would not allow anti-Uzbek  activities from its territory."    Uzbek Communications Minister Kamilzhan Rahimov has  suggested  that Uzbekistan could use Turkey's satellite, Turksat, after it  is launched.    President Suleyman Demirel is expected to visit Tashkent in  October.</p>

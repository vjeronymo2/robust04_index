			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Observer: Water on the brain Still on the subject of big-spending water companies, water watchdog Ian Byatt's recent grim warning that water prices could double in real terms by the year 2005 has already begun to prompt some zany debate about the cost of water quality. John Gummer, the agriculture minister who made his daughter eat a very public hamburger to show that there was no risk of mad cow disease, has been one of the first to throw his weight behind Byatt's common-sense views. But Gummer may regret his enthusiasm. Writing in yesterday's Sunday Express, he asks: 'Do we really want to double our bills just to make our water 20,000 times purer than the vegetables we cook in it?' No doubt the minister knows what he is talking about, but it is hardly a ringing endorsement for Britain's vegetables. Gummer's comments are not much better than those of the Perrier-drinking classes who complain that every glass of water coming out of a London tap has been drunk six times already. Have they not heard of the hydrological cycle? Ever since the dawn of time, all the water in the world has been going round in a circle. Every time they raise a glass of water to their lips, says one expert, they risk imbibing recycled dinosaur pee.</p>

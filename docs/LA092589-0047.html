			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES TO PROTECT FLAG  </P> <P> Regarding bills and amendments to fireproof the flag:  </P> <P> What rubbish -- all of it!  </P> <P> The flag symbolizes love of country. The love felt by the individual. Burning,  blasphemy, and desecration can't touch it.  </P> <P> Symbols and words are used to represent what people see as underlying realities  that may or may not exist but, nevertheless, exist apart from the symbols and  words. What did stoning do to remedy blasphemy or the Inquisition against  heresy?  </P> <P> Obscenity? The flag flying over a Ku Klux Klan meeting is what obscenity's all  about.  </P> <P> DEAN J. SLOCUM  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

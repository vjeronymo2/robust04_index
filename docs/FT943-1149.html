			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Price of free tickets - Airlines want to change the emphasis of air mileage schemes Air mileage schemes have become something of a headache for the world's airlines. Most leading airlines now offer a bonus or incentive scheme based on the number of miles a passenger flies with it: even some of the old communist bloc carriers have become involved, with Czechoslovak Airlines running a frequent-flyer scheme, called OK Plus, for the past two years. However, free tickets are an expensive way to keep the customers happy. People still refer to a summer when Pan Am, the defunct US airline, discovered that all its flights to Hawaii were filled by passengers claiming free mileage awards. As a consequence, airlines are becoming increasingly careful about the rewards they offer and the ways in which they administer such schemes. Swissair, for instance, which runs the Qualiflyer mileage scheme along with Austrian Airlines and Crossair (and has reciprocal deals with Delta, SAS, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines), makes it clear that members claiming free tickets may not be able to get on heavily booked flights. As a further dampener, it warns: 'Your point of entry in a country need not be identical with the airport at which you board your return flight.' It is also keen to tempt you away from claiming an aircraft ticket of any description. Instead of a free flight to New York, for example, your 75,000 mileage credits could be spent on an hour in a Swissair flight simulator, two nights at the Lucknam Park hotel near Bath, or deep-sea diving in Lake Geneva. Japan Airlines, with its JAL Mileage Bank scheme, is similarly quick to suggest that mileage credits can be spent on hotel accommodation, a 'European break', or a seating upgrade, rather than a ticket. Even American Airlines, which was the first to introduce mileage credits in 1981, is clear that, however many credits you accrue on its AAdvantage frequent-flyer programme, you cannot insist on any particular free flight in return. As the airline puts it: 'We have a sophisticated system to make sure that flights don't get swamped with AAdvantage flyers.' British Airways also evidently has this in mind with its Air Miles scheme. In order to qualify for Air Miles on BA, you must be a member of the Executive Club - a privilege earned by collecting Travel Points on BA flights. You can then accrue Air Miles points only on fully flexible fares: non-discounted, unrestricted, non-Apex tickets, which account for a minority of tickets sold. The allowances, moreover, are not especially generous - a one-way flight from London to Rome can net you 80 Air Miles, but it will cost you 1,900 Air Miles for a free return ticket to the same destination. And you may not be able to fly when you want to. Travel Points, however - which entitle you to Executive Club membership, access to the executive lounges and other benefits - are relatively easy to pick up. A handful of flights to the US and you could at once become a Silver Tier Executive Club member. BA wants to take the emphasis off free flights and turn Air Miles from a something-for-nothing promotional device into part of a larger strategy to keep customers loyal. As BA puts it: 'It's more a thank you for travelling with us.' This is clearly the trend. As an industry spokesman observed: 'In a perfect world, many airlines wish they weren't in the system. The problem is, it's here and you have to finds ways to live with it.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ("kp"): "The Problem of German Names of </F> Communities in the Czech Republic Supposedly Does Not Exist"]    [Text] Prague--The draft treaty on easing border customs  clearing in railway, road, and river transportation between the  Czech Republic and Germany does not contain names of villages  and cities, and, therefore, there is no problem with their  German translation. RUDE PRAVO learned this from well-informed  circles participating in the drafting of interstate treaties  with the Federal Republic of Germany.    According to the RUDE PRAVO source, the planned treaty on  state borders between the Czech Republic and the Federal  Republic of Germany contains no names of villages or cities,  either. However, it has transpired from the negotiations  presently under way that the problems linked to names in other  planned treaties have a good chance of being resolved. For  instance, in the Czech version of the treaty on limited border  traffic or the intergovernmental agreement on establishing  tourist routes on the state borders, only Czech names for Czech  communities are to be used. This also applies to the German  version, but the German equivalent would be given in  brackets--for example, Cheb (Eger). According to the RUDE  PRAVO source, this might be acceptable to the Czech side.  Originally, the Germans pushed for a solution according to  which the Czech villages would be given German names established  under the influence of the German historical settlement in Czech  border regions. They wanted the Czech names of the villages to  be given only in brackets. The Czech side has rejected this  demand.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Preparatory work  has started on the construction of a new trunk railway line from  Handan city, in north China's Hebei Province, to Jinan,  provincial capital of east China's Shandong Province.    The new railway line will have a total length of 234 km and  will be jointly constructed by Hebei and Shandong provinces and  the Ministry of Railways, with a total investment of 1.53  billion yuan (about 175.86 million U.S. dollars).    The construction will be carried out in two phases -- a  single line for the first-phase construction and double-tracking  in the second phase.    When it is completed, the new railway line, the west end of  which be linked to the existing coal transport railway lines to  Shanxi Province, China's leading coal producer, will help  transport 20 million tons of goods a year, and three pairs of  passenger trains will be able to operate on the line a day.    Experts here say the construction of the new railway is of  special importance not only for transporting coal from Shanxi  but also for further improving transportation conditions in the  hinterland of China.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: The sombre and sensitive subject of pricing / A look at the uncertain process by which the market value of new issues is determined Institutional investors remain in a sombre mood over new issues. In what has been a record year for flotations, a rapid succession of profit warnings, poor results and share price underperformances has rattled investors It has also served to focus attention on the sensitive subject of pricing. 'The feeling remains among many fund managers that some of the new issues which came to the market during the first quarter of the year, in particular, were overpriced,' says Mr Geoff Douglas, smaller companies analyst at BZW. This attitude has been reflected in several recent issues where companies have been forced to scale back their valuation expectations. Cellular components group Filtronic Comtek, for example, which was expecting a market valuation of about Pounds 60m, had to settle for Pounds 44m. TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting Group, was valued at Pounds 205m against hopes of about Pounds 225m. But significantly, both companies have been successful at the issue prices dictated by the market. Filtronic leapt to a 15 per cent premium within days of its flotation, while TLG's offer has been subscribed 3.2 times. Its shares begin trading tomorrow . Fashion retailer New Look, however, refused to countenance the price institutions were putting on its shares last week, and became the latest in a growing list of companies to postpone its float. While criticisms have been levelled at the quality of the companies coming to the market and at investors' eagerness to exit at the earliest opportunity and the highest price, it is the financial advisers which have borne the brunt of the disquiet over pricing. However, they counter that pricing is largely a function of investor demand, which was high during the last quarter of 1993 and the beginning of this year, helping to push up prices. They also argue that, as they are often involved in placing only part of a company's equity, it is not in their interests to float a company at a price that is not sustainable, because there may well be more to come. Traditionally, new issues have been priced at a discount to either their nearest listed competitors, or to the sector, or to the market, the purpose being to give investors an incentive to subscribe for the shares. Keen pricing should also stimulate demand in the after market when the shares begin trading. The two-week period prior to the shares being priced is a crucial one when the company and its broker meet with potential investors and gauge feedback to the issue. 'Although it is not a completely passive process, pricing is largely a reflection of institutional appetite,' says Mr Paul Hamilton, a director of corporate finance at SG Warburg, the investment bank. Another adviser commented: 'If the institutions won't wear it then it won't get away. It's as simple as that. They call the tune.' Mr Tim Linacre, corporate finance director at Panmure Gordon, says that the important thing is to establish benchmarks for a company so that a valuation can then be more easily established. The process is, however, more problematic when companies are not easily defined. 'The pricing issue becomes less scientific and more selective after that,' Mr Linacre says. Panmure was responsible for advising Filtronic, the first company in its field to come to the London market. 'We had to tell the institutions what we thought the company would make and apply our own multiple to the prospective earnings', says Mr Linacre. 'Not all of them bought the story and we eventually settled for a price at the bottom of the range we had set ourselves.' But the company was supported by firm American interest - the placing was being undertaken simultaneously in the US - and a strong management story. As a result, the flotation price put the shares on a prospective p/e of about 20 times, still well ahead of the market average of 13.5 times for 1995. Other companies which have jumped or dived on or shortly after the day of issue have similar individual tales explaining their performances, making generalisations over pricing difficult. Finelist, a motor components group, jumped to a 16 per cent premium on its first day's trading, which might indicate a slight underpricing. Like Filtronic, Finelist was a difficult company to compare with others and the shares came on a slight premium to the market on a prospective basis, although at a discount to its sector. BZW was the broker to the issue and Mr Douglas says that the strong early performance of the shares enabled the company to come back to the market in July to finance an acquisition. Coda, the accountancy software group, came to the market in February on a prospective p/e of about 19, according to analysts, again a hefty premium to the market. Unfortunately, this was also at the market's peak, and the shares trailed downwards, although outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share. However, the group dived into the red in July and the shares lost 25 per cent of their value. ED&amp;F Man, the commodity broker, also suffered from the sour sentiment towards new issues, having its issue price reduced by 15 per cent from the expected figure when it floated in September. The offer price gave it a notional yield of 6 per cent; the prospective p/e was about 9 times, a good discount to the food manufacturing sector's 12. But the shares went to a 10 per cent discount within two weeks of their issue, which the company's advisers attribute to the falling market. They have since recovered but are still trading below their issue price. Mr Douglas says that investor nervousness has prompted an increase in yields among new issues. 'In a growth market, the yield plays little part in investor interest. But now they've started to creep back up again.' One institutional investor added: 'Falling prices and improving yields is the only way the new issues will come back into favour with the big institutions.'</p>

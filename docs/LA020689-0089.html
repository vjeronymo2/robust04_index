			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DEATH;  </P> <P> SNOW FALLS IN WIDE AREA AS MERCURY DIPS  </P> <P> Arctic air continued to assault Southern California on Sunday, bringing reports  of snowfall in low-lying areas from Riverside to Orange County, keeping high  temperatures at record or near-record low levels and prompting officials to  issue freeze warnings for some agricultural areas.  </P> <P> Orange County officials said Sunday that the death of a man believed to have  been a transient may have been caused by exposure to the cold weekend weather,  and there were reports of snow falling in Rancho Santa Margarita and Trabuco  Canyon, although it dissolved as it touched the ground.  </P> <P> Orange County Supervising Deputy Coroner Rick Plows said the body was found  early Saturday morning near the Slater Avenue overpass of the San Diego Freeway  in Fountain Valley. The victim, who carried no identification, was pronounced  dead at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center and may be "a  possible hypothermia death," Plows said.  </P> <P> The man was described as a white male 5-feet, 9 inches tall, 124 pounds, about  60 years old, with a 3- or 4-day growth of beard, black-gray hair, hazel eyes  and a tattoo spelling "Jeef" in a heart on his upper right arm. He was wearing  light-blue jeans, a light-blue, long-sleeve shirt, a dark-blue-and-tan,  long-sleeve sweater and yellow-and-brown rosary beads with a white cross around  his neck.  </P> <P> "Our examination today revealed that he has had a stroke in the past," Plows  said. Anyone with information about the victim is asked to contact the  sheriff-coroner's office at (714) 647-7400.  </P> <P> Sunday's high in Santa Ana reached 55 degrees, after a low of 39 Saturday  night, said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts to The Times.  </P> <P> The forecast for today and Tuesday is mostly clear skies and cool temperatures,  with daytime temperatures in the 50s and upper 40s, Dittmann said. Winds are  expected to gust up to 30 m.p.h. below the canyons, and nights will be very  cold, especially in wind-protected areas, he said.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol dispatcher Janelle Clem said there were reports of  snow "in Trabuco Canyon, Rancho Santa Margarita, a bunch of places."  </P> <P> "But it's not sticking," she said. "Maybe tomorrow."  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles Civic Center, a peak reading of 53 degrees was recorded,  just 1 degree warmer than the coldest high for the date, recorded in 1909. The  mercury at UC Riverside reached just 47, shattering the old low maximum of 51  degrees set in 1949.  </P> <P> Snow showers were reported Sunday in the San Bernardino Valley, and snow stuck  to the ground for a time near Rancho Cucamonga, the National Weather Service  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temperatures in Mid-20s  </P> <P> March Air Force Base, near Riverside, reported snow showers at 1,500 feet.  Temperatures were expected to drop into the mid-20s this morning and Tuesday,  prompting the weather service to issue a frost advisory for inland valleys.  </P> <P> Cold air moved into San Diego County, with the weather service saying the  coldest inland areas will drop to the upper 20s. Agricultural interests in  those areas were alerted to take measures to protect crops from frost.  </P> <P> Tonight will be even colder, the weather service said, as lows drop to the low  and middle 20s. The frost advisory will remain in effect.  </P> <P> In Northern California, light snow covered the higher hills of the Bay Area on  Sunday after overnight temperatures dipped below freezing.  </P></p>

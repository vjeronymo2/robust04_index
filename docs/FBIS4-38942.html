			<p>BFN     [Text] Latvia would like to see the territory of Abrene as  part of Latvia, as decreed in the Latvian-Russian peace treaty  of 1920. This was stated at a press conference today devoted to  Latvia's participation in the Balladur, or European stability,  pact, by the acting foreign minister, Justice Minister Egils  Levits. The Estonian and Latvian delegations to the conference  in Paris on the inauguration of the pact presented a joint  document on the border question, declaring that the state  borders of Europe are based on internationally recognized and  binding treaties. As is known, part of the Abrene district, an  area of 1,260 square km, was apportioned to Russia in August  1944. Nine Eastern and Central European countries, which wish  to join the European Union, have created discussion forums,  namely the Baltic Table and the Central European Table, at which  the other interested countries and the European Union will take  part. The Baltic Table will be attended by the Baltic  countries, perhaps also Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and the United  States.    Russia will specify issues to be reviewed and will only then  decide on partciipation at the Baltic Table.</p>

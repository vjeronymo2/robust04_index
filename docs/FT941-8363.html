			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Movie marathons fight it out - At the Berlin Film Festival Nigel Andrews is caught between the pleasure principle and art through pain This year's two retrospectives are devoted to Erich Von Stroheim and Sophia Loren: strange - nay mind-boggling - bedfellows. Erich's is the face louring from the posters with monocle, army cap and interrogation-room stare. Sophia's is the face with sunripe pout and cascading Mediterranean locks. The twinning is surely symbolic. Put Prussian strictness with Mediterranean hedonism and what do you get? Something like the 44th Berlin Filmfestspiele itself. The festival, like most of world cinema today, is caught between pleasure-principle picturegoing and the old ethic of art through pain. Nowhere is the tension greater than in the two main movie-marathons, both French. Jacques Rivette's six-hour, two-part Jeanne La Pucelle was shown within the same 24 hours as Alain Resnais's 4 3/4 -hour, two-film diptych Smoking and No Smoking, based on Alan Ayckbourn's play cycle Intimate Exchanges. Both films flirt with avant-gardism while simultaneously wooing le grand public. Rivette's epic passes Joan of Arc's story through the deconstruction machine: no windy heroics, much blending of Brechtian tableaux with Bressonian line-delivery. (Never let the voice range beyond one octave.) But the film is still a surprising dollop of colour, accessibility and class performances from the hitherto hermetic Rivette. Resnais, 30 years after Marienbad, is still exploring the paradoxes of time and memory. But this time it is 'Last Year In Hutton Buscel'. Here in Ayckbourn's twee north-east English town (Scarborough by another name, but all conjured on a soundstage), a headmaster (Pierre Arditti) and his wife (Sabine Azema) and six other characters (all played by Arditti and Azema) play Musical Destinies with a story scripted for multiple-choice developments. Now she runs off with the gardener; now she doesn't. Now he falls in love with the daily help; now he doesn't. Resnais/Ayckbourn keep pressing that narrative rewind button. I thought Rivette won the Old French Masters prizefight. Resnais keeps dancing over the same stretch of canvas until interest yields to tedium. But Rivette, boxing clever with history, makes his Joan (superbly played by Sandrine Bonnaire) both a myth-glamourised icon and a modern girl fighting for sexual-political equality. The film is accurate, it claims, to every dot and comma of researched history. Hence no doubt its teasing rhythm, alternating a quotidian banality of bills and meals and social minutiae with the horrors and heroisms of war. Shown in the noncompetitive Panorama section, Rivette's film is not in the running for prizes. The favourite Golden Bear challengers so far are Krszystof Kieslowski's Three Colours White and Tomas Gutierrez Alea's Strawberry And Chocolate from Cuba. The Polish film is part two of Kieslowski's tricouleur trilogy, tackling 'Equality' after his Blue dealt with 'Liberty.' (You need a computer to keep up with all the diptychs, trilogies and films fleuves of modern cinema). For a movie called White this comedy is bracingly black. It is very funny about life in 'liberated' Eastern Europe, where the Warsovian hero (Zbiegniew Zamachowski), scheming to lure his estranged French girlfriend over from Paris, can buy anything on the markets of the New Capitalism from used cars to dead bodies. All come in handy as the plot shifts gear all the way from gentle romance to cynical overdrive. Strawberry And Chocolate is also free with the gear-shift. For romance, here is one-sided gay passion between young Diego (Jorge Perrugorria), an artist whose high-camp manners and high-risk artworks attract the attentions of the State, and the 'straight' young Communist David (Vladimir Cruz) sent in to sound him out or set him right. For cynicism, here are buckets of witty scorn thrown over the prejudices and repressive edicts of Castro's Cuba. But Berlin has long been the cinematic capital of gay liberation. The most fanfared American competition entry here is Philadelphia, with Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks fighting Aids and homophobia from a Hollywood hospital bed. Also rallying to the demo have been Zero Patience ('first ever Aids musical'), Grief (almost first ever Aids comedy), Go Fire (no Aids, but lots of lesbians) and Coming Out Under Fire and One Nation Under God (gayness and anti-gayness in America and points East). Moral: a city with the world's most famous fallen Wall knows all about barriers between people and how to deal with them. Ironically, the one barrier Berlin is still struggling to demolish, cinematically, is that between East and West. Every year the festival proclaims its chief loyalty to Europe, especially the neglected movie cultures of the former East; then it exasperates everyone by filling the cinemas with films from the US. This has two effects. It gives Berlin a schizoid personality: paying lip service to Our Art while showcasing Their Entertainment. And it allows Hollywood bounce and professionalism to expose the inadequacies of much modern Euro-fare. Who wants to sit through another dog-eared, chain-smoking French policier even when lent spurious novelty value by a bisexual woman sleuth (Anemone in Tonie Marshall's Pas Tres Catholique); or a damp-squib German satire about film-making (Reinhard Munster's Back To Square One); or another Russian movie attempting to revive the stylistic ghost of Tarkovsky (Aleksandr Sokurov's Whispering Pages)? Even Asia, regular miracle-worker at recent Euro-festivals, has failed to deliver the goods at Berlin '94. Try China-Hong Kong's Competition-opener Sparkling Fox, a sort of reject Aesop fable hijacked by the Orient, or Japan's 800 Two-Lap Runners, all about the existential tremors of school track-racing. By contrast America, even outside the Competition, gave us DW Pennebaker's humming docu-feature about the Clinton presidential campaign The War Room; Francois Girard's massively witty mock-biopic 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould, a sort of musicological Citizen Kane; and my favourite fringe lunacy at Berlin to date, the documentary Tigrero. Though this has a Finnish director, Miko Kaurismaki, the stars, story and inspiration all come from across the Atlantic. We watch US film-makers Sam Fuller and Jim Jarmusch revisit the Brazilian jungle where Sam, 40 years ago, shot footage for an aborted John Wayne movie, the eponymous Tigrero. Scratching around for memories and survivors, their double act plays like a lost-in-the-forest version of Waiting For Godot. Jarmusch is droll and deadpan; Fuller is crackpot and garrulous; the scenery is surreal; and the Indians stand around wondering what has hit them and how long the Mad People from Hollywood are staying. At Berlin, as far as many of us in this jungle are concerned, they can stay indefinitely.</p>

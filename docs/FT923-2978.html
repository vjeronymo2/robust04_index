			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena - Opera in Innsbruck Several of the most dashing recent recordings of baroque opera have come out of Rene Jacobs's summer performances in Innsbruck: Handel's Flavio and Giulio Cesare, Monteverdi's Poppea, works by Cavalli and Cesti. This year Mr Jacobs was looking for something Spanish, since in Austria 1492 is being remembered for Spain's eastward rather than its westward expansion. Hence the happy choice of the considerably obscure Francesco Conti (1682-1732), since he was responsible for one of the earliest Don Quixote operas, Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena. This was one of two dozen stage works Conti wrote for the Viennese court. It was played at the 1719 carnival, and three years later reached Hamburg, with the recitatives translated into German by Mattheson, who recorded that it was 'impossible to forebear laughing even at a first reading through the score.' Innsbruck's Landestheatre production let the piece smile once more. Mr Jacobs has a way of brushing accompaniment under the voices, so that although the reproduction instruments of his Concerto Koln can sound brisk and characterful, the projection is fundamentally vocal and from the stage. Even with a number of big da capo arias and a playing time of close to four and a half hours, the opera fairly slipped along on the skid of pathos and humour which the librettists Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati ably conveyed from their source. Of course, Conti helped. Unlike the contemporary operas of Handel, Don Chisciotte has a great variety of vocal types: alto castrati (here counter-tenors) for the rival swains Cardenio and Fernando, sopranos for the girls Dorotea and Lucinda, another male alto for the frenetic barber whose bowl Don Quixote takes for a magic helmet, a treble for a page, inevitably a buffo bass for Sancho Panza, and an aptly erratic tenor-baritone for Quixote himself. There is also great variety of characterisation. Cardenio and Lucinda are paragons of the sweetly amorous-lyrical: parted by the plot for most of the opera, they naturally have their centres in plaintive ardour and patience respectively, though even in their cases cliche is skipped by creative enthusiasm: the piece is full of melodic bravado, bursting towards the reckless simplicity of a later age of Italian opera. Fernando is an angrier sort (Jeffrey Gall was a responsive contrast with Derek Lee Ragin as Cardenio). Dorotea is an interesting variant, in that much of her part is sung tongue-in-cheek as she leads Don Quixote a dance, pretending to be an exotic queen dispossessed by a giant: the role requires - and got from Jennifer Smith - grandeur for a first aria of minor-key siciliana lament, and bold-faced comic irony for much of the rest. Again there was a suitable contrast with the sustainedly beautiful performance of Audrey Michael as Lucinda. Michael Schopper and Isabelle Poulenard romped through the vigorous duets for Sancho and a maid at the inn. Dominique Visse, as the barber, added to his repertory of high-register hysterics. Nicolas Rivenq kept up a wild thrust as Don Quixote, tottering on the edge of absurdity: it is hard to know whether it was just his performance that revealed so much Quixote-ish mad extravagance and absorbed self-pity in the part. Gerd Turk had the luckless task of representing normality in the person of Lope. Judith Vindevogel was his bright boy attendant. Nobody was much helped by the production. Roland Topor's designs had adventitious jokes on the wrong scale - like Quixote's costuming in sheets torn from romances, barely discernible even from the third row of the stalls. And the singers seemed to be moving and reacting without much guidance from the director, Jean-Louis Jacopin. But the musical distinction and energy were captivating, and the piece came up as something rather remarkable, well worth revival again before another 270 years have gone by.</p>

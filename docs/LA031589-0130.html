			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STICKY VALVE FIXED; SHUTTLE CREW TO COMPLETE MISSION  </P> <P> Discovery's astronauts overcame a sticky valve in the electrical system and  began restoring full power to the space shuttle today, dispelling any need to  cut short the five-day mission, NASA said.  </P> <P> The shuttle started drawing fuel again from the hydrogen tank that had been  closed because of the valve, said Al Pennington, a flight director.  </P> <P> "We're repowering back up at this time," he said. "It appears that the tank is  back in operation, which means we're back on a nominal time line."  </P> <P> The valve, which started jamming shortly after the launch Monday, had forced  the crew to dim lights and shut down unneeded computers to conserve power. The  astronauts were in no danger, but officials said the problem could have forced  the shuttle to return to Earth on Friday, one day early.  </P> <P> Despite a dim cabin and a careful use of electrical power, the astronauts kept  to their schedule of conducting experiments and photographing environmentally  damaged places on Earth during their second full morning in space.  </P> <P> They focused a powerful 70-millimeter camera on the Tanzanian plains in Africa  and then looked for evidence of pollution near Zanzibar, where a coral reef is  dying. Other targets included the scars from a recent fire in the Everglades  and an erupting volcano in Guatemala.  </P> <P> While over Australia, then in darkness, Discovery commander Michael L. Coats  turned Discovery to get TV views of what he called "spectacular thunderstorms."  </P> <P> Coats focused a television camera on crew mates Dr. James M. Bagian and Robert  C. Springer as they made a minor repair on an experiment and vacuumed away  debris.  </P> <P> "Bob and I almost had a fight over the vacuum cleaner," Bagian joked. "We are  the prime operators of that instrument, and we wanted a chance to show off our  prowess."  </P></p>

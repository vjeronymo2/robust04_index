			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Curious case of the Abbey's habits: John Gapper says the actions of a former UK building society have prompted questions about its strategy Each week, about 100 letters arrive at the headquarters of Abbey National, the UK mortgage lender and bank, asking for mysteries to be solved. The letters are addressed to Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective, who lived at 221b Baker Street, Abbey's address. Yet even Holmes's analytical powers might have been tested by the strange case of the former building society. Abbey has behaved oddly of late. Within one month, it has disclosed bad debt provisions of Pounds 94m in France because of poor commercial property lending; sold its 347-branch estate agency business for Pounds 8m after sustaining a loss of Pounds 258m over six years; and set up a joint venture with Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, to sell companies derivative financial products such as interest rate swaps and options. If Abbey were a Conan Doyle character, its relatives would have visited Holmes to express their bafflement by this time. As it is, its share price has dropped by 4 per cent relative to the stock market over the past month and financial analysts have been asking questions. 'Abbey is sending odd signals to the market by going into derivatives, and I am a bit worried about it,' says Mr John Wriglesworth, of UBS Securities, the stockbroker. Abbey's latest revelations have only added to a sense that it is a curiosity among UK financial services companies. It is the first and only of the country's 88 building societies to have converted from mutual ownership. Since its flotation of shares four years ago, it has carried on raising money from retail depositors and lending to mortgage borrowers. But it has also diversified into a series of new businesses. The biggest diversification has been its growth of treasury assets, including syndicated commercial loans, debt securities and even six aircraft leased to British Airways. Its treasury assets have more than doubled since 1990 to Pounds 24.8bn, compared with Pounds 42bn in mortgages. It has reined in growth of treasury assets this year, but Abbey may eventually have to allocate a further Pounds 35m of its capital resources to the derivatives unit. Profits from Abbey's treasury have helped to maintain its earnings over a tough period in the housing market. But they have also led to questions over whether it is taking on risks it does not understand. This happened to TSB, the retail bank, which has had to make provisions of Pounds 880m on bad corporate loans made by Hill Samuel, the merchant bank it bought after its 1987 share flotation. Abbey's management reorganisation announced yesterday is partly an attempt to prevent mishaps by imposing stronger controls. Yet Mr Peter Birch, Abbey's chief executive, says it does not mind attracting attention by marching out of step. 'We are a hybrid,' he says. 'I hope that no other societies convert because we succeed by being different. If a lot of others follow, it might clutter our way forward.' The difficulty is defining exactly what its way forward is. Abbey's traditional business of mortgage lending using funds deposited by savers has been squeezed by interest rate falls since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism last year. As savers have transferred money into investments such as unit trusts that offer higher returns, it has become cheaper to raise funds by borrowing from wholesale money markets. This has worked in favour of banks such as Abbey in the short term, because societies have strict limits on wholesale funds. Abbey has sold 23 per cent of all new mortgages this year, largely using wholesale funds. But its share of retail savings has fallen, and lending margins have narrowed owing to the cost of such funds. Its scope to raise margins has been curtailed because most new mortgages have been fixed rate. Mr Wriglesworth argues Abbey has made a crucial switch of strategy by concentrating on wholesale-funded lending. 'It is starting to behave like a bank rather than a society,' he says. He thinks this could damage Abbey's ability to ride out future dips in profitability. Because of treasury assets and fixed-rate lending, its margins are more tightly fixed than its main competitor, the Halifax Building Society. As banks try to increase mortgage lending, competition is likely to stiffen. Yet Abbey's last attempt to defend itself against competition led to its blunder in estate agency. In common with other societies, it bought agents to ensure that they would recommend Abbey mortgages. But, by the time of the sale, it was only selling 5 per cent of its mortgages through its agents, and had suffered big losses. The second mistake was to expand into France. It bought a mortgage and commercial property lending business for Pounds 40m in 1989, but has been hit by the commercial property downturn. Mr Ian Harley, Abbey's finance director, says this is one reason why it is no longer treating subsidiaries as separate profit centres. 'There is a tension between control and delegation, and in France we arguably got it wrong,' he says. Mr Birch also points out that it has made other investments in its retail business that he believes worthwhile. One is the Pounds 500m spent since flotation on upgrading its 660 branches. The other is the Pounds 285m purchase of insurance company Scottish Mutual in 1991. This has created a wholly owned life insurance arm through which Abbey sells its customers savings products and policies linked to its endowment mortgages. Yet such investments do not distinguish Abbey sharply from Halifax or other societies. The area in which it has far more flexibility is its treasury. Abbey's flotation gave it a large amount of capital, and allowed a wider use of the money. Societies' treasuries are largely confined to raising funds for mortgage lending. Abbey operates under the looser constraints of Bank of England supervision. Abbey's ratios of capital to assets are far stronger than other large UK banks, which gives it an AA credit rating. This allows it to borrow and lend on international capital markets at premium rates. It has gradually moved from simply financing mortgage lending to leasing equipment in order to cut its tax charge and investing in securities. It made Pounds 66m profit on these activities in the first half of this year. Yet there are two concerns. One is over the risks that Abbey may be running, epitomised by the move into derivatives. Mr Harley insists that Abbey errs on the side of caution. He cites its policy of ensuring that 90 per cent of all leasing assets are underwritten by other banks. 'We deliberately take smaller spreads than we might do because we are extremely careful. We are very strict about risk,' he says. The second problem is the logic of such activity. Mr Birch admits it is largely opportunistic: Abbey has the capital and this is a convenient way of using it. 'We think that one of the safest ways of using our capital for now is to put it into treasury assets,' he says. Yet such corporate lending and finance activities - no matter how profitable they are - do not fit easily with its roots as a mortgage lender. The obvious alternatives would be either to use its capital to acquire another retail bank or mortgage lender, or to give it back to shareholders. Mr Birch says Abbey has examined nearly 150 other companies since flotation with a view to buying one, but has not yet found a good fit. He does not favour handing back capital because Abbey wants to keep its credit rating, and even raise it to the rarefied heights of AAA. Abbey will soon face stronger pressure to make sense of a business that stretches from making unsecured personal loans to trading interest rate swaps. In July next year, five years after the flotation, the temporary ban on the bank being taken over will lapse. It would be expensive to swallow since its shares are currently worth about Pounds 5.2bn, but any substantial error could now bear the penalty of increasing its vulnerability. Mr Birch is sanguine about such a notion, arguing that no other financial services company is in a position to take on Abbey. 'If anyone can really extract increased value out of our business, then good luck to them,' he says. But while it remains a hybrid, it will continue to provoke curiosity. If Abbey's management cannot resolve the mystery, others may be tempted to take up residence at 221b Baker Street.</p>

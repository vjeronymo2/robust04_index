			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> UPDATING BIRTH CONTROL;  </P> <P> LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, RESEARCHERS EXAMINE EFFECTS OF NEW METHODS  </P> <P> Birth control research moves slowly, but it is moving, researchers say.  </P> <P> Among the technologies working their way through the investigational pipeline  are:  </P> <P> Norplant: An implantable contraceptive that inhibits ovulation and also  thickens cervical mucous, impeding sperm penetration. Six match-size silastic  capsules are implanted in the upper arm and release the ovulation-inhibiting  hormone levonorgestrel over a period of five years.  </P> <P> The Population Council, the New York-based nonprofit organization that  developed Norplant, filed for FDA marketing approval last August, but has not  yet received it, spokeswoman Sandra Waldman said.  </P> <P> A potential drawback: A change in bleeding, including prolonged menstruation or  "breakthrough" bleeding, said Dr. Donna Shoupe, a USC assistant professor of  obstetrics and gynecology who's studied Norplant.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 97%-99%.  </P> <P>  RU-486: Perhaps the most controversial technique under study in the United  States, RU-486 is manufacturer's shorthand for a drug that interrupts pregnancy  in early stages. In France, it was withdrawn from the market in October, 1988,  after a campaign by pro-life advocates. Two days later, however, the government  ordered the drug back on the market.  </P> <P> A so-called anti-progestin, RU-486 works by "blocking the effects of  progesterone, the hormone that supports pregnancy," said Dr. David A. Grimes, a  professor of obstetrics/gynecology and preventive medicine who's studying the  drug at USC. In the absence of progesterone, the lining of the uterus breaks  down as it would in a normal menstrual cycle.  </P> <P> In the last four years, 13 different regimens have been tested on 300 women in  USC studies, Grimes said. Most promising: a single 600-milligram dose that  interrupted pregnancy 90% of the time in 50 women studied.  </P> <P> Taken within two weeks of a missed menstrual period, the drug is 80% effective,  according to a new report by Washington's nonprofit Population Crisis  Committee, and even more so when combined with synthetic prostaglandins.  Possible side effects include hemorrhage and incomplete or failed abortion.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 95%.  </P> <P>  Nonscalpel Vasectomy: Under study by the Population Council and VasTech  Medical Products Inc., of New Brunswick, N.J., nonscalpel vasectomy promises  almost immediate recovery. After a local anesthetic is administered, scrotal  skin is punctured with a Vasocclude, a device much like a stapler with  preloaded clips, and the device is maneuvered near the vas deferens or  spermatic duct, which is sealed off by a clip.  </P> <P> Clinical studies are scheduled to start this year.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 99%.  </P> <P>  Plug Sterilization: In this potentially reversible male sterilization  procedure, two tiny puncture holes are made in each vas deferens, then two  silicone plugs are inserted into the ducts. A tiny space between the two acts  as a trap for sperm that may have gotten past the first plug.  </P> <P> "The vas is hardly damaged," said Dr. Lourens Zaneveld , a professor of  obstetrics and gynecology at Chicago's Rush University. "When the plugs are  removed, a small suture recloses the duct and the hole closes almost  immediately."  </P> <P> Preliminary clinical studies, under way here and in South America, showed a  third of the men were sterile but in two-thirds, some sperm still passed by the  plugs.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 99% as contraceptive; 90% reversibility.  </P> <P>  Anti-Sperm Vaccine: Human studies are expected to begin this year or next for  a vaccine that attacks sperm and reduces their "fertilizability," said  Northwestern researcher Dr. Gerald Zatuchni , a professor of obstetrics and  gynecology at Northwestern University in Chicago, Ill. First, an enzyme called  lactic dehydrogenase is extracted from the sperm and injected into his partner.  She, in turn, develops antibodies that attack the sperm, reducing motility and  ability to fertilize eggs.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 90%.  </P> <P>  Injectables for Women: A biodegradable microcapsule of norethindrone, the same  synthetic hormone found in most oral contraceptives, is injected into the  buttocks, allowing for slow release of the hormone. Farthest along in clinical  trials is a 90-day capsule; 30-day and 6-month systems are also being  developed, said Zatuchni.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 99%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Injectables for Men: Periodic injections of a synthetic version of the hormone  testosterone may reduce sperm counts to zero or other safe levels, researchers  say. Testosterone inhibits sperm production much like oral contraceptives  inhibit ovulation, said Dr. C. Alvin Paulsen, a researcher and professor at the  University of Washington.  </P> <P> Other researchers, including Dr. Ronald S. Swerdloff, director of the UCLA  Population Research Center and professor of medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical  Center in Torrance, are studying injections of testosterone combined with other  substances that together "turn off" the sperm production system.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: Unknown.  </P> <P>  Female Condoms: "When people first look at a female condom, they're not too  impressed," said USC's Shoupe, one of several researchers investigating various  types of female condoms, also called intravaginal pouches. The one she's  studying looks like a plastic tube with a ring at each end. The upper ring is  inserted like a diaphragm to prevent sperm passage while the other is  positioned near the vaginal opening. Prelubricated with the spermicide  nonoxynol-9, such condoms may help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted  diseases, researchers say.  </P> <P>  Expected effectiveness: 88%-96%.  </P> <P> </P></p>

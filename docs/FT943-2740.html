			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: ITT looks to expand through asset sales ITT, the US financial, leisure and manufacturing conglomerate, yesterday confirmed it was seeking buyers for its ITT Financial subsidiary, a middle-ranking US finance company, in a sale that could fetch between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn. ITT said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes, but it is understood the group wants to use at least some of the funds to pay for a big expansion of its leisure and entertainment business. This could even include a bid for General Electric's NBC television network. Goldman Sachs was yesterday appointed advisers to the sale. Mr Rand Araskog, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday ITT was selling ITT Financial because it wanted a greater balance between its financial service, manufacturing and hotel and entertainment businesses. At present, the financial side dominates the other two divisions. Apart from ITT Financial, it includes the Hartford insurance business, one of the biggest operations of its type in the US. Hartford is not being sold. Although ITT's existing leisure and entertainment interests include the Sheraton hotel group, they rank behind the manufacturing side in terms of turnover and profit. The manufacturing arm includes a big auto parts unit making anti-lock braking systems. ITT Financial offers a range of services to businesses and individuals, including commercial equipment and real estate loans, small business loans, home mortgages, consumer loans, and related insurance products. Last year it made net profits of Dollars 205m on revenues of Dollars 1.44bn. Possible buyers would include other finance companies in similar business areas. One candidate is GE Capital, part of General Electric. ITT's reported interest in acquiring the NBC television network from General Electric raises the possibility of a part exchange. However, General Electric's favoured buyer for NBC is believed to be Time Warner, the US media and entertainment group. ITT has been sidelined pending an outcome of talks between the other two parties. ITT's interest in NBC follows its acquisition last month of Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex for Dollars 1.1bn, in partnership with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television company. ITT is also in the process of taking over Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group.</p>

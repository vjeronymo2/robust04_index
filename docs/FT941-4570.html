			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Gambro increases earnings by 30% The weak Swedish krona helped Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment maker, to increase its profits by 30 per cent to SKr976m (Dollars 122m) for 1993. The improvement encouraged the group to raise its dividend by 25 per cent to SKr5.50 per share. Earnings per share rose 29 per cent to SKr20.86. Sales were 43 per cent higher at SKr9.05bn. The increase would have been 12 per cent if acquisitions and currency effects were excluded. The group's renal care division benefited from strong growth in sales of dialysis machines and disposable products, which lifted sales by an underlying 11 per cent to SKr5.95bn. Growth in cardiovascular surgery slowed, due to increased market competition, but sales were still up 3 per cent, excluding currencies, at SKr1.18bn. The group is proposing a four-for-one share split, increasing shares in issue to 118m from 29.5m. BCP, the newly-formed consumer products company which is set to become an important cash generator for Volvo, yesterday reported pro-forma profits after financial items in the second half of 1993 of SKr711m, up from SKr552m in the second half of 1992. BCP was formed late last year following the break-up of Procordia, a drugs-to-food group jointly controlled by the Swedish state and Volvo. It includes Swedish Match and many of Sweden's best-known beverage and food brands. It is 73.7 per cent owned by Volvo, which is bidding for the remaining shares. The new company showed sales in the last six months of SKr11.1bn, marginally ahead of the SKr10.9bn in 1992. Pro-forma full-year 1993 profits of SKr1.26bn were down from SKr1.69bn in 1992, due to divestments. A dividend of SKr1.70 per share is to be paid for the 1993 second-half period.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALABAMA SERVES UP FAST-FOOD COUNTRY;  </P> <P> CONCERTS: THE GROUP PERFORMED BLAND AND PREDICTABLE MUSIC, BUT OPENING ACT  CLINT BLACK SHOWED A GENUINE FEEL FOR TRADITION. BOTH WILL APPEAR SUNDAY AT THE  IRVINE MEADOWS AMPHITHEATRE.  </P> <P> If fast food was country music, it would sound like Alabama: bland,  predictable, nutritionless, the same menu at every location and -- of course --  billions served, including the wildly enthusiastic sold-out crowd at the Greek  Theatre in Los Angeles recently. All that was missing was the grease.  </P> <P> With songs stitched together from simple sing-along melodies and feel-good  greeting-card phrases, patter built around "Hello (fill in your town here)!"  cheerleading and a presentation that seemed scripted in every detail (the  pre-encore portion of the concert ran one hour on the nose), Alabama showed  just what can be achieved without even having to try.  </P> <P> Lead singer Randy Owen switched, as appropriate, from mugging funny man to  patriotic booster to sentimental fool with all the depth of a lounge singer. In  fact, the only time he stepped out from the script was to acknowledge all those  important music industry folks at the show with a sappy version of "Bridge Over  Troubled Water," which he said the band used to do when it was a lounge act  back in Myrtle Beach, S.C., many moons ago. At least he acknowledges his roots.  </P> <P> By comparison, opening act Clint Black is a home-cooked meal of biscuits and  gravy. At the Greek, the grinning Texan showed the legitimate feel for various  country traditions (from Bob Wills swing to Merle Haggard work ethic) that has  placed him just a step away from joining Randy Travis and George Strait in  mega-headliner matinee idol status.  </P> <P> But like Travis and Strait, Black seems all too willing to just slip easily  into the cozy country envelope and showed little desire or inclination to push  against it. Encoring with a Jimmy Buffett song hardly counts.  </P> <P>  Alabama, Clint Black and Suzy Bogguss will play Sunday at 8 p.m. at Irvine  Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Tickets: $19.50 to $27.  Information: (714) 855-8096.  </P> <P> </P></p>

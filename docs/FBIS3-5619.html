The officials said Sirivut made the call in a half-hour  meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Both  Sirivut and Hata serve concurrently as foreign ministers and  deputy prime ministers.    Sirivut arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day accompanying  Co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen to a two-day  meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of  Cambodia (ICORC), which starts Thursday.    He was quoted as saying that in order to further consolidate  ties between Cambodia and Japan his government is considering an  early reopening of its embassy in Tokyo.    Since the fall of the Lon Nol government to the Khmer Rouge  in 1975, the embassy in Tokyo's Akasaka District has been  occupied by Cambodians of various political persuasions but it  has not been functioning in an official capacity.    Officials said Sirivut told Hata Cambodia is requesting  assistance from the international community from the perspective  that its own self-help efforts are most important.    They said Hata called such an approach laudable and  expressed  hope that the ICORC meeting will prove successful in  facilitating Cambodia's development.    Hata said that if Cambodia's reconstruction from years of  civil strife goes smoothly it could serve as a model for similar  efforts in other parts of the world.</p>

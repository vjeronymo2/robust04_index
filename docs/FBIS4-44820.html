The  Laboratory for Technical Optics in Iserlohn, Mark Brandenburg,  (Professor Doctor Burkhard Neumann, Frauenstuhlweg 31, 58644  Iserlohn) now hopes to utilize these techniques in  interferometers and pulse oxymeters. To this end, the  researchers have developed an economical laser interferometer,  whose laser light source and electronic components, which take  up a relatively large amount of space, can be placed a  considerable distance away from the miniaturized interferometer  measuring head. Owing to the sensor's small dimensions, position  systems, like the cross-table syste, can now be retrofitted with  this interferometer without difficulty. This has been made  possible through the use of a polarization-holding monomode  faser, in which the light source is directed without disturbance  to the measuring head, which is a few centimeters in size. In  addition, a pulse oxymeter for the determination of blood oxygen  content has been developed in cooperation with the Mark  Brandenburg Company for Medical Developments mbH in  Luedenscheid. By employing a faser sensor, this instrument can  now also be used with nuclear spin tomographs. The light is  detected and evaluated in the patient's illuminated finger. The  photograph [see original] shows the measuring head set on a  control path.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / It's better late . . .: Palestinian rejectionism was usually justified, but always wrong One of the most powerful myths of antiquity is that of the Cumaean Sibyl. She offered her nine books of prophecies to Tarquin the Proud, the last (legendary) king of Rome. When he refused them, she burned three and offered him the remaining six at the same price. Again he refused, so she burned three more and offered him the remaining three still at the same price. This time he bought them. Why did Tarquin refuse the first and second bargains offered? Obviously because the price asked was outrageous. Why did he accept the third one, which was clearly even more outrageous? Because he realised that next time there would be no books left to buy. The Palestinians have been made a series of outrageous offers since 1917, when the British government first took it upon itself to designate their homeland as 'a national home for the Jewish people'. Each offer has been, from their point of view, more outrageous than the last. In 1923, for instance, they boycotted elections for a legislative council, because Jewish delegates (then representing a small minority of the population) were to have the casting vote whenever British government appointees disagreed with the elected Arab members. It made sense to reject this, since it would enable the UK to push through its 'national home' policy, disregarding the wishes of the majority. But, with hindsight, if they had accepted, the Arabs would surely have been better placed to resist or at least limit that policy. A much more famous rejection was that of the 1947 UN partition resolution, dividing Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state, with Jerusalem as a corpus separatum under UN control. The Arabs looked at the map and found that even within the proposed Jewish state they would be (narrowly) the majority. Like today's Bosnians, they saw no reason why 'the international community' should impose on them a partition of their country on ethnic lines. They fought to prevent it, arguing for a single democratic state in which all citizens would be equal and all religions respected. Like today's Bosnians, they were defeated, and many were driven from their homes, taking refuge in neighbouring countries or in the two bits of Palestine that remained under Arab rule: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Those two bits taken together were much smaller than the Arab state the UN had proposed; and when the fighting stopped, in 1949, the Palestinians found they no longer had the option of returning to their homes, even to live under Israeli rule. In 1965 President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, speaking in a Palestinian refugee camp in Jericho, suggested that the time had come for the Arabs to accept the 1947 partition. Palestinians indignantly rejected such defeatism, knowing well that by then there was in any case no chance of Israel withdrawing voluntarily to the frontiers the UN had proposed. They stuck to the view that Israel was an illegitimate state, built on land stolen from them. The rest of the Arab world supported them, at least verbally, and the result was another war (in 1967) in which Israel overran the West Bank and Gaza as well as parts of Egypt and Syria. Moshe Dayan, Israel's defence minister at the time, suggested to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza that they should set up their own state there. They rejected the idea, while in Khartoum the Arab leaders promulgated their three 'no's': no peace, no recognition, no negotiation. Meanwhile Israel annexed east Jerusalem and began to plant settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. By 1973, when the next Arab-Israeli war broke out, the main Arab states had accepted UN resolution 242, which they interpreted as meaning that Israel should be left in peace if it withdrew to the 1949 armistice lines. The Palestinians, now represented by the PLO, began to hint that, if their arms were twisted, they might after all accept the offer General Dayan had made in 1967. Said Hammami, then the PLO representative in London, was the most explicit about this: he advocated mutual recognition and peaceful co-existence between Israel and a Palestinian state. But of course Dayan's offer was no longer on the table. At most, Israel was willing to hand over part of the territory to Jordan. And then, in 1977, Menachem Begin came to power, pledged not to give up any part of 'the Land of Israel'. At Camp David in 1978 the presidents of Egypt and the US persuaded Begin, with great difficulty, to agree to an interim solution, giving the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza autonomy for five years and leaving the ultimate solution to be negotiated later. The Palestinians rejected this, pointing out (correctly) that it committed Israel neither to withdrawal nor to acceptance of a Palestinian state. In 1993 Israel is offering to allow a 'Palestinian entity', which in the first instance will control only Gaza and a small area around Jericho. The price is still the same: recognition of Israel, acceptance of its right to live in peace, cessation of all armed struggle or terrorism against it. But Yassir Arafat, like Tarquin, has decided to pay. Many Palestinians think he is a fool or even a traitor, to accept so little after struggling so long. He may well suffer the fate of Said Hammami, murdered in 1978 by a Palestinian extremist in the pay of Saddam Hussein. But he is surely right to realise, however belatedly, that mutual recognition and peaceful coexistence are a commodity worth paying for, even through the nose.</p>

The draft  program, they said, included several key dates: on Sept. 30, there will be a  presentation of detailed national agricultural support and export subsidy  schemes and possible reductions; on Oct. 8, high government officials will go  to Geneva to meet "on a more or less permament basis" to reinforce their  lower-ranking permanent negotiating teams.; on Oct. 15, governments are  scheduled to make presentations on improved market access offers; on Nov. 15, a  draft package covering all 15 Uruguay Round sectors will be submitted to  participants by Dunkel; on Dec. 4, trade ministers will meet in Brussels to try  and complete a full agreement.  </P></p>

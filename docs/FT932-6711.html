			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Technology: Buzzword EXPERT SYSTEMS are also known as knowledge-based systems, KBS. An offshoot of early artificial intelligence (AI) research, they are rule-based, using the answers entered by users to refine the information and prompt the next question. An expert system 'shell' such as Crystal provides the KBS developer with a framework linking questions, rules and screens. The rules are often derived from one human expert and can include uncertainties, usually expressed as percentages.</p>

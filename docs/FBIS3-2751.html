It is beyond all doubt that taking  vigorous action regarding state-owned enterprises will be an  inevitable necessity for in-depth reform, hence action is  imperative under the circumstances.    What worries people, however, is that before the beginning  of  wide-scale reform, the dissatisfaction of enterprise staff and  workers has burst out in many ways. If the policymakers do not  realize this soberly and take effective measures to cope with  it, the pace of reform very soon will be held up by this  continually spreading dissatisfaction, and the grand and dynamic  reform will die away without being noticed.    A survey indicates that the dissatisfaction of enterprise  staff and workers has vented itself in many ways. The following  are just a few examples:  <H5>  It Is Difficult To Maintain Basic Living Conditions </H5>   First, the excessively sharp increase in commodity  prices has aroused dissatisfaction among staff and workers.  In the first half of 1993, controls on the prices of grain and  edible oil were lifted for the first time in several decades in  more than 1,300 counties among 90 percent of provinces and  cities throughout the country. In the meantime, the state  adopted a policy of combined regulation and relaxation of the  prices of some essential means of production, whereby the state  has successively lifted control of factory prices for steel  products, partially unified the allocation of coal, and made  appropriate adjustments to the prices of some heavy oil  products. This move caused prices to rise by 13.9 percent in  June 1993 over the corresponding period in 1992, more than  doubling the rise of 6 percent originally set for the whole  year. Enterprise staff and workers were weighed down by the  pressure of this price surge much more than indicated by the  figures released by the authorities.    The overly rapid price surge has affected the basic lives of  staff and workers and has aroused their intense dissatisfaction.  According to a survey conducted by the Henan Provincial  Federation of Trade Unions among 10,000 staff and workers across  the province in September 1993, 41 percent of them felt that the  price surge had caused their families' living standards to  decline.    Second, the poverty of staff and workers became an  increasingly conspicuous problem. The findings of an  authoritative survey show that among the ranks of staff and  workers in China, more than 5 percent of personnel who have  retired or are still working (totalling about 8 million) now  live in poverty. If their dependents are included, the total  population of impoverished staff and workers and their families  is approximately 20 million. The salaries of some staff and  workers are unsecured, and for several consecutive years, a  small number of them have received only scores of yuan each  month to live on. Some enterprises could not even afford to pay  this sum as basic living expenses. Take the Xinjiang production  and construction corps as an example. In the five divisions of  this corps in northern Xinjiang, nearly half the staff families  have less than 50 yuan per head to live on.    Under circumstances in which basic livelihood can hardly be  maintained, some people have had to live on borrowed money and  grain or to sell their own furniture and clothing; others were  forced to divorce, commit suicide, or steal. Owing to  livelihood problems, instances of presenting petitions, staging  demonstrations, and collectively appealing to the authorities  for help have occurred frequently.    Third, the income of staff and workers has declined  substantially in the name of reducing material benefits.  As China has a large population but a weak economic foundation,  there originally were few and relatively low-level welfare  services. Some enterprises, however, improperly reduced welfare  services in the name of reform. As a result, some units  arbitrarily distributed money or things to staff and workers,  which led to sharp increases in welfare expenditures on the one  hand, but on the other, necessary welfare services were  neglected. Moreover, some units turned former welfare  facilities -- such as nurseries, cafeterias, bathrooms, and  barbershops -- into profit-making commercial service networks,  but did not increase the income of staff and workers  correspondingly. This has directly sapped their revenue.    Fourth, encroachment on the rights and interests of  staff and workers has occurred frequently. According to a  survey, 615 staff members and workers were fired, laid off, or  dismissed from 178 enterprises in Shijiazhuang between April and  December 1992, and 30 percent of them were relieved of their  posts without being gived any explanation or without trade  unions being advised in advance of the reasons for the  termination of their services.   <H3>    Staff Members and Workers Gradually Feel Doubtful About  Reform Measures </H3>   Fifth, unfair distribution and the wide gap between  rich and poor engender resentment and dissatisfaction.  There are still 6 to 7 million poor families among the urban  staff members and workers, with the income of high salary  earners being 10 times higher on average. Even among the  residents in cities and towns, the gap between the 10 percent of  high income earners and the 10 percent of low income earners is  close to 5 times. Certainly, there are irrational portions in  this high income. According to a survey of the tax department,  the amount of tax evasion in China has reached approximately 100  billion yuan per year, of which the individual sector accounted  for more than 90 percent, and more than 80 percent of private  enterprises evaded taxes. The drastic widening of the income  gap in society has led to serious psychological imbalance in  quite a number of staff members and workers.    Other phenomena -- including acute employment  contradictions,  housing difficulties, default in the payment of salaries, the  lack of protection due to child-birth, old age, illness, and  death, and so on -- are causes of intense dissatisfaction among  staff members and workers.    The ever-growing dissatisfaction and psychological imbalance  have aroused doubt or even resentment among some staff members  and workers toward the reform and open door policies, so that  their support for reform has declined noticeably.    An opinion poll conducted during the Seventh Five-Year Plan  indicated that more than 80 percent of staff members and workers  gave their support to reform, with the highest percentage  reaching 95, whereas the latest survey shows that only 72  percent of staff members and workers support reform.    Overcome by dissatisfaction, staff members and workers have  sought countermeasures to gain benefits and avoid losses, which  has exacerbated social disorder and bred a hidden peril to  reform and development. Over the past few years, sudden  incidents stemming from material interest problems have  increased notably. In this connection, people must not take it  lightly in the course of instituting a modern enterprise system.</p>

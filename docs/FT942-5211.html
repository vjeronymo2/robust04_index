			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Too early to talk of government victory Sir, If I were a government minister, I wouldn't be celebrating yet ('Government near victory on contracting-out', May 31). Your correspondent, David Goodhart, normally the most reliable of authorities, fails to report the whole of the story on this occasion. While it is true that the European Commission is considering amending the Acquired Rights Directive, the law which protects workers' terms and conditions when their jobs are market tested, the revision, if accepted, will not have the impact suggested. I have a copy of the full text of the latest revision of the directive. This does state that the transfer of only 'part of a business' does not in itself trigger the regulations, as reported. However, the next sentence qualifies this by highlighting that the key test is always whether or not 'an economic entity, which retains its identity' has in fact been transferred. This is exactly the same test that has been used over the past 18 months in each of the landmark European Court of Justice cases, which have demonstrated that workers are protected in virtually any market test or contracting-out exercise. Furthermore, while the UK government may wish to see the directive severely weakened, because of the way it has affected its own market testing programme, any revision at all of this particular piece of European Union legislation requires the backing of each member state. This is very unlikely given the support for the principle of protecting employment rights which exists among the majority of our European partners.

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UN soldiers captured in Cambodia KHMER ROUGE guerrillas have seized 21 United Nations peacekeepers in central Cambodia in the second such incident this month, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia said last night. 'We don't think they are in any kind of danger and we're confident they will be released shortly,' Mr Eric Falt, the Untac spokesman, said in the capital, Phnom Penh. The captives, still held last night in Kompong Thom province, include 15 Indonesian soldiers, four military observers - from the US, China, France and Senegal - and two Cambodian interpreters. On December 1, a Khmer Rouge guerrilla unit in the same province held six military observers for three days after they penetrated Khmer Rouge territory by driving up a river in inflatable boats. They were released unharmed. The Khmer Rouge was one of four Cambodian factions to sign a peace accord in Paris last year which paved the way for the UN's Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) peacekeeping operation, but it has repeatedly flouted the accord.</p>

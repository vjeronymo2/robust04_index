			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Why equalisation needs indexing I have read with interest the recent articles on capital gains tax in the Weekend FT. In the case of unit trusts, it is stated that equalisation should be regarded as a repayment of capital. But as this repayment does not occur until up to six months after the initial investment, at the time of the first dividend, presumably the equalisation itself needs indexing from the time of repayment and not from the time of the initial investment? Yes, you are right. By virtue of section 99 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, units in an authorised unit trust are treated as if they were shares in a UK company. Consequently, equalisation payments are treated as if they were capital distributions in respect of shares, and the receipt of an equalisation payment is deemed to be the occasion of a part disposal of the units, by virtue of section 122(1) of the Act. As the equalisation payment will, in practice, always be 'small, as compared with the value of the (units) in respect of which it is distributed', however, section 122(2) authorises the unit-holder's tax inspector to direct that '(a) the occasion of the capital distribution shall not be treated for the purposes of this act as a disposal of the asset, and (b) the amount distributed shall be deducted from any expenditure allowable under this act as a deduction in computing a gain or loss on the disposal of the (units) by the person receiving or becoming entitled to receive the distribution of capital'. If, by chance, your tax inspector declines to give a direction under section 122(2) in respect of any particular equalisation payment, then section 122(3) gives you the right to 'appeal to the commissioners having jurisdiction on an appeal against an assessment to tax in respect of a gain accruing on the disposal'. For equalisation payments made before April 6 1985, there are complex indexation rules (re-enacted in section 57 of the 1992 act (Receipts which are not treated as disposals but affect relevant allowable expenditure)), which are quite different from those for later payments. For current payments (and those made in 1985-86 onwards), section 110(8)(d) simply says: 'Whenever an operative event occurs . . . if the operative event results in a reduction in the qualifying expenditure but is not a disposal, the same reduction shall be made to the indexed pool of expenditure.' We shall be happy to explain the oddities of section 57 and its predecessor, if need be - but we hesitate to burden you with a reply even longer than this one is already. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

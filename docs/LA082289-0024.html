			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CAST CHANGES IN 'SLEEPING BEAUTY'  </P> <P> Two young principals brought an exciting new sense of involvement to the Kirov  Ballet production of "The Sleeping Beauty" Sunday afternoon at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> In physique, 22-year-old Zhanna Ayupova may be more womanly than girlish, but  she danced Princess Aurora with great freshness, sweetness and a rapt wonder at  every happy surprise in the fairy-tale plot.  </P> <P> Free and spontaneous in phrasing, she faltered momentarily during the  treacherous supported balances of the Rose Adagio but otherwise successfully  met the technical challenges of the role. And she sustained an emotional  rapport with her prince that helped camouflage many of the miscalculations in  the staging.  </P> <P> Opposite Ayupova, 25-year-old Farukh Ruzimatov danced with a disarming blend of  bold, pristine classical technique and soulful Romantic intensity. Slender,  dark-skinned, exotic -- a firebrand from Tashkent nicknamed "Razzmatazz" by his  English-speaking fans -- Ruzimatov managed to make the Vision Scene seem a  private revelation, "seeing" the corps dancers in his own mind before he ever  turned to look in their direction.  </P> <P> His distinctive melancholy complemented Ayupova's sunniness perfectly and they  danced together in the last act with faultless surety -- his sharply etched  jumps matching her perfectly placed turns. Incidentally, the Kirov program  booklet says that Ruzimatov danced on the 1986 American tour, but don't believe  it.  </P> <P> As the Lilac Fairy, veteran principal Galina Mezentseva (the opening-night  Aurora in this engagement) offered brittle, small-scale dancing and exuded a  kind of impassive graciousness. Nevertheless, her authority helped the  character represent a plausible counterforce to Carabosse -- no easy task with  all the cuts in storytelling pantomime that largely "abstract" the role.  </P> <P> Except for the dainty, refined dancing of childlike Veronika Ivanova as  Florine, and the appearance of Evgeny Neff (the opening- and second-night  prince) as one of the suitors in the Rose Adagio, the rest of the Sunday  matinee cast proved wholly familiar. Dzhemal Dalgat again conducted. LEWIS  SEGAL  </P></p>

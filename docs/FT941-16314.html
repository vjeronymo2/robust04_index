			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Dissatisfied clients at Europe's Bars  -A barrier-free market is a long way off One year after the unveiling of the European Single Market, lawyers are still some way from establishing a free market in legal services. Progress has been made towards lowering the barriers which prevent lawyers practising in foreign jurisdictions. In Europe, the European Commission is considering a draft establishment directive giving lawyers the right to set up shop in foreign jurisdictions, while globally, there have been efforts to open up legal services under the auspices of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. However, agreement at both levels has proved elusive. Mr John Toulmin QC, the outgoing president of the Council of the Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE), an umbrella organisation for the European legal profession, says agreement is now urgent. There has been a large rise in demand for cross-border legal services in the past five years, he says, largely the result of the globalisation of business. If lawyers are going to meet the new and increased demands from clients they must move towards a unified position on legal practice and regulation, he adds. Mr Toulmin remains optimistic about achieving a single market for legal services in Europe, in spite of the lack of progress since the CCBE submitted its draft establishment directive to the Commission in 1992. Despite opposition from some EC member states, the Commission is pressing ahead with the draft directive. At a meeting with Commission officials in December, the CCBE was assured that the Commission's final draft would be published within three months. The need for uniform rules governing lawyers' rights to practise in the EU is accepted by the Commission, he says, and by most of the European Bars. There are a number of issues which remain unsettled, such as the question of whether after three years' practice in a foreign jurisdiction a foreign lawyer should be able to, or should be required to, become a full member of the Bar of the host member state. Mr Toulmin says agreement on the directive can be reached by the end of the year. A Gatt deal on legal services, in contrast, may prove harder to achieve. Representatives of the CCBE, Gatt and the American and Japanese Bars met in France last October to try and settle the outstanding obstacles to a global legal services deal. One of the main issues is the US and Japanese refusal to allow foreign lawyers to practise in the US or Japan until they have practised in their own country for five of the previous seven years. This stipulation makes it more expensive for foreign firms to open up offices in Japan or the US because they would have to staff them with experienced - and expensive - lawyers. At the meeting in France, there were signs that both the Americans and the Japanese may be prepared to relax the five-year rule. The US is considering reducing or abolishing the rule. In Japan there has already been a softening of the stipulation with the Japanese now saying two years' practice outside a foreign lawyer's own jurisdiction would also be sufficient. The Japanese also agreed to look again at domestic rules which prevent foreign lawyers in Japan advising local firms on the law of a foreign jurisdiction - a restriction Mr Toulmin describes as 'absurd'. The main sticking point to a Gatt legal services agreement is the nature of the work that foreign lawyers should be able to practise in overseas jurisdictions. The Americans do not necessarily want individual US lawyers to be able to practise the local law of a foreign jurisdiction, but they do want to be able to offer a local service by hiring local lawyers and, potentially, appointing local partners anywhere in the world. The head of the US delegation at the meeting in France, Mr Steve Nelson, a partner of Dorsey &amp; Whitney, said the aim was to be able to form 'international multinational partnerships'. European and Japanese Bars oppose this. The CCBE position is that foreign lawyers should be able to advise on their own national law and on international law but not on the law of the host state. EC law, however, would be treated as part of the national law of each member state, which would mean US firms in Europe would not be able to advise on EC legislation. The main disadvantage of a global legal services deal would be that it could undermine bilateral or multilateral deals outside the Gatt. For example, such a deal might threaten bilateral pacts between the US and the UK under which American and English lawyers can form multinational partnerships. Mr Toulmin points to a formula which could allow progress on a global legal services deal. Foreign lawyers could advise on their own law and on international law and take part in all arbitrations except domestic ones. They would have to register with the local competent authority and submit to local conduct and disciplinary rules provided those rules conform with accepted standards. This would be the minimum requirement entitling a state to most-favoured nation treatment for legal services - that is, exemption from the requirement under the Gatt general services agreement to give equal market access to all trading partners. Mr Toulmin accepts that not all European member states would find such an approach acceptable. But he warns that unless someone produces a positive formula for an agreement soon, a deal on global legal services could prove impossible. That, he adds, would be a serious setback for both lawyers and their clients.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Bonn ministry targets telecoms group for sale THE German Finance Ministry has named Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly, as a prime candidate for privatisation. The project, if ultimately approved by the cabinet, would be the government's most ambitious and contentious sale of state assets in the seven years since the sell-off began. 'Telekom as the people's share of the nineties is a desirable and realistic prospect,' said Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. The problems facing Telekom could not be solved by leaving it as a state-owned concern, he said. Mr Waigel told journalists that he would undertake to remove the remaining obstacles to the sale as quickly as possible. These include persuading parliament, particularly the Bundesrat (upper house), to change the country's constitution. This lays down that operation of the railways and postal service, including Telekom, 'shall be conducted as matters of direct federal administration'. Dominated by the SPD opposition, the upper house has exercised its power by resolutely blocking tax reforms. including an increase in value added tax and cuts in corporate levies. Mr Waigel, who said he had found wide support for privatisation in other ministries and state authorities, claimed to have detected signs from the SPD that parliamentary agreement might be possible. However, suggestions of less radical changes have in the past been met by strong resistance. A proposed partial privatisation in 1990, to raise funds for rebuilding the east German telephone network, disappeared without trace. Now, however, with demands for government funding rising on all fronts - Telekom itself has just started a seven-year, DM200bn (Pounds 69.6bn) investment programme - and the Bundesbank squeezing state borrowing, there is fresh urgency in the search for new resources. Mr Waigel's scheme emerged a day after Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, proposed merging east and west German railways into a public limited company, to reduce demands on state subsidies. Although Telekom's telephone business makes profits of around DM8bn a year, this is swallowed up by loss-makers such as telex, telegram and directory inquiries. The government's main privatisation moves so far have been limited to small disposals and the sale of holdings in groups like Volkswagen, Veba and Viag. Mr Waigel flatly rejected SPD and trade union suggestions that the state should take over the 6,000 east German companies still under the control of the Treuhand privatisation agency at the turn of the year. About 5,000 had fewer than 250 employees. The others, including shipyards on the Baltic coast, brown coal mines in Saxony, and chemicals complexes in Halle, have attracted little interest. West German groups, urged by Bonn to join forces, take them over, restructure and ultimately float them on the stock exchange, have been noticeably reticent.</p>

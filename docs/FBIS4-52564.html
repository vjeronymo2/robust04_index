			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. can  redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture in  case of emergency, according to a book to be published Thursday  [12 May]. Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international  politics at Kyoto Industrial University, said in his new book  that the two countries concluded the secret deal during summit  talks between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President  Richard Nixon in November 1969.    According to the book, a draft of agreed minutes to the  Japan-U.S. Joint Communique Nov. 21, 1969, stated in part, "In  times of great emergency the United States Government will  require the reentry of nuclear weapons and transit rights in  Okinawa with prior consultation with the Government of Japan."    The agreed minutes also said, "The Government of Japan,  appreciating the United States Government's requirements in  times of great emergency as stated above by the President, will  meet these requirements without delay when such prior  consultation takes place."    As Sato's special envoy, Wakaizumi at the time was  negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with  Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser. The U.S.  had maintained a presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa before  the territory was returned to Japan by the Nixon administration  in 1972.    Prime Minister Sato had insisted then that Japan would  reject  the reentry of nuclear weapons into Okinawa even if there were  prior consultations.    A government source, when asked to comment on the secret  accord mentioned in Wakaizumi's book, said he is not aware of  "such facts."    "No comment. We ignore (the report)," the source said.</p>

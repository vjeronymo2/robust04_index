			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Before the Battle; Who </F> Will Prevent the Left Wing From Victory in the Presidential  Elections?"]    [Text] The noncommunist camp, under a threat of  left-wing domination, should select just one candidate to be the  next president--so say politicians from the "Solidarity"  movement. Aleksander Hall and Jaroslaw Kaczynski have spoken  about it, while Bronislaw Geremek turned his attention to the  fact that only candidates coming from broad camps have a chance  in the elections, and not people put forward by individual  parties. Pawel Laczkowski also made an appeal to the parliament  members who formed the Citizens Parliamentary Club in 1989, to  hold a meeting on the fifth anniversary of the June elections,  with the goal, among others, of discussing a possible joint  candidate for head of state.    It is not yet known who could possibly be the "man of the  moment" able to prevent the "communist camp" from taking over  the highest post in the Republic of Poland.  "Solidarity"-derived politicians, even though they have been  declaring their will to nominate just one candidate, may face  some serious problems with making it happen. A majority of the  more than 10 potential candidates has quite big ambitions, and  it is probable that it will be hard to convince at least a few  of them that they should not run in the 1995 elections.  <H5>  Prime Minister's Award </H5>   There has been talk for quite some time now in Democratic  Union [UD] circles concerning Hanna Suchocka's candidacy. She,  just like some other former prime ministers, has presidential  ambitions. But the current period of left-wing domination in  public life is a burden for the former prime minister. Until the  presidential elections come, left-wing activists will be blaming  the Suchocka government for the economic difficulties, which the  Pawlak Cabinet will find it hard to overcome. At any rate, it  seems that Hanna Suchocka's candidacy has become less and less  likely. Even though UD politicians may think that accusations  concerning Suchocka's having granted a 140-million-zloty award  to herself are unjustified, it is doubtful that the view will be  shared by the voters or by other post-Solidarity parties.    Under this situation, Tadeusz Mazowiecki may be UD's only  "serious" candidate (or, actually, a candidate for the new party  formed along with the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD] ) who  could be acceptable to at least some right-wing parties. He has  probably not given up his presidential dreams entirely. The  political time in Poland has been flying by very quickly since  1989, and the wounds are also healing fast.That is why  Mazowiecki would like to just forget (and hope that this is what  the voters have done, as well) about his disgraceful defeat of  [presidential candidate in the previous elections] Tyminski,  especially because right now he is the leader of one of the most  powerful and most influential parties in Poland, which will be  further strengthened by its merger with the KLD. Mazowiecki's  departure for a "deserved rest" at the Belweder would be  beneficial to his party because it would make him leave the post  of party chairman, which could then be taken over by someone  younger and more dynamic. Both Suchocka and Mazowiecki would  like to be candidates of the entire Solidarity-derived camp.  They would be approved by an overwhelming majority of UD and  (as representatives of UD's right-wing faction) would also hope  to be supported by at least a part of the extraparliamentary  opposition. However, it does not seem very likely that the  right wing, for which the presidential elections will be one of  the last hopes for a political existence in Poland, will forgo  coming up with their own candidate. And alas, it is very likely  that it will not be just one candidate.  <H5>  Dignitaries From the Right Wing </H5>   Jaroslaw Kaczynski (just like other parties' leaders) and  other leaders of the Center Accord [PC], which is the most  dynamic right-wing party of all, have already mentioned a few  possible candidates, while stressing that these would have to be  candidates for the entire noncommunist camp. Some time ago, PC  leaders seemed to think that a woman would be a good candidate  for president. The names of Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak and  former Sejm Deputy Teresa Liszcz were mentioned. But, in the  final analysis, the right wing will most probably be looking for  a candidate among its representatives or sympathizers who occupy  high posts in the state hierarchy. Adam Strzembosz, chief  justice of the Supreme Court, is the most serious candidate and  the only one about whom there is talk currently in Kaczynski's  bloc. Strzembosz is an unquestioned--and, importantly, a  nonparty--authority on the right-wing side. If he agreed to run,  Strzembosz could probably gather around himself the electorate  of all of the parties that call themselves right-wing or center  right-wing, and even the electorate of Solidarity. But, if he  decides not to run after all, then, according to talk in the  Christian-National Union [ZChN]-PC-Movement for the  Republic-Peasant Accord bloc, Lech Kaczynski (who is also  nonparty) would have to replace him. But Kaczynski is burdened  with the odium of "being one of the Kaczynski brothers," and so  the Supreme Chamber of Control chairman will be held accountable  by the voters for real or fabricated deeds by himself and his  brother. By the way, the latter categorically denies the  possibility of Lech Kaczynski's candidacy.   <H5>    Out of Solidarity </H5>   In the right-wing camp, the possibility of nominating  Andrzej  Stelmachowski (Senate speaker in the First Term and education  minister in Jan Olszewski's government) continues to be  considered. Olszewski himself, about whom there was talk after 4  June 1992 that he was the center right wing's main candidate for  president, after the election defeat by the Coalition for the  Republic and after his party was taken over by Romuald  Szeremietiew, says (although recently in a less persistent  manner) that he will not run in the presidential elections. Jan  Olszewski could be a candidate for that part of the right wing  that is associated with Solidarity. Jan Parys also made  connections with the trade union. His enthusiasts presented him  as a candidate for president even shortly after his dismissal in  1992.    There is a contest also within Solidarity itself on who will  be the Solidarity-right-wing candidate for president. It seems  that the trade union's chairman, Marian Krzaklewski, began  displaying presidential ambitions. The success of the Warsaw  demonstration by Solidarity, in which thousands of people took  part, and also the initiation of a wave of strikes throughout  Poland strengthened his position a great deal. But, on the  other hand, some politicians associated with the trade union  would gladly support Zbigniew Romaszewski, the man who is an  anticommunist opposition legend, a senator, and chief of the  Solidarity Parliamentary Club. At present, Romaszewski is in  serious conflict with Krzaklewski. There is even talk that the  setting up of a Warsaw Solidarity club marks the beginning of  Romaszewski's election campaign.    From among the somewhat more exotic right-wing candidates,  the chairman of the Union for Real Politics [UPR], Janusz  Korwin-Mikke, will not run this time around. His party wants to  come up with just one presidential candidate within the entire  "Accord of 11 November" consisting of UPR, the Party of  Christian Democrats [PChD], the Conservative Party, and the  Peasant-Christian Party [SLCh]. Christian-democratic activists  from Pawel Laczkowski's party would like to suggest somebody  else to the alliance (and to the entire Solidarity-derived  camp): Even though PChD leader Pawel Laczkowski denies that,  there is unofficial talk about Ryszard Kaczorowski, Poland's  former president-in-exile. SLCh's Artur Balazs would like  Leszek Balcerowicz to run in the elections, but it is not very  likely that other right-wing parties would support the former  deputy prime minister; UD would also most probably prefer  someone better associated with the party.  <H5>  Fight With Walesa </H5>   Whoever from the Solidarity-derived camp runs in the  elections will have to fight Lech Walesa for the support of  noncommunist voters. The incumbent president is a candidate for  the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], which he himself  established, even though he has not yet made a decision on  whether to run in the elections. Officially, the reason for  Walesa's hesitation is said to be uncertainty about the powers  of the head of state under the new Constitution. If the powers  were to be the same as now or even less, then, according to a  close associate of his, Professor Lech Falandysz, Walesa might  give up trying to win the office. But that scenario is not very  likely. Falandysz himself admits that it is possible that Walesa  will think that he has worked enough and can now afford to  become a "president on the picture" and drink champaign during  official functions. But, if the incumbent president cannot or  does not want to run in the 1995 elections, the BBWR has a  reserve candidate: Zbigniew Religa, a cardiologist and the  BBWR's chairman, who is enjoying enormous popularity (recently,  it has been even greater than Walesa's). So far, Religa has  been stressing that Walesa is the BBWR's only candidate, but he  will not refuse to face the responsibility if it comes to that.    Lech Walesa will be trying to build a presidential party  before the elections, perhaps using the BBWR as its basis,  although, recently, he has been leaning toward Solidarity again,  when he made it clear that he had proposed his "citizens'  constitutional initiative" precisely as a gesture toward his old  trade union. Walesa has already given up trying to win the  support of the right-wing "bunglers," even though it is probable  that he could have gained the support of some minor parties not  so long ago, but the president's good relationship with the  ZChN, the SLCh, the PChD, or part of UPR is already in the past.  <H5>  Limited Market </H5>   All signs are that the "market" of presidential candidates  is  limited and that next year's battle for the supreme post in the  country will take place precisely among those people on the  "market"--they are well known to the political public, and they  know each other well--perhaps with the participation of a few  ambitious outsiders such as Andrzej Lepper snd Janusz  Bryczkowski.</p>

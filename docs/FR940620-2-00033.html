			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant in performing the TST program for employees on a routine basis will be required to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Use a two-step Mantoux test for all initial tests to minimize the likelihood of interpreting a boosted reaction as a true conversion due to recent infection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Place and read a TB skin test on all HCWs. This will include measures or incentives likely to enhance workers' compliance with such testing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Perform subsequent Mantoux testing annually (or more frequently if appropriate for the level of risk in the occupational group or facility) of all employees whose initial skin tests were negative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Directly observe the reading of the TB skin test (in mm of induration) by personnel trained in correct placement and reading of Mantoux skin tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Confidentially assess potential pertinent demographic factors, (such as, sex, race/ethnicity, country of birth, and history of receipt of Bacille Calmette-Guerin) and occupational factors, (such as, occupation and worksite) which may place HCWs at risk for TB exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Pilot CDC-developed software to assist in the collection, tracking, management, and analysis of data from tuberculin skin testing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Follow CDC guidelines for tuberculin skin testing. A copy of the guidelines will be included in the application kit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Implement a research protocol jointly developed with CDC for the TST demonstration project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Use CDC-developed skin test software to enter all tuberculin skin test information onto the software and send a diskette of the database to CDC on a monthly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Develop forms appropriate to their sites for the collection of data including HCW's demographics, occupational information, tuberculin skin test information, and results of follow-up clinical evaluations for persons with reactive skin tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Ensure that all data are kept confidential and in secured files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. CDC Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Jointly develop a research protocol for the TST demonstration project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide technical assistance in implementation of the TST program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide one or more version of microcomputer software for use in the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Train health department personnel in the use of the software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Develop a plan for data management and for data transfer to CDC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Review site performance and ensure compliance with the study protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Conduct data analysis and summarize and present findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Study on Hospitalization of TB Patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria. (100 total points maximum)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The extent of the problem of TB, HIV, and MDR&hyph;TB in the applicant's area. (25 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The extent to which the applicant's proposed staff and description of duties meet project requirements; the extent to which the applicant can demonstrate that institutional barriers will not impede the initiation, implementation, and completion of the project. (25 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The ability of the applicant to manage local data and ensure the quality of the data collected. The ability of the applicant to ensure that the data will be received at CDC in a timely manner. (25 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The extent to which the evaluation plan is appropriate to assess the study objectives. (25 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, consideration will be given to the extent to which the budget is reasonable, clearly justifiable, and consistent with the intended use of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Tuberculin Skin Testing Demonstration Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria. (100 total points maximum)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The extent of the problem of TB, HIV, MDR TB, and TB/AIDS in the applicant's area. (10 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The extent to which an efficient and effective tuberculin skin testing program exists in the facility proposed for the project. This includes the compliance rate with the tuberculin skin testing program. If compliance rates are sub-optimal, the extent to which the applicant's plan for improving compliance during the project period is likely to succeed. (30 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Agreement by the applicant to pilot test CDC-developed software and provide diskettes of the database to CDC on a monthly basis. The extent to which the applicant's data management plan demonstrates an ability to ensure the integrity of the data. (30 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Funding power Pakistan's Dollars 1.6bn Hub River power project, whose financing was finally completed over the weekend, is being promoted as a blueprint for first world investors eager to satisfy the developing world's appetite for infrastructure funding. Industrial companies such as National Power, which has a 25 per cent stake in the project, are increasingly keen to provide some of the finance themselves. But there are competing views about how best it should be channelled. One route is that being taken by Welsh Water. It is looking to raise around Dollars 100m from half a dozen industrial partners and a further Dollars 400m from institutions. The fund would provide equity for projects identified by the industrial partners. They would get a return on their investment as well as an outlet for their products and services. Though attractive for the partners, such a structure raises the possibility of conflicts of interest. Institutional backers need to be satisfied their investment will not be used to subsidise industrial partners' sales. US General Electric's efforts to raise Dollars 2.5bn for a fund to invest in third world power projects are thought to have been hampered by such concerns. On the other hand, companies such as GE can deliver the flow of deals the fund needs. Tiger Management, the US hedge fund, recently failed to raise Dollars 1bn for infrastructure investment because of its perceived lack of experience in Asia. Other institutional funds are complaining about a lack of suitable projects. But this may say more about their expertise than the investment opportunities.</p>

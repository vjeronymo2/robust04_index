			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Credit du Nord losses rise sharply Credit du Nord, the retail banking arm of the Paribas financial group, yesterday announced a sharp increase in net losses to FFr610.9m (Dollars 106m) for last year from FFr253.4m in 1992 Mr Bernard Auberger, chairman, said the bank was aiming to break even this year but warned that the property market remained difficult. Increased provisions of FFr1.8bn, up from FFr1.6bn in 1992, reflected the weak state of the real estate market and largely accounted for the rise in losses. Credit du Nord said that its target of breakeven for this year, with profits in 1995 and 1996, required an increase in its capital base. Paribas, its parent company, said it would inject FFr618m of new capital and subscribe, at market rates, to a FFr1.5bn subordinated convertible bond issue.</p>

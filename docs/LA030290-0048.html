			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Send Resumes: Curator Franklin Kelly is leaving the Corcoran Gallery of Art in  Washington, which has been the target of criticism over cancellation of a  controversial photography exhibition last year, to return to the National  Gallery of Art as research curator of American art. Kelly complained of  increasingly heavy administrative duties at the Corcoran. The Corcoran is still  searching for a successor to former director Christina Orr-Cahall, who resigned  last year, and has two other top-level openings. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

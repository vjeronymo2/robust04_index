In our Notice we proposed amendments to 39 CFR 3001.54(j), which governs Postal Service presentations concerning estimated volumes and revenues in our proceedings. As discussed in our Notice, during the post-hearing phase of Docket No. R90&hyph;1 an issue emerged as to whether the assumptions underlying the billing determinants that the Postal Service used to project revenues were compatible with those underlying the billing determinants that were implicit in the indexed prices that the Postal Service used to project volumes. This caused us to review our rules governing the Postal Service's volume and revenue presentations to see if more complete initial documentation would expedite hearings on these issues in future rate filings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of that review, we noticed that our current rules do not require the Postal Service's revenue presentation to be disaggregated to the billing determinant level, although the Postal Service has done so in recent rate filings. Nor do our current rules specifically require the Postal Service to source the data underlying its revenue presentation. We therefore proposed amendments to Rule &sect;3001.54(j) designed to bring it into conformity with current practice in these respects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments that we initially proposed in this docket had three basic objectives: (1) To require that revenue presentations be disaggregated to the billing determinant level [proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(3)], (2) to require that the method of calculating revenues be explained in detail, especially where the calculation involved redesigned rates [proposed rule &sect;3001.54(j)(4)], and (3) where the assumptions underlying the billing determinants used to calculate revenue differ from those underlying the billing determinants implicit in the corresponding volume estimate that the Postal Service provide an explanation for the difference [proposed rules &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(iv),(v), and (vi)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of comments received in response to our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we have simplified our proposed amendments in ways that still accomplish the objectives described above. Final rules &sect;3001.54(j)(3) and &sect;3001.54(j)(4), as we adopt them here, accomplish the first and second objectives, respectively, with simpler and more concrete language. To accomplish the third objective, we have deleted proposed rules &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(iv) through (vi) in favor of a simpler provision that we have incorporated in the preamble of rule &sect;3001.54(j)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, our final rules largely eliminate the basis for the Postal Service's generalized complaint in its Comments of December 2, 1993, and Reply Comments of December 13, 1993, that our proposed amendments are needlessly burdensome. Final rules &sect;3001.54(j)(3) and (4) bring our rules into conformity with what is essentially the Postal Service's current practice. Proposed rules &sect;3001.54(j)(5)(iv) and (v) had asked for revenue presentations for interim years, and the year following the test year. These proposals might have added moderately to the Postal Service's documentation burden. They have been deleted from our final rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only a minor addition to the Postal Service's documentation burden remains in our final rules. That is the simplified requirement, incorporated in final rule &sect;3001.54(j)(6), that the Postal Service provide supporting rationale where its revenue estimate is based upon billing determinants that differ from those that are implicit in its volume forecast. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

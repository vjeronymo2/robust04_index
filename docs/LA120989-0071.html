			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH PLAN FOR AUTO MALL SUFFERS  SETBACK  </P> <P> Long Beach's attempts to keep its auto dealers from fleeing to other cities hit  a major setback this week when neighboring Signal Hill signed exclusive  negotiating agreements with four Long Beach dealers who have decided they would  rather do business in Signal Hill.  </P> <P> Both cities are planning auto malls. But while Long Beach has yet to sign up a  dealer, Signal Hill already has signed up two Long Beach dealerships and will  begin finalizing agreements with the four. Signal Hill was able to offer the  dealers a better financial arrangement and an earlier construction date than  Long Beach, which started planning its mall after Signal Hill.  </P> <P> Susan Shick, Long Beach community development director, said the city will  continue to pursue other dealers and perhaps rethink the mall proposal to  include retail space.  </P></p>

"They are gone from the outside of the house. I don't know  about the inside," one diplomat said when reached by telephone  from Bangkok. A second western diplomat, also contacted by  telephone from Bangkok, confirmed that said the guards were  absent from outside the house.    "I passed along (the street in front of) her residence last  night and the two guard boxes were not there any longer," he  said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The second diplomat  also said there still could be guards inside the residence, and  speculated they could have been pulled from outside the house to  make the military government look good to the increasing number  of tourists visiting Rangoon.    "It is too soon to draw any conclusions, but it is  definitely  the first time (the guards have been withdrawn) since she was  put under house arrest" on July 20, 1989, he said.    The first official, who also declined to be identified by  name, refused to speculate as to why the soldiers guarding the  complex on Rangoon's University Avenue had been withdrawn.    "But I don't think it is terribly significant," he said.  [passage omitted: background]</p>

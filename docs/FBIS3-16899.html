			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the </F> Supreme Council and head of state, by correspondent Nato Onaini;  in Tbilisi -- live]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, a week after the visit  to the United States by a Georgian delegation, James Baker has  arrived in Tbilisi. Could this be regarded as a continuation of  your U.S. visit from the political point of view, or is it a  coincidence? Can we speak of Georgia's new role? And how  founded is the irritation of the Russian press and of certain  circles with the visits to the United States by Nazarbayev,  Kravchuk, and yourself? The view has been expressed that the  United States is gaining spheres of influence from Russia.    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. As I have already  said, Jim Baker's visit is connected with his being a cochairman  of a committee for the salvation of Georgia. On my arrival in  Washington we had a very short meeting and we agreed that he  will come to Tbilisi and we will continue our exchange of views  on the fate of democracy in Georgia, on the economy of Georgia,  and on the main ideas for business relations between Georgian  and U.S. business. His advice is essential for us. He has  great experience. [passage omitted]    It was considered essential that the American community,  that  U.S. citizens listen to my views on various issues. The main  direction of my speeches in the United States -- you attended  meetings and listened to them -- was that it is inadmissible to  permit a recurrence of the cold war. This issue was covered  from different points of view but my principal approach was that  this would be a disaster for the world and every country would  pay a high price for that. There is no reason for anyone to be  irritated or jealous. All ultrareactionaries, from our region  or from others, dream of an ice-age.    I think that my contention that Russia and the United States  should continue in partnership to handle all complex issues of  the modern world found a fertile soil in the United States and I  hope that the wishes and aspirations of the majority of Russian  people are directed toward this principle of partnership.    As for the visits to the United States or to any other  country by heads of the CIS countries, I think these are  ordinary events which should not surprise anyone. An  independent country is independent because its leader can  himself decide where to go and where not to.    Now, your question about whether Georgia's role will  increase: I would say that interest toward Georgia is  substantial. It is natural that if we manage to achieve  stability, if we manage to settle the Abkhazian issue by normal  political means, to settle the issue of Samachablo, and to  revive our economy, we will have our own identity and gain our  place in world politics. It is natural that this will result in  a new function of the state. This will be a function of  determining not only internal policy but also policy in foreign  relations.    You have said that individual public figures in Russia make  claims against the United States for widening their spheres of  influence. I do not think that this is the case today.  Nowadays, we should have a different comprehension of spheres  of influence. Today, people will find themselves in these  spheres of influence not depending on who is strong but  depending on what principles of Weltanschauung they have and  what model of economic development or rather what experience of  economic development they are offered.    We have to say that we have already determined our relations  with Russia and it is impossible to speak more than has already  been said. We have said that we want friendship with Russia, we  want close relationships. At the same time, we need relations  with the whole surrounding world.    I think that these first reactions to trips by presidents  [of  the CIS countries] will pass. Everything will be understood in  the right way and life will go ahead in a normal way.    [Oniani] Just recently we spoke about the economy. The  hardships of the postcommunist years in Georgia seem to be due  to a naive attitude toward the economy. This has already been  said repeatedly. Speaking of the economy, the people used to  say -- and quite loudly -- that for the sake of independence  they are ready to eat grass. Eventually it appeared that it is  not that simple. Yesterday, at the first congress of the Union  of Georgia's Citizens, most of your speech was dedicated to  economic problems. You said that economic stabilization will  begin in the country in 1995. It is clear that foreign  investments will require a legislative basis. This is an issue  which has been repeatedly put forward in France and in the  United States by foreign partners. Speaking of the Cabinet of  Ministers, you said that ministries should be structures of  political significance rather than economic. How far do you  think the present cabinet will manage to implement the reforms  you and outher speakers mentioned? Moreover, the parliament is  going to discuss the issue of the cabinet at its sitting  tomorrow.    [Shevardnadze] Yesterday's congress was a very serious  occasion. I have no doubt now that it will be a mass movement.  I cannot help saying that the delegates' businesslike and  professional speeches made me happy. The speeches were very  comprehensive. I would highlight the youth. They crowned the  congress. [passage omitted praising speakers, audience,  documents passed at the congress]    As for what will happen in the parliament, of course, it is  difficult to forecast. I would say one thing. I request this  from both the majority and the minority. I have planned  meetings with them. I ask them to approach the issue in a very  serious way. I want the radio listeners to hear it and know it.  Change for the sake of change will never be effective. A  change should not be an end in itself. I said yesterday that no  magician will come to the Georgian Government. And the  introduction of 1, or 2, or 10 inexperienced people into the  government means that they will not be able to do anything  during the next three or four months. They will find it very  hard. Seeking a scapegoat will cost the state even more.    If it were for me, I would not replace the principal staff.  There is talk about corruption and that some ministers cannot be  trusted. This is another thing. This needs yet additional  arguments. A general conversation is not sufficient. [passage  omitted on the current situation in Georgia and prospects of  reviving the economy]    In this situation, any replacement of ministers could have  grave consequences. This should be considered by  parliamentarians. Above all, a majority of the ministers,  especially those in charge of the economy, have had experience  in international economic relations and have acquired a minimum  of the knowledge needed to handle foreign investments and import  foreign products. This is a school. A new person will find it  difficult to start from the very beginning. That is why I say  that the parliament should take all this into consideration. If  the parliament makes a decision which cannot lead to an  improvement in the situation, this will further undermine the  authority of the parliament, of its chairman, and of the head of  state, too.    It is necessary for parliament to attach much more attention  to the creation of legislative bases, especially regarding  foreign investments. We have found plenty of partners.  Incidentally, Mr. Baker named one big industrialist, who works  in the sphere of oil- prospecting, and said that he has serious  claims against our legislature. He is ready to come to Georgia  along with other companies. He believes that there is much oil  in Georgia. He knows there are people who will work. But the  existing laws are not sufficient for such wide-range  cooperation. Therefore, apart from changes in the cabinet and  sacking or changing ministers, the parliament should do its best  to create a legislative basis.    My remarks that there should be certain improvements in 1994  and that 1995 should become a year of stabilization and that  improvements will be felt by all families in 1995, are not  simply cheap talks, provided the approach in parliament, in  government, and in all rayons and regions is serious .    [Excerpts] [Oniani] In your speech you spoke about the role  of the constitution which is in the process of being drafted.  You claimed that it is necessary to introduce the post of  president to serve as an essential element in overcoming the  crisis. After all the negative assessments of the presidential  post which were made by the former opposition and in view of  general attitudes, how much chance do you think this idea has of  being accepted? And how necessary is it for Georgia to have a  president?    [Shevardnadze] [Passage omitted: Shevardnadze says he spoke  about this at the congress but he knows his speech at the  congress was too long to be published] By all means, a country  like Georgia needs a strong power, a strong executive power and  correct relations between the executive power and the parliament  as well as a judicial power. A country which is in crisis and  which has a peculiar (?geopolicy) will not be able to stabilize  itself itself with a relatively weak power. I said yesterday  that the president's power and authority should be a guarantee  of the country's security, integrity, and unity.    As for our bitter experience, I would like to say that  history knows good and bad presidents in various countries.  Some have been good, some bad, and some even criminal. This  happened in the United States but the United States did not  reject the idea of the presidency.    We need a good and strong president. I have been convinced  of this by numerous discussions. The people have had  experience. They know what sort of person not to elect. And  this means a lot. I think there is a rather wide and  interesting spectrum of political figures at present. There is  a big choice. However, this is my own idea and it may not be  accepted by the constitutional commission. Neither may it be  accepted by the parliament and the people. [Passage omitted  elaborating]    It can be said that certain mistakes are made not only  during  presidential elections -- this should also be considered -- but  during parliamentary elections, too. Not many parliaments are  ideal, so to say. I do not mean our parliament.    [Oniani] And yet another phrase from your speech: Abkhazia  will have the autonomy stipulated by European or world  standards. You said this and added that the CIS, and especially  Russia's experiences and serious achievements in the  construction of the state should be taken into consideration.  How should we understand this? What does it mean? Today, yet  another round of talks about Abkhazia will take place. How  efficient do you think it will be considering that in Abkhazia  progressively thinking Abkhazians -- I mean the Movement for  Peaceful Abkhazia -- managed to issue a statement on the current  situation in Abkhazia. This means that such people exist. The  people have always existed but the main thing is that they have  managed to say this aloud. This means that the situation is  changing.    [Shevardnadze] Speaking of Abkhazia yesterday, I meant that  it could be autonomous or something else. I meant Abkhazia's  political status, in principle. I also spoke about the  political status of Ajara. The rights Abkhazia had before the  war, before the conflict, met all world standards. I spoke  about this at the UN Security Council and this was unexpected  for many.    We are ready to have a wider look at this issue, to  distinguish functions as is needed for each to do his own job.  As for the Russian experience, I am talking about a  constitutional solution to the problem. I consider it to have  been Yeltsin's big victory when he managed to induce the people  to adopt the constitution in the shape he suggested. I am  referring to the rights, duties, and representation of the  subjects [of the federation] in the supreme bodies, in the  parliament in particular. I think this experience should be  discussed in the press as well as on television and so on so  that the people can have a better idea about it. It is a very  interesting experience.    I have been told that the presentation of the UN secretary  general's report to the Security Council has been scheduled for  today. Decisions will not apparently be made today or tomorrow,  as far as I understand. But I believe that the report will be  an ideal reflection of the situation in Abkhazia.    Now, with regard to the recent broadcasts of the Movement  for  Peaceful Abkhazia, I have to admit that I am not well aware of  this. I listened to it in the same way as you did. Certain  radio stations have registered this. It has been said that this  originated in Abkhazia, in Sukhumi, that is, in the heart of  Abkhazia. As far as I know, ethnic Abkhazians residing in  Abkhazia as well as from the outside take an active part in this  movement. I do not think that it comes from the Tbilisi, from  Tbilisi Abkhazians. It is important because the appeal to live  in peace, to return to Abkhazia, and to restore the age-old  traditions we have had for centuries is coming from Abkhazia.  [passage omitted: exhibitions are planned to demonstrate  Georgia's intellectual and industrial potential. Shevardnadze  welcomes the exhibitions, praises young scientists and  entrepreneurs, and promises assistance]    [Oniani] And, finally, Batono Eduard, you yourself have said  -- and it is frequently said -- that we have to declare war on  the mafia and on saboteurs. But, unfortunately, cases of  sabotage are still numerous. The authorities and  law-enforcement bodies seem to be unable to combat this. If we  add the social dimension to this, the question arises naturally:  How long will things last like this? How long will this  inactivity last? There are evident cases of sabotage which are  not followed by any reaction.    [Shevardnadze] I would like to answer you like this. The  fight against the mafia has begun and it will continue and its  scale and pace will not reduce. Of course, it is not at all  easy to eradicate the mafia or to supress it. This is not only  a Georgian phenomenon. I should say that as one economic  structure of a state is replaced by another, this is accompanied  by the stirring up and establishment of mafiosi clans and then  it is rather difficult to eliminate the clans. Mafiosi  structures create a rather undesirable climate, if I may say so,  even in highly developed countries.    We should come to the conclusion that we have to assist and  care about law-enforcement bodies. Society should be mobilized.  This process has commenced and thus stirred up hopes, I  believe. We must support the people who do not tremble they  talk about combating mafiosi clans. I want to declare that the  pace of the fight will not decrease and I want to assure radio  listeners of this.

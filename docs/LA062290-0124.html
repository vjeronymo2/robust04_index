			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> BATEMAN EICHLER CHIEF RICHARD CAPALBO QUITS  </P> <P> Richard J. Capalbo, chairman and chief executive of Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards regional brokerage, has resigned to pursue other interests and has  been replaced by Allan L. Sher, former vice chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> Industry insiders had speculated that Capalbo was not long for Bateman since  Chicago-based Kemper Corp., parent company of the Los Angeles brokerage, last  month announced plans to consolidate some operations of its five regional  brokerages and to lay off about 600 of the firms' 5,200 employees. The move,  prompted by the slowdown in the securities industry, was seen as greatly  reducing the authority of the regional brokerage heads.  </P> <P> But James R. Boris, chairman and chief executive of Kemper Securities Group  Holdings and Capalbo's boss, said the 43-year-old executive was not forced out  but decided to leave on his own.  </P> <P> "We worked together for just a few months," said Boris, who took his position  in January, "but we found we had considerably different management styles, and  he decided it was best for him to move on."  </P> <P> Neither Capalbo nor Sher was available for comment.  </P> <P> Boris said the appointment of the 58-year-old Sher, who had headed West Coast  operations for Drexel, "should send a clear message that we are fully committed  to the retail brokerage firm."  </P> <P> Capalbo, an aggressive salesman who once worked for Drexel, had beefed up  Bateman's nontrading operations, including investment banking and municipal  finance, only to see those businesses greatly reduced in the consolidation.  </P> <P> "This is no surprise," said one investment banker. "Richard is leaving because  of the fact that the whole regional autonomous stand-alone nature of Bateman is  leaving with him. . . . Capalbo didn't want to be Boris' puppet."  </P> <P> "The '80s are over, and the '90s have begun. I think Kemper is pulling in its  horns," another investment banker said. "This is not a cheap business to be  in," and Bateman was believed to be losing money, he said.  </P> <P> Sher also was a director and member of the executive committee of Drexel, which  filed for bankruptcy law protection in February. Sher began his career in the  securities industry in 1956 with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. NANCY RIVERA BROOKS  </P></p>

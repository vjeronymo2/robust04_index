Fishman said the report admits that "there is virtually no  corruption" in Costa Rica's police force, which is prevented  from taking more effective action against drug trafficking by a  lack of financial resources. "I am proud because they say there  is no corruption," the minister told ACAN-EFE, saying that  contrary to what Washington says, Costa Rica has dealt "harsh  blows" to drug traffickers in recent years despite the limited  resources.    Fishman said he "disagrees" with the assertion that Costa  Rican policemen are unprofessional. He said that Puerto Limon  on the Atlantic coast is a problem area and added that many  resources have been allocated to fight drug trafficking and  consumption.    The State Department's annual report, released today,  highlighted the progress made by Central American governments,  with the exception of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the fight  against drug trafficking and money laundering. The report says  that the "laundering of drug money" is particularly serious in  Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, but virtually nonexistent  in El Salvador.    The State Department gave Guatemala the most praise for its  cooperation with Washington in several campaigns to eradicate  cocaine and opium and to arrest drug traffickers. According to  the State Department, meager resources and a lack of  professionalism among security services preclude significant  progress in the counternarcotics struggle in Costa Rica.    The report says that Puerto Limon has become the main point  of contact between the Colombian island of San Andres, the  Nicaraguan coast on the Caribbean, and the United States. At  the same time, however, the report said there is virtually no  corruption.</p>

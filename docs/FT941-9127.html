			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Float values Mithras at Pounds 20m Mithras Investment Trust, a provider of mezzanine finance to unquoted companies, is to come to the market through a placing which values the group at Pounds 20m. The company was formed in 1990 by Legal &amp; General Ventures - which remains the investment manager - Pricoa and Banque Indosuez. It has investments in 10 unquoted companies and Anglian Group, which floated in 1992. By floating and gaining investment trust status, Mithras will be able to avoid capital gains tax on the sale of its Anglian shares and other companies that may float. NM Rothschild and Warburg Securities yesterday placed 10m Mithras shares at 50p, raising Pounds 4.25m. The company had net assets of Pounds 15m, or 49.9p a share, at end-1993. The flotation comes less than a month after Postel, the UK's largest fund manager, bought a 20 per cent stake in Intermediate Capital Group. ICG is one of the few groups still providing mezzanine finance - a form of capital that is riskier and higher yielding than bank debt but is not generally classed as equity and is not usually as risky. Many banks entered the mezzanine market in the late 1980s but withdrew in the early 1990s after losing money on overly leveraged buy-outs such as Isosceles. The prospectus warns that Mithras's principal investments are in loans to unquoted companies with high levels of gearing.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TEST THAT'S EASY TO FLUNK;  </P> <P> IDEOLOGY: NOT MANY OF US COULD COUNT OURSELVES RESISTERS TO A TRULY HOSTILE  REGIME. ACCOMMODATION IS THE RULE.  </P> <P> The young apparatchiks of the Soviet Communist Party are said to be having no  trouble adjusting to the new political order. The day after the party's Central  Committee renounced Communism's monopoly on power, students at Moscow's Higher  Party School were already spouting the new dogma.  </P> <P> The flexible ideologue is an ancient social type, dating back at least to  England's famous Vicar of Bray, who became a Protestant or a Catholic depending  on the whim of the monarch of the moment.  </P> <P>  And this is law, I will maintain  </P> <P>  Unto my dying day, sir  </P> <P>  That whatsoever king shall reign  </P> <P>  I will be the Vicar of Bray, sir!  </P> <P>  The deft vicar kept his perks. But events moved too fast for some East German  party hacks, who now find themselves in prison for the salamis of six months  ago. But let's not be smug. These folks were just playing the game by the rules  they were given, as most of us do.  </P> <P> In fact, it makes a pretty good parlor game. Which people in the Bush  Administration would be members of the Politburo and which, if any, would be  dissidents? The President himself, son of a senior regional apparatchik? James  Baker? Can you see our secretary of state freezing in Siberia for his belief in  freedom and democracy? Richard Darman? Robert Mosbacher? The Doles? Well, now  that you mention it, I can sort of imagine Bob Dole warming his bile over a  coal fire for a couple of decades in a gawd forsaken place with a name like  Yukst because of some unfortunate remark to Stalin around 1949. But as for most  of the rest, it's apparatchik city.  </P> <P> I don't mean to suggest that the rest of us would be heroes. Even by Washington  standards, the Bush crowd strikes me, at least, as especially characterized by  ambition unhinged from principles of any sort, good or bad. But no doubt most  of us would accommodate, not rebel. In his famous first speech as president of  Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel said that everyone shared responsibility for the  "contaminated moral atmosphere" the country inherited because, "We had all  become used to the totalitarian system and accepted it as an unchangeable fact  and thus helped to perpetuate it." This is stirring but overmodest, coming from  a man who spent years in jail for opposing the system. Nevertheless, a  corollary of its central truth is that those of us fortunate enough never to  have been put to the test would have flunked it, too.  </P> <P> I recently heard the following dialogue between an American left-wing  intellectual and a reformed left-wing intellectual who is now a professional  apostate, making a comfortable living as a disparager of his former views:  </P> <P> Reformed Lefty: If people like you were in power, people like me would be in  prison.  </P> <P> Lefty: If people like me were in power, people like you would still be on our  side.  </P> <P> Lefty pretty clearly won that exchange. Some people's principles can't even  survive a couple of presidential elections, let alone decades of totalitarian  suppression.  </P> <P> This is not to say that everyone except the occasional Vaclav Havel is corrupt,  a bad person. Good people, even admirable, heroic people, can't always see  moral scandals that seem blindingly obvious in hindsight. Thomas Jefferson  owned slaves. Generations of enlightened men -- until just a couple of decades  ago -- saw nothing wrong with a society where opportunities for women were  circumscribed in ways that seem unbelievable today. Women still don't have  equal opportunity, but almost no one denies that they're entitled to it.  </P> <P> George Bush -- not an evil man, not a racist -- opposed the Civil Rights Act of  1964. Today we argue about its interpretation, but outright opposition to the  Civil Rights Act would put you on the distant fringes of political  acceptability -- not in the White House.  </P> <P> My point is not that America before the Civil Rights Act or the liberation of  women was in any way comparable to the Soviet Union. My point is to reserve a  bit of sympathy for people whose moral universe is suddenly turned upside down.  </P> <P> America's basic values are not going to be found wanting and rejected  overnight, as is happening in the Communist bloc. But who knows what perceptual  revolution will come along that will make the views of even right-thinking  people today seem shockingly debased? When it happens, most of us will flip  just like those students at the Moscow Higher Party School.  </P></p>

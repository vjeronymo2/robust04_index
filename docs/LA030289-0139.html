			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAISER ENGINEERS MERGING WITH UNIT OF ITS VIRGINIA PARENT FIRM  </P> <P> Kaiser Engineers Group, one of the largest engineering firms in the West, is  being merged with another subsidiary of its corporate parent, American Capital  &amp; Research, the holding company announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Kaiser will combine with ICF Inc., a Fairfax, Va., consulting firm, and the  resulting company will be called ICF Kaiser Engineers. Its headquarters will be  in Oakland, where Kaiser is now based.  </P> <P> American Capital &amp; Research, also of Fairfax, acquired financially troubled  Kaiser last June from a consortium of banks led by Bank of America. Kaiser's  Australian and Asian operations were then spun off.  </P> <P> ICF Kaiser Engineers will be a subsidiary of another new firm, ICFcorp  International, which is wholly owned by American Capital.  </P> <P> American Capital said Kaiser, which was losing $1 million a month when it was  sold last June, is now earning $1 million a month. "That's what a company its  size should be doing," said William C. Stitt, chairman and president of ICFcorp  International.  </P> <P> Stitt said Kaiser's $70-million debt has been eliminated and that American  Capital had bought a portion of the debt at a deep discount and forgiven it.  </P></p>

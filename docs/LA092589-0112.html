			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> LAW IN CUSTODY FIGHT CHALLENGED  </P> <P> The former husband of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan today challenged the  constitutionality of a law designed to free his former wife after 25 months  behind bars for concealing their daughter in a bitter custody battle.  </P> <P> Morgan remained in jail, awaiting action on a weekend request filed by her  lawyers that she be freed.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Morgan's former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, claim the legislation,  which President Bush signed Saturday, infringed on the powers of the local  courts. The attorney, Elaine Mittleman, also said the bill violated Foretich's  rights and those of the couple's daughter, Hilary, 7.  </P> <P> Morgan has been in jail rather than produce the child for a court-ordered visit  with Foretich, claiming he had sexually abused Hilary. Foretich denies the  allegation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Accounting Merger Talks Halted: Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse  &amp; Co. said they have ended merger talks that would have created the world's  biggest accounting and consulting company. The discussions were discontinued  because differences could not be resolved within a realistic period, the  companies said in a joint statement. Other factors, including regulatory  concerns, also helped to derail the talks. The Justice Department asked Price  Waterhouse for information, including client lists, shortly after the merger  talks were announced July 6, an official said. He noted that the Department  requested the same data from Arthur Andersen.  </P></p>

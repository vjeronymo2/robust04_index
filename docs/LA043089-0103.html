			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COERCED TO BEAR' POINTS TOWARD WOMEN BEING 'FORCED TO ABORT'  </P> <P> As the spectators tried to read the lips and minds of the justices there  followed a seminal exchange between Charles Fried and Sandra Day O'Connor, the  justice who may be pivotal to this case. "Do you say there is no fundamental  right to decide whether to have a child or not?" O'Connor asked Fried.  </P> <P> He answered hesitantly and she pursued. What if, she said, in a future century,  we had a serious overpopulation problem. Does the state have a right to require  abortions?  </P> <P> This was not some question that professors use to trip up first-year students.  It went to the heart of the matter. The government wants the court to  "reconsider" who has the right to decide the question of abortion: the woman or  the state. If it's the state, she asked, couldn't a legislature that disallowed  abortion today force it tomorrow?  </P> <P> Fried's response was as quick as it was obtuse. There is a difference, he  insisted, between preventing an operation and forcing one. A forced abortion  would mean "violently . . . laying hands on a woman and submitting her to an  operation . . . ." A forced pregnancy, however, was what? Nonviolent? Benign?  </P> <P> Such distinctions would seem obscure to a woman pregnant against her will for  nine months. They would seem specious to the doctor calculating the medical  risks of her condition. But George Bush's lawyer saw nothing intrusive in such  a pregnancy.  </P> <P> It was O'Connor alone who raised the issue of coercion. Like others who have  reservations about Roe vs. Wade and about abortion itself, she had concerns as  well about individual liberty. If, as she once wrote, abortion was on a  collision course with medical technology, then "pro-life" is on a collision  course with liberty.  </P> <P> Indeed, the scenario that she described is not as far-fetched as it sounds. We  do not have to look to the future or to China to see state attempts to control  reproduction. We've made our own.  </P> <P> Earlier in this century, there were numerous forced sterilizations in the  United States. It was 1974 before the courts ruled that the poor or mentally  incompetent couldn't be coerced into such procedures.  </P> <P> Six years ago, in Massachusetts, a court ruled in favor of a husband who wanted  to force his wife into a cervical operation so she wouldn't miscarry. She was  only protected from this "violently . . . laying on hands" by the Roe reasoning  of a higher court.  </P> <P> During the 1980s, we have seen as many as 11 Caesarean sections ordered by  courts. We have had at least one pregnant woman accused of fetal neglect and  had others put in protective custody -- protective of the fetus.  </P> <P> Even now there is serious debate about whether a pregnant women could be forced  into testing and treatment for her fetus. There are suggestions among those who  talk of fetal rights that the government could constrain a pregnant woman's  diet and physical activities, stomp out her cigarettes, empty her wine glass .  . . or else.  </P> <P> If that is true today, what if the protection of Roe were shattered, and a  woman's rights transferred piecemeal to the government? How freely would the  state intervene?  </P> <P> The specter of forced pregnancy is serious enough. There is no real need to tap  into O'Connor's fantasy of forced abortion to see the dangers of gutting Roe.  But pendulums swing. How hard is it to imagine the first financially strapped  state practicing coercive family planning? How hard to imagine another group of  eugenicists in a statehouse insisting that the brain-damaged fetus of a welfare  mother be aborted?  </P> <P> As Harvard Law School's Lawrence Tribe says, "There's no principled way to say  that the government can use women's bodies against their will to nurture the  unborn without accepting the other serious and totalitarian implications about  privacy." While the court deliberates the Missouri case, it is worth  remembering that if you take away the right of individuals to make decisions  about their lives, you cede it to the state. And that is just the beginning.  </P></p>

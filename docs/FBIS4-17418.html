			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 23, BNS -- If Latvia refuses to sign the  whole package of initialed troop withdrawal documents, including  the section on social guarantees of military retirees, Russia  may halt the pullout indefinitely, said chief Russian negotiator  Sergey Zotov.    "I can officially say that the question in that case will be  about immediate suspension of Russian troop withdrawal from  Latvia and cancellation of decision on Aug. 31 as withdrawal  deadline," Zotov told a Latvian newspaper Friday [22 April].    "The end of August is not far away and if the signing of all  four agreements is longer delayed we will start to suspect  Latvia of an intention to evade the signature," Zotov told the  nationwide DIENA newspaper.    The Russian delegation head asked Latvians not to  overdramatize the situation, though. He and his delegation plan  to tour Riga next week to meet with Latvian negotiators. No  concrete date for the meeting has been fixed yet.    The trip will be aimed at preparing the visit of Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis in Moscow during which he will meet  with his Latvian counterpart Boris Yeltsin, said Zotov.    Zotov claimed that the day of the presidential summit was  unknown yet but Latvian media reported earlier this week that  the presidents would meet on April 30.    Latvian experts spent in Moscow three days this week and met  with Russian colleagues in a bid to soften the agreement on  social guarantees for military pensioners, sources told DIENA.    A source said that Latvia can hope for little and not  serious  changes in the agreement on Russian war pensioners, which grant  them broad social guarantees, like easy access to residency  permits.    As reported, Russia expected Ulmanis to sign the package  April 21 but the Latvian parliament failed to adopt a decision  authorizing him to do so.</p>

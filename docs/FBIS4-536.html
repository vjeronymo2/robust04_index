			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 7 Apr (AFP) -- This week, a mediation  force deployed in the southern districts of the city began  collecting illegal arms from opposition and presidential group  activists, its deputy commander announced today.    "We have already retrieved a quantity of arms, some of which  do not exist in the regular Army's arsenal, which were found in  the possession of opposition activists," Colonel Jean-Marie  Guembo told the press, without however specifying the number or  type of weapons retrieved. "Our task is progressing  satisfactorily," he stated, stressing that the role of the  mediation force is "to occupy the frontlines in order to  definitively stop the violence." According to the officer,  peace" has gradually become a reality in the capital since  political leaders, who are mostly responsible for the violence,  pledged to stop supporting the fighters politically and  militarily."    Established on 30 January after a cease-fire agreement  between deputies of the presidential group and the opposition,  the mediation force, which is 400-strong, was deployed on 18  February in Brazzaville's southern districts, which have  suffered most from the fighting between the two opposing  militias that left several hundreds dead between June 1993 and  last January. These soldiers are also charged with preparing  the necessary security conditions for the return of tens of  thousands of people who fled the southern districts during the  fighting.</p>

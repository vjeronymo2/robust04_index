			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Covenant payments cannot be stopped NINE YEARS ago, I made covenants in favour of two grandchildren and arranged that the deeds would carry on until my death. This was accepted by the Inland Revenue. Two more grandchildren arrived in 1987 and 1988. I then made further deeds of covenant. I am approaching 85 and realise it is unlikely that the covenants will run until the youngest child is 18. This means that the older two will have a distinct advantage at my death. I am now considering ceasing the first two covenants and then terminating the others when the younger boys have received the same amount as the older ones. You cannot cease the payments made under such a covenant. The deeds create binding legal obligations which can be enforced against you, and the parents of the minor children have a duty to enforce them. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

The rise was scored on revenues of ADollars 89.2m, 17.5 per cent higher than in the previous year. The company, which acquired the large BBC Hardware retail chain in July, said it was adding the Campbells Hardware Group for ADollars 81m from Jamison Equity, the Australian conglomerate. The company is also pulling out of the stevedoring business. It is planning to sell its 25 per cent interest in Australian Stevedores for ADollars 28m to Jamison Equity unless ANL, the government-owned shipping business, exercises a pre-emptive right.</p>

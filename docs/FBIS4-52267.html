			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign  Ministry praised dismissal of Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano Sunday, calling it "appropriate" for building new South  Korea-Japan relations.    "The dismissal of Minister Nagano was the result of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata's determination and courage," a Ministry  official said in a commentary, "it was an action reflecting  Prime Minister Hata's awareness and efforts to build new South  Korea-Japan relations."    Nagano resigned Saturday after his remarks on Japan's role  in  World War II ignited flurry of protest from Asian neighbors. He  claimed Japan was not the aggressor in the war but was only  trying to liberal Asian colonies from Europe.    He also belittled the rape of Nanjing as a made-up story.</p>

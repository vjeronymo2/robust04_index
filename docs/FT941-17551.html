			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Saudis to cut government spending 20%: Budget proposals aimed at ending long period of pressure on currency Saudi Arabia's promise to cut government spending by 20 per cent in 1994 has eased pressure on the riyal and prompted a 1.5 percentage point fall in interbank rates over the weekend. The intended spending cut was the centrepiece of the kingdom's annual budget, the outlines of which were unveiled at the weekend. It follows several months of intensified international scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's public finances, which have been in deficit for more than a decade but under increased pressure with the recent softening of crude prices. According to the budget statement, the government intends almost to balance its books in 1994, with expenditure estimated at SR160bn (Pounds 28.7bn) and revenues, mainly from oil sales, at SR155.6bn - a figure economists in Riyadh said implied a price of Dollars 15 a barrel for Saudi Arabia's main export crude and sustained output at present levels of 8m barrels a day. The 1994 figures compare with a budgeted deficit in 1993 of SR27.8bn and spending of SR196.5bn. However, the government has not published actual figures for last year's overall revenues or expenditure, leaving the true scale of the Saudi budget deficit a matter of conjecture. Some local economists believe the easing of the oil price last year may have left a gap as large as Dollars 15bn, while none believes the government to have met its budgeted target. Few other details of the 1994 budget were given at the weekend. There is, in particular, no indication of how or where government spending cuts are to be made, although the Saudi Press Agency said the king had banned the signing of any new contracts which would add to spending in 1994. King Fahd clearly hoped the announcement of intended spending cuts would end pressure which has dogged the riyal over the past few months, while banishing rumours of a possible devaluation. The king told the council of ministers on January 1 he was determined to maintain the riyal's present value. But while bankers and economists said yesterday that pressure had eased on the Saudi currency, many expressed caution before the London and New York financial markets returned to work fully today. Meanwhile, neighbouring Oman said it intended making a 10 per cent cut in expenditure for 1994 over last year in its new year budget. The budget puts spending at RO2bn (Pounds 3.5bn), of which 30 per cent is to on defence. Revenue is estimated at RO1.7bn, leaving a deficit of RO301m. Mr Qais Al Zawawi, deputy prime minister for financial and economic affairs, said actual 1993 expenditure was Dollars 5.84bn (Pounds 3.94bn) and revenue Dollars 4.4bn, leaving a deficit of Dollars 1.4bn. The actual 1992 budget deficit came to Dollars 1.5bn, according to the central bank. The government has not so far indicated how it arrived at higher 1994 revenues, though officials have previously indicated the government's intention to sell some state-owned assets, including the Sultanate's only oil refinery and the telecommunications agency, to the private sector. Previous budget deficits have been funded by drawing down reserves and more recently by issuing government development bonds, for which there has been a ready domestic market. Oman last year reached record oil output of 800,000 barrels a day, 96 per cent of it from the majority state-owned Petroleum Development Oman. However, PDO cut output by 5 per cent on Sunday in an attempt to help shore up world prices.</p>

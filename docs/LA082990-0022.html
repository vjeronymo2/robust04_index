			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> CLUB'S PLAQUE SHOWS GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES  </P> <P> One of the best views of Ojai can be found on the Dennison Grade overlook where  a scene of the mythical Shangri-La was filmed for Frank Capra's 1937 classic,  "Lost Horizon."  </P> <P> Sightseers who pause at the turnout along the serpentine climb of California  150, linking the lower and upper Ojai valleys, are finding the horizon easier  to identify now.  </P> <P> The Rotary Club of Ojai has installed an interpretive plaque that identifies a  dozen geographical points. Most are visible from the overlook.  </P> <P> Cast in bronze are White Ledge Peak, Three Sisters Peak, Chief Peak, Nordhoff  Peak, Matilija Twin Peaks and the 6,244-foot-high Topatopa Peak. Also marked  are Horn, Senior and Gridley canyons, among others.  </P> <P> Club member Jane McCarthy, marketing director at Ojai Valley Community  Hospital, said it was educational for many of the 65 professional and business  people in Rotary to learn the names of the mountains and canyons they see  daily.  </P> <P> The plaque's installation and a ribbon-cutting ceremony Aug. 15, the  culmination of the club's nine-month project to beautify the overlook site,  were marked by commendations from County Supervisor Maggie Erickson's office  and Ojai Mayor Nina Shelley.  </P> <P> Using $13,000 of its members' donations and much of their time to haul trash  away from the overlook, the club paved the small parking area, built stone  walls and benches, installed garbage cans and put up fencing to keep sightseers  from wandering farther onto private property.  </P> <P> Local contractor Ernest Ford, whose property includes the vista point, was  thinking of sealing it off after years of putting up with trespassers and  trash.  </P> <P> "A lot of people dumped garbage up there," McCarthy said. "We had a massive  cleanup last November and several mini-cleanups since then."  </P> <P> "It's our gift to Ojai," said project coordinator Larry Wilde, an Ojai real  estate broker. He credited former club president Roger Phelps, an Ojai  optometrist, for directing the effort, stonemason David Lee for contributing  his skills and Ojai artist Kent Butler for sketching the plaque's mountain  relief.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ouagadougou, 17 March (PANA) -- The resignation of  the Burkinabe prime minister, Youssouf Ouedraogo, was caused by  the failure of negotiations with workers following the  devaluation of the CFA franc in January, observers said Thursday  [17 March] in Ouagadougou. They point out that even if he was  supported by President Blaise Compaore, he was not able to meet  the demands of the trade unions.    The workers were demanding better living conditions, a  substantial salary increase and maintaining prices at a  reasonable level. In spite of the signing on Saturday of a  joint communique between the government and the unions which  increased salaries, the trade unions are still threatening to  strike because they consider the salary increases insufficient.  Some of the trade union leaders who signed the accord later  rejected it saying that concessions made by the government were  not enough.    Youssouf Ouedraogo, who resigned on Wednesday night, is  portrayed in his country as a brilliant technocrat, with a solid  academic, administrative and political experience in Burkina  Faso. Nominated prime minister on 16 June 1992, Ouedraogo, an  economist, has been a lecturer at the Economic Sciences  Institute of the University of Ouagadougou. A member of the  People's Assembly (ADP- Parliament) since the last general  elections of 1992, Ouedraogo was planning and popular  development minister (September 1984-August 1987), cooperation  and planning minister (November 1987-April 1989) and president  of the Economic and Social Council (April 1989-May 1992).    During the general convention of the Organisation for  Popular  Democracy Labour Movement (ODP/MT), which has majority in  Parliament with 79 seats Ouedraogo who was not an active  political leader, was elected senior vice president of the  party, on 19 April 1993. His nomination as prime minister  raised many controversies in the ODP/MT. He reshuffled his  government two times during his two year term. The first was on  3 September 1993 and the second on 19 January 1994.</p>

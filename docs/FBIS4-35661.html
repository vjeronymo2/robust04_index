			<p>BFN     [Text] The 16th regional seminar of the revolutionary  committees movement began this afternoon under the theme: For  revolutionary tasks of defiance and confrontation. The seminar  is being held from 30 May to 1 June. The agenda consists of  three topics: the local topic, the pan-Arab topic, and the  international topic.    The local topic is focussed on work for further improving  production capacity, practicing self-reliance, and fortifying  the coast. The pan-Arab topic consists of boosting the morale  of the Arab masses, exposing the aims of colonialism, sticking  to the pan-Arab spirit, working for destroying the artificial  borders, and forging alliance with the active forces in the Arab  homeland. As for the international topic, it consists in  working for broadening the international front, forging alliance  with the small peoples which struggle for their freedom, and  standing with the peoples that love peace based on justice and  respect of freedom, sovereignty, and the options of peoples.    The meeting of the 16th seminar of the revolutionary  committees movement comes at a time when the Arab Libyan people  have declared their historic resolution of defiance and  preparedness for confrontation, as shown by the great defiance  manifestations in which the masses took to the streets to  receive the brother of the revolution everywhere in the Arab  Libyan territory.</p>

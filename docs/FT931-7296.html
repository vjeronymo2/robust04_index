			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Ford unions warn of strike action FORD, the US carmaker, faces the prospect of an all-out strike this spring at all 21 UK plants over compulsory redundancies. Unions representing 9,000 white-collar staff at Ford announced yesterday that they would ballot members early next month on whether to launch industrial action against any planned job cuts. Unions representing Ford's 24,400 manual workers are due to meet the company on March 11. They say that they also intend to hold a strike ballot if they do not receive a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies among production workers. The unions - the TGWU general union and the MSF white-collar union - said yesterday that Ford had rejected all their proposals to avoid the proposed job losses and had refused to consult them. It is the first time in 30 years that Ford has sought compulsory redundancies at its UK plants. In December the company announced it needed to cut its white-collar labour force by 1,200. Ford said so far 650 workers had volunteered for redundancy from staff grades. It also said that the manual workforce had to be reduced by 1,180 at its plants at Dagenham, east London, Halewood on Merseyside and Bridgend, south Wales. So far 530 workers have agreed to go. Ford set a deadline of March 30 for voluntary redundancies but recently it has warned hundreds of workers that they could be made compulsorily redundant. The company said that it had to reduce its workforce because of falling demand for its models and as part of an efficiency drive in its European operations. Both the MSF and the TGWU said yesterday that this week's announcement by Ford of 500 new research and development jobs at its plant at Dunton, Essex did not affect the outlook. They pointed out the jobs were not new but part of a relocation deal with Germany in which the UK would lose more jobs to Germany than were gained. Mr Bob Purkiss, TGWU national officer, said he was urging his members to resist what he called the threat of 'unprecedented sackings'. Mr Jim Thomas, MSF official for the motor industry, added the unions had 'no choice but to urge our members to take a stand against this shabby treatment'.</p>

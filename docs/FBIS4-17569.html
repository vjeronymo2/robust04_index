			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas before </F> the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in  Strasbourg on 14 April]    [Text] Mr. President,    Madame Secretary General,    Ladies and Gentlemen,    I am exited to be able to speak to you today. I represent  Lithuania -- one of the three Baltic states which base their  development on universal and acknowledged values: Democracy,  freedom, human rights, the supremacy of law, and social justice.    I believe that one of the most important things that we have  gained in Lithuania after the restoration of independence on 11  March 1990 is the feeling of, and the aspiration for, unity with  Europe. This is a clear understanding in the people that  Lithuania is a European state. Lithuanian people are  consistently implementing and testifying to this inner principle  in practice. Apart from all this, we do not mean that Lithuania  expects benefits from Europe, but we mean that it is actively  looking for ways of becoming useful and interesting to Europe.  We pursue neither a policy of nationalistic egoism nor state  isolation. On the contrary, our openness and readiness to  reconciliate different interests meeting in Lithuania and the  desire for wise compromises push us ahead. We cannot allow  Lithuania, which, incidentally, is in the geographic center of  Europe, to become its province.    There are people in this assembly who are familiar with my  background and who have heard that I headed the secession of the  Lithuanian Communist Party from Moscow. Back in 1989, we  clearly spoke out for a democratic and independent Lithuanian  state. That was the first move of its sort in the former Soviet  Union, which was transferred to the CPSU monolith in 1989. I do  not want to overestimate any party or movement, the role of one  politician or another in restoring the independent Lithuania.  The will of the Lithuanian people themselves to manage their  affairs and create a citizens' community and a democratic state  was and remains the decisive basis for change. History itself,  the beginning of reform in the former Soviet Union, and support  of the free world community for our aspirations, which pursued  the policy of nonrecognition of occupation and annexation,  create conditions for this state to become a reality.    In the first direct presidential elections in the history of  Lithuania, people voted for me as I am, knowing my background.  I am convinced that history has granted a chance for all  Lithuanian people, including myself, to create a democratic  state and a new community, where people should not be divided  into winners and losers.    The collapse of the communist system in Eastern and Central  Europe, and the deepening processes of integration in the West,  simply do not leave any other alternative than participation in  building the new Europe. Following the "Cold War" and  ideological confrontation, I think that we would not be  satisfied with a Europe of "cold peace" and local conflicts.  Lithuania, as well as other Eastern and Central European  states, would like to see the West expand its attention and  assistance to the countries east of the fallen Berlin Wall,  treating this region as an integral part of the new Europe. The  West should have a better understanding of the complicated and  real problems, and even dangers that could ensue from the  increasing instability in some Eastern states.    In terms of European security and stability, and within the  context of the predicted expansion of the European Union to the  East, the importance of the Stability Pact becomes obvious.  Lithuania understands this initiative not only as a forum for  discussions on regional security and stability problems, but  also as an effective measure for regulating interstate political  conflicts and a means of preventive diplomacy. Exerting our  efforts to prevent the problems of ethnic minorities and borders  from posing additional threats to the security of regions or  even of all Europe, we should not forget the influence of  economic and social factors and their link with these problems.  It seems that the latter could be resolved through the  so-called "additional agreements" which are envisioned in  executing the pact.    Last spring, during my meeting with members of the Vilnius  University Senate and ambassadors accredited in Vilnius on the  occasion of Lithuania's admission to the European Council, as  well as during the summit meeting in Vienna, I proposed to hold  a conference of the heads of new democratic states.    This conference could be held under the auspices of the  European Council. This would not be an attempt to form another  bloc or a place to complain of economic difficulties. The most  important thing is that we could have businesslike consultations  on how to strengthen the democratic system, conduct reforms  related to it, and overcome difficulties that are common to most  countries. West European states have learned the art of  democratic and equal cooperation for decades. We do not have so  much time. It would be very important if we could shorten this  time by joint effort and with the assistance of the European  Council. I believe that the participation in this conference of  Western States, which have the experience of the successful  transition from autocracy to democracy, would be extremely  significant.    I see the exceptional role of the European Council in  ensuring progress in the creation of a new and democratic  Europe. The activities of the Parliamentary Assembly are  important both in implementing pan-European political  cooperation, and in specifying, defining, and defending human  rights and freedoms considering the world changes under way. It  is very important that all European institutions, which are  already operating or which are being created, function in  agreement, without mutual duplications and contradictions.    Our country has achieved a sufficient level of political,  economic, and social stability. Since the 1992 democratic  elections, all government institutions projected in the new  Constitution, that was adopted in a referendum, have functioned  in Lithuania. Nine political parties are represented in the  Seimas [parliament]. The current majority in the Seimas is held  by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, which has formed a  stable government. Several opposition factions are very active.  Implementing the principle of division and balance of powers,  the Constitutional Court has begun its work. A multiparty  system is emerging in society, while the government does not  restrict the freedom of speech. The Seimas is debating the law  on local self- governments, which defines their duties,  responsibility, and relations with central bodies in a more  detailed and stricter manner. We do not have any problems with  either ethnic minorities or borders. We have adopted a law on  investments favorable to foreign investors. We have curbed  inflation. Lithuania has had a stable currency for a year, the  viability of which is guaranteed by sufficient gold and hard  currency resources. According to the statistics of  representatives of the European Union [EU], privatization in  Lithuania is the most rapid among all other Eastern and Central  European countries. More than half of the employed population  works in the nonstate sector. Living standards have stabilized  after a four-year decline, even though they are not high. We  have halted the dangerous rise in the crime rate. A stratum of  active people with initiative is emerging in the process of  reform. Certainly, all of this strengthens the foundation of  democracy.    At the same time, we notice, however, that hidden  unemployment is spreading in Lithuania. A considerably high  crime rate infringes on citizens' rights and affects the  development of market relations. Sometimes the freedom of speech  also encounters economic problems, when it is necessary not only  to publish but also to sell a newspaper, or to financially  support an independent radio or television station. There are  too many people living on the verge of poverty. The middle  class is slow in emerging. The ill- considered reform in  agriculture has produced very painful social and economic  effects. The influx of foreign investments into Lithuania is  overly slow. I regret that last fall, the Seimas failed to  rally the qualified majority for the constitutional amendment  allowing the sale of land to foreign investors. Under current  Lithuanian law, foreigners can lease land for 99 years.    Seeing these troubles as typical of newly democratic states,  we realize that thus far we have secured the irrevocability of  reform. However, we have not yet achieved the stage in which  reform, designed to create a social market, would become the  source of wealth and progress for all citizens. Therefore, we  will require much effort to escape impasse in the transitional  period and the danger of returning to the autocratic rule common  to Eastern and Central Europe between the wars.    Taking this opportunity, I would like to repeatedly express  Lithuania's determination to sign the European (Association)  Agreement with the EU as early as this year, which would become  an unequivocal sign of support for our reform. It seems that  this time we, the people from Eastern and Central Europe, must  encourage Westerners for more resolute and powerful moves, and  remind them that their hesitation and indecisiveness can again  divide Europe and deprive us of our future. The time has come  to welcome our future. The European Council seems to have been  the first organization that had enough courage to greet and  admit this future along with us, the newly democratic states.  On behalf of Lithuania, I express my gratitude to the European  Council, which rendered and continues to render vital support to  the development of democratic traditions in our state.    European security is indivisible. Therefore, Lithuania's  security is indivisible from that of Europe. On 27 January of  this year, Lithuania joined the NATO "Partnership for Peace"  program, stressing its goal -- from partnership to full NATO  membership. It is important to note that Lithuania's  cooperation is not and cannot be directed against any European  state. Defense and political integration with Europe through  cooperation with NATO and the West European Union will be  impossible and unreal without the possibility of speeding up  Lithuania's political and economic relations with the EU.    Good relations with neighbors is Lithuania's priority. Thus  far, there have not been any serious reasons that could hamper  Lithuania's good-neighborly relations with Russia, Poland, or  Belarus. I say nothing about cooperation among the three Baltic  states, where recently we have passed over from good intentions  and projects to their implementation and the creation of  relevant structures. The free-trade agreement among Lithuania,  Estonia, and Latvia has come into effect. A unified visa space  is emerging. The bodies of parliamentary cooperation are  operating, while those of government cooperation are being  created. Meetings among the presidents are held regularly.    The three Baltic states attach great importance to the  expansion of cooperation with the five Nordic states according  to the formula "3 plus 5," as well as with the states of the  Baltic Sea region and Eastern and Central Europe. This complies  with Lithuania's strategic foreign policy goals.    I assess the initialing of the Lithuanian-Polish treaty as  a great political success. The treaty testifies to the growing  mutual understanding between the two countries and nations, and  provides a legal backdrop to our historical conflicts. The  Lithuanians and the Poles, who had lived in one state in the  Middle Ages, were divided by profound hostility in the first  half of this century concerning the fate of Lithuania's capital  Vilnius and its region. Echoes of this hostility are sometimes  felt in society's moods and in statements by some politicians  even today. I think that this agreement, which President L.  Walesa and I will sign in 12 days in Vilnius, will allay the  path of both countries to the new Europe and become a  substantial contribution to the stability of the continent and  the Stability Pact. The process of reconciliation, which began  in Europe after World War II, is inexorably spreading from West  to East. The place where this process would halt could,  probably, mean an end to the Europe of the 21st century. In  sight of the tragedies in the Caucasus and former Yugoslavia,  which seemed to be impossible in the late ah century, we must  find a more operative and effective possibility for utilizing  the influence of international organizations, including that of  the European Council.    Multilateral international cooperation is another level  about  which I would like to speak. Although Lithuania is not a large  state in geopolitical terms, I believe that from most viewpoints  all countries are relatively small today in comparison with the  problems that have befallen Europe, the goals of universal  integration, and the future perspective. Therefore, I fully  support the idea of the French prime minister that there are no  small or large states in Europe but that there are only partners  of the common cause. I suppose that the European Council will  have an exceptional role in Europe's architecture -- as a forum  of equal pan-European states, an effective guarantor of states'  commitments in the sphere of human rights, and a mechanism for  implementing new initiatives.    The expansion of the European Council is another responsible  task that emerges in projecting the new Europe and promoting  political dialogue. I am certain that the compliance of  candidates with the principles and standards of the European  Council will be checked on very thoroughly, and that they will  be rendered the necessary assistance in implementing these  principles and standards.    The integration among the three Baltic states largely  depends  on Latvia's membership in the European Council. The ethnic  situation in Latvia, which emerged over the period of Soviet  occupation, is unique. However, the problems arising from it  should not be the reason for delaying Latvia's full membership.    I suppose that Russia has a chance to implement democracy  and  escape the outbreak of dangerous imperial forces. Therefore,  the procedure of Russia's membership begun by the Parliamentary  Assembly implies political and moral support for the democratic  forces of this country. The withdrawal of its Army from Latvian  and Estonian territories by 31 August of this year would be a  favorable reflection of Russia's intention to peacefully  regulate its relations with neighbors.    At the same time, I would like to draw your attention to  another trait in Russia's relations with neighbors that has  become distinct recently. One had the impression in the second  half of the past year that new relations based on constructive  and mutually beneficial cooperation were emerging between  Lithuania and Russia. As had been agreed, Russia withdrew its  Army from Lithuania, and I met with President B. Yeltsin.  Shortly thereafter, Russian Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin paid  a visit to Vilnius where he signed 10 agreements.  Unfortunately, the subsequent developments demonstrate that it  is not so easy to change the established stereotypes in  relations with smaller neighbors. The trade and economic  agreement signed between Lithuania and Russia has not yet come  into force due to the latter's position. Lithuania, as well as  other Baltic states, is not included on the list of countries  with which Russia concludes normal trade agreements. It would  be important for us, and, I think, also for other European  states, to know whether the aforementioned facts reflect the  work style of Moscow's officials or its political line. It is  regrettable that defending the Russian- speaking population by  words, Russia is actually worsening the social situation of  those citizens by applying economic levers against Lithuania.  This will primarily halt large enterprises in Lithuania and  other Baltic states, the output of which is largely exported to  Russia and the workers of which are mostly Russian speakers.    In my opinion, Russia's principles in relations with  neighbors should comply with universally acknowledged principles  of international law. I think that Russia's respect for the  sovereignty of the Baltic states, the rejection of the concept  of "near abroad countries," and the execution of international  agreements would speed up the decision of the European Council  on this country's membership. The Baltic states and, I would  suppose, the European Council would assess it as most positive  if Russia's governmental institutions officially dissociated  themselves from some political groups in the parliament and  their statements negating the lawfulness of the independence of  the Baltic states and the territorial inviolability of some  European states.    Lithuania has a common border with Russia through  Kaliningrad  Oblast. Therefore, it is very important to us whether this  region that used to be the military outpost of the former Soviet  Union will gradually be demilitarized and will become a zone of  active business. We feel positive efforts in this direction  both from Moscow and Kaliningrad. However, sometimes one can  notice the opposite tendencies as well. I think that Russia and  its neighbors would be interested in attracting capital and  various businessmen to this area, and in a larger role of  international organizations there, particularly that of the EU.    Here is the last idea that I would like to share with you.  Lithuania freed itself after 50 years of oppression. Therefore,  the appeal that was voiced at the summit meeting of the European  Council in Vienna urging to combat national egoism, ethnic  hatred, racism, and anti-Semitism is very important to us. I  can assure you on behalf of the Lithuanian leadership that we  are strictly following this Vienna declaration. Lithuania can  rightly take pride in the rational resolution of ethnic  problems, including those of the Russian minority. It is  strange that now and then we hear unfounded accusations against  Lithuania, from both the Russian press and some politicians.  The tradition of ethnic tolerance is viable in our country, and  we are interested in its further promotion, particularly among  young people. We can remember that not a single ethnic minority  has disappeared in Lithuania over 600 years.    Another historical topic painful to all of us is linked with  the Jewish genocide and the execution of the fascist regime in  Lithuania during World War II. I mourn those numerous victims.  I also regret the fact that some Lithuanians participated in  punitive actions. Therefore, I state firmly that all criminals  who have not yet been reached by the hand of justice must be  exposed and punished. We are accomplishing this with  consistency and calling on all interested organizations and  individuals to cooperate with us. Maybe, not everything has  been yet said about those tragic events. However, we are not  afraid to speak about them, and with open hearts we seek mutual  understanding both with Israel and the Jewish communities in our  state and others. The firm basis for this is not only the  centuries-old tradition of the Lithuanian and Jewish nations  living together on the same land, but also the self-sacrifice of  hundreds of Lithuanians in saving Jews persecuted during the  war. Now that we have restored Lithuania's independence, we  have accomplished much in rebuilding hundreds of Jewish  graveyards and monuments, and granting possibilities for their  cultural and educational activities.    Lithuania is working intensively to bring its laws in line  with the European Council Convention on the Protection of Human  Rights and Freedoms. The president's duty to submit  international agreements for ratification, contained in the  Constitution, has encouraged me to set up a group that engages  in active work and cooperates with European Council experts.  Being fully aware of your constant attention and the fixed  limit of the "proper period," I will assure the most rapid  ratification of this convention. By joining conventions that  constitute the European Agreement System, Lithuania not only  assumes new commitments but also acquires new possibilities.  Integration with this system is one of our state's priority  goals.    Lithuania realizes the importance of its state commitments  to  the international community, and primarily to its people. The  exceptional significance of the European Council in Europe's  current changes repeatedly proves that the human dimension is  the basis for the lives and reinforcement of all democratic  states.</p>

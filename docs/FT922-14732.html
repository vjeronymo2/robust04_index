			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: Fresh fish in a deep freeze MINUS 12' is not a temperature recommended for trying to impale bright red mosquito larvae on a tiny hook. It leaves you with what can only be described as mosquito juice over your aching, gloveless hands, and with nothing but icy lake water in which to wash them clean. Reaching down through a tangle of line, weights, float and hooks, you rinse your fingers in the 6in-wide hole which is your window to the lake below. Then, after wiping your hands dry on your Shuba, the enormous sheepskin coat which is the sine qua non of all serious ice-fishermen, you lower the red bait down until it sits, invitingly, just above the lake floor. There are two things which make this masochism worthwhile. First, you will definitely catch a fish. In fact, you will probably catch more than you can be bothered with. A nursery school of overly-curious lesh (bream) played enthusiastically under our ring of ice-holes. In three days, only restraint stopped me from pulling out more than 50. Second, you get to toast every new arrival with Russia's answer to a Fisherman's Friend - vodka. The lake I visited with a group of Russian friends is six hours by car north-west of Moscow. Russian roads being what they are, three punctures and only two spare tyres meant we took twice that long. Lake Seligier is a bright white maze of islands and inlets, its shores cluttered with giant bullrushes and rickety pedalos, clamped for the winter in 2ft of ice. A tangle of frozen tram lines marks the paths of cross-country skiers. Wooden dachas and the occasional onion-domed church hide among the pine trees. The hotel in which we stayed - or, to give it its proper title, the House of Leisure - sits on the lake edge. It is a contradictory, kitsch sort of place: Butlins holiday camps meet Bolshevism. Clean, sparse rooms. Communal, temperamental showers. Each evening, we sat in a corner of the vast dining room eating oukha, the steaming fish soup we had made out of the day's catch, while hordes of adults in identical 1960s'-style track suits and groups of chaperoned children swarmed punctually in and out for their set meals. After dinner, the Butlins' influence gains the upper hand. Distracted briefly by a recreation room full of broken arcade games, we headed downstairs along a bright purple corridor, past maps which calmly proposed 210 km skiing tours, to the disco. The DJ did not take requests but was more than happy to keep playing the latest hit, a Euro-pop track called Bad Russians. Clearly, though, Russians take their fishing more seriously than their dancing. By the time we emerged on to the blinding white ice just after 8am, small clusters of Shuba-coated fisherman were already dotted across the lake, hunched over their holes. Loaded up for the day, (Shuba, Fisherman's Friends, giant corkscrew to make your hole, sieve to keep it ice-free, pocket-sized rod and line, stool, vacuum flask, bait) we pushed off on our skis. Somewhere out there, we were assured, were enormous pike. Perhaps next time. For now, the art of hauling a 27kg fish through a 6in hole must remain a mystery.</p>

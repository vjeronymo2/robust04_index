			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVIL LIES IN SYSTEM, NOT IN THE RACE;  </P> <P> GERMANY: IT'S NOT THE PREDISPOSITION OF A PEOPLE BUT THE QUEST OF A DICTATOR  FOR TOTAL CONTROL THAT LEADS TO AGGRESSION AND WAR.  </P> <P> The die is cast, the commitment made. Britain, France, the United States and  the Soviet Union have agreed on the creation of a new Germany and to a process  by which it will occur. Still, on the morning after, Europe is feeling  ambivalent about the whole matter.  </P> <P> Although Western governments long ago endorsed reunification of the two  Germanys, and recent polls show that more West Europeans support than oppose  reunification, misgivings abound as the reality looms. The Soviet Union remains  the most outspoken of the four powers about its concerns. "Small boys, when  they play soldiers here, still play Russians against Germans, not Russians  against Americans," a Soviet political scientist said in explaining Soviet  reluctance about German unity.  </P> <P> Substantial minorities of adults in Poland, France, Britain and the Benelux  countries, among others, share this reluctance to see the reconstruction of a  powerful Germany in the heart of Europe. Poland has demanded a major role in  the reunification process on the ground that previous suffering gives it a  special interest.  </P> <P> Germans are acutely aware of their neighbors' concerns. They have heard the bad  jokes about how their neighbors like Germany so much they want two of them,  about how the purpose of NATO is to keep the Russians out, the Americans in,  and the Germans down. West Germans, in particular, have made repeated efforts  to reassure their neighbors. They are still working on the problem.  </P> <P> "We Germans are aware of the historical dimensions of (the reunification)  process," West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told Mikhail S.  Gorbachev in Moscow. "We are aware of all the suffering inflicted on other  nations in the name of Germany," he said. "We do not have territorial claims  against any of our neighbors," he added, seeking especially to reassure Poland.  But the fear remains.  </P> <P> Perhaps because the United States never suffered physical destruction or defeat  from the Germans, or perhaps because it is an ocean away, Americans are less  worried than Europeans about a resurgent Germany, though they are sensitive to  the power of the German economy. There is another reason why Americans do not  worry as much. To be deeply concerned about "the German problem," you must  believe that there is something inherent in the German people that predisposes  them to expansion and aggression, and that this tendency is stronger than the  experiences of war, defeat, occupation, division and 40 years of democratic  politics. Americans have a habit of believing experience is more powerful than  inheritance in shaping social behavior.  </P> <P> I do not believe that there is a permanent predisposition to conquest in the  German psyche. I do believe that there is a predisposition to aggression and  war in totalitarian politics, and that this made the Germans of the Nazi period  a special menace to Jews, Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses and all Germans who  opposed Hitler's vision and commands.  </P> <P> We know from the brief, violent history of Hitler's rule that the Nazis first  made war on German society, then made war on the world. They moved quickly from  the quest for total control within one country to the quest for control beyond  its borders. The Nazi political machine was responsible for the deaths of tens  of millions of people inside and outside Germany.  </P> <P> It is right to fear the destructive dynamic that drives such politics. But it  does not follow that we must fear Germans. Nor does the Soviet record prove we  should forever fear Russians. Instead we should fear totalitarianism.  </P> <P> Both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union adopted policies that involved huge  bureaucracies and mass murders. To collect and ship Jews and operate the death  camps of the Final Solution required the active participation of tens of  thousands of Germans -- just as it required great bureaucracies of Soviet  citizens to staff the secret police, the interrogations, prisons, executions  and slave labor camps of Stalin's gulag.  </P> <P> It does not follow, however, that the national character of Russians or Germans  drove this destruction. It was rather the quest of dictators for total control.  Totalitarian politics is dangerous because it strips individuals of rights and  societies of protection and leaves them exposed to the state's claim of total  power.  </P> <P> The lesson of this century is not that Germans or Russians are intrinsically  dangerous to the world, but that small bands of violent men who claim special  powers over the rest of us should be restrained at all cost.  </P></p>

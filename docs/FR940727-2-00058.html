			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Decontaminate all persons who may possibly have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent before they are transported to a hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Decontamination substances should be readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include soap, water, and 5% hypochlorite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To protect the environment, include in State and local disaster plans a method for containing and disposing of contaminated runoff. CDC does not recommend establishing fixed decontamination units in prehospital areas because of the expense and inflexibility of such units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Level of Medical Preparedness Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> At a minimum,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> train persons designated as prehospital medical responders in evaluating patients exposed to chemical warfare agents, managing patients' airways (excluding intubation), transporting patients, and decontaminating patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Train prehospital responders who have been designated in State or local disaster plans to operate in environments contaminated by a chemical warfare agent in the proper use of PPE in accordance with OSHA guidelines (2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensure that,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> at a minimum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , physicians who have been designated in State and local disaster plans to provide medical supervision for prehospital emergency responders and medical care for victims of a chemical agent release receive specialized training through continuing education in the emergency response areas specified for prehospital responders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Patient Triage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The basic premise of patient triage, to provide maximum benefit to the greatest number of victims, is of utmost importance during a mass-casualty event involving chemical agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Have the most experienced responder conduct triage operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Base decisions regarding patient triage on local resources, the extent of patient contamination, the type of chemical warfare agent to which the patient is exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the likelihood of additional traumatic injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Public Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Inform the public appropriately, accurately, and rapidly about chemical agent exposures that have or may have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establish, through the local emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital community, a coordinated public information policy for chemical emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contact local and regional news media in advance to establish an accurate and rapid way of disseminating critical information to the public concerning a chemical agent emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensure that hospital and EMS personnel coordinate their plans to provide public information with the plans of those who have overall responsibility for emergency response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Communication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Medical personnel must have access to the emergency communication network 24 hours a day. Such a network should link the chemical agent depot, local and regional EMS, and all potential receiving hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Have medical personnel demonstrate the ability to access the emergency communications network during any evaluation of preparedness for a chemical warfare release into civilian communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensure that the hospitals' emergency communications system allows hospital personnel to verify rapidly whether a chemical warfare agent release has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Transporting Exposed Victims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Coordinate the transportation of chemical agent-exposed victims with the overall disaster response plan, and include a method for tracking transported patients during an emergency response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Transport patients only after they have been properly decontaminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Transport decontaminated patients to medical facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics, and urgent care centers).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Formal agreements such as memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between organizations that transport patients and the medical facilities that receive them must be part of the planning process. Medical facilities designated to receive should be capable of evaluating and managing patients exposed to chemical agents as described later in the hospital section (Section IV) of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Base decisions regarding urgent and emergency transfers of decontaminated patients on the capabilities of the receiving facilities, transportation resources, demand for hospital services, and the clinical condition of the patients. Certain medical care (e.g., for burns, pediatric emergencies, trauma, or pulmonary complications) might require prearrangements for patients to be transferred to a tertiary treatment center. CDC recommends that transfer and evacuation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> plans  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for victims exposed to chemical warfare agents call for land_rather than air_transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

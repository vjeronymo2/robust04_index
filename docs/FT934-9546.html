			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Great Portland The 7 per cent rise in the value of a batch of Great Portland Estates' properties since March provides encouraging confirmation of the property recovery. Having been one of the first companies to reflect the severity of the downturn in 1990, Great Portland is now among the earliest to demonstrate the speed of the upturn. Yet it would be alarming if it were otherwise, given the surge in property shares over the past year. If anything, the suspicion is that Great Portland's revaluation may well understate the upturn in investment-grade property in central London. The market certainly presumes other companies will soon report double-digit rises in asset values. However, Great Portland's reduced interim dividend and static rental income are a useful reminder that many property balance sheets remain stretched and the underlying market fragile. Investors have not worried much about such niceties while chasing the yield available from property shares and in the direct market itself. But the first signs are emerging that the yield obsession may be beginning to fade. Leading property shares have been groggy since the wobbles in the US bond market hinted that long gilt yields may be close to their floor. When that appears more certain, attention will switch to companies offering better prospects for rental growth. Ironically, it could then be the weaker companies, such as Great Portland, which boast low rental bases and empty space which find particular favour.</p>

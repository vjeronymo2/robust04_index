			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanichaphak has  rejected as untrue the observations made by certain elements in  the Thai private sector that the Thai Government has been acting  slowly in dealing with trade and investment in Vietnam following  the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. He told reporters that  the Thai Government's consistent efforts to build economic  cooperation with Vietnam and other neighboring countries was  part of the impetus behind the U.S. private sector pressing  their government to terminate the trade embargo.    The deputy prime minister said that soon after it first  assumed office, the government began promoting trade with  Vietnam as if there was no U.S. trade embargo. The government  has extended the Mekong River development program to cover six  countries, and is considering inviting China to participate in  the scheme. Vietnam and Thailand are in the process of  establishing energy cooperation, and Thailand plans to buy  natural gas from Vietnam. The government intends to open a Thai  investment promotion office in Vietnam, and is encouraging Thai  commercial banks to open branches there. The number of Thai  commercial banks currently operating in Vietnam is second only  to France. Officials are working on a plan to link the two  countries' telecommunications networks and promote investment in  Vietnam's tourism industry. Meanwhile, the Thai Government has  also provided gratis financial assistance to Vietnam.    Suphachai noted that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo  will help Thailand become the trade and investment center of the  Indochinese region. Japan is using Thailand for that purpose.  He said the private sector should realize the government cannot  interfere in every matter. Its duty is merely to lay the  foundation for them. He pointed out that the government only  wants good investors to invest in foreign countries, not those  who want to be brokers or middlemen and sell official permits to  other investors.</p>

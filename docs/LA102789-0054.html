			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO MOVE NUCLEAR SUBS OUT OF BALTIC  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced Thursday that the Soviet Union will  withdraw all its nuclear-armed submarines from the Baltic Sea in a step toward  making Northern Europe a nuclear-free zone.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, pressing the Kremlin's overall disarmament drive and its goal of a  world eventually free of nuclear weapons, said the Soviet Union has already  removed or repositioned all its tactical nuclear missiles capable of striking  Northern Europe.  </P> <P> He said the Soviet Union is also preparing to "eliminate certain classes of  sea-launched nuclear weapons," presumably cruise missiles, from the Baltic Sea  region.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader, who is visiting Finland, said the Soviet initiatives are  intended to give momentum to the movement to rid the Baltic and, if possible,  all Northern Europe of nuclear arms.  </P> <P> "We are prepared to come to an agreement with all the nuclear powers and the  Baltic states on effective guarantees for the nuclear-free status of the Baltic  Sea," Gorbachev said, addressing 1,500 Finnish politicians, businessmen and  community leaders in Helsinki, the Finnish capital.  </P> <P> He said the Soviet Union is taking these steps to follow up a speech he made  two years ago in the Soviet port of Murmansk proposing a nuclear-free zone in  Northern Europe as well as other measures to reduce East-West tensions in  Europe.  </P> <P> The measures were unilateral, he said, and no longer conditioned on Western  agreement on a nuclear-free zone in the region.  </P> <P> The moves, although welcomed in Helsinki and most other Scandinavian capitals,  were met with skepticism in Washington.  </P> <P> "We do not believe that nuclear-free zones contribute to security in Europe,"  Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said. "Most of these  proposals have been designed to affect (the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization's) deterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weapons  intact."  </P> <P> Anticipating a negative U.S. reaction, Gorbachev addressed Washington directly  and said, "Let us meet halfway on the wish of the peoples in Northern Europe to  turn their countries into a reliable flank of a European and worldwide system  of security."  </P> <P> In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Gorbachev endorsed a Finnish proposal for a  nuclear-free zone in Northern Europe, centering on the 148,600-square-mile  Baltic Sea. The two NATO countries in the region, Norway and Denmark, do not  permit nuclear weapons in their territory in peacetime, and the other two  countries, Finland and Sweden, are neutral.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union started by removing from operational status two Golf-class  submarines, and before the end of 1990 it will destroy the four remaining  submarines of the same class," Gorbachev said Thursday. "We will also destroy  their standard nuclear missile payloads, and we have no plans for their  replacement."  </P> <P> Six Golf II subs, 321 feet long with a displacement of 2,950 tons, have been  deployed in the Baltic Sea since 1976, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, the  authoritative British naval reference. Soviet commentators have said the  submarines each carried 18 ballistic missiles.  </P> <P> The Golf II, increasingly obsolete, has slowly been withdrawn from service, and  Western naval attaches here contend that those still in use are largely  bargaining chips in arms-reduction negotiations.  </P> <P> "They are not only old and inefficient but they are becoming more and more  dangerous as their operating systems deteriorate," a NATO submariner here said.  "Every one still in service could be withdrawn without any diminution of Soviet  naval strength or strategic capability."  </P> <P> Gorbachev noted the sharp, unilateral reductions in Soviet and Warsaw Pact  forces over the last year and the shift of the remaining units into a defensive  posture.  </P> <P> "In the northern region, their transformation in this direction will be  completed next year," he said. "The numerical strength of Soviet land forces on  the Soviet-Finnish border is now less than the total numerical strength of land  forces in Finland.  </P> <P> "It can be said with certainty that the military-political situation in the  north has greatly improved. An attack or an outbreak of armed conflict in the  area is out of the question."  </P> <P> Acknowledging the strong Scandinavian concern about Soviet naval and air units  based on and around the Kola Peninsula, the headquarters of the Soviet Union's  powerful Northern Fleet, Gorbachev said these are strategic forces whose fate  depends on negotiations with the United States on a 50% reduction in strategic  arms.  </P> <P> But he suggested that countries of the region pursue their own negotiations on  various confidence-building measures and other agreements on naval activities  in the seas of Northern Europe.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said the Soviet Union will accept, for example, Norway's proposal for  negotiations to establish procedures for the mutual notification of accidents  involving ships, including nuclear-powered submarines. Three Soviet  nuclear-powered submarines have been involved in accidents since April in the  Barents and Norwegian seas.  </P> <P> Finnish officials welcomed Gorbachev's announcements, and they are assured of a  warm reception even in Norway and Denmark, the region's NATO members. They are  also likely to win support among political groups in the Baltic republics of  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where pressure has been building for the removal  of nuclear weapons from the region.  </P> <P> In his speech Thursday, Gorbachev effectively ended four decades of relentless  Soviet pressure on Finland to avoid offending Moscow in any way through a  policy known as "Finlandization."  </P> <P> Finland's neutrality, established in a 1948 treaty of friendship and  cooperation with the Soviet Union, had caused "ripples in the past," Gorbachev  said, and retains "distinct features."  </P> <P> "But what I wish to stress most firmly is that the Soviet Union unconditionally  recognizes Finland's neutral status," he declared, "and it will continue to  observe it in the future in full measure."  </P> <P> Discussing the next meeting on the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which formulated a  new relationship between East and West based on expanding contacts, increasing  trade and reducing tension, he suggested that a summit conference be held in  1992 in Helsinki.  </P> <P> Gorbachev also opened the possibility for direct contacts between legislators  in the Soviet Union's Baltic republics and the Scandinavian countries grouped  in the Nordic Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COUNTERPOINT  </P> <P> The Soviet proposal for a "nuclear-free" northern Europe is less than meets the  eye, critics say. The four nuclear submarines that Moscow plans to withdraw  from the Baltic Sea were headed for the scrap heap anyway. In July, the Kremlin  indicated it will eliminate all its Golf-class submarines because they are  outdated, said Richard Sharpe, editor of the authoritative Jane's Fighting  Ships. Losing the whole Golf fleet would not significantly hurt Soviet military  capability, other experts say. In any event, many U.S. experts believe NATO  needs the nuclear option to offset the superior conventional forces of the  Warsaw Pact. A nuclear-free zone thus would hurt NATO more than it hurts the  East Bloc, they say, and actually destabilizes Europe. "The United States  remains opposed to the concept of nuclear-free zones in Europe, or in waters  surrounding Europe, because we think such zones do not make a real contribution  to preserving European security and stability," the White House said late  Thursday.  </P></p>

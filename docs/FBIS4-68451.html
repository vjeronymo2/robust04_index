			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, doctor of historical </F> sciences: "CIS Not a Burden for Moscow: The Commonwealth as a  Guarantee of General Revival"]    [Text] The Commonwealth of Independent States, which  emerged from the rubble of a superpower, is into its third year.  Sufficient time to have left the infant and toddler phase and to  have begun to walk unaided. But the diagnosis "something is  rotten," which was once appended to the state of affairs "in the  state of Denmark," has proven appropriate to the CIS also. The  processes of the formation of the Commonwealth are proving  contradictory, and successes are being replaced by failures,  setbacks even. As a result, no one can say for certain what will  come of all this.    Let us attempt to grasp the realities that have emerged. It  would seem that the correct reference point is the historical  background from which the present relationships in the  Commonwealth are growing.  <H5>  Is the Role of Leader a Burden? </H5>   How were the components of the CIS' predecessor--the Soviet  Union--correlated between themselves? A well-known charge  leveled at it is that it was an empire. Let us take a look  according to a dispassionate criterion of identification of a  real empire, namely, whether the center (metropolis) pumps  resources from the periphery (colonies). According to figures  used by, we would note, the International Monetary Fund, the  charges are not borne out--the Union center was a major donor in  respect to the five most backward Central Asian republics. Thus  at the last stage of the existence of the USSR, in 1991, Union  subsidies, according to IMF data, constituted the following  proportion of these budgets: 45 percent in Tajikistan, 43  percent in Uzbekistan, 35 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 25 percent in  Kazakhstan, and 22 percent in Turkmenistan. Thus according to a  key criterion, the Union was not an empire. It effected  infusions into the economy of the outlying areas, did not pump  resources out.    But this is only the first step toward establishment of the  root system. Let us try to exfoliate the facts further. There  arises, for example, the question: Where did the sums of money  for the subsidies come from? From other, more economically  developed Union republics, primarily Russia, which accounted for  60 percent of the overall potential. So what kind of nature of  relationship was it--"plunder in reverse," as it is sometimes  portrayed? Not this either. World experience testifies that this  is a normal, even typical, mode of interaction within any  federation. It is a question of the civilized redistribution of  resources among its members.    Let us look at Canada, the federation most similar to us  both  in terms of size of territory and natural and climatic  conditions and in terms of difference in the development of  individual parts of the country. The most industrially advanced  province of Canada--Ontario, accounting for 55 percent of  national production--is the main donor in relation to the  majority of the remaining 11 provinces and territories. Some of  them receive very substantial resources nominally from the  federal government, but in fact from Ontario. Thus for Canada's  four Atlantic provinces these transfers constituted in 1987 the  following percentage of their total income: 47 for Newfoundland,  46 for Prince Edward Island, 40 for New Brunswick, and 38 for  Nova Scotia.    In other words, the identity of the roles of Russia and  Ontario is obvious. It consists of the function of leader of the  federation, its locomotive, which is followed by the whole  train. It is important that the allocations made the others by a  forward-looking leader are by no means a one-sided burden. They  are also an assurance of the health of all members of the single  organism, a guarantee of the unity and integrity of the  federation. A wise head does not refuse to maintain the arms and  legs. The main thing is that the leader himself obtains a prize  in the form of more extensive national markets. He uses this to  considerable advantage, compensating the original costs. Thus  all members of the federation ultimately benefit, and this is  why they are interested in it.    It should be added that this nature of relations (with some  specific singularities, understandably) is characteristic of  other federations also--the United States, Germany, Switzerland,  Austria, Australia.    Of course, the CIS is not a federation, not even a  confederation, and only coordinating, not supranational, bodies  are possible within it. Yes, a lesser contribution of Russia to  the common pot is, consequently, justified as yet. But, on the  other hand, the CIS is a unique organization: Its participants,  even having become independent states, are tied to the Russian  Federation by the umbilical cord of many centuries of economic  and other relations and interdependencies. In so closely  interwoven a common space the guiding role of Russia is  justified. If we are all thinking in categories of voluntary  reintegration, and this has been the case thus far, we should  not, in any event, be taking abrupt steps back, moving back in  order subsequently, possibly, to take a step forward. But it is  this problem, apparently, that has arisen for Russia--this, by  appointment, nucleus of the Commonwealth.  <H5>  Recoil--Where and For What Purpose? </H5>   Unfortunately, a struggle of common sense and, in addition,  the lessons of world development against irrational  improvisations continues in the Russian position in respect to  the CIS. Consequently, the Commonwealth is at times recognized  as a legitimate child, with whom hopes for the future are  linked, what is more, at other times it suddenly comes to be  slighted as a foundling and sponger.    It is well known what has as of late served as a stimulus to  a strengthening of the trends of attraction on the periphery of  the CIS. Disenchantment with the euphoria of the sovereignties  and a growing understanding that it is easier to cope with  difficulties together. All the harder does what began as of the  middle of last year--opposite impulses of rejection from the  center--lend itself to a rational explanation.    There was in July 1993 a relapse into the Belovezha  syndrome--a new statement of the "Slav trio"--on this occasion  concerning urgent measures to strengthen only its economic  integration. This was followed by attempts by Moscow to impose a  "new-type" ruble zone on the rest of the participants in the  CIS. According to the conditions of its formation, the Russian  Federation could use these states' credit liabilities to place  an important part of their economies under control. Another  condition of Russian credit was the conclusion with CIS  countries of dual-citizenship agreements. It was said here that  we had not thought up such conditions, the entire international  credit system works on the basis of them, and that linking  policy with economics is a normal practice.    This is not true. First, as far as it itself is concerned,  the Russian Federation is justifiably rejecting the attempts by  the creditors of the London Club to sell its assets overseas for  the debts. Second, the demand for dual citizenship in respect to  25 million citizens of one country who suddenly, through no  fault of their own, have found themselves abroad is without  precedent. The main thing is that while in no way helping them  specifically, it even makes their position worse, putting the  corresponding states, a substantial part of whose population  would thereby become "semi-foreigners," on their guard. Similar  claims were not made on Estonia and Latvia, incidentally, where  severe discrimination against the Russian-speaking population is  being openly directed by the governments.    It is not surprising that both Russian conditions set the  CIS  countries in respect to credit were rejected. Following this, a  policy of evicting the malcontents from the ruble zone was  adopted, and all was crowned this March by a statement that the  burden of leader of the CIS does not suit Moscow.    As of the present there are more questions than answers in  connection with so abrupt a development. But the reflections are  highly disturbing. What is the reason, for example, for priority  being given the creation of an ethnic Slav union? The 1,000-year  history of the multinational Russian state has known of no such  reference point. This could be a mine beneath the fate of the  Russian Federation itself. Why, further, is it acceptable to  impose in the CIS the patronage of an older brother capable of  dictating his terms to the younger ones? To be honest, this is  akin to the imperial approach which we have sacredly forsworn.  Finally, does not all this mean virtual renunciation of a  full-fledged Commonwealth and its death knell? It is not,  evidently, from having nothing better to do that the president  of Kazakhstan, a convinced supporter of the CIS, has put forward  the alternative idea of a Eurasian Union.    One thing is certain--ignoring realities is dangerous. Only  in close interaction and on an equal basis with other countries  of the CIS, not in isolation from them, in confrontation with  them even less, is Russia's own revival conceivable.  <H5>  Potential of the Commonwealth </H5>   There are three main reasons why Russia's emergence from the  multidimensional crisis is possible only in cooperation with the  other countries of the CIS.    First, the imperatives of world development, with which  Russia should proceed in step, not against the current. These  amount to the fact that only extensive regional (meaning regions  of the world) markets afford real prospects of economic growth.  This is why the United States, despite all its colossal  possibilities, preferred to join forces with Canada and then  with Mexico also in the NAFTA trade and economic bloc. In turn,  Germany, France, Britain--also great economic powers--agreed to  unity with other states within the framework of the European  Union. In this context the sole possibility for Russia of not  withering away with its ailing economy and not suffocating from  a lack of oxygen is to have its own regional market in the form  of the CIS. The time of "lone wolves" in the world economy is  gone.    Second, the tasks of ensuring national security push in the  same direction. The collective interaction of the states of the  CIS is a dependable common shield. Arguing from the opposite:  Members of the Commonwealth, abandoned to the whim of fate,  would have even fewer chances than the Russian Federation of not  finding themselves plunged into chaos. But acquiring thereby an  "encircling lichen of conflicts" along its entire perimeter  would be most unpropitious surroundings for Russia. Such as it  has never known throughout history and should not know, even  less generate.    Third, as regards the geopolitical dimension. In short:  Unless the Russian Federation is the leader in its region of the  world, so much more will it not be a power of truly world  caliber.    An adjustment of the impulsive actions, based on elementary  miscalculation, is needed. A journey in the turbulent waters of  world economics and policy cannot be started by jettisoning the  lifesaver.</p>

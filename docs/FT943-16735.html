			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: It's open house at Equitable - Company beats SIB deadline on information Customers for pensions, insurance and investment products should acquire a greater spring in their step as the long-awaited system of ensuring they have better information about what they can buy - and what it might cost them - hits the streets. Or, rather, one street. From now on, Equitable Life, one of the UK's largest mutual life insurers, will show a new openness in the information it volunteers to all its customers. As yet, it is alone among life insurers in doing so. Equitable plays down the extent to which the new format will differ from the information it used to make available to clients but, until now, it has not produced estimates of what policies would be worth in the future based on its own charges rather than industry averages. As from yesterday, Equitable's sales agents will provide clients with: A four-page document setting out the key features of the policy being sold. Examples of how much it will yield. A letter explaining why the advice to take out the policy has been given. The surrender values at various points during the contract, together with a figure for the cost of providing advice. Take a 20-year pension plan sold to a man aged 45 which costs Pounds 1,000 a year in premiums and has an assumed 9 per cent rate of return. The information shows that if the policy were given up at the end of five years, the customer would receive Pounds 6,139, having paid Pounds 384 in deductions. On the same basis, the customer would have had Pounds 1,189 deducted in charges at the end of 10 years, and would receive Pounds 15,371 if the policy were surrendered then. It also says that the cost of providing advice for this sort of policy averaged Pounds 231 in 1993, and that this cost would rise proportionately as the level of customer contribution increased. The presentation of the information meets the format required by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. But some insurers say they cannot meet SIB's requirements until January 1, the date by which they become compulsory. Others do have plans to comply before then and will incorporate the changes in any new products - but these are not likely before the autumn. One reason for Equitable being able to move more quickly is because it is not re-designing its products, as many life insurers intend doing in order to spread the costs of commission as these become more visible. A further factor has been that Equitable's sales force is salaried - rather than paid on commission - and its costs are strikingly low as a proportion of its premium income. So, the issue is not as sensitive for the company as for most of its competitors. Should customers now stampede to Equitable? That depends on what you want, but it would be rash to assume that Equitable would suit everyone. It did, however, come out very well from the recent report by the Office of Fair Trading on surrender values of life policies. The company specialises in pensions for the top end of the personal financial market and has a conservative attitude towards its products, which it believes in keeping relatively simple. But there may be people, even in Equitable's target audience, who are slightly uncomfortable with its intent focus on individuals of high net worth. While this clearly makes commercial sense, there is something slightly chilling about the way its marketing director talks of 'the proletariat' during the same conversation in which he insists the company is not elitist.</p>

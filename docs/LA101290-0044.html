			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> FLAG HONORING GAYS ORDERED REMOVED  </P> <P> A rainbow-colored flag intended to honor gays and lesbians briefly flew over  the state Capitol, but it was soon ordered taken down by Gov. George  Deukmejian's office. Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), whose district  contains a large number of gays, asked the Joint Rules Committee to allow the  flag, which has no writing on it, to be flown and permission was granted. But  after only a few hours complaints were received by the governor's office and it  was ordered removed. "Flags that represent special interest lifestyles or  issues are not to be flown over the state Capitol," said Susan Trowbridge, a  Deukmejian spokeswoman.  </P></p>

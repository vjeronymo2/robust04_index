Moreover, the possibility of a visit to Hainan Province is also  being studied. In recent years, Mr. Deng has spent New Year's  days in Shanghai. However, he will leave Shanghai this year.    The inspection tour to the southern region is aimed at  showing Mr. Deng's strong will regarding the complicated Hong  Kong issue by visiting Guangdong Province, which has close  economic ties with Hong Kong. At the same time, it seems the  visit is also aimed at seeking continuation of high level  economic growth in southern China.</p>

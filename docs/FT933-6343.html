			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Bugatti buys Lotus group in Pounds 30m deal BUGATTI INTERNATIONAL is to take over Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering group, bringing together two of the most famous racing marques of the European motor industry. The Bugatti holding company, registered in Luxembourg after being formed in the late 1980s to revive the Bugatti marque, is understood to be paying about Pounds 30m to acquire Group Lotus from General Motors of the US. Bugatti International's main operating company is Bugatti Automobili, which started production in Italy last year of a L550m (Pounds 232,000) supercar, the EB110, the first Bugatti to be made since the early 1950s. The Bugatti name was made in the 1920s with a string of racing victories, and the design of many classic cars, including the Bugatti Royale. One 1931 Royale fetched a then record car auction price of Pounds 5.5m in November 1987 at Christie's in London. Group Lotus, founded in the early 1950s by Colin Chapman, one of the most creative post-war designers of racing cars, made its name in the 1960s and 1970s winning six drivers' and seven constructors' world championships. Group Lotus was acquired by GM in 1986 for Pounds 22.7m. It has run up heavy losses in recent years and the US carmaker has been searching for a buyer for months after the breakdown of talks on a management buy-out. Group Lotus suffered its biggest setback last year when it was forced by rapidly mounting losses to end production of the Elan sports car after less than 2 1/2 years. The Elan cost Lotus a write-off of Pounds 24.4m. The company acquired yesterday by Bugatti has no connection with Team Lotus, the Formula One motor racing operation. Bugatti is taking over the entire Group Lotus business including its engineering consulting and car production operations based at Hethel, near Norwich, as well as Lotus's assets in the US, where it sells through a network of 59 dealers. Mr Romano Artioli, president of Bugatti Automobili, said Lotus engineering would be used to accelerate development of Bugatti's planned EB112 sports saloon, due to be launched in 1995.

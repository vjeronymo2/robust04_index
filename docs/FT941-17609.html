			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Light at the end of Eurotunnel - The Bottom Line The quantification of the unquantifiable, that's what you are asking.' Thus one analyst summed up the difficulties of evaluating the 10-year extension of Eurotunnel's concession on running the Channel tunnel. In return, Eurotunnel is renouncing most of its claims for extra costs, estimated at between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn, against the British and French governments incurred because of increased safety, security and environmental measures. Eurotunnel will now hold the concession for 65 years, dating from the Channel Tunnel Act in 1987. 'This largely resolves the outstanding issues between the French and British governments and Eurotunnel,' said a French official. The news came out too late on Wednesday to affect the market. On Thursday morning, though, investors showed they approved and the share price rose 34p to 597p. Yesterday, it increased a further 13p to close at 610p, well up on the week. The profitability of the tunnel after it opens later this year is an unknown factor, let alone the value of money in the year 2052. But Eurotunnel looks on the verge of overcoming most of its troubles. In particular, the deal with the two governments bodes well for the company's talks with its bankers. Eurotunnel still has to fund the whole cost of the project, now estimated at Pounds 10bn instead of the original Pounds 4.8bn. While it has raised about Pounds 8.95bn, it needs at least another Pounds 1bn, mainly to cover debt servicing before the tunnel begins to break even on a cash basis in 1998. Deadline for a refinancing agreement for the Pounds 1bn is Tuesday. At least Pounds 500m is expected to come from a rights issue, for which the company won approval before Christmas. Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's finance director, said the 10-year extension would not accelerate the group's progress towards the rights issue, but it would facilitate it. The issue is expected in spring, possibly as early as March but more probably late in April or May. 'Once you have decided to go down that route, the quicker you go the better,' Corbett added. Further weeks of detailed negotiation lie ahead, even if a deal is reached with the banks on Tuesday. But winning the extended concession has made the road ahead look very much smoother. Looking back just six months, Eurotunnel has resolved a whole raft of troublesome issues. Among the most notable was the settlement at the end of July of the long-running dispute with Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French consortium of contractors building the tunnel, over responsibility for heavy cost over-runs. This was followed at the end of November by resolution of a dispute between Bombardier, the Canadian supplier of trains for the shuttle service, and Transmanche Link over the same issue. 'All the things that were giving the banks sleepless nights a few months ago have been resolved - now it's up to them to do their bit,' said Corbett. Looked at alongside comparable civil engineering projects of the past, Eurotunnel has not done too badly. Its cost over-runs pale into insignificance alongside the Suez and Panama canals, each of which soared more than 50 times over budget. More recently, the single bore Seikan rail tunnel connecting the northern island of Hokkaido to mainland Japan was completed after taking 24 years to build - 14 more than planned. The Channel tunnel will be running in March and the state opening by the Queen and French President Mitterrand is set for May 6. The UK government has resolved its dispute with Eurotunnel without having to pay out any cash. With the black clouds disappearing rapidly, from the horizon, it is not surprising that market sentiment has turned positive. And while investors will still have to wait until the turn of the century for any dividends, they can look forward to earnings coming on stream fairly soon - and those with travel concessions will be able to use them. As one analyst said yesterday: 'People who have held on this long have no reason to sell now.'</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSISTS WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN KEPT FULLY INFORMED;  </P> <P> SUNUNU EXPECTS NORIEGA WILL GO  </P> <P> White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu offered "8-to-5" odds Saturday that  Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega would be out of power within six months.  </P> <P> Sununu, interviewed on Cable News Network's Evans and Novak program, made the  statement after defending the Bush Administration's handling of the U.S.  response to the attempted coup against Noriega last Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We certainly would like to see him out. The President has said he wants him  out, and I can't believe that between the will of the people of Panama, and the  will of the people of the United States, we can't achieve that," the former New  Hampshire governor said.  </P> <P> "I'm not in the business of making predictions," he added, "but if you want  odds, I'd say 8-to-5 that he probably will be out."  </P> <P> Sununu maintained that the White House had received full information throughout  the abortive revolt by officers of Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces and that  he would not shift crisis management from the Pentagon to the White House to  improve coordination.  </P> <P> Congressional critics have insisted that faulty intelligence and tangled lines  of authority barred effective U.S. action during the attempted overthrow.  </P> <P> Sununu denied reports that he was dissatisfied with the handling of the  situation, during which U.S. forces blocked some access roads but failed to cut  off other routes used by loyalist troops to reach the besieged PDF headquarters  and rescue Noriega.  </P> <P> Critics have said a communications gap prevented President Bush from ordering  U.S. seizure of Noriega while he was briefly in rebel hands. Sununu indicated  that the assessment was accurate.  </P> <P> Asked if Bush would have sent in U.S. troops had he known that Noriega -- under  indictment in a Florida federal court for drug trafficking -- was a captive,  the chief of staff suggested that a similar situation in the future would meet  with a different response.  </P> <P> "If there had been a high probability earlier that Gen. Noriega was there and a  communication that would have made it clear that there would not have been  resistance from those who had taken him in our taking it over, we could have  started the decision-making process and perhaps moved in that direction," he  said.  </P> <P> Sununu also signaled that other Latin American governments should not regard  the Panama performance as an indication of future action. Asked if the  Sandinista regime in Nicaragua could now disregard U.S. pressure for a free  election there next February, Sununu replied:  </P> <P> "If they do make that assumption and not have a fair election, I think they're  going to be surprised, not only by the U.S. reaction, but the reaction around  the world."  </P> <P> Sununu emphasized that in both Panama and Nicaragua, the Administration sees  political pressure rather than military action as the primary instrument of  change.  </P> <P> "The long-range interest of this country and of the Western world is that what  we get is a concerted pressure on Noriega and a concerted pressure on the  regime in Nicaragua," he said. "That has achieved results. In the Western  Hemisphere, virtually all countries but those two have democratically elected  leaders . . . and I think we can continue to achieve that kind of results."  </P></p>

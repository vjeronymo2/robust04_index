			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Maki, D.G., ``The Use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Antiseptics for Handwashing by Medical Personnel,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Journal of Chemotherapy, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  1:3&hyph;11,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Ojajarvi, J., ``Effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hand Washing and Disinfection Methods in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removing Transient Bacteria After Patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nursing,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Cambridge University Journal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hygiene, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  85:193&hyph;203, 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Leyden, J.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Subungual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bacteria of the Hand: Contribution to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Glove Juice Test; Efficacy of Antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detergents,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Infection Control Hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Epidemiology, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  10:451&hyph;454, 1989.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. The agency is aware that some manufacturers provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical information relating to the antimicrobial activity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their health-care antiseptic drug products in the form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical information bulletins. The agency considers such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulletins to be labeling under the provisions of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 201(m) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``labeling'' as ``all labels and other written, printed, or graphic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter (1) upon any article or any of the containers or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.'' As labeling, technical information bulletins are subject to the OTC drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has no objection to the inclusion of technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information relating to the antimicrobial activity of these OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug products in the labeling of products intended for health- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care professionals only. Therefore, in this amended tentative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final monograph the agency is proposing that manufacturers have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the option of including data derived from the in vitro and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clinical effectiveness tests included in &sect;333.470 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed monograph as additional labeling for products labeled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and marketed ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such additional information provide a standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison of the effectiveness of these OTC drug products, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is further proposing that only data on the antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity of these OTC drug products derived from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness tests included in &sect;333.470 of this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph be included in the labeling of these OTC drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the present time, claims of product effectiveness against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms other than those included in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an NDA containing information supporting the deviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the monograph in accord with &sect;330.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Based on the wound healing data from studies of test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wounds in laboratory animals that were discussed in the first aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (comment 37, 56 FR 33644 at 33662), the agency has reevaluated the labeling for iodine tincture as a patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation and is not including the warning ``Do not apply this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product with a tight bandage, as a burn may result.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. The agency has determined that data and reports have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptics has brought about overgrowth of gram-negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bacteria, particularly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, the previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed caution in &sect;333.99(a) concerning this overgrowth is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.D, comment 9.) The warnings proposed in &sect;333.99 (b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (c) of the previous tentative final monograph are not being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in this amendment because these warnings apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quaternary ammonium compounds which currently are not Category I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for health-care antiseptic uses. (See section I.J., comment 20.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The agency is not including the warning proposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Miscellaneous External Panel in &sect;333.98(c)(2) for products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing isopropyl alcohol, ``Use only in a well-ventilated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area; fumes may be toxic.'' As discussed in section II.B.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph 32 of the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33556), the agency invites comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for such a warning, including any reports of adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactions due to inhalation that have not yet been brought to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's attention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in a number of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor'' for ``physician'' in OTC drug monographs on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis that the word ``doctor'' is more commonly used and better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understood by consumers. Based on comments to these proposals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency has determined that final monographs and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable OTC drug regulations will give manufacturers the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of using the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended tentative final monograph proposes that option in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.450(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Based on the withdrawal of the majority of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on chlorhexidine gluconate as a health-care antiseptic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient data upon which to make a safety and effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination are no longer present in the rulemaking. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.F., comment 11.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. The agency has reviewed the data submitted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloroxylenol and is classifying chloroxylenol 0.24 percent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.75 percent as Category I for safety and Category III for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness for short-term use (patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation) and Category III for both safety and effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for long-term uses (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash and surgical hand scrub). (See section I.G., comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. In &sect;333.30(a) of the previous tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph, the agency included United States Pharmacopeia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (U.S.P.) specifications for iodine tincture and topical solution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying these Category I patient preoperative products as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iodine tincture U.S.P. and iodine topical solution U.S.P.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In the 1960's, at the height  of the Cold War, the United States and the USSR acknowledged  that for the sake of international security and their own  security it was essential to limit the number of members in the  "nuclear club." Today political rapprochement and the  establishment of alliance relations between the United States  and Russia offer broader opportunities for joint or parallel  actions.    However, it is clear that their bilateral efforts are as yet  inadequate to the degree of threat to international security  posed by nuclear proliferation. The three "underground" nuclear  states -- Israel, India and Pakistan -- are outside the bounds  of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty. According to  experts' estimates they already possess a certain number of  completed nuclear devices. The Republic of South Africa, which  joined the treaty in 1990, has stated that it produced six  nuclear warheads in the 1970's and 1980's. Of the CIS member  states with nuclear weapons deployed in their territory, Belarus  and Kazakhstan have signed the treaty. Ukraine remains a  non-member. Argentina and Brazil, which have a highly-developed  nuclear industry, are also not members.    Nor is the picture any more encouraging among the treaty's  signatories. In March of last year North Korea officially  announced its intention to withdraw from the treaty and thereby  free itself from its political obligations not to build nuclear  weapons.[.sup]1[/] Even though Pyongyang has not yet made  good on its threat, this could set a dangerous precedent. As  demonstrated by Iraq's large-scale nuclear weapons efforts as  revealed during the Gulf War, it cannot be assumed that some  states might not use their participation in the treaty as  camouflage for the accumulation of fissionable materials and  nuclear technology for military purposes. Experts list Iran,  Syria, Algeria, Libya, Taiwan and South Korea among such  countries. Programs for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful  purposes can significantly simplify and accelerate the road to  acquiring nuclear weapons. Despite the international system to  control the trading and exchange of nuclear materials and  technologies, "black" and "grey" markets continue to operate,  and there technologies and materials with direct or dual  applications can still be acquired. The collapse of the USSR  created a further risk of trade in contraband and a "brain  drain" to states striving to acquire nuclear weapons.    According to experts' projections, if the most decisive  measures are not taken there could be more than 10 members in  the "nuclear club" by the start of the 21st century, and the  expansion will take place among the developing states. That  prospect, coupled with an alarming situation regarding  proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction -- chemical  and biological weapons and missiles -- requires the United  States and Russia, as the two principal founders of the  non-proliferation system, to fundamentally reevaluate their  traditional approaches to prevention of nuclear weapons  transfers from one country to another, in order to achieve  greater effectiveness in ensuring international and their own  national security.    Beginning in the 1960's the policy of the United States and  the USSR in non-proliferation field was based on a  discriminatory principle: we (the nuclear powers) may have  nuclear weapons, while you (the non-nuclear powers) may not. At  the height of the Cold War, when the accumulation and  improvement of nuclear arsenals was the main concern of the two  opposing superpowers, one could hardly have expected any other  approach. The current system for monitoring of non-nuclear  states' activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) was established, a system accepted by them largely as a  result of pressure from the United States and the USSR. But even  in those years, aware of the vulnerability of their position,  Washington and Moscow stressed that the system was only intended  to "buy time" -- restraining nuclear proliferation until such  time as they could reach agreement among themselves on a way to  stop the nuclear arms race. This was also reflected in the text  of the treaty, in which non-nuclear states pledged not to build  nuclear weapons (Article II) and nuclear states pledged to  undertake disarmament (Article VI). However, during the period  of nuclear confrontation the latter frequently ignored their  pledges. Despite the fact that all the fundamental agreements  between the United States and the USSR -- SALT I and SALT II --  acknowledged the need to comply with obligations under Article  VI, they nevertheless actually led to further expansion and  improvement of nuclear weapons arsenals. The nuclear arms race  and the doctrine of nuclear weapons use created a nuclear  weapons cult, and the discriminatory double standard applied in  regard to non-proliferation spurred on efforts by Israel, India,  Pakistan and other countries to acquire them. The legacy of the  Cold War is that even today nuclear weapons remain a symbol of  military and political greatness and, consequently, a cherished  dream of countries counting on playing a leading role in their  region or in the international arena.    Would the appearance of nuclear arsenals of perhaps only a  few dozen warheads in a number of developing states really be  such a threat to American and Russian security interests,  considering that Washington and Moscow possess thousands of  nuclear weapons each? Just one or two nuclear strikes within  U.S. or Russian territory would be considered unacceptable  damage to their security. Such a threat would increase  significantly in the event of the further spread of nuclear  missile technology. In that event strategic stability could be  superseded by chaos, in which the threat of regional nuclear  conflicts, involvement of the current nuclear powers therein,  and anonymous nuclear missile attacks would increase many times  over. Already in the 1990's the focus of the nuclear threat has  shifted from the developed countries to the developing world. In  1990 threats to use nuclear and chemical weapons were issued  alternately by both Israel and Iraq, and during the Gulf War by  the United States and Iraq. If Baghdad had succeeded in building  a nuclear weapon before the start of the war, it apparently  would have used it, just as it used its ballistic missiles. That  same year the risk of nuclear conflict arose between India and  Pakistan as a result of the dispute over Kashmir. In 1993 the  threat of a similar conflict between North and South Korea was  considered serious.    A majority of experts reject the possibility that nuclear  weapons will be used by the current nuclear powers against each  other.[.sup]2[/] We are witnessing an unprecedented  devaluation of the military significance of various types of  nuclear weapons, and interest in Russian-American agreements to  control them is waning.    The era of nuclear competition between the superpowers is  over, but it could be followed by an era in which weapons of  mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, will proliferate.  In order to keep that from happening the United States and  Russia are demanding preemptive, coordinated joint efforts  without parallel in the past. Furthermore, new principles are to  form the basis of non-proliferation policy.    Firstly, the United States and Russia should acknowledge  jointly that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the  principal threat to their national security and international  security. It is precisely from that standpoint that their  political and military relations should be restructured, and the  sooner, the better. The spectrum of interaction should include  global monitoring of nuclear activities by "underground" nuclear  and "threshold" nuclear states -- exchange of intelligence  information between the CIA and the Foreign Intelligence  Service, development of preventive measures against the possible  use of nuclear weapons, and joint research in the field of  anti-missile defense.    Secondly, it has become clear that it will not be possible  for very long to try to combine the uncombinable -- retaining  the "nuclear club" while not admitting anyone else to it. In  order to prevent expansion of the "nuclear club" it will be  necessary, along with its other members, to begin the process of  disbanding it, taking far-reaching steps in that direction such  as complete bans on nuclear testing, the production of  fissionable materials for military purposes and use of nuclear  weapons. Only in that event can one hope that a  non-proliferation system based on an appropriate treaty be  effective and universal.    Thirdly, the United States and Russia should rely primarily  on political methods of preventing nuclear proliferation,  avoiding the use of force and not attempting to use existing  problems as an excuse to justify preparations for a new cold  war, this time between North and South. The role of nuclear  police is not only intolerable from a moral standpoint, it will  also inevitably have the directly contrary effect on  international and national security. That role could in various  non-nuclear states prompt a powerful desire to put an end to the  "military and political hegemony" of the current nuclear powers  through the accumulation of nuclear weapons by associations of  various states, for example the Islamic states. In view of the  rapid proliferation of missile equipment and technology in the  developing world, the territory of the United States and Russia  will sooner or later lie within the range of new nuclear  countries' missiles forces. It would be necessary to pay an  unacceptable price for taking part in the establishment of  nuclear order in the world, i.e. an increased threat to national  security. It is not likely that high-tech anti-missile defense  systems will provide a 100-percent guarantee of the nuclear  states' invulnerability against strikes by potential members of  the "nuclear club." The most promising route for the United  States and Russia to take is not strategic preparations for  expansion of the "nuclear club," but instead prevention of  nuclear proliferation.    Will the United States and Russia be able to quickly  restructure their military and political relations in such a way  as to fully subordinate them to the problems of confronting a  new challenge? The two countries' success in the  non-proliferation field will to a significant degree depend on  the answer to that question.    As the creators of a non-proliferation system, they will be  responsible for breathing new life into the treaty, ensuring  that it continues to function into the 21st century and  attempting to bring in those states that are not currently  signatories to it. The United States and Russia must state  unambiguously that they condemn the aspirations of any state to  acquire nuclear weapons, regardless of the nature of their  relations with them, and they must classify the use of such  weapons as a crime against humanity.    It appears important that the U.N. Security Council draft a  special declaration on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It  should express two key non-discriminatory principles of new  policy in this area. On the one hand, a statement by the five  permanent members of the Security Council declaring nuclear  weapons proliferation intolerable, and on the other a clear  expression of their willingness to disband the "nuclear club"  and eliminate nuclear weapons completely. The highest-level  Security Council session in January 1992 could be considered a  first step; following that session it was stated that the  proliferation of weapons of mass destructions posed a threat to  peace. It is logical to assume that the next step could be the  aforementioned declaration.    Support for the treaty by all permanent Security Council  members who possess veto power would allow one to assume that  the council is capable of playing a more decisive role in  affirming non-proliferation as a standard, violation of which  would invoke the U.N.'s use of adequate measures as provided for  by Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter. That possibility  stems from the final document of a Security Council session  which states that Security Council members will take appropriate  measures in the event of any violations reported to them by the  IAEA.    In 1993 the U.N. Security Council was unable to take such  measures (China was opposed) with regard to North Korea, which  had announced that it was withdrawing from the treaty, primarily  because the five permanent members had no coordinated position  on how to resolve nuclear non-proliferation issues. Drafting a  special declaration would not only facilitate greater U.N.  effectiveness, but would also ensure support by the world  community against any violator of the nuclear non-proliferation  regime. The United States and Russia should play the leading  role in achieving consensus among the nuclear states regarding  the need to adopt such a declaration.    The United States and Russia could add to the world  non-proliferation system additional barriers to preparations by  "threshold" states. That role could be played primarily by  complete bans on nuclear testing and the production of  fissionable materials for military purposes.    Sooner or later the time will come when there will be a need  for the "threshold" states to test their nuclear devices. A  complete test ban treaty could essentially be an insurmountable  obstacle to a political decision by any "threshold" country to  conduct such tests. Thus realization of a program to create  reliable nuclear forces could be halted at an early stage. The  presidents of the United States and Russia agreed at their  meeting in Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear  test ban should begin in the near future, and that their  governments will carry out appropriate consultations among  themselves.[.sup]3[/] Any delay in drafting a complete test  ban could be fraught with serious consequences: firstly, the  risk of a test being carried out by some "underground" or  "threshold" state for the purpose of declaring itself a nuclear  state and, secondly, complications in the 1995 conference on the  further fate of the treaty and its expiration date.    The problem of fissionable materials for military purposes  is  analogous. So long as they continue to be produced by the  nuclear states, one can hardly expect the candidates for the  "nuclear club" not to do the same. Many years of efforts to  convince Israel, India, Pakistan and other countries to place  their facilities for the production of enriched uranium and  weapons-grade plutonium under IAEA monitoring have proven  fruitless. As demonstrated by the examples of Iraq and North  Korea, even countries that are signatories to the treaty are  secretly stockpiling fissionable materials. It is clear that  only if the nuclear powers agree to the measure will it be  possible to expect similar steps by the "threshold" countries.  Surpluses of already manufactured materials in the United States  and Russia and the closure of a number of the facilities in  question have made easier realization of the idea of a global  halt to the production of fissionable materials for military  purposes and appeals to other nuclear and "threshold" states to  join in the initiative. A proposal put forward by President  Clinton in September 1993 at a session of the U.N. General  Assembly was a timely step in that direction.    The United States and Russia could also give joint  consideration to ways of expanding the IAEA's authority. IAEA  inspectors would take part as observers in monitoring of  compliance with treaties on the elimination of nuclear weapons.  After reprocessing, a portion of the fissionable materials could  be transferred to that international organization for use in the  implementation of peaceful nuclear programs. This could  graphically demonstrate that both sides are willing to beat  their swords into plowshares and convert their nuclear  production facilities in the spirit of President Eisenhower's  "Atoms for Peace" program. In that event the United States and  Russia would be called upon to facilitate a further increase in  the effectiveness of IAEA monitoring and respect for it in the  international arena.    In 1995 a conference of treaty signatories will be held to  decide whether the treaty should remain in force indefinitely or  only for a specific period of time. The treaty text leaves no  other choice: the conference does not have the right to decide  to abrogate the agreement. Nevertheless, it is possible that  participants might extend the treaty for a short period of time,  upon expiration of which it would be considered invalid. It is  also possible that some individual participants might exercise  their right to withdraw from the treaty as granted to them by  Article X. In 1995 an effort might be made to make extension of  the treaty contingent upon the nuclear powers' performance of  their disarmament obligations (Article VI), specifically by  banning nuclear testing.    At all four conferences held to verify the workings of the  treaty (1975, 1980, 1985 and 1990) the non-nuclear states have  regularly criticized the nuclear powers for failing to perform  their obligations, and in particular for continuing to conduct  tests. The SALT I and SALT II treaties are definitely capable of  reducing tension over this issue in 1995, but they will hardly  be enough to achieve the main goal: extending the treaty  indefinitely. It is of fundamental importance that the text of a  complete nuclear test ban treaty be drafted by the time the  conference opens in 1995. The same end could also be served by  the aforementioned declaration by the nuclear states that are  the five permanent Security Council members, regarding their  willingness to see nuclear disarmament through to the end. There  is no need to set strict time limits on elimination of nuclear  weapons; the most important thing is to express an official  interest in the complete and guaranteed liberation of the world  from nuclear weapons.    Another area in which the treaty can be reinforced is  expansion of the number of signatories. The next group of new  members should come from the independent states that have  emerged in place of the former USSR and Yugoslavia. Lithuania,  Latvia, Estonia, Belarus and Uzbekistan have already signed the  treaty. The United States and Russia could have some influence  on other states as well in order to ensure that they sign the  treaty by the start of the 1995 conference.    In the course of efforts to provide the new states'  governments with an incentive, the United States could let it be  known that it is willing to help them resolve their economic  difficulties if they will sign the treaty. For its part, Russia  could on similar terms promise assistance with the development  of peaceful atomic industry, in particular nuclear power plant  construction.    By the time of the 1995 conference it would also be possible  to think about ways of rewarding developing countries that have  nuclear power development programs for signing the treaty and  abiding by the non-proliferation regime. The idea of providing  them at a favorable price the enriched uranium obtained through  dismantling of nuclear warheads seems attractive.    The most significant difficulties face the United States and  Russia in their efforts to turn back the clock on nuclear  proliferation in South Asia -- the "race" between India and  Pakistan -- and in the Near East, i.e. in Israel, and to prevent  the building of nuclear weapons by North Korea and eliminate  threat that nuclear weapons will be retained by Ukraine and  other CIS members.    The example of South Africa, which stated in March 1993 that  it had dismantled all its previously manufactured nuclear bombs,  gives reason to hope that the same path might also be taken by  the "underground" nuclear states -- India, Pakistan and Israel.  The most important thing today is to restrain those states from  any attempts to officially declare themselves nuclear states  prior to the start of the 1995 conference.    India's position on non-proliferation issues is ambiguous  and  not fully defined. On the one hand, it was one of the first  countries in the world to support the idea of non-proliferation.  New Delhi regularly expresses its support for complete bans on  nuclear testing and the use of nuclear weapons and for complete  elimination of all nuclear potential and creation of a nuclear  weapons-free world. On the other hand, India was the first  developing country to label the treaty discriminatory, saying it  permanently divided the countries of the world into nuclear and  non-nuclear, as well as the first developing country, in 1974,  to test a nuclear device, throwing down an open challenge to the  non-proliferation system. According to experts' estimates it may  have approximately 100 nuclear devices. India takes a negative  position on the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in South  Asia and toward bilateral agreements with Pakistan to ban  nuclear weapons testing and nuclear weapons proliferation in the  region. If nuclear weapons proliferation continues, Indian  "hawks" might gain the upper hand and the country would set out  irreversibly on the path to producing and deploying nuclear  weapons.    However, after the end of the Cold War it became obvious  that  the world was moving in a different direction: the United States  and Russia concluded far-reaching agreements on reducing their  nuclear arsenals; South Africa signed the treaty, and Argentina  and Brazil, though not parties to the treaty, announced their  renunciation of military nuclear programs. India's relations  with nuclear China improved markedly. Therefore the positions of  those in India who support a wait-and-see course have been  significantly strengthened. The only thing that could tip the  scales in favor of open possession of nuclear weapons would be  intensification of nuclear preparations by Pakistan.    According to experts' estimates, Pakistan probably has  approximately 10-15 nuclear devices. However, they believe that  Pakistan's military nuclear program was frozen in 1990, when the  United States cut off military aid in response to the  acceleration of that program and stated that the entire complex  of American-Pakistani economic and political relations would be  called into question if the program were carried out. U.S.  pressure produced results (albeit temporary ones) -- it became  possible to exert diplomatic influence on the positions of New  Delhi and Islamabad. The role of the United States and Russia in  this region is divided: the United States restrains Pakistan,  and Russia restrains India.    Thus far India has taken a negative stance on convening a  five-state conference (India, Pakistan, the PRC, Russia and the  United States) on security and nuclear non-proliferation issues  in South Asia. However, its approach will change in any event if  the United States and Russia officially announce their  willingness to completely eliminate nuclear arsenals, if a  corresponding U.N. Security Council declaration is adopted and,  finally, if multilateral accords banning the testing or use of  nuclear weapons are achieved. Even today the United States and  Russia could begin discussing with India the latter's idea of  creating a nuclear-free world, as well as the role that it would  play in restraining nuclear proliferation among developing and  non-aligned states.    As in the case of India and Pakistan, there is little  likelihood that Israel will join the treaty prior to the 1995  conference. Its signing of the treaty could be the final act in  a series of events that will lead to the creation of an  effectively monitored nuclear-free zone in the Near East. That  has long been proclaimed as a goal by the Arab countries, Iran  and Israel, and is supported by the United States and Russia.  Creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons is a lengthy process  requiring the development of a monitoring system encompassing  not only nuclear weapons, but also missile, chemical and  biological weapons. Furthermore, a nuclear-free zone can be just  one means of resolving the political issues that are the basis  of military tension in the Near East. However, neither does that  mean that we should wait for a general resolution of the Near  East situation and only then begin creating such a zone. Since  Iraq's nuclear capability was destroyed Israel has essentially  had no competitors capable of challenging its nuclear monopoly  in the region. According to experts' estimates, it has 150-200  nuclear devices. Yet it is quite obvious that the Arab countries  and Iran are not likely to let Tel Aviv retain that monopoly  forever. Israel is also very concerned by the fact that some  Arab countries are stockpiling chemical weapons and acquiring  missile technology as a counterweight to its nuclear potential.  All this could prompt Israel to take a more positive and  constructive attitude toward plans to create a zone in the Near  East free of weapons of mass destruction, plans under which Tel  Aviv would attempt to a certain extent to exchange its nuclear  potential for chemical, biological and missile disarmament in  the Arab countries.    Since the end of the Cold War and the reestablishment of  diplomatic relations with Russia the nuclear threat to Israel  has been virtually non-existent. Alliance relations with the  United States and de facto guarantees of the  foundations of its security deprive continuation of a military  nuclear program of all motivation. It was in this situation that  the United States and Russia became able to influence Israel to  stop the further implementation of that program and freeze its  nuclear preparations.    A difficult situation exists on the Korean Peninsula. If the  Korean People's Democratic Republic were to acquire nuclear  weapons this could, according to expert consensus, have the most  dramatic effects on the non-proliferation system. In that case  South Korea would be forced to reexamine its approach to nuclear  weapons and make the decision to build them. One after the  other, many countries in Asia, particularly Japan and Taiwan,  could be drawn into a nuclear arms race. Therefore the stakes in  whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons are very high,  requiring the United States and Russia, as the founders of the  non-proliferation system, to take immediate yet well-reasoned  measures.    The North Korean threat caught everyone off guard. Despite  the fact that American and Russian experts have repeatedly  warned that such a step was possible[.sup]4[/], the nuclear  powers proved unprepared for this turn of events, once again  demonstrating the lack of high-priority attention to nuclear  non-proliferation issues. As pointed out previously, efforts to  take action through the U.N. Security Council have been  fruitless, but that may be for the best. In the opposite case,  if economic and political sanctions were taken against North  Korea, the treaty itself would be compromised, because it  provides for voluntary participation and the right to withdraw  from the treaty. A treaty is not a prison whose escapees must be  forcibly returned to their place of detention and punished.    The United States and Russia were forced to resort to the  methods of "quiet diplomacy," but thereupon discovered that they  had virtually no political leverage, or else that it was very  limited. That is especially true of Russia. After abrogating its  treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with North Korea,  almost completely shutting off shipments of raw materials and  weapons and undertaking a political reorientation toward South  Korea, Russia lost its main sources of influence on North Korea.  As a result, if there were anyone else that could influence  North Korea, then that would mainly be its ally China. The  United States and Russia have been forced to work through  Beijing, but at this point it is difficult to say how successful  that influence will be.    The temptation is great to resolve the issue by force. But  until the world community and the U.N. Security Council give the  go-ahead for any such actions, they would be regarded as  aggressive acts, and that could harm the non-proliferation  system. At the present stage, U.S. and Russian interaction  should have the goal of preventing North Korea from officially  declaring itself a nuclear state.    The interests of the United States and Russia coincide on  their approach to the hotbed of nuclear proliferation that has  emerged in place of the former USSR. Both powers understand that  if it is not extinguished and if in addition to a nuclear Russia  there also emerged other nuclear states -- for example, Ukraine  -- that could spur on the spread of nuclear weapons to other  regions and undermine the world's policy of restraining the  ambitions of "threshold" countries. For Russia that goal is of  vital importance, as its security interests require that it be  surrounded by nuclear-free states.    By 1994 there were political indicators permitting one to  hope that by the start of the 21st century only Russia will  still be a nuclear power. These were: firstly, the Alma-Ata and  Minsk (1991) accords regulating nuclear relations in the CIS;  secondly, Russia's assumption of the USSR's seat in the U.N.  Security Council; thirdly, pledges by Ukraine, Belarus and  Kazakhstan to become nuclear-free states under the Lisbon  Protocol (May 1992) to the SALT I Treaty; fourthly, the SALT II  Treaty, which provides for elimination of a majority of the  missiles deployed in the republics' territory; fifthly, the  constitutional obligations of Ukraine and Belarus to become  nuclear-free states; and, sixthly, the categorical  unacceptability to the industrially developed countries of the  world of other republics besides Russia possessing nuclear  weapons. The successful completion in mid-1992 of the withdrawal  of tactical nuclear weapons from the other republics to Russia,  ratification of the SALT I Treaty by Belarus, Ukraine (though  with some caveats) and Kazakhstan, and Belarus' signing of the  non-proliferation treaty indicate that the accords can be  implemented within the scheduled time frame.    However, it would be a serious political mistake to think  that the issue is settled. The process of regulating mutual  nuclear relations could be interrupted by a possible collapse of  the CIS, social upheavals in the republics, assumption of power  by extremely nationalistic forces, and increasing economic and  political instability in Russia itself. In the event of the  worst-case scenario -- social upheavals and civil war -- control  over nuclear proliferation and weapons would be lost completely.    In this situation, assessment of the approaches taken to  this  issue by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan is important. Ukraine's  approach to nuclear weapons is taking shape under the influence  of two factors: on the one hand, the need to abide by its  official obligations to sign the treaty and become a de  jure nuclear-free state following the withdrawal of  strategic nuclear forces to Russian territory and, on the other,  efforts to take advantage of its temporary position as a  de facto nuclear state to increase its political  prestige in the world arena and strengthen its security relative  to a nuclear Russia during a period of heated debate over the  Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet.    Whereas the former factor makes it possible to put forward  various anti-nuclear initiatives regarding, for example, the  establishment of joint control with Russia over destruction of  nuclear devices withdrawn from Ukrainian territory,  transformation of the Black Sea into a nuclear-free zone,  Russian suspension of further nuclear testing, etc., the latter  factor means a desire to keep nuclear weapons in its territory  as long as possible, to achieve greater control over those  weapons, to participate directly in subsequent negotiations with  the United States regarding their elimination, etc. It should be  noted that in the Ukrainian parliament increasing criticism is  being levelled at the president (particularly by deputies from  Rukh) as political tensions with Russia increase, accusing him  of giving up nuclear weapons without receiving any security  guarantees in return. Strong pressure on the president is also  coming from the rapidly emerging military-industrial complex,  which, as in Russia, cannot imagine life without missiles and  nuclear weapons.    However, one should not completely ignore the extreme  scenario, in which rapidly developing nationalist sentiments  could prompt a decision to keep nuclear forces. The idea of  disarming this nuclear capability and taking a series of  measures as a result of which it will become unusable, as put  forward by the Clinton administration, seems extremely  important. It is equally important for Ukraine to become an  official signatory to the non-proliferation treaty as soon as  possible, without waiting for the withdrawal of strategic  systems from its territory. It does not matter who is capable of  more successfully solving this problem, whether the United  States or Russia. The most important thing is that it be solved.    Belarus was the first country to turn its nuclear weapons  over to Russia and sign the treaty. This example is worthy of  imitation and should be financially rewarded by  Russia and the United States.    Kazakhstan is located in a fundamentally different  geopolitical environment than Ukraine or Belarus. Its proximity  to nuclear China and the "threshold" states India and Pakistan  has prompted serious concerns over guarantees of its security in  the event that its nuclear weapons are withdrawn. Vacillation on  the issue of what sort of state it should be -- nuclear or  non-nuclear -- has largely been eliminated by Russia's pledge to  maintain its nuclear umbrella over Kazakhstan, as well as by  strong pressure from the United States and other Western states.  It appears that Kazakhstan has been able to reap the maximum  dividends from this situation by ensuring its nuclear defense  primarily at Russia's expense. In negotiations over elimination  of nuclear arsenals Kazakhstan will most likely resist complete  withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory and insist that  Russia continue to bear the burden of the military obligations  involved in ensuring its security.    Washington's approach to relations with the other former  republics of the USSR is based on the existing nuclear  non-proliferation system. The United States, the European states  and Japan regularly let it be known that those CIS members  cannot expect to develop economic relations with them if they do  not sign the treaty and do not abide by disarmament agreements.  On the horizon looms the threat of a "brain drain" and  uncontrolled trade in nuclear materials and technologies with  Third World countries wanting to build a nuclear weapon.    By assuming the role of "honest broker" in the dispute  between Russia and the former republics, Washington has run into  new problems. On the one hand, everything possible must be done  to put an end to countries' use of nuclear weapons as a "trump  card" in negotiations without inciting their political ambitions  as de facto nuclear states. On the other hand, it is  also essential that Russia be restrained from using force to  resolve nuclear non-proliferation issues.    The agreement between Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and  Belarus  concerning joint control of strategic systems deployed in those  republics' territory was received without any particular anxiety  in view of the fact that it meant a reduced likelihood that any  one republic might decide to use those weapons on its own; the  republics were granted a veto right, not the right to use the  systems. The "two-key" system used with American nuclear weapons  deployed with the United States' NATO allies in Western Europe  functioned quite satisfactorily during the Cold War and there  was never any danger that the allies might use a nuclear weapon  without American consent. CIS countries' participation in  Russian-American talks on reduction of strategic arms systems  could be fraught with additional difficulties, but only if they  began resisting the complete withdrawal of those systems from  their territory. In view of the fact that Ukraine and Belarus  have proclaimed their intention of becoming nuclear-free states,  that course of behavior would at first glance seem unlikely. It  is more likely that the republics would be something of allies  for the United States in its negotiations with Russia, whose  representatives are increasingly inclined to be guided in their  approach by old ideas (parity or equal security, strategic  stability, etc.), failing to realize that the republics never  shared such concepts and strove to get out from under nuclear  tutelage.    However, the United States realizes the danger involved in  playing off disputes between the republics, and is extremely  interested in ensuring that political differences do not disrupt  the delicate process of integrating the newly independent states  into the world nuclear non-proliferation system. This is due to  the need to set aside nuclear non-proliferation issues as a  separate, independent area of relations with the CIS members. As  indicated by the SALT II Treaty, the optimum alternative is for  strategic weapons to be next after withdrawal of tactical  weapons from the republics' territory, coupled with the weapons'  subsequent destruction within the framework of agreements with  Russia.    The Clinton administration has shown particular concern over  Ukraine's position, which is to delay the process of joining the  non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Kiev's demands  for security guarantees and financial compensation for getting  rid of its nuclear weapons are perceived in Washington as an  excuse to retain those weapons. All these things dictate a  stricter approach to Ukraine on nuclear issues. The Clinton  administration has let it be clearly known that the main  condition for economic aid to Kiev is its participation in the  Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty.    However, something else is obvious as well: political  pressure by Russia on the issue of nuclear relations with  Ukraine could produce diametrically opposed results. In this  context Washington's intermediary role is all the more  well-defined. The United States, the European countries and  Japan will bear most of the responsibility for integrating  Ukraine into the worldwide non-proliferation system. For its  part, Russia could make the process easier by officially  declaring that it does not intend to maintain its nuclear status  and that it is willing, together with the other nuclear states,  to see disarmament through to the end.    Interaction between the United States and Russia as the two  leading nuclear powers remains the foundation of the global  nuclear non-proliferation regime. Its effectiveness will largely  depend on how quickly and radically the United States and Russia  restructure their military and political relations and assign  absolute foreign policy priority to the task of preventing the  further proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States and  Russia are the ones to begin the process of creating a system of  international security under which possession of nuclear weapons  by any state would be considered illegal under international law  and would be regarded as a threat to peace. Only such actions as  that can provide a fitting response to the challenge presented  by nuclear proliferation to the national security interests of  the United States and Russia following the end of the Cold War.

China carried out its latest nuclear test in October  1993,  thus calling into question the continuation of an almost  two-year moratorium by the United States, Russia, England and  France. Despite this action and pressure from the American and  Russian military-industrial complexes, the United States and  Russia are being urged to achieve a complete nuclear test ban  treaty.    4.

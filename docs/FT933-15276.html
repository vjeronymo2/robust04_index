			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Observer: Cutting no ice The punctilious Swiss look to have dealt a blow to the grand old advertising dodge of the Unique Selling Point. The whole point about a USP, of course, is that the advertised feature itself is not unique - indeed it may well be shared by every competing product on the market. All that's unique is that your company is the first to highlight the standard feature and shout about it. But better beware pinning your hopes on the dodge in Switzerland, as Grand Metropolitan's trendy American ice-cream vendor, Haagen-Dazs, has found in trying to follow McDonald's into the fastidious indigenous food market. It took the hamburger chain a two-year struggle with the local authorities to break into the posh resort of Zermatt. And the Swiss are now giving no less icy a reception to Haagen-Dazs, with particular emphasis on its tactic of marketing its products on the claim that they contain no preservatives. While that might do everywhere else, Swiss health officials say, it doesn't do in the country of perfection. There everyone who makes ice cream is obliged to keep it free of preservatives and the interloper may not make mention of doing likewise in either advertising or packaging. Undaunted, the company has promised to remove the offending claim from its packaging. As for advertising, it claims to have no plans to recycle the erotic campaigns which went down so well in Britain. Sensible decision. If it had done so, it would undoubtedly have run foul of some Swiss official or other.</p>

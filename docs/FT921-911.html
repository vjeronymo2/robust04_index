			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Observer: Writer's cramp Yet another landmark in the UK recession. In the coming two days, 108 bankers accompanied by 54 lawyers will line up at the offices of Theodore Goddard, the solicitors, to append their signatures to documents finalising the long-awaited refinancing of Brent Walker. It will be the biggest corporate refinancing in UK history, involving Pounds 1.6bn of borrowings. It also could well be the longest and most turbulent attempt to rescue a company ever known. Attempts to reconstruct its balance sheet began in November 1990 and the more memorable events since then have included a night of the long knives in the boardroom, a dawn raid by the Serious Fraud Office, a takeover attempt by Lonrho and endless bitter rows between the current board and the company's flamboyant founder, George Walker. Even the process of getting the deal signed is a logistical nightmare. Brent Walker's long-suffering finance director, John Leach, will have to countersign every one of the bankers' documents on behalf of the company's 50 subsidiaries. As a nimble finance director, he calculates quick-as-a-flash that he will be signing 2,500 times. If, once he has done it, he is suffering from nothing worse than an aching hand, he will be relieved. Since joining Brent Walker, he has acquired a neurotic fear of unexpected disasters. Who can blame him?</p>

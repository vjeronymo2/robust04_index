			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Georgiy Shelenkov]    [Excerpts] Cairo, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev has ended his visit to Egypt [passage  omitted]    Before leaving Cairo A. Kozyrev gave an exclusive interview  to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The agreement signed yesterday  [between Israel and the PLO]," he said, "is a good start for the  next stage of Middle East settlement. Equally strenuous work is  ahead, that is, implementation of the signed document, which  will raise many issues, for a new authority means new problems.  But we will assist in this, too.    "We stressed very clearly our vital interest in this region  which is close to us. Russia therefore will participate in the  peace process in the future, too. We are already thinking about  the next steps in further developing the Palestinian-Israeli  settlement and in other areas. We will pay special attention to  the Syrian aspect.    "Russia intends to develop in every possible way its  bilateral relations with all the countries in the region, first  of all with Egypt. Boris Yeltsin's message was received by  President Mubarak warmly and with understanding. Now, without  delay, we will start preparing for his forthcoming official  visit to Moscow.    "Also, we will develop relations with Israel. Yesterday  evening, after the signing, I had a meeting with [Israeli Prime  Minister] Rabin which was geared toward strengthening our  contacts established during the Israeli premier's recent visit  to Moscow."</p>

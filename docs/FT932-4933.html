			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Improved seating for soccer fans JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION has added to its tally of stand construction work with projects for Tottenham Hotspur and Watford Football Club together worth Pounds 5m. This follows Mowlem's similar work with the north stand at Twickenham for the Rugby Football Union, completed in 1990; Twickenham east stand, which is due for completion by the start of the next season; and stands for Notts County Football Club and the Epsom racecourse grandstand. The contract for Watford Football Club valued at Pounds 3m, is to design and construct a 9,500 seater stand at the Vicarage Road end of the ground and an extension to the lower terrace of the Rous stand. The new stand will have a structural steel frame with a 'goal post truss' supporting the roof and extending the full 85m of the stand. Terrace units will be pre-cast concrete. The extension to the Rous stand will also be precast concrete and facilities will include an executive club lounge. Work has started for completion in 16 weeks. The second contract, worth Pounds 2m, has been awarded by Tottenham Hotspur for the redevelopment of the north stand at White Hart Lane. The contract comprises the removal of the roof and the erection of a cantilevered roof comprising 400 tons of structural steelwork. A key element of this will be the main roof truss. This will span the entire length of the stand, which will be fabricated at ground level and winched into position. At the same time, the lower terrace will be reprofiled to provide seats for 2,500 spectators. Work has started for completion prior to the start of the new season in August.</p>

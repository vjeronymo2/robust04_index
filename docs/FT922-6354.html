			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Hanging on to the family silver - In A Nutshell Family businesses are not giving up the fight for further improvements on inheritance tax. The Stoy Centre for Family Business has been lobbying Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to go beyond the changes made in his 1992 Budget. These allowed 100 per cent inheritance tax relief but only on shareholdings of over 25 per cent of the equity share capital. The SCFB has told Lamont that while this may help newly-established family businesses, it will not help older firms, where individual shareholdings are likely to fall below the threshold. These shareholders will be entitled to only 50 per cent rather than 100 per cent relief. SCFB reckons this discriminates against the businesses that the Chancellor was trying to help. The SCFB has suggested that if an individual owns shares in a family company in which his or her family owns more than 50 per cent, then the full relief should be applied.</p>

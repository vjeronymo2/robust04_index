			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia: Edouard Balladur has announced the partial  withdrawal of the peacekeeping troops from former Yugoslavia.  The withdrawal from Bihac will take place in six months. As  for the destination of this contingent, France will decide on  what action to take, depending on the progress of the peace  process. Edouard Balladur was speaking in the National Assembly:    [Begin Balladur recording] Things are clear, ladies and  gentlemen, we are at the service of the United Nations and at  the service of a policy aimed at restoring peace. If this  restoration of peace were to prove impossible, if the other  powers were not working toward this end, then, as I said last  week, we should be forced to ask ourselves questions about the  meaning and duration of our action. We do not have to blush;  quite the contrary, we can be proud of what we have done, and of  what we are continuing to do. We have the largest number of  soldiers -- by a long way -- at the service of peace on the  territory of former Yugoslavia. We are quite prepared to  continue with our efforts, on condition that every party is  willing to make its own contribution. [end recording]</p>

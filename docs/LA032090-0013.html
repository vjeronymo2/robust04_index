			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: THE POUNDS CAN CREEP UP DURING 'DANGER YEARS'  </P> <P> Are there age-related "danger zones" for weight gain during adulthood?  </P> <P> Yes, suggests a new study that tracked 10,000 adults, ages 25-74, for a decade  and found weight gain is more likely at certain ages than others.  </P> <P> First, the bad news:  </P> <P> * Major weight gain -- defined in this study as 30 pounds -- occurred most  often in the 25-to- 34-year-old age group.  </P> <P> * But a subset of test subjects, people who began the study at a normal weight  and had a major weight gain, were most likely to put on the pounds between the  ages of 35 to 44.  </P> <P> * Women were twice as likely as men to have a major weight gain.  </P> <P> David F. Williamson, an epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta who led the study, believes that so-called "middle-age  spread" may begin well before middle age. "Becoming fat and being fat are two  different phenomena, although people tend to focus on the aftermath," he said.  </P> <P> But there's some good news from the study, published in this month's Archives  of Internal Medicine.  </P> <P> * About 40% of the men and 35% of the women maintained their weight within  about 6.5 pounds, Williamson said. Older people didn't tend to gain weight  during the study. Less than 1% of subjects ages 65-74 had major weight gains,  although Williamson speculates some were ill or had poor appetites for other  reasons.  </P> <P> * Weight gain isn't inevitable with age, Williamson believes. "Or at least not  to the magnitude we've seen." Keeping off excess pounds requires only prudent  eating and exercise, Williamson said. He suggests nothing more than 45 minutes  of "purposeful" walking every day.  </P> <P> Other weight control experts say the findings in the federal study mirror their  own clinical findings about weight gain. "Our clients are primarily females,  between 25 and 54," said Margaret Kohlberg, a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers'  International.  </P> <P> Women sometimes develop weight problems after their first pregnancy, said  Annette Natow, a New York dietitian and weight loss expert who wrote "The Fat  Attack Plan" (Pocket Books, 1990), a how-to book on trimming fat from the diet.  "Men gain weight when they assume full-time work."  </P> <P> "Men gain weight due to job stress and 'abuse of lifestyle' behaviors like  drinking and eating rich desserts," added Dr. David Heber, director of the  University Obesity Center at the UCLA School of Medicine. "For women, hormonal  changes are a major cause of weight gain."  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT COUNTERPOINT  </P> <P> The At-Home Pap Test: Is It a Good Option?  </P> <P> Women should undergo a Pap test every one or two years to help detect cervical  cancer in its early stages, most doctors agree. But many women don't.  </P> <P> The developers of an at-home Pap test say their product, not yet approved by  the Food and Drug Administration, may make it easier and less embarrassing for  women to have the test. To complete the home test, women use a douche-like  device to collect vaginal fluid and then mail a sample to a laboratory for  analysis.  </P> <P> Bill Truglio, vice president of Medtech Diagnostics, the Bohemia, N.Y., firm  developing the MY-PAP, says comparisons of the home test with the traditional  Pap test have shown the two methods are almost equally accurate.  </P> <P> But there's opposition to the home test, with some doctors saying Pap tests are  best left in the hands of health-care professionals. Even experienced doctors  and lab workers can find Pap tests difficult to perform and interpret, they  point out.  </P> <P> Here are two views:  </P> <P> * Dr. J. S. Wilkenfeld, pathologist, Spring Branch Memorial Hospital, Houston;  spokesman, College of American Pathologists.  </P> <P>  "Only trained health-care professionals should do a Pap smear. It takes a lot  of experience (to collect the specimen and to interpet it). To get a good  specimen, you must get cells from the cervix, for instance. If an inexperienced  person does the Pap, it's a potluck type of test.  </P> <P> "And the Pap is not the only reason for seeing the doctor. The pelvic  examination by the physician, which accompanies the Pap, is part of a valuable,  comprehensive exam."  </P> <P>  * Dr. Fred Given, gynecologic oncologist, Norfolk; professor of obstetrics and  gynecology, Eastern Virginia Medical School.  </P> <P>  "We have compared several hundred office Pap tests with the home Pap test. So  far, we have found the home test just about as accurate as the office test.  </P> <P> "The home test is not a substitute for a pelvic examination. But it's a good  screening tool for women who won't or don't get an office Pap test. Some women  say they're just too busy to go in for a Pap. This test will also be a godsend  in areas where medical care is not easily attainable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHOPTALK  </P> <P> Video Rescues Gym Neophytes  </P> <P> Newcomers at a health club can feel as intimidated as a 98-pound weakling on a  beach full of bullies. They may feel out of shape, not to mention confused  about how to operate weight-training machines.  </P> <P> To the rescue comes Beginner's Break, a 35-minute video that gives neophytes a  head start in the privacy of their own home.  </P> <P> "The tape takes you, beginning to end, through what you will experience in a  gym," said a spokeswoman for Health for Life, the distributor of the $29.95  tape. (Information: (800) 523-9983). "It describes how to use most  weight-training machines, for instance, and what muscle groups each machine  works," she said. "It's not going to take the place of a personal trainer, but  it will reduce intimidation for first-time gym-goers."  </P> <P> "The concept sounds good," said Mike Trexler, associate director of continuing  education for the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. He has two other  tips for new fitness buffs:  </P> <P> "Go to a reputable fitness center with trainers certified by the Institute or  the American College of Sports Medicine. Ask a trainer to take you through the  machines."  </P></p>

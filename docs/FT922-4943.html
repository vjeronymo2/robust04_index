			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Personal View: In a muddle on training Education and training for 16- to 18-year-olds is in a mess. Everybody is agreed - the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress and government included - that all young people should continue formal learning until at least 18, but that remains a remote target. A recently published briefing for the National Commission on Education by Mr David Raffe shows that in 1990 only 37 per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds in the UK were in full-time education. Of the remaining 63 per cent only 15 per cent were in Youth Training and the rest - almost half - were in an 'others' category, with only a minority receiving any part-time education. We lag badly behind other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Raffe says that the UK had the lowest full-time participation rate among 16- to 18-year-olds in 1986: its rate was then 33 per cent, half the average for the other 12 OECD countries. If part-time provision is included, our rate at 64 per cent was much closer to the average for the other 12 of 75 per cent; but given the uncertain quality of our part-time provision, we can take little comfort from that. Our poor performance is sometimes held to show that we have a cultural block that prevents us doing better, or that employers, who are supposed to be responsible for training, are incurably short-sighted. In fact our real ailment seems to be muddle-headedness. We do not make it easy for people to behave sensibly. Clear our heads a bit, and things could improve. Four areas need attention: Responsibility. There is a conflict between the interests of employers, which are bound to be fairly short-term, and the needs of young people, which stretch more than 40 years ahead. It is reasonable to expect employers to provide training related to the job; but further education is also needed, and should be provided by colleges or other providers at public expense - as in full-time education. Costs. Making it clear that it is not the employer's responsibility to provide further education makes it easier to return to the financial basis of all successful apprentice systems: that the net cost to an employer of each apprentice is broadly neutral. The cost of pay plus the cost of training is balanced by the value of the apprentice's output. If you achieve that, there need be no limit to employers' willingness to provide training places. Incentives. Why should young people be prepared to train for qualifications if employers do not show that they value them? Pay structures must be overhauled, first to reduce the pay of trainees in recognition of the costs that employers incur in training them, of their absence one day a week or more at college and of their comparatively low output, and second to increase the pay of employees who have acquired relevant qualifications. Traineeships. Experience shows that there need to be formal 'traineeships' signed by employer and trainee (and perhaps a parent); they must be seen to lead to recognised qualifications, now made possible by the NVQs introduced by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications; and there must be proper inspection to establish and maintain standards. Get these things right and the upshot should be traineeships of good quality for all 16- and 17-year-olds entering the labour market. Young people will get a lasting benefit; employers should be delighted, so too should the trade unions. And the government should be pleased because youth unemployment will dwindle - a result achieved at much less expense to the taxpayer than the current arrangements, which do not work. But there are a couple of snags. One is that employers often attract 16- and 17-year-olds into jobs with no training but quite high pay. That is one reason that the UK's staying-on rate in full-time education is so low. We probably need legislation obliging any employer who wants to employ a 16- or 17-year-old in a regular full-time job to provide him or her with a traineeship. The other snag is that the pay of most young people in work is based on the presumption that they are fully productive workers - not surprisingly, since that has been the reality in most cases - and not trainees. For a trainee, the example of German apprentices suggests that a starting at 30 per cent of the adult rate would be about right. But it would not be easy for any individual employer to move to that level of pay on his own initiative. Either there needs to be a concerted movement by leading employers or, if that proves impossible to arrange, legislation needs to step in here too, providing for a statutory body to determine the wages of young people in traineeships. Negotiating these snags may seem tricky, even formidable, but the stakes are high. Do nothing and we are set for continuing failure, whereas the prize for success is immensely valuable.

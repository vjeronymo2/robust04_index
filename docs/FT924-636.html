			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Observer: Beyond our Ken Who would have thought it? The Sun is inviting its readers to write and complain. Not normally known for its contribution to raising readers' standards of literacy, the tabloid is cockily enjoining its faithful followers to, well, pen a letter of complaint about the content of Britain's top selling daily newspaper. Ken Donlan, former Sun managing editor and Ombudsman these past four years, dealt with two big cases and heavily censured the paper, the tabloid informs us yesterday in an article flagged 'Save our Ombudsman'. But since then - shock, horror, probe  - nothing. So wake up readers. Save his job by telling him 'how you, personally, have suffered from intrusion or inaccurate reporting'. Sounds as if the Sun's editorial powers-that-be are trying to come up with an unusual foil for those politicians currently making nasty noises about anything from privacy to accuracy to a right of reply.</p>

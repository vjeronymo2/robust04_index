			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Gas mask slips What is British Gas up to? In its public statements, the company says it wants the government to press ahead with legislation this autumn to open up the domestic gas market to competition. But at the same time, Gas is planning to 'rebalance' its prices to bring them in line with costs - a phrase that conjures up the idea of higher gas bills for little old ladies. The government is already dithering about whether to abolish Gas's domestic monopoly. Hints about higher bills could be all that is needed to scupper legislation. The Machiavellian interpretation is that this is precisely what Gas is after. If so, it is being foolish. So long as Gas retains its monopoly, it will face tight regulation. The company may feel the current regulatory burden is suffocating, but matters could get worse under a Labour government. Gas should, by contrast, embrace competition and use its advent as a spur to change the organisation's still rather moribund culture. Since Gas is gradually getting this message, a Machiavellian interpretation of its latest moves seems unlikely. The more plausible explanation is that the company has yet to craft a new and internally-coherent public image. This is not to suggest that Gas has nothing to fear from the abolition of its monopoly. Although its regulator has promised to create a level playing-field, until the rules are set in stone there remains the possibility that rivals could 'cherry-pick' its most attractive customers. But the best way to protect itself from such an eventuality would be to fight for fair competition rather than to scare the politicians.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: ORLANDO PAMPHLET IS SLIM ON IDEAS  </P> <P> The city of Orlando dropped its off-season special rates for seniors some time  ago and instead offers a free pamphlet listing senior discounts and bargains.  </P> <P> Published by the Orlando/Orange County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, the  pamphlet is called "Orlando -- Golden Magic Years."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the eight-page publication is woefully slim in size and scope on  money-saving tips for mature travelers heading for one of the world's most  popular tourist destinations.  </P> <P> For example, there are only 14 accommodations listed despite the hundreds of  hotels, motels, inns and other accommodations in the area.  </P> <P> The pamphlet does list a few condominium bargains that readers might not find  in the Mobil or AAA guides, both of which consistently state whether senior  discounts are available in their more extensive accommodation listings.  </P> <P> And the booklet does mention the Ramada Inn at Altamonte Springs, which has a  senior plan worth noting. It gives a 25% senior discount for double occupancy,  plus 50 cents off the discounted rate for each year the visitor is past age 55.  For those 65, that's another $5 off plus the discount.  </P> <P> That's a better price break to lure the true seniors, who are all too often  lumped into the same discount bracket as millions of AARP and Mature Outlook  members, many of whom are 50 years old and still employed.  </P> <P> There is a similar shortage of attractions and dining recommendations in the  booklet. Busch Gardens, Sea World and Universal Studios are noted.  Conspicuously absent, however, is Walt Disney World and Epcot, which provide a  "Magic Years Club" for seniors age 60 and over.  </P> <P> According to the pamphlet, there are only six restaurants in the entire Orlando  area offering senior discounts. Only one car rental agency and one airline are  noted as providing senior deals.  </P> <P> All this points out one of the shortcomings of such guides put out by area  chambers of commerce or visitors bureaus: They are published for their members.  There can be fine senior deals at accommodations, attractions, etc., in the  area, but if those businesses are not dues-paying members, they are not listed.  </P> <P> One possibly helpful feature in Orlando's pamphlet is its listing of medical  services, medical supply and rental companies, drug stores and pharmacies. None  of the 19 such listings are noted as offering discounts, however.  </P> <P> The same goes for the 16 shopping areas listed, although the location and  opening hours of several malls, flea markets and browse-and-buy areas are  helpful.  </P> <P> In short, Orlando's "Golden Magic Days" pamphlet is marginally helpful, better  than nothing at all and just about worth the 25-cent stamp.  </P> <P> To obtain a copy, write to Golden Magic Days, Orlando/Orange County Convention  &amp; Visitors Bureau, 7208 Sand Lake Road, Suite 300, Orlando, Fla. 32819.  </P></p>

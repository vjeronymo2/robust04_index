			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It will appear that the Zairian opposition Sacred  Union is not as rock solid as it used to be. One of the parties  in the coalition has been kicked out and it is partly over the  leadership of Etienne Tshisekedi who is locked in a struggle  with President Mobutu over who should be Zaire's prime minister.  From Kinshasa, (Makele Urung) telexed this report:    After a meeting that stretched late into the night, the  Sacred Union general assembly delivered its chilling verdict.  The centrist Union of Independent Democrats, UDI, supported  largely by businessmen and technocrats, was no longer part of  the opposition coalition. The party was accused of betraying  the spirit of the national conference and of violating the  principles of the Sacred Union alliance.    The expulsion was clearly an attempt by hardliners within  the  alliance to discipline the troops for daring to challenge the  claim of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi to the post of  prime minister. In this regard the UDI is accused of having  made two mistakes. First, it did not join a mass opposition  walkout in Parliament last week in protest against the adoption  of a constitutional article which allowed candidates other than  Etienne Tshisekedi to stand for the premiership. The UDI then  added insult to injury by helping to launch the URD [Union for  the Republic and Democracy], which is an opposition subplatform  widely seen as a challenge to Tshisekedi's authority.    Tshisekedi supporters have other strong reasons to suspect  the UDI. The party's leading light, Kengo wa Dondo, is being  tipped as a potential prime minister if in the end Tshisekedi  agrees to step down. Already the opposition press has launched  a bitter campaign against Kengo who is the son of a Polish  father and a Rwandan mother. The press says he is not a true  Zairian and therefore he's not suitable for the post of prime  minister.</p>

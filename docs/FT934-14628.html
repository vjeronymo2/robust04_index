			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Comac rights to fund Pounds 18.5m purchase of Computer Search MR PHILIP Swinstead, former chief executive of SD-Scicon, the computing services company acquired two years ago by EDS of the US, is once again at the head of a large information technology company. Comac, the small USM-quoted computer staff agency in which he has a controlling interest, is buying Computer Search and Selection, a private company which is the UK's largest independent provider of contract computer staff. The consideration is Pounds 18.5m, satisfied by Pounds 4m in shares and Pounds 14.5m in cash or loan notes. Comac intends to raise Pounds 21.8m through a 4-for-1 rights issue at 85p a share to settle the cash portion of the consideration, repay the enlarged group's indebtedness of Pounds 2.5m and provide working capital. The brokers to the issue, fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, are James Capel. Dealings in Comac were suspended yesterday at 90p. Both companies specialise in finding computer staff with specialised skills. CSS was founded in 1981 by Mr John Sharpe who remains the large shareholder. From a base of 50 consultants in 1982 it now has more than 1,000 contractors placed with client companies. In the year to March 26 1993 turnover was Pounds 53m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m. Comac, founded in 1973, joined the USM in 1989. It had a turnover of Pounds 11.1m in 1992 with a profit before tax of Pounds 447,000. Mr Swinstead became chief executive of Comac in June this year following the purchase of a 19.5 per cent stake for Pounds 750,000. The acquisition of CSS is part of his strategy to create a computing services company. A particular trend in the sector is towards the use of contract staff supplied by specialist agencies, rather than the maintenance of large in-house data processing departments. Mr Swinstead said: 'The agency industry is fragmented and we believe it will be restructured over the next few years, just like the software industry in the 1980s.</p>

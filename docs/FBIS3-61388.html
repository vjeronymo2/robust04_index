			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Borodayev: "The Railroad and the National </F> Economy"]    [Text] Of course, journalists frequently turn to the  chief of the Moldovan Railroad, G. Mikenberg, with their  questions. However, it was perhaps for the first time in the  last few years that so many representatives of the mass media  gathered in his office.    The press conference was organized on the occasion of  the issuance of the government Decree on Measures To Develop  Railway Transportation.    This was a long-awaited decree. G. Mikenberg dwelled on its  key aspects. The document provides for developing the Program  and Chart for the Long-Range Development of Railway  Transportation, taking into account its integration into the  European transportation complex, as well as building new  sections of the network and upgrading certain most significant  facilities.    In addition to the proprietary funds of the railroad,  appropriations from the republic budget, bank credit, and  off-budget funds are supposed to be allocated for the  development of railway transportation. The feasibility of  attracting foreign capital and loans from international  organizations for purchasing rolling stock and the most  significant types of machinery and materials was acknowledged.  The task was set to organize in Moldova the repairs of certain  types of cars, devices, and equipment and the manufacturing of  spare parts, making use of the production capacity of local  industrial enterprises.    The adoption of the decree does not at all mean that the  railroad is indebted to the state. On the contrary, the railroad  of Moldova operates in a stable and profitable manner, without  subsidies. It fully meets the need for freight and passenger  carriage alike, is converting two sections to electric traction,  and is building a new spur line, Revaca-Cainari, which will make  it possible to reduce the distance to the station Bessarabskaya  by more than 100 kilometers.    However, a number of specific difficulties have recently  developed that the railroaders are not in a position to overcome  solely with their own resources.    In the last two years, the railroad has not received a  single  diesel motor coach train, a single freight or passenger car, or  a single wooden tie. Some 32 percent of diesel motor coach  trains qualify for retirement. The numbers of broken-down  passenger and freight cars are snowballing. More than 1 million  rotten ties lie on main and entry-and-exit tracks. This is an  alarm signal from the railway sounding full blast. At present,  it is still able to handle the volume of carriage, whereas  tomorrow a crisis may break out in the course of which not only  the carriage of freight and passengers will fail to be ensured,  but the guarantee of safe traffic will also disappear. This is  why it is hard to overrate the issuance of the government decree.    There is no way to do without foreign investment. At  present,  one compartment coach costs 1.1 million Deutsche Marks, and a  diesel motor coach train, $5 million. In addition, it has been  resolved to build the Chisinau-Bucharest main line. To be sure,  the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has  taken an interest in this project and is prepared to invest in  construction.    Moldova received 13,000 cars as a result of the division of  the car stock among CIS countries. There are many cars that are  somewhat difficult to repair because of the erstwhile strict  specialization. We have begun to repair certain things in  overhaul workshops here. The rest we send for repairs to other  states selecting places that are cheaper and more advantageous.  However, even this claims considerable funds.    All the enumerated problems are objective. There are a great  many subjective ones! They are threatening to tear the railroad  into pieces. In this instance, furious assault has been mounted  on the part of Ukraine. Over there, it has been resolved at the  level of the parliament to take away from Moldova the stations  that are located on the territory of Ukraine. If they succeed  the railway of Moldova will be torn into six sections. To the  credit of railroad personnel, we must say that they are also  preparing for the worst. A number of scenarios have already been  developed under which the unity of the railroad and the  management of technical processes will be maintained.  Nonetheless, they are awaiting with hope the results of  government-to-government negotiations between Moldova and  Ukraine that will dot all "i's" in railroad property disputes  between the two states.    What about the Dniester area? Over there, they just would  not  give up the desire to establish their jurisdiction over the  subdivisions of the railroad located on the Left Bank. The  economic absurdity of such striving has been proven. However,  yet another cycle of their expansion is building up again.    But the appetites of Right Bank officials are no smaller.  The  Ministry of Health Care is simply obsessed with the notion of  taking health care establishments away from the railroad  personnel. The government rejected these claims. They did not  calm down, and appealed to the parliament. The parliament acted  the same way the government had. A new attack is now beginning.  Why is the Ministry of Health so bent on doing it? There is one  argument: All medical establishments should report to a single  center. However, departmental medical services of the railways  have been codified in all CIS countries, in Romania, Poland,  Bulgaria, and Hungary because of the specifics of railway  transportation. What specifics? There is a special approach to  employees who are associated with traffic, that is, traffic  safety and the lives of a multitude of people. There are special  requirements for sight, hearing, fatigue resistance, and  psychological condition. There are prerun examinations of  locomotive engineers. There are intricacies of occupational  hygiene. There are services to railway workers who live in  out-of-the-way locations--at junction points, small stations,  and so on.    The attitude toward employees on the part of the mayor's  office of the city is hard to understand. On one occasion, they  took away a secondary school, on another, the building housing a  committee of the trade union of railroad workers and the  editorial office of the industry newspaper. They are now trying  to liquidate the children's hospital of the  railroad--notwithstanding that the railroad has built in  Chisinau huge residential subdivisions, hospitals, polyclinics,  shops, and the Palace of Culture (which, incidentally, they are  also dyeing). The railroad is continuing to build a lot of  beautiful things, and helping the city to meet its needs.    How can they fail to appreciate this contribution to urban  facilities? How can they trample on the rights of railway  workers?    The fact that the government has stated weightily by way of  its decree that it is extending its wardship and protection to  the main line should cool off the fervor and ambitions of some  zealous figures who wish to destroy the enterprise that has  evolved for a long time, as well as a stable collective.</p>

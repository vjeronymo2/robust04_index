			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   ANC Internal Rivalry -- The editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 27 June on page 8 begins by stating  that the recent restructuring of the ANC shows that "the  phenomenon of parliamentary versus extra-parliamentary  politics...will continue long into the future." The editorial  suggests that "the development of `people's power' outside the  Parliament...strengthens the hand of ANC secretary-general Cyril  Ramaphosa in the contest for ANC leadership" once Nelson Mandela  resigns. While, noting that the extra-parliamentary forces have  opportunities "to restrain government excesses," the paper warns  against efforts "to advance shortsighted, populist causes by,  say, opposing attempts to impose fiscal discipline or liberalise  the economy."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   East Rand Violence -- "We urge the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional government of Tokyo Sexwale  to make East Rand townships a top priority in the unfolding of  the Reconstruction and Development Plan [RDP]." So says an  editorial on page 12 of Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 27  June. The editorial charges that the causes of violence in East  Rand townships are the badly deteriorated infrastructure and  high unemployment. To combat the problem, the paper urges  "haste in ensuring that ordinary people begin to see tangible  results of the RDP." "Upgrading of Reef townships," the paper  argues, should take priority over projects such as refurbishing  the Johannesburg City Hall.  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   President's Example "Worthy of Emulation" -- "The days are  obviously past when the ANC pampered rebellious youngsters who  refused to go to school," says an editorial on page 6 of the  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 20 June. "Hence President  Mandela's blunt words last week to the youth on the anniversary  of the 16 June uprising: Roll up your sleeves, forget about  protest, and tackle the country's problems in a culture of  education and reconciliation. The message is not new. The  difference is that this time it comes from a democratically  elected president whose government has to deal with the enormous  problems arising from the disruption of schools in the townships  in recent years.... President Mandela emphasized his concern  over the youth by adding that he will forfeit one-third of his  salary to a fund to help street children, and children in  detention, and poor children who wish to study. It is an  example worthy of emulation by his political colleagues, the  youth, teachers, and parents."    Concern Over Truth Commission `Not Unfounded' -- The  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 June says in a page-10  editorial: "The concern of the Commissioner of Police Services  over the damaging consequences of a Commission of Truth on  certain ANC members in government will be taken with a pinch of  salt in some circles....But his opposition to such a commission  could possibly have more to do with the reasonably general fear  in the inner circles of the old regime -- in political and  security circles -- that only the sins of apartheid will be  exposed, and that they alone will have to pay the price. If  that is what the commissioner fears, he should say so outright.  His fears are apparently not totally unfounded. By spelling  out his opposition to the commission honestly, he will achieve  more and hopefully ensure that the commission exposes the whole  truth and, more important, achieves genuine reconciliation. The  commission will only succeed in its aim if it is seen to be fair  and just towards all parties, and if it probes in all directions  impartially. If that is what the police chief is aiming at,  then he ought to be given support."    Child Health and Care -- A second editorial on page 10 of  the  same issue of BEELD says: "It is disturbing that South Africa  has fallen so far behind in the provision of health and other  care to its children....According to the UN Children's Fund, 16  African countries have attained a better standard of living for  their children than South Africa, the continent's most  prosperous country. Part of the solution lies in the provision  of more and better health services, particularly among the  neglected part of the population." But this, together with "the  provision of specialized treatment where necessary," is not the  whole solution. "To improve the living standards of the  children, it is further necessary to persuade parents that  smaller families are in everyone's interests.... The legitimacy  of the new government offers it a golden opportunity to tackle  this sensitive issue."</p>

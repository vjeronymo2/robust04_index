			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Right place for locating EuroFed Sir, The debate over the location of the proposed European Central Bank will likely get nastier before it is resolved. As a visitor to the financial centres of Europe, I see obvious reasons why the bank ought to have its headquarters in London or Frankfurt. The other contenders are lightweight. Either the Germans will prevail because of the sheer size of their economic clout, or the bank could move to London to ensure even-handedness. London would be a great choice since a German will likely be the first chairman. This compromise would protect the integrity of the Ecu and D-Mark. So, two points for the Germans. Seen from across the Atlantic, London appears neutral. I cast my vote for London as the premier European financial centre and home for the ECB. There is another consideration. A good international bank needs a cadre of financiers, economists and civil servants. London is presently the home of one of the global centres of economic learning - the London School of Economics. The LSE already supplies monetary priests to the US Fed, the Bank of England and, probably, the Bundesbank. What better way to guarantee the necessary human capital to assist the new bank than by placing it in the Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf tower and by allowing the LSE to move into County Hall.

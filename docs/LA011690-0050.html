			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> First Chicago Corp.: The largest banking company in the Midwest posted fiscal  1989 net income of $359 million, a drop of 30% from fiscal 1988, in part  because of problems with loans to less developed countries. For the fourth  quarter, the firm, which is the parent of First National Bank of Chicago,  reported profit of $123 million, off 10% from the year-ago period. The quarter  results were attributed to commercial non-performing assets, which increased by  more than 30% to $592 million, largely because of problem real estate loans  that it said were geographically dispersed.  </P></p>

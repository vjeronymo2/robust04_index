			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: Property contracts should be binding, and remain so Sir, We have under our management a large cross-section of property and deal with a substantial number of assignments within portfolios over any given period of time. We note with considerable concern the various proposals that emerge from time to time, not least from the CBI (Letters, April 10), that the contract between landlord and tenant shall be varied purely on the basis of an assignment, whereby assignors might be relieved of their covenants if an assignee defaults. The terms of a contract freely entered into by the parties concerned will remain exactly that. When a tenant signs a lease it is a contract for a given period of time and is negotiated at arm's length. If the tenant then seeks to sell that interest to a third party, it does not alter the contract already entered into. The landlord, when approached for consent to an assignment, has strictly limited powers to refuse such proposals. The landlord chooses his tenant; he does not choose the tenant's subsequent purchaser. If there was any proposal to change the present privity of contract then it most certainly should not be retrospective and must only be allowed to apply in the case of leases granted after the law was changed. In that event, a landlord should have power to require a direct covenant from his tenant that he will remain liable under his covenant or an absolute power to approve or not approve assignments. The landlord should not be put into a position whereby, through no fault of his own, he finds the freely entered into contract ends up between parties not of his choosing with financial implications beyond his control. Tenants usually assign leases for a premium which they receive and spend. The landlord does not receive the benefit of such premiums. If the law was amended on the basis that any premiums were put into a joint account available to meet any subsequent default, then it might be possible to accept some change. However, freely negotiated contracts should remain without interference. Tenants are already protected under the Landlord and Tenant 1954 Act and have security of tenure; so, if they are concerned, they are perfectly able either to negotiate shorter leases or break clauses. Any proposal that seeks to interfere with the freely negotiated contracts would be a very retrograde step in whichever sector it might apply.

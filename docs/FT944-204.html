			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Unilever in deal with Indian ice cream group Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, has linked with the Kwality Icecream group, India's largest ice cream manufacturer, to produce and market ice cream under the Kwality Wall's brand name, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. The agreement, signed by Brooke Bond Lipton India, a Unilever subsidiary, and three of four families which own Kwality, is part of Unilever's strategy to enter India's growing food processing industry. The three parties to the deal, which cover two-thirds of the country and account for 85 per cent of the national volume sold by the Kwality group, will make ice cream for Brooke Bond, which will market the product. Brooke Bond Lipton India, which has a substantial presence in the country, took over the Dollops ice cream business and marketing system from Cadbury India, before launching Wall's, the international ice cream brand, in India early this year.</p>

Mate Granic is to have  talks tomorrow with U.S. Government representatives and with his  U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher.    A Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna delegation is traveling  together with Minister Granic. It is led by Kresimir Zubak,  president of the Presidential Council [of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna] and justice and administration minister.  Presidential Council member Mile Akmadzic is also traveling with  him.    In Washington they are going to discuss a possible agreement  between Croats and Muslims and putting an end to the war.  [passage omitted]    The Croatian side will display a high degree of flexibility  and will do everything for a Croat-Muslim agreement to be  reached, in which the United States and the European Union are  interested, most of all the Croat and the Muslim nations,  Minister Granic said in Frankfurt this afternoon. We will bear  in mind that the fundamental interests of the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must be completely protected. We have won  support for our stands from numerous important European  countries. We are beginning the negotiations in good faith that  an agreement is possible, and that reaching an agreement would  mean the beginning of the end of the war and the restoration of  a permanent peace. This agreement would give a chance to the  third side [Serbs] to take their standpoint toward a future life  together in Bosnia-Herzegovina that will be based on equality of  the three nations, Minister Granic stated for Croatian media  prior to his departure from Frankfurt.</p>

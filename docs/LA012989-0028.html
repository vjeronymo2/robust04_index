			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: LEGGE'S OPERETTA SERIES ON CD: A DELICIOUS FROTH  </P> <P> Walter Legge, the producing genius behind the operatic treasures of the early  years of the Angel/EMI label, deserves no less credit for overseeing the  operetta series dating from the same years, 1952-58. The nominal star of those  performances was Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Mrs. Legge -- but no one dared suggest  nepotism with a talent of that magnitude.  </P> <P> Schwarzkopf was part of an ensemble that, in the operettas, included the young  and virtually unknown Nicolai Gedda; a pair of echt-Viennese singing comedians,  Erich Kunz and Karl Donch, and soubrettes Erika Koth and Emmy Loose, all under  the lithe baton of Otto Ackermann, presiding over a London Philharmonia  Orchestra transformed into the world's most stylish waltz band.  </P> <P> The series is at last with us again, sounding better than ever in digital sound  on Angel compact discs.  </P> <P> For one listener the cream of this frothy crop is "Wiener Blut," top non-vocal  tunes (waltzes, polkas, gallops) from the pen of Johann Strauss Jr.,  posthumously joined by the book and lyrics of Victor Leon and Leo Stein, who  would later create the "Die Lustige Witwe" libretto for Franz Lehar. Their  efforts on behalf of "Wiener Blut" resulted in a musical delight coupled to a  loopy farce of which Feydeau might not have been ashamed.  </P> <P> The Legge troupe, headed by Schwarzkopf -- the teasing, cooing, vocal  affectations that can make listening to her a trial in more serious repertory  are made to order for this material -- Gedda and Kunz is pure joy, and Angel  accommodates the 70-minute score on a single CD.  </P> <P> Another arrangement, this time involving surgery by Erich Wolfgang Korngold on  an existing, unsuccessful Strauss operetta, is "Eine Nacht in Venedig." While  the work is musically cohesive in Korngold's refashioning, the  confused-identities plot has little of the wit of the "Wiener Blut" libretto.  The tunes, however, are irresistible and the performance is consistently on the  mark, with the additional plum of some ravishing singing by the Philharmonia  Chorus. The single CD (69530) is nearly 80 minutes long.  </P> <P> Strauss' other great operetta, which, like "Fledermaus," can be found on the  major operatic stages alongside Mozart and Verdi (although with less  frequency), is "Der Zigeunerbaron" (69526, 2 CDs). It is given what must be the  performance of its lifetime by the repertory company, augmented by the  25-year-old Hermann Prey, belting out the great last-act recruiting song with  spectacular brio.  </P> <P> The best known work of Lehar, ruler of the second generation of Viennese  operettists, is, of course, "The Merry Widow" (69520 -- another single-disc  bargain). Schwarzkopf is both merry and in most alluring vocal form, while  Gedda and Loose exude optimum charm as the young lovers. Casting Kunz as Danilo  may cheat us of some notes -- Kunz's range was restricted, to say the least --  but he does give us some memorable clowning.  </P> <P> A more serious Lehar operetta is "Das Land des Lachelns" (The Land of Smiles).  Ackermann and his cast made a powerful case for it with their 1953 recording  (69523, 2 CDs). Hearing its greatest tune (and Richard Tauber's signature),  "Dein ist mein ganzes Herz" (Yours is my heart alone), in chilling context is a  revelation: The Chinese prince sings it to his young Viennese wife to indicate  that of all his wives she is the one who has his heart, which ultimately proves  insufficient for the lady.  </P> <P> There is more to this operetta than that single tune -- ravishingly sung by  Gedda, with no attempt at imitating Tauber -- and, again, all of it handsomely  done by the Legge troupe. But there is something uncomfortable-making about the  libretto, by Fritz Lohner and Ludwig Herzer, in which the intelligent Asians  are perhaps unintentionally caricatured as being shifty and barbaric while the  frivolous, even dimwitted, Europeans are to be loved at pretty-face value.  </P> <P> It should be noted that the two "Smiles" CDs (69523) total only 87 minutes  playing time -- eight minutes longer than the single-disc "Eine Nacht in  Venedig." Surely Angel could have included some of the operetta arias recorded  by Schwarzkopf and Ackermann around the time of these sessions.  </P> <P> "Die Fledermaus" (69531, 2 CDs) is the single fatally flawed production in the  lot, done in by two pieces of miscasting: a self-effacing Bach tenor, Helmut  Krebs, chosen to impersonate Alfred, the preening Italian tenor, and Kunz, who  is is all wrong for Falke, trying to make it on charm alone where a strong,  secure operatic voice is demanded.  </P> <P> Then again, charm is precisely what is lacking in the conducting of Herbert von  Karajan, who muscles and hacks his way through the score where Ackermann  danced.  </P> <P> A final cavil, which applies to the entire series: While trilingual notes (and  synopses) of minimal worth are provided, the crucial librettos and their  translations are not. Hardly fair play when one considers that these are  full-priced CDs.  </P></p>

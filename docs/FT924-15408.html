			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Norfolk is one of those few remaining corners of England which still feels more than a touch primitive. No surprise, then, to learn from C4's Animal Squad Undercover (9.00) that among the yokels there are still avid followers of cock-fighting. (How much worse cock-fighting is than, say, factory farming chickens is a moot point.) The opening part of this trilogy follows the RSPCA's undercover squad in its dogged but ultimately frustrated effort to see justice done to the cock-fighters. BBC 2's Out of Darkness (7.50), the consistently interesting series on the troubles of African states, tonight reaches the Cameroons, whose footballers with their wonderful pelvic-thrusting dances provided quite the most memorable moments of the last World Cup - not excepting Gazza's blubbing. C4's late-night theme is a highly praised Mexican historical epic, Cabeza de Vaca (12.00), based on the memoirs of an eponymous 16th-century conquistador in Florida. Captured by an Indian tribe, de Vaca is brought to realise that the Indians' moral code is superior to that of the Spaniards.</p>

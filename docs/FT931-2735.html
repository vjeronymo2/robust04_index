			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Birkdale's triumvirate shrinks In May 1992 the UK advertising world was set abuzz by news that Richard Humphreys was joining the Birkdale Group, a tiny collection of advertising, PR and other marketing agencies with a Pounds 3m market capitalisation. Humphreys had just left Saatchi and Saatchi Worldwide where he was president and chief executive; the contrast spoke for itself. Now it seems that Humphreys is feeling the constraints of Birkdale, for it has announced that he is stepping down as chief executive. Humphreys will stay as an executive director but is also joining 'a consortium of investors which plans to acquire a substantial holding in a US-based international advertising group', an ambitious-sounding project not too dissimilar from the type of thing he gave as his reasons for joining Birkdale in the first place. At the same time, Simeon Galpert, one-time treasurer with WPP, is leaving his post as Birkdale's finance director to 'pursue other interests'. Of the triumvirate who hoped to make a substantial acquisition and put Birkdale back on the map, only Neil McClure is staying - as chief executive once more. McClure is putting a brave face on the proceedings; but it is hardly reassuring for shareholders to see the departure of two of the would-be architects of the group's planned resurgence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has  rejected a proposal by the Independent Electoral Commission that  all categories of prisoners should be allowed to vote in the  election. The ANC [African National Congress] and the SACP  [South African Communist Party] voted in favor of the proposal  but it was opposed by the NP [National Party] and the DP  [Democratic Party].    Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC said that the right to vote  was a basic right, and that problems could be created by  allowing only certain categories of prisoners to vote. Home  Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said the government was strongly  opposed to murderers and rapists being allowed to vote.</p>

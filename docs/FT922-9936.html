			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Reform of pension fund use resisted ANY government move to prevent companies from using their pension fund surpluses for their own benefit is likely to result in significantly lower levels of corporate contributions and threaten the security of schemes, according to finance directors of Britain's largest companies. A report to be published shortly by the 100 Group of finance directors, after a survey of its members, is the first formal response from British industry to proposals for pension fund reform aired in recent months. Co-operation from employers who sponsor pension schemes is seen as critical in implementing any plans for reform. The companies surveyed account for roughly Pounds 97bn in pension fund assets, about a third of all those in the UK. Since revelations that more than Pounds 400m has disappeared from pension funds controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, UK lawmakers have been besieged by public demands for an overhaul of UK pensions law. The cross-party parliamentary select committee on social security, after months of hearings, has called for legislative changes to improve pension fund security. While some groups have called for laws to prevent employers from using scheme surpluses, the committee failed to address the matter, saying it required further study. The report by the 100 Group shows that, despite concerns that reform would hobble companies' ability to use surpluses for themselves, the majority of large employers believe that surpluses should be shared with workers. Of 91 companies responding to a questionnaire, 74 said they planned to use funds to improve benefits to members, and only six said they would not do so. An equal number said they would also use the surplus either to take a contributions holiday or repay some of it to the company. The study showed a wide degree of support for some elements of pension reform that have been proposed by the select committee. In particular, the finance directors are calling for 'rigorous internal control and accountability in pension scheme management'. The study, the broadest of its kind in the UK, found several significant trends. Particularly, there is a growing concentration of pension funds in the hands of a small number of fund managers. The study noted that five internally managed funds and six UK fund managers accounted for more than half of all the funds surveyed. 'A limited number of major fund managers control an increasing part of the share capital of UK companies. The effect of this is yet to be seen in practice but it may militate against short-termism,' the study noted.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THATCHER AT NEW LOW IN OPINION POLL;  </P> <P> GREAT BRITAIN: THE FUROR OVER THE TOP TREASURY OFFICIAL'S RESIGNATION HEIGHTENS  CRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S LEADERSHIP STYLE.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, her government rocked by the resignation of  her top treasury official, sank today to the worst ratings of her decade in  power.  </P> <P> One sounding showed her the most unpopular leader since polling began here.  </P> <P> "She cannot afford many more mishaps," said Norman Tebbit, former chairman of  the governing Conservative Party who helped mastermind Thatcher's third  successive election victory in 1987.  </P> <P> In a National Opinion Poll sounding, Thatcher hit the lowest popularity rating  for any prime minister since polling started in Britain 50 years ago.  </P> <P> Only 24% of a sample of 935 voters questioned said they were satisfied with her  performance and 61% blamed her for Thursday's sudden resignation of Chancellor  of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.  </P> <P> He said he could not continue in the 22-member Cabinet so long as Thatcher  retained a personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, who opposes having  Britain fully join the European Monetary System that links key European  currencies. Walters then also resigned.  </P> <P> Thatcher is lukewarm toward membership of the system's currency-stabilizing  exchange rate mechanism while Lawson and Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe  favor it. She fired Howe as foreign secretary last June.  </P> <P> Tebbit, one of Thatcher's closest political associates, described the latest  forced Cabinet shuffle as "an appalling political muddle.'  </P> <P> "She should remember it is dangerous for a captain to appear semidetached from  the team," Tebbit wrote in London's Evening Standard.  </P> <P> The furor has heightened criticism of Thatcher's style as bossy, hectoring and  intolerant of opposing views in the Cabinet.  </P> <P> The National Opinion Poll, published in a London newspaper, The Independent,  was taken by telephone in the three days after Lawson quit and the British  media reported the government in crisis.  </P> <P> Thatcher already held the unpopularity record when she scored a 25% satisfied  rating in Gallup and Market Opinion and Research International polls in 1981  when the effects of her tight-money policies sent unemployment soaring.  </P> <P> Labor Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson held the previous unpopularity record  of 27% satisfied in a 1968 Gallup sounding.  </P> <P> The National Opinion Poll showed 62% of those questioned said they were  dissatisfied with Thatcher. Fourteen percent had no opinion.  </P> <P> A Harris Poll for the BBC-TV current affairs program "Panorama" being screened  tonight showed the Conservatives 13 points behind the socialist Labor Party.  Fifty-two percent of those questioned said Thatcher should resign.  </P></p>

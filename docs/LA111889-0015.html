			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VANDALIZING U.S. FLAG  </P> <P> Your insistence that any vandalism or desecration of the American flag  represents some bellwether of national freedom ("Reason Wins a Round,"  editorial, Oct. 23) is sheer fantasy. In an effort to prop up your uninformed  opinion, you cite a so-called conservative spokesman, who earlier opined that  the Bill of Rights protects speech, no matter how offensive.  </P> <P> Both of you are wrong. The Bill of Rights protects free speech, but certainly  not unlimited speech. Further, those who would wrap themselves in  constitutional broadcloth as protection against their libel, slander, riot, or  advocacy of violent sedition have seldom found legal sanctuary in the  Constitution and Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> Neither are "fighting words" protected speech. To anyone who has ever walked  along the quietly elegant rows of simple white markers at a veterans cemetery  and contemplated the supreme sacrifice those honored dead gave for our flag, it  is most assuredly "fighting words" when, in the name of "free speech," that  ensign of liberty is vandalized.  </P> <P> If such an atrocity does not heighten your sense of outrage enough to protect  that precious symbol, feel free to crawl back underneath your constitutional  theory, but do not expect any patriot to join you.  </P> <P> JAMES E. ROGAN, Glendale  </P></p>

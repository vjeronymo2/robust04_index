			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondents Aleksandr Gerasimov and Nikolay Federov </F> report from the Plesetsk test ground]    [Text] [Gerasimov] Just like everything else in the world,  strategic missiles are getting old as well. The most modern of  them -- the Topols -- have been given 15 years of life by their  constructors, after which they will be scrapped. It is unlikely  that these missiles will come under the treaty on cutting  offensive weapons. Today, Russia has no money to create new  nuclear systems.    Scientists at the Kompleks scientific-technical center,  which  created the SS-25, and now in financial crisis like the majority  of their colleagues in the defense industry, have decided to  earn money with the elderly missiles. The Topols that have been  taken out of active service are being purchased with credits  from the Defense Ministry, and START-II space rockets will be  built, based on these missiles.    The Plesetsk cosmodrome has the chance to become a  cosmodrome  twice over. Previously, all space work was carried out by  officers in the military-space forces. Taking part in the  START-II program are workers from the Plesetsk test ground and a  structural unit in the Strategic Missile Troops. The  departmental division of the two sections of the Defense  ministry barely allows them to unite their space efforts.    In the meantime, such an unnaturally long rocket can carry  cargoes weighing up to 1.5 tonnes into space from unprepared  launch sites, and is capable of working anywhere on the planet.  So we have learned that a project is being developed to launch  a South African satellite from the territory of the Republic of  South Africa. However, in order to enter the market with new  launch vehicles, it is necessary to confirm its reliability.  The developers are counting on the reliability of the SS-25  base rocket, which was last launched on Wednesday [22 June].</p>

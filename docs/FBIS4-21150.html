Ma said conclusions about Taiwan found in the summary of the  1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ran counter  to details in the report's appendices.    The summary depicted Taiwan as a market and transshipment  point for Southeast Asian heroin and a safe haven for drug  fugitives. Taiwan was also said to be producing illicit  amphetamines and increasingly playing a role in money laundering.    In the appendices, however, Taiwan is not listed as a major  drug producing, manufacturing trafficking or money laundering  nation, contrary to some foreign wire reports, he said.    Ma criticized the report's conclusion that Taiwan is a safe  haven for drug fugitives. He blamed this misunderstanding on  the lack of an extradition agreement between the U.S. and  Taiwan. The problem can be easily resolved by signing an  extradition treaty, he said.    Ma added that the Justice Ministry will see to it that a law  to prevent money laundering is enacted as soon as possible to  put an end to the crime in Taiwan.    Meanwhile, Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau Director  Wu Tung-ming denied reports that Taiwan is a major drug  producing and trafficking country.    Wu explained that Taiwan is actively cracking down on  illicit  drug trade and abuse, has implemented laws and regulations to  control drug-related crime, and is stepping up international  drug smuggling information exchanges.</p>

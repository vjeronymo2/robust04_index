			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mathew Pereira] </F>   [Text] Instructors from the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF]  showed soldiers from the Philippine Army (PA) the finer points  of Fighting in Built-Up Areas (Fibua) yesterday.    The visiting army later executed a near-perfect mock attack  to secure three buildings at the Safti [Singapore Armed Forces  Training Institute] training area under the watchful eyes of  Singapore trainers.    The PA soldiers were part of a 200-strong contingent which  is  in Singapore for Exercise Anoa-Singa 2/94.    The exercise allows for cross-training between the troops of  the two countries.    This is the first bilateral army exercise between the two  countries to be held Singapore and the second the Anoa-Singa  series. The previous exercise was held in the Philippines last  year.    Anoa-Singa 2/94 is conducted under a memorandum of  understanding the the countries signed last week.    It provides for regular joint exercises between the two  armed  forces. The two countries take turns to host it.    Among those observing yesterday's attack were the chief of  Defence Force, Major-General Ng Jui Ping, and the chief of  staff, Arme Forces of the Philippines, Lt-General Arturo T.  Enrile.    The Fibua practice was also one of the activities which  kicked off Anoa-Singa 2/94.    While the men tackled urban warfare, their commanders were  put through a fully computerised wargaming system. The  seven-day bilateral exercise is being held in the Safti training  area.    Maj-Gen Ng and Lt-Gen Enrile opened the exercise at a short  ceremony at the SAF Wargame Centre in Jurong earlier in the  morning.    Maj-Gen Ng, in his speech, said the SAF had always valued  joint exercises with friendly forces.    He said: "Not only do such exercises provide good avenues  for  us to learn from one another, they forge close understanding  between the leaders, officers, and men of both armed forces.  Over time, as the officers advance in the careers, they bring  to defence relations that special insight into the other armed  forces and that special rapport with its leaders."    Lt-Gen Enrile said the bilateral initiative underpinned the  desire of the two sides to expand their interaction.    About 600 officers and men from the 1st and 2nd Battalions,  Singapore Guards are involved in the exercise.    Their Filipino counter are from the PA's 56th Infantry  Battalion (56IB). The troops arrived here last Friday and will  leave on May 21.    The Defence Ministry said Exercise Anoa-Singa reflects the  warm and friendly ties between the two countries' armed forces.</p>

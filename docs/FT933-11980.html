			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Good example for timber production management Sir, The terms of the new International Cocoa Agreement ('Cocoa pact goes for output management', July 20) should be most instructive to the negotiation of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA). The cocoa agreement rightly puts the emphasis on production management, whereas ITTA negotiators still discuss, among other aspects, the suitability of a reference to 'Target 2000', according to which all tropical timber reaching international markets should be 'sustainably produced' by that date. Instead of discussing time targets, ITTA negotiators would be better off to concentrate on production management. This would be most suitable to the ITTA, as it would lead to better prices for tropical timber producers and a more environmentally friendly exploitation of the tropical rain forest. Environmental and economic objectives would be simultaneously addressed, and the international tropical timber trade would stand a chance of subsisting in the long run.

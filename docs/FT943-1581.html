			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK economic trend argues against monetary union Sir, As the new set of trade figures released on Wednesday reveals, the UK economy is finally cashing in on Britain's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism two years ago ('Non-EU exports rise to record highs', September 22). This outcome had not really been too difficult to predict (Letters, September 28 1992). While fears of any repercussions on the inflation front have proved unfounded as well, the opportunity costs of an artificially high exchange rate have become all too clear. 'Black Wednesday', even though it should be considered a humiliation of the government's economic policy at that time, was a real blessing for Britain's economic pros-pects. Moreover, it offers some food for thought regarding future EU economic policy. As there is no way to prevent economies from diverging at some point, any fixed exchange rate will eventually prove wrong as well. Consequently, the recent British experience is the best argument available against the planned European monetary union] Jorg Schimmelpfennig, Department of Economics, University of Osnabruck, D-49069, Osnabruck, Germany</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Chief executives slip back on pay Chief executives in the UK are falling further behind their international colleagues in the pay stakes in spite of substantial salary increases in recent months, according to a survey by Towers Perrin, the management consultants. However, because prices in Britain are relatively low, UK executives have better living standards than many of their Continental colleagues. The remuneration survey placed UK chief executives 17th in a survey of 19 countries, down from 14th the year before. US executives were top. The survey covers industrial companies with annual sales above Pounds 165m. When the criterion of total remuneration was used, UK chief executives fared slightly better at 14th position. In the last survey on this measurement of pay in 1991 UK executives ranked sixth. Towers Perrin said a number of factors were influencing this change. They included: Exchange rate movements. The adoption by other countries of annual bonus schemes and other forms of longer term incentives. Shortage of management talent in other countries which was driving up pay rates. In terms of purchasing power, chief executives in the UK had 63 per cent of the purchasing power of US chief executives. German chief executives had 65 per cent, Italy 64 per cent, Spain 62 per cent, Switzerland 61 per cent, France 55 per cent, Netherlands 54 per cent, Belgium 44 per cent and Sweden 31 per cent.

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Polly Peck pay-out could bottom at 3p Creditors of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and electronics group, have been told they may receive no more than 3p in the pound when administrators complete their disposals. Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte and Touche Ross, the joint administrators, have told the creditors in a six monthly update that the best estimate of a return is now 11p in the pound with a lowest estimate of 3p in the pound. This excludes any contribution from northern Cyprus or from legal actions launched by Mr Christopher Morris, the Touche Ross administrator, against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck, and other related parties. Originally the administrators had hopes of achieving a much higher figure.</p>

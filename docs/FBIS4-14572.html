			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report under the "Contacts" rubric: "Russia </F> Studies Alternatives to NATO expansion and Builds Direct  Contacts With Europe"]    [Text] As has been advised by the staff of Russian Deputy  Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, his meeting yesterday with  French Ambassador to Russia Pierre Morel was devoted to  international security matters. Mr. Kokoshin and Mr. Morel  discussed the military-political cooperation of France and  Russia under the agreements signed by both countries' defense  ministers.    Commenting for SEGODNYA on the range of problems discussed,  Andrey Kokoshin said that Russia advocates a strengthening of  European security systems and views with great interest the  "Balladur Plan" suggested by France, aimed at greater stability  in Europe. This plan, according to experts, represents an  autonomous program that does not rely on NATO structures and is  based on bilateral agreements outside the U.S. sphere of  control. Russia, incidentally, has stepped up its bilateral  contacts with leading countries of Western Europe, especially  with France and Germany, as well as with Great Britain and  others.    Mr. Kokoshin, however, remarked that "alongside this" Russia  also seeks to interact constructively with NATO, including  participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia is  trying to create a counterbalance of sorts to NATO's possible  expansion through the accession of former Soviet satellites to  it. The possibility of proposing to the European community a  security system not based on a military bloc where the United  States plays the leading role, but one based on bilateral  accords, especially with France -- a country that traditionally  keeps aloof from NATO and is unwilling to follow in the wake of  American foreign policy -- appears very appealing.    According to SEGODNYA's lights, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev will put before Western European countries a  Russian concept of European security late in April.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: The only route to an effective opposition Sir, Your leader, 'The challenge for the Labour party' (April 30), was most perceptive. Labour said that it no longer worshipped the Clause Four commitment to public ownership, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the unions. It lost because it did not get rid of the men who all their lives had worshipped at those shrines. Those have now become, and are seen to be, yesterday's men. You suggest that if Mr John Smith be elected, his first job will be to deunionise the party. Can he? He is not only a union sponsored MP, but has made it clear, by letting it be known almost before the leadership campaign began, that he had strong union support - and so was a yesterday's man. I am a Conservative worker. I hope Mr Brian Gould will win, for every government needs an effective opposition. Mr Gould might produce that. Mr Smith cannot. Robert Nott, Englefield Cottage, Hurtmore, Godalming, Surrey GU7 2RA</p>

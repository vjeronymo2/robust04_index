			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--A Muslim fundamentalist who  said he had orders "to kill any Frenchman" was sentenced to a  life term of hard labor Wednesday [13 April] for the 1986 murder  of a French diplomat, the state-run news agency NNA [NATIONAL  NEWS AGENCY] said.    The defendant, Hasan Muhammad Tulays, a corporal in the  Lebanese army and member of Islamic Resistance, a paramilitary  wing of the pro-Iranian group Hizballah, had confessed to the  killing.    He testified that at the time of the shooting of Christian  Gouttiere [name as received], the military attache at the French  embassy, he had "received an order to kill any French person".    The military court that sentenced Tulays rejected his  lawyer's appeal for amnesty, saying that to do so could damage  relations between France and Lebanon.    Under a law passed in 1991, the death penalty in Lebanon was  replaced by a sentence of life at hard labor.    An alleged accomplice of Tulays, Munzir Rammal, tried in  absentia, got the same sentence.    Tulays was 26 at the time of the shooting.    Gouttiere, 54, was shot in the head three times in a  Christian suburb of Beirut, near the French embassy.</p>

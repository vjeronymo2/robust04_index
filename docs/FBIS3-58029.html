Testifying at the Milan trial of financier Sergio Cusani in  connection with kickbacks paid for the failed public-private  joint venture, Enimont, Portesi said he met several times in  1991 with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi and party  treasurer Alessandro Patelli on request from the company.    Portesi said Bossi asked for contributions in the form of  campaign advertising, while Patelli also suggested "financing  for foreign companies." In the end, Portesi said he delivered  the 200 million lire in cash to Patelli at a Rome cafe and that  Patelli did not request the joint receipt required by laws on  financing of political parties.    Patelli was arrested in connection with the funds on 7  December and Bossi was placed under investigation for the same  case on December 20.    The Northern League, which claims to be innocent of any and  all political corruption, said the entire affair was a mistake  by Patelli and has offered to return the money.    At his testimony, Portesi also described other contributions  made by the chemical giant to politicians for the 1992 elections.    Today's court session, the twentieth in the trial, was the  first attended by Cusani himself, who faces charges of  falsifying accounts and violation of party financing laws.    The first person to be brought to trial in the vast Clean  Hands scandal, Cusani spent five months in Milan's San Vittore  jail and was granted house arrest on December 23.    The financial expert refused to appear in court during his  jail term, saying he would answer questions only as a free man.    Among those due to take the witness stand today were the  administrative secretaries of the Social Democrats, Liberals and  Christian Democrats, former Socialist Senator Bruno Pellegrini,  Socialist MP Paolo Pilliteri, Liberal MP Egidio Sterpa, and  Vincenzo D'Urso, assistant to the late Socialist Party  administrative secretary Vincenzo Balsamo.    Among those who received unrecorded campaign contributions,  according to Portesi, were former Socialist Foreign Minister  Gianni Di Michelis, Milan Mayor Paolo Pillitteri, Maurizio  Pagani of the Christian Democrat Party and Republican Senator  Antonio Del Pennino.    Portesi said he obtained two billion lire from Montedison  Chairman Carlo Sama to distribute during the election campaign  but that he did not spend it all and returned the left-over  money to Sama.</p>

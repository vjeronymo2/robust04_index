			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: BES deadline AS SEPTEMBER draws closer, university business expansion schemes will begin to dry up. BES companies are allowed to buy only property which is empty, which means before term begins. This week's offerings include another FT-SE 100-linked scheme sponsored by Close Brothers. BESSA Wye College is an arranged exit, cash-backed scheme to provide accommodation for Wye College, University of London. Investors can choose one or two companies. The first offers a fixed price of 121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to a 13.9 per cent annual compound return to a higher-rate taxpayer. The second will give a fixed return of 60p, plus a variable return of 2.44p for every 1 per cent growth in the FT-SE. There is a lock-in once the index achieves 25 per cent growth (giving investors a return of 121p) and 0.6p for every 1 per cent growth thereafter. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Sponsor Neill Clerk's cash-backed Glamorgan Residences aims to raise Pounds 4.5m for student accommodation for the University of Glamorgan. The arranged exit price is 122p and minimum investment Pounds 1,000. Capital Prime Properties, an assured-tenancy BES sponsored by Johnson Fry, seeks to raise Pounds 5m to 'buy property in London as cheaply as possible, add value to it where it can, and let at the highest possible rental.' The minimum application is Pounds 3,000. There is a 4 per cent discount for applications received before September 7, and 2 per cent from then to October 5. Capital Ventures next week launches Cambridge Collegiate Consortium, a cash-backed offer with a fixed exit price of 122.5p. For those who prefer trading ventures, Safewear Wessex, a Hampshire-based corporate clothing and work-wear company, has launched a BES trading company called Bodycover plc which will acquire the parent. The company will continue to supply corporate clothing and plans to create a franchise network.</p>

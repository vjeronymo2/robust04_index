			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Review Under Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations. These requirements, set forth in section 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation describes any administrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies that the proposed rule meets the requirements of section 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE has determined that promulgation of this proposed rule falls within the procedural rulemaking class, Category A6 of Appendix A to Subpart D, ``Categorical Exclusions Applicable to General Agency Actions'', of the DOE National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. 10 CFR part 1021. It is therefore categorically excluded from preparation of either an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement under the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321, et. seq).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX.

If informal meetings or other contacts occur during this rulemaking, DOE may add a memorandum to the record on file summarizing what transpired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential and which may be exempt by law from public disclosure, should submit one complete copy of the document, as well as two copies from which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information and to treat it according to its determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Request to Speak Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public hearing on the proposed rule will be held at the time and place indicated in the DATES and ADDRESSES Sections of this notice.

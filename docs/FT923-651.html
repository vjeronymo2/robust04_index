			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Rules eased on sale of non-cat cars THE GOVERNMENT plans to give car dealers and manufacturers an extra year to sell at least 40,000 new cars built without pollution-curbing catalytic converters. The move arises from a collapse in the market for new cars which has left the industry with excessive stocks. in effect, it ends any prospect of the non-cat cars being offered at bargain-basement prices before the end of the year. Under an EC directive introduced in in the middle of last year, registration of new cars without catalytic converters is scheduled to become illegal throughout the Community after this year. However, subject to certain volume restrictions, the government now plans that their sale should be allowed until the end of next year. With sales of new cars in the UK and to a lesser extent some continental markets this year falling well below predicted levels, the UK industry some weeks ago joined France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Greece in seeking extra time to sell its remaining models without catalytic converters. The EC Council of Ministers recently acknowledged the difficulty with an amendment allowing member governments to relax the rules. Without the resulting extension throughout next year, manufacturers - many already incurring substantial losses - faced either selling the cars at even deeper discounts than those already being made, or registering them without real owners and selling them as used. One rumour current before the government's rescue proposal was that such cars might be destroyed to prevent them from undermining the market further. Under the scheme, the extension will apply only to non-cat cars built between August 1990 and the beginning of this month. Each manufacturer's sales of such vehicles will also be restricted to not more than 10 per cent of its total sales this year. The government estimates, however, that there will be only enough cars without the converters left unsold after January 1 to account for around 3 per cent of next year's total sales, or just over 40,000 cars on a market which is widely expected to reach a total of 1.6m. FORD, the leading UK vehicle maker, has warned union officials that it has too much capacity in the UK. It has told them that sales of its Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars and light vans are expected to remain low. It has also warned them that without action 'this reduced demand would lead to ..a worsening cost position which would put at risk new-product and other investment programmes'. The company is already cutting capacity at its UK assembly plants by about 20 per cent. Ford said yesterday that 'the situation could deteriorate even further' forcing the company to shed more jobs than the total of more than 1,500 announced on Thursday.</p>

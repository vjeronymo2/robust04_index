			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Cautious EC response EC officials yesterday responded cautiously to the Danish Social Democratic party's proposals for a compromise with the European Community on the Maastricht treaty, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. A senior EC official said the proposals marked a first step towards a common effort aimed at meeting Danish objections to the treaty, following the rejection of Maastricht in last June's referendum in Denmark. 'It is just the beginning of the negotiation process,' an official in Brussels said. Informal talks are already under way in talks between Denmark and the British presidency. Talks will gather pace when the Danish government publishes its White Paper on Maastricht after the French referendum on September 20. The key question is whether the EC and Denmark can agree on how to proceed before January 1, when the treaty is to come into force. Without an agreement - or at least a wide-ranging consensus at the Edinburgh summit of the 12 members in December - Denmark risks being left in legal limbo. EC officials said some of the Danish proposals, notably the affirmation that they would not send soldiers to serve in a future European army, were uncontroversial, since this was not required under the Maastricht treaty. Brussels officials said negotiations between the 11 members and Denmark were bound to become tense if the French approve the Maastricht treaty. EC states such as Spain and Italy will want to press ahead with ratification, while the Danish government wants more time to prepare public opinion. 'The timing is extremely delicate,' said a senior EC official. Another difficulty identified in Brussels is Britain's sympathetic attitude to the Danish predicament.</p>

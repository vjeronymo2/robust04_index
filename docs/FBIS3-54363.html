A series of meetings culminated in a meeting with British Prime  Minister John Major. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, al-Hariri said that British  officials are interested in developing bilateral relations,  especially in work spheres. They are also interested in  bolstering the Army and internal security forces. He stressed  their support for Resolution 425 in order to liberate southern  Lebanon from the Israeli occupation.    Al-Hariri pointed out that the policy pursued by Lebanon in  the [peace] negotiations has produced positive results so far.  He stressed that no one can conclude an agreement on Lebanon,  nor can anyone conclude an agreement at Lebanon's expense. He  said that participation in multilateral negotiations before  progress is achieved in the bilaterals would harm Lebanon more  than its nonparticipation in the multilaterals. He stressed the  need to adhere to Resolution 425, "because it is the legal  foundation for the Lebanese negotiator."    He pointed out that his government is working to tackle the  peace challenge, to stand fast, and to rebuild the  infrastructure without waiting for aid, despite its importance.  Talking about the criticism campaign against the government, he  said that the major part of it does not take account of the  concept of the democratic process. "It is criticizing figures  rather than programs."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan-Anders Ekstrom: "Hard-Pressed Salolainen </F> `Pounds on the Table'"]    [Excerpts] Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, the  chairman of the National Coalition (Conservative) Party, thinks  he won the support of the rest of the party leadership in a new  attempt to restore order in the party. Following a fresh  outbreak of criticism against him, he secretly summoned the  group of ministers, the party leadership, and the leaders of the  party's parliamentary group to a meeting a few days ago at which  he says agreement was reached both on the party's goals during  the remainder of this election period and on ending the "clever  tactical maneuvering" on personal issues.    At an impromptu news conference Friday [18 February] at the  parliamentary building he stated frankly that he had now  "pounded his fist on the table," as he had promised to do  earlier. That this quite literally happened was attested to by  parliamentary group vice chairman Kimmo Sasi, among others.  [passage omitted]    He also related that party vice chairman Maija Perho-Santala  apologized for statements she had made, including those in an  interview with the principal Social Democratic newspaper,  DEMARI. In it she described Salolainen as "extremely  hypersensitive" and implied that an extra party congress might  be called for.  <H5>  Caustic Opinions </H5>   Salolainen did not mince words in his opinion of  Perho-Santala, among others. He declared that he was "very  displeased" by the disloyalty she had exhibited and pointed to  the loyalty he himself had shown presidential candidate Raimo  Ilaskivi as a model for others. [passage omitted]    Clearly annoyed, Salolainen further noted that it is very  difficult to lead a party in the current economic situation.  Here he compared his own situation with Prime Minister Esko  Aho's position as chairman of the Center Party. It is well known  that he too has come under pressure from Paavo Vayrynen, among  others.    "We are both better than our reputations, but envy and  shrewd  calculation makes people behave strangely," Salolainen said.    He went on to say that Aho is by far the best conceivable  person for the Center Party chairmanship. He also said he  sympathized with former Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman  Pertti Paasio. He referred warningly to the consequences that  ensued when the SDP decided to remove capable Paasio. The Social  Democrats are already coping with their third party chairman in  a short period of time.    Finally, he also accused "old journalist colleagues" of  conducting a campaign against him out of envy.  <H5>  Some Understanding </H5>   Despite the broadside against his critics, Salolainen also  indicated some understanding of the dissatisfaction that exists.  He conceded that he has recently been forced to devote quite a  lot of energy to the European Union (EU) negotiations, but  promised to begin devoting himself to preparations for the  parliamentary election as soon as the EU negotiations have  ended. Then the emphasis will be in the party sphere.    In view of the time that remains in the election period, the  party leadership has already defined its goals. Salolainen  declined to talk more about that yet. Proposals and demands will  be presented in good order later.    It remains to be seen if order has now really been restored  in the National Coalition Party. The party's parliamentary  representatives seem to expect that there will continue to be  internal dissatisfaction with the party chairman. [passage  omitted]</p>

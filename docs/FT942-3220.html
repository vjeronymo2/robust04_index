			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (13): Multimedia may give US an edge - Martin Dickson on the impact of the interactive revolution Many acres of newsprint have been devoted to the wonders of the impending US interactive multimedia revolution, which will supposedly transform Americans' home lives. Many telecommunications experts think that US businesses will be the first to want, and benefit from, some of the new services. And, since US telephone companies are leading the world in the deployment of the sophisticated new communications networks needed to provide these services, American business could gain a global competitive edge by early adoption of multimedia offerings. Perhaps the most obvious example is video conferencing. Equipment already on the market allows desktop collaboration - that is, staff in different locations working together to manipulate data, while simultaneously holding video telephone conversations. Their desktop computers need only to be linked by the twisted copper pair wire traditionally used to link telephones, though they also need to have narrowband ISDN, a relatively inexpensive technology which allows ordinary phone lines to transmit not only voice but video and data signals. ISDN is widely regarded as an intermediate technology, which will sooner or late be superseded by broadband fibre optic/coaxial cable networks allowing huge amounts of data to be send down communications lines. But ISDN and falling prices for desktop video conference equipment may at least establish a basic market for video conferencing services. The quality of desktop video conferencing pictures is still far from perfect (about 15 frames a second, compared to 30 frames for full motion film). But Mr Andy Grove, chief executive of microprocessor giant Intel, which has developed its own, relatively inexpensive video-conferencing system, reckons that the industry will get to 30 frames a second in a couple of years. He sees a substantial business market developing, since the video conferencing can save both time and air fares. 'The cost of this thing is demonstrably saved by one trip avoided.' US local telephone companies are now upgrading their systems to allow a much greater flow of multimedia services to business customers and home consumers. Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone company serving states from New Jersey down to Virginia, recently announced that it had chosen AT&amp;T's Network Systems equipment division as project leader and systems integrator for its Dollars 11bn broadband network. Pacific Bell, which serves the Californian market, has chosen AT&amp;T for a similar role. But despite these bold moves, the structure of the multimedia industry, and the telecommunications companies' role in it, remain far from clear. At present, America's local telephone companies - notably the seven Baby Bells spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in a 1982 anti-trust court settlement - have virtual local monopolies on telecommunications business in their areas, and charge long distance carriers like AT&amp;T hefty charges to complete the last mile or two of calls. However, both local cable television operators and the long-distance companies would like a larger slice of the vast local market, while the Baby Bells, which are barred from the long distance market by the anti-trust settlement, would like to break into that area. The local phone companies would also like to attack the local monopolies enjoyed by the cable companies themselves. But at at present they are forbidden by law from providing video entertainment services of their own, though they can act as conduits for others. There is one important exception to this: Bell Atlantic last year won a court case giving it the right to provide its own video programming. Following its lead, many other local telecommunications companies now have similar cases pending before the courts. But the cable companies, in a flurry of legal action, recently filed suits to have telecommunications groups barred from building video networks until the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the industry, imposes elaborate new rules on how these would be financed. The cable industry argues that the local companies will try to use their telephone monopoly profits to subsidise their multimedia infrastructure investments, with telephone subscribers left paying higher bills. Several bills before Congress could cut through this complex jostling for position as the two industries converge. Lawmakers in Washington are trying to impose a comprehensive multimedia framework on the nation, but it is far from clear that the bills will reach the statute book as lobbyists for all sides try to gain the upper hand for their industry. The legislation would allow new competitors, including cable companies, the right to compete with local phone companies and use their facilities to interconnect with consumers. Phone companies would be freed to enter the cable market. The Baby Bells would be allowed into the long distance market  -though there is strong disagreement over how quickly. The US wireless market, which is growing strongly, is also in a state of considerable uncertainty. Participants are anxiously waiting for the FCC to set a timetable and final rules for the auctioning off of licences for personal communication services - small, lightweight mobile phones which could provide a significant challenge to the established cellular telephone industry. The PCS lobby claims that further delays could damage PCS's chances of competing against cellular and other wireless technologies, such as enhanced specialised mobile radio. The FCC is widely expected to hold auctions next December. The only certainty in all this is that the US telecommunications industry is set to go through several more years of upheaval and consolidation as it experiments with the best regulatory and corporate structures for the multimedia age. But whatever emerges seems likely to have a strong competitive framework, which should be good news for business customers as it will hold down communications costs.</p>

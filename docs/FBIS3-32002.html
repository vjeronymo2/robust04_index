			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The General Command of the Haitian Armed Forces  [FADH] denounces the motive behind the 26 January statements by  by the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Haiti, which announce the  cancellation, over the next few days, of officers' visas. This  calculated measure is shameful blackmail aimed at destabilizing  another national Haitian institution and taking it hostage, the  General Headquarters press release adds.    The communique issued by FADH General Headquarters stresses  that the ideal of the Haitian military, nourished by the lessons  of its national history, is concerned with duty to country, thus  enablling the unified military institution to continue defending  the ideals of freedom, sovereignty, and greatness, which have  always roused the Haitian people.</p>

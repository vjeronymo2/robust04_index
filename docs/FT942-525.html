			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Caracas attacked over drastic powers Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera's administration was criticised yesterday for assuming wide new powers in an attempt to tackle a gathering financial crisis. The new measures, not yet fully defined, represent the strongest set of interventionist policies in Venezuela since the late 1980s, when the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez launched a series of market-oriented reforms. The measures include controls on foreign exchange transactions and on many prices of basic consumer goods and services, the suspension of certain basic civil and economic liberties, special 'bonus' payments to workers to help cover transportation and food costs, and stiffer supervision of financial institutions. The government also threatened to take harsh action, including fines and jail, against businesses found to be hoarding merchandise or violating price controls. The Caldera administration has been in a financial crisis since it took office in February, after the collapse of the second-largest Venezuelan bank, Banco Latino. 'These measures are the result of not wanting to face reality. They are focussing on effects instead of causes,' said Mr Jorge Redmond, president of Conindustria, Venezuela's largest association of private industrial companies. In New York, analysts at Bear Stearns argued that the controls were not welcome but 'may not be wholly negative, provided they are temporary tools'. They could help to stabilise the Venezuelan bolivar, which has been nearly halved in value this year and which the analysts described as 'oversold'. Exchange controls began yesterday with a suspension of foreign exchange transactions at financial institutions for five working days. The rules covering exchange controls will be defined in a joint resolution, yet to be announced, by the finance ministry and the central bank. The new price controls, to be defined in detail by the industry ministry, cover scores of products: basic food items such as rice, bread, sugar, eggs; other items such as soap, medicine, toothpaste, car parts, clothing, shoes; services such as electric power, gas, water, telephones, medical attention, funerals and dry cleaning. The third main element among the new measures was the suspension of some rights guaranteed by the Venezuelan constitution. These include three civil rights: free movement in and outside the national territory, the inviolability of the home and protection against unauthorised arrest and detention, and economic liberties, which cover the right to engage in any legal economic activity, the right to own property, and the control of expropriation by the state. Suspending these freedoms gives the government powers to deal with social disturbances and allows it greater freedom to apprehend speculators, hoarders, rumour-mongers and corrupt individuals whom officials have blamed for many economic troubles.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Japan's LDP fears for its cash supply: Company doubts over party donations JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party, out of office for the first time in 38 years, suddenly also finds itself seriously out of pocket. The country's biggest companies began saying yesterday that they were halting contributions to the LDP and its parliamentary representatives after learning that the Keidanren, the leading business grouping, was backing efforts by the new ruling coalition to clean up politics. The Keidanren is from next year to stop acting as a conduit of funds from its members to political parties, of which the most by far has gone to the LDP. Although federation officials said it would be up to companies whether they made donations directly, as many have done in addition, its move is influencing the private sector to scale these back too. Mr Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon, the camera and copier producer, said his company would halt all political donations. 'Nothing will change unless companies drive the political world into a corner,' he added. Officials at the country's big trading houses said they too were suspending contributions. The Keidanren decision cuts off an annual line of funds to the LDP put at more than Y10bn (Pounds 66.7m). With other corporate and industry association pledges it forms the bulk of the party's declared central funding of nearly Y30bn a year. Other corporate donations have gone to individual Diet members, most notoriously by construction companies seeking to ease the path to winning a contract or cut a way through a regulatory tangle. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, Keidanren chairman, in explaining the initiative acknowledged that the public believed the donations had bought Keidanren members favours from the LDP during its years in government, although he denied this was the case. His move, which comes as parliament prepares to discuss political reform next week, anticipates proposed measures to shift the basis of party funding in Japan towards donations by individual supporters plus assistance from central government funds. The Japan New party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, says a checkoff system of voluntary payroll debits is being examined, and that it would possibly offer tax incentives for those who sign up - the justification being that the system would involve citizens more in the democratic process. Its final form remains unclear, however, and is likely to be the subject of parliamentary haggling not only with the LDP, which will fight against any tough curbs on corporate funding, but also among the seven members of the coalition. One of its number, the Democratic Socialist party - which despite its name is a former close ally of the LDP - has also been a beneficiary of Keidanren funds, getting Y1bn a year. 'Underhand donations are bad, but it is not natural to stop legitimate donations,' the DSP complained this week. It and the Social Democratic party, which is more strictly socialist in nature and is the largest of the seven, are both suggesting that a new funding arrangement would need to be phased in over a few years. The SDP draws much of its funds from trade unions, and is willing to forego these only if it can be assured of an adequate replacement. Mr Hosokawa has pledged to enact political reform by the end of the year, paving the way for fresh polls next summer under a changed electoral system. Whether an alternative stream of funds for candidates to fight that campaign will by then be running remains uncertain. The LDP is additionally burdened with an estimated Y10bn in commercial bank borrowings used to help finance last month's campaign. 'Does it mean the LDP is no longer needed following the collapse of the cold war structure, even though the party has protected the free-market economy?' one unnamed party official was quoted as asking. Each year from then, party leaders would go to the Keidanren with a budget. This the federation would apportion among its members on the basis of how business had been for their company and sector - from each according to its ability, to the LDP according to its needs. Big business is likely to retain ties of a sort with the LDP, not least because the durability of the current coalition remains in doubt. But the severing of the party edifice from its financial plinth resounded in Tokyo yesterday like the toppling of a Soviet statue in an east European capital.</p>

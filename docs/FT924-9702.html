			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Ministers fail to agree on 2% pay rise ceiling THE OUTLINE of the package of economic measures to be announced in next week's Autumn Statement was agreed by Mr John Major yesterday as cabinet battles over next year's Pounds 244.5bn public spending total looked set to continue right up to the weekend. After a meeting of almost two hours yesterday morning, ministers said a cabinet struggle over public sector pay remained unresolved, with some ministers still pressing for a total freeze rather than a 2 per cent ceiling on rises, to free more resources for capital programmes. The cabinet will meet again tomorrow, but some senior ministers signalled that they expected to have to continue the discussions on Friday. Tomorrow's meeting is likely to be given an indication of the economic measures to be announced with the Autumn Statement, including rule changes on private sector financing of capital projects. As ministers began going through each department's spending programme, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was said by colleagues to be fighting hard to defend his Pounds 2bn-a-year budget for housing associations, pointing to a manifesto commitment to the associations' housebuilding programme. He warned the cabinet separately that too tight a squeeze on overall local authority spending would threaten a backbench revolt when the House of Commons votes on the arrangements for the council tax in January. Plans by EDX, the cabinet committee on public spending, to impose deep cuts on the defence budget hit strong opposition from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. In what a Whitehall insider described as one of a series of 'moving speeches' around the cabinet table, Mr Rifkind is said to have warned of the loss of thousands of jobs. Some defence-dependent companies might also be threatened. Others arguing strongly for increased allocations were Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary. Mrs Shephard is understood to be pressing for next week's statement to show the government launching a drive to boost industry. This would put the emphasis not only on capital projects, but also on her department's training and employment programmes. Unemployment and the pay of public sector workers were two of the central concerns raised with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in a meeting with representatives from the Trades Union Congress. After the discussion - the first official, bilateral meeting between the chancellor and the TUC since the early 1980s - Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, said union leaders told Mr Lamont that things were 'awful out there'. 'We told him that the government must tackle jobs and we must have a recovery, and he listened carefully,' Mr Willis said. In the 80-minute meeting, the union leaders presented their plan for economic recovery, and warned Mr Lamont it would be 'morally unacceptable' for Britain's lowest paid workers to be hit by a pay freeze. The government's plans to hold down public sector pay were challenged yesterday with the announcement of a 4.9 per cent pay increase for Britain's 42,000 firefighters. The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of local authorities, described the 12-month deal as the last of this year's public sector pay round. The government, however, is likely to see it as among the first of next year's wage agreements, and thus a test of its resolve on public sector pay rises.</p>

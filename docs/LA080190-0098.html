			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP AD ON S&amp;L CRISIS INFURIATES DEMOCRATS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE ENDS IN PARTISAN DISCORD. BUSH'S  HANDLING OF PROBE IS CRITICIZED AS RIVAL PARTY VOWS RETALIATION.  </P> <P> The National Governors' Assn. conference concluded here Tuesday on a harsh note  of partisan discord as Republicans and Democrats each sought to blame the other  for the savings and loan crisis.  </P> <P> The GOP got in the first shot with an ad taking up nearly three-quarters of a  page in the Mobile Register displaying photos of 12 present and former  Democratic congressman and senators over the headline: "These are the guys who  let the S&amp;L problem explode into a $325-billion national crisis."  </P> <P> Infuriated Democratic governors, gathered at a breakfast meeting to discuss  1990 campaign strategy, responded by adopting a resolution criticizing the Bush  Administration's handling of the savings and loan investigation and calling for  appointment of an independent prosecutor "to investigate charges of fraud,  mismanagement and criminal activities associated with sick thrifts."  </P> <P> Democrats vowed to retaliate more directly with countercharges of their own,  some pointing out that the party's failure to rebut Republican attacks in the  1988 presidential campaign contributed to the defeat of their standard-bearer,  Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. "Let's not make the same mistake Mike  Dukakis made in 1988," Dukakis himself told a reporter after the breakfast  meeting.  </P> <P> Some Democrats specifically recalled 1988 GOP charges that the crimes committed  by Massachusetts convict Willie Horton while he was on a weekend furlough were  a sign of Dukakis' permissiveness. Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste, head of the  Democratic Governors' Assn., said: "If there is a Willie Horton on S&amp;Ls,  it's Neil Bush," a reference to the President's son, who has been accused of  conflict of interest as a member of the board of directors of a Denver savings  and loan.  </P> <P> Earlier in the three-day meeting, Democratic governors received approval from  the association's executive committee for a resolution calling for creation of  an independent commission to investigate the savings and loan crisis.  </P> <P> Some Republican governors grumbled then that the Democrats were trying to shift  the blame for the mess from Congress to the Administration and were also  seeking to the give the impression that the Administration's handling of the  affair was faulty.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a modified version of the proposal was adopted.  </P> <P> Some Republican governors seemed pleased with the latest attack on their  Democratic counterparts. "The Democrats are the ones who are trying to make the  most political hay out of this disaster for American taxpayers," Republican  Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine said in an interview. "The Republicans want  to make sure people know there's enough blame to go around."  </P></p>

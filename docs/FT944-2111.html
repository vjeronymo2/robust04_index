			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Triple witching brings surge in Dow Wall Street US equities surged in extremely heavy volume as investors covered short positions during the afternoon's 'triple-witching' when options and futures on stock indices expired in the last hour of trading, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 41.72 stronger at 3,807.19, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 registered an advance of 3.46 at 458.80, but the Nasdaq composite declined 1.61 to 729.07. Trading volume on the New York SE reached 479m shares. The market bounced back to levels not seen since before its mid-November nosedive, with the Dow recovering more than 3 per cent of its value over the course of the week. Volume for the day was the third highest in the history of the NYSE. Trading activity was greater only on the two days surrounding the market crash in October 1987 when turnover surpassed 600m shares. Neither the stock nor the bond markets reacted sharply to data showing an unexpectedly large increase in housing starts for November. Construction of private housing grew by 6.9 per cent last month, against economists' forecasts closer to 2.0 per cent. The bond market was mixed in quiet trading, with the long bond outperforming the two-year note and helping the yield curve keep its relatively steep slope. The curve had flattened since mid-November, reflecting investor sentiment that the economy would slow. Analysts had attributed recent flattening to the prospect that the Federal Reserve would lift interest rates again at the December 20 meeting of its open market committee. The release of relatively mild economic news earlier this week, however, led investors to believe that another tightening was unlikely, causing a steepening of the yield curve and a rally in the stock market. Shares in US airlines were mostly down in the morning after a spate of separate incidents raised safety questions, although several bounced back with the market. Fears were already high in the wake of two recent crashes of American Eagle planes. Late on Wednesday the commuter airline cancelled all flights out of Chicago after pilots claimed that they were not adequately trained to fly in cold weather. Meanwhile, Tower Air acknowledged that several of its aircraft had been sabotaged, and the privately held Kiwi Airlines was grounded after it was unable to provide regulators with documentation that its pilots had received sufficient training. Tower Air was unchanged at Dollars 8 5/8 , Southwest Airlines shed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 and Continental Airlines eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 50 5/8 and UAL, parent of United Airlines, put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 87 5/8 . USAir Group, which has lost about 65 per cent of its value since the start of the year, was up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 4 5/8 . Canada Base metal issues were the stars and precious metal shares the weak performers as the Toronto market mainly failed to find direction yesterday amid the turbulent state of play on Wall Street caused by the triple-witching expirations. The TSE 300 index was flat for most of the day before ending a slight 6.30 up at 4,118.03, making a gain of 83.7 points on the week. Rises outscored falls by 414 to 364 after volume of 61m shares. The golds group dropped 1.88 per cent. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo closed 1.5 per cent up in nervous trade after players put final touches to their strategies ahead of Monday's options market settlement. The Bovespa index rose 750 to 49,177, and turnover was high at RDollars 377m (Dollars 444m) as a number of institutional investors reversed some box operations, a combination of two call and two put options. Analysts said the market's medium and long-term scenario remained positive and did not discount the possibility of a bullish trend after Monday's settlement. Lower nominal domestic interest rates, following falling inflation forecasts, were also expected to continue bolstering prices.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIL WAY: TRANSIT WITHOUT TEARS;  </P> <P> A VITAL DEAL -- AND TWO VITAL BALLOT MEASURES  </P> <P> Raising mass transit to the former glorious level of the beloved Red Cars will  be a long process. L. A. County transit officials last week took a big step  along the way, a step that could benefit commuters in every surrounding county.  </P> <P> After many months of negotiations, Southern Pacific Transportation Co. agreed  to sell or lease the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 245 miles of  valuable rights-of-way. Someday those rail lines will be part of the commuter  rail system that this region badly needs to help relieve increasing highway  gridlock. Southern Pacific agreed to sell the rights-of-way, and 190 acres of  adjacent land parcels, for $450 million, a bargain price 40% less than the  original asking price.  </P> <P> MAJOR ADVANCE: Specifically how the rail lines will be used -- where stations  will be located, for example -- is still to be determined. But by purchasing  passage rights along some very busy transit corridors, the commission has  filled in large gaps in the map of the region's hoped-for mass-transit system.  And from Ventura to San Clemente, most local officials agree that some kind of  mass transit must be moving along those corridors soon, or we'll choke on  traffic and smog.  </P> <P> Most of the rights-of-way covered by last week's agreement are old railroad  lines that SP doesn't use much any more. They converge on downtown Los Angeles  from the Simi Valley, the Santa Clarita Valley, San Bernardino and the  Westside.  </P> <P> The agreement will also allow purchase of a right-of-way to the Orange County  line that can be linked to 4.5 miles already owned by the Orange County Transit  District. That would open the door for major advances in commuter rail service  from the south. But there's a catch for Orange County: The $50 million to buy  the right-of-way and build the necessary stations and other capital projects is  in Measure M, a half-cent sales tax for transit and transportation projects on  the ballot.  </P> <P> PROPS C AND M: L. A. County was able to purchase Southern Pacific's  rights-of-way because voters assessed themselves a half-cent sales tax back in  1980. Now Los Angeles voters are being asked to enact another modest  transportation tax on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Proposition C would raise the county sales tax another half cent for  mass-transit projects. Under normal circumstances, we would be dubious about  another sales tax hike so soon. Unfortunately, the need is there because the  federal funds that once could be relied on to pay for major transportation  projects like the Metro Rail subway are drying up. If Los Angeles is to  maintain the momentum created by its new mass-transit projects, local residents  must do more to support them.  </P> <P> From that perspective, another half cent is a reasonable investment. Probably  nothing that has been done with Los Angeles' transit tax money -- even building  the Blue Line trolley between downtown and Long Beach -- will be as important  as developing these rights-of-way. By enacting Proposition C in Los Angeles,  and Measure M in Orange County, voters will help put these old rail lines to a  new use as quickly as possible.  </P></p>

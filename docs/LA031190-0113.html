			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY IS NORTH KOREA DIGGING?  </P> <P> Like moles who will not rest, North Korean construction battalions continued to  dig, dig, dig their way into South Korea. For all anyone knows, they're at it  still.  </P> <P> South Korean military engineers have found another tunnel running beneath the  155-mile-long demilitarized zone that divides their country and North Korea,  the fourth to be discovered in the last 16 years. Seoul says satellite photos  showing underground "axis lines" and other surface details point to the  probable existence of another 20 or more tunnels. It's known that North Korean  dictator Kim Il Sung ordered work begun on the project nearly 20 years ago.  Construction noises led to the discovery of three tunnels in the 1970s. After  that, North Korea invested heavily in Swedish excavators with noise-repressing  equipment, and work continued apace.  </P> <P> The tunnels so far found are anything but little shafts. Each is wide enough  and high enough to allow soldiers to march three-abreast without stooping. The  engineering difficulties involved -- the clandestine digging and disposal of  great volumes of rock and dirt -- were clearly considerable. In some cases the  tunnels burrow through solid granite; one runs as much as 490 feet beneath the  surface. It's a safe guess the tunnels weren't built just to keep North Korea's  troops out of the rain. Their only plausible purpose is to infiltrate commando  units into rear areas, either to wage guerrilla warfare or to support a frontal  invasion.  </P> <P> U.S. and South Korea officials take the tunnels very seriously, and so they  should. The two Koreas remain in the state of war that has existed ever since  Communist North Korea invaded the south 40 years ago. The tunnels are clearly  expensive, labor-intensive, time-consuming projects. That Kim was willing to  invest a lot of scarce resources in them is visible proof that his old dreams  of military conquest have not faded. It seems that, with all the changes going  on in the Communist world, Kim Il Sung's North Korea is one place where time  has stopped.  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (15): Video links 14 cities in China - News in Brief GPT Video Systems of Maidenhead is supplying what is claimed to be the first video-conferencing network in China. Fourteen cities will be video-linked in Hunan Province. 'The problem facing Chinese officials is the fast distances they have to cover to attend a face-to-face meetings,' says Mr Tom Doyle, director of video and ISDN systems at GPT. The Chinese network could also be linked with international, interactive video meetings with western industrial companies, he says. SATELLITE APPLICATIONS IN ASIA Research in south-east Asia has revealed the need for a new hardware-orientated exhibition for cable and satellite technologies, says Reed Exhibition Companies of London. 'Cable &amp; Satellite '94', focusing on the operational needs of business, will be held at the Hong Kong Exhibition Centre from November 30 to December 2, next year. TELECOM REVENUES UP 11 PER CENT Western European revenues from the provision of telecommunications totalled Ecu 102.1 (equal to Dollars 119bn or Pounds 79bn) last year - up 11 per cent on 1991, according to a new report from the London-based CIT Research group. But between 1992 and 2002, CIT expects an annual average growth rate of 5.6 per cent a year in real terms. Despite the big strides in telecoms network technology and services over the last 20 years, public switched telephony networks (PSTNs) are still the mainstay of European telecommunications. In 1992, says CIT, Ecu 83.3bn worth of phone bills were paid across western Europe - a sum equivalent to Dollars 97bn or Pounds 64bn. About 25 per cent of PSTN charges were for access (connection and line rental) and 75 per cent for calls. TREND TOWARDS GLOBAL NETWORKS British business is on the verge of 'massive worldwide networking investment,' according to new research among 100 leading UK organisations. The report, by analysts at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, found that 55 per cent of companies have international networking requirements, with the majority (67 per cent) wishing to link territories globally, rather than just within Europe (27 per cent), followed by the US (18 per cent) and the Far East (13 per cent). Alan Davis, managing director of Ascom Timeplex, a leader in the total networking solutions sector - and publisher of the report - says that the sharing of business information 'is not just from desk to desk or from office to office, but rather from country to country. UK companies realise that linking globally is a means of gaining competitive advantage in a worldwide market.' Research by Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton on networking market trends, established four critical factors: changes in voice management, computing, carrier strategies and user competencies - all of which impact the development of networking in Europe, the US and Japan in different ways. In the US, for example, most of the users in the survey had shifted a large portion of their voice traffic to virtual private networks, but in the Far East almost all traffic is on the public network. These differences, says Alan Davis, affect the way in which companies communicate globally and require network suppliers to have an in-depth grasp of networking across countries. Consultants Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, in another report on the business impact of 'wire-less' communications, say that 'companies know about that wire-less communications deliver real benefits, but have yet to be fully persuaded that the investment is justified.' Touche Ross believes that 'substantial growth will come over the next five years, driven by the development of applications that enable users to reap the full benefits of the technology.' The race to supply new global services: see page 7. NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES The development of wireless computer technology, as used in today's cellular telephones, personal communications systems or mobile radio systems, will create a new area of business and marketing potential, according to CSC Index, the international management consultancy. The forecast lists several areas of opportunity: first, is the 'migration' of business transactions - wireless technology will anable sales and service transactions to be made as close to the customer as possible, unlike most current transactions which have to take place at a fixed point next to a computer - for example, at the cash register, reservation desk or office. This 'untethered' communications facility is already being tested by an international airline in a roving check-in service for passengers as they enter air terminals. Their travel information is then entered into a hand-held computer connected to the check-in system over a radio network. Other areas for development singled out by CSC Index - a subsidiary of Computer Sciences Corporation - are the tracking and deployment of items in a supply chain, where trucks can tracked and goods 'tell you' where they are; also in 'turbo-charging' business organisation - speeding the administrative reactions to customers, suppliers or employees by providing on-the-spot response and acceleration of planning processes. The consultants forecast that by the year 2000 as much as half of all voice and data communications traffic could be via wireless computer technology. SATELLITE LINK FOR AUTO PARTS DISTRIBUTOR Dana Distribution UK, an automotive after-market company, has signed a contract with Hughes-Maxat under which all its 115 locations will be provided with a two-way VSAT (very small aperture terminal) network. This network links Dana's Swindon headquarters, its main UK distribution centre in Milton Keynes and 113 branches, and will carry all sales and inventory details on more than 40,000 product lines. POUNDS 4M INVESTMENT IN CELLULAR SERVICES Securicor Cellular Services is investing Pounds 4m to improve customer service. Research by SCS, the cellular service provider of the Securicor group, shows that while more than 85 per cent of customers are 'reasonably satisfied' with service they receive, the company aims 'to create differentiation through service delivery, raising customer expectations, industry-wide.'</p>

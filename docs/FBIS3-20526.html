This is the latest news provided for  reporters by the Domestic Trade Department.    Continuing to reduce materials distributed by the state  command plan. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, especially the last few years, the supplies  department has undergone a series of reforms, allowing many  capital goods to enter the market. In the past, the number of  materials allocated directly by the state command plan was as  high as 256. After years of reform, the number has been reduced  to 27. In 1994, the number will be further reduced to 10--steel  products, timber, cement, coal, heavy oil, copper, lead, truck,  electric wire and cable, and other. All products, except for the  above 10, will be allowed to enter the market. Even of these 10  products, the quantity, ratio, and variety to be allocated plan  will all be reduced substantially. The quantity of steel, iron,  coal, and other major supplies to be allocated accounts for less  than 50 percent of total such resources. The quantity of such  allocation will be reduced by another 20 percent in 1994.    Conscientiously strengthening the building and management of  the capital goods market. The Domestic Trade Department has  determined that efforts will be made to do a good job in the  layout, location, and building of national and regional key  capital goods wholesale markets. By the late Ninth Five-Year  Plan period, we should strive to build about 10 large  influential capital goods markets throughout the nation. At the  same time, we should speed up the building of several new  capital goods wholesale markets, do a good job in experimenting  with capital goods futures market, and ensure that each and  every experiment is successful. With regard various types of  established capital goods markets, it is necessary to strengthen  management and ensure that they are functioning properly.  Currently, efforts should be made to connect the network of  central and peripheral markets, and domestic and foreign market.  We should stress linking the network of Beiyang (Tianjin) steel  marke, expand the scope of influence, and develop the group  function.    Further deepening the reform of capital goods enterprises  and  creating conditions for establishing modern enterprise system.  Next year, all capital goods enterprises must march toward the  direction of establishing a modern enterprise system in  accordance with the demand of "clear property rights, definite  right and responsibility, separated government and enterprise,  and scientific management." The Ministry of Domestic Trade is  preparing to experiment with a reform in its subsidiary  companies that ensure the selection of managers and the  appreciation of capital. Under this experiment, all powers and  responsibilities specified in the "Stipulations" will be granted  to enterprises. All capital goods supply departments will do the  same. At the same time, efforts should also be made to  vigorously push the shareholding system and expand the scope of  experiment. Next year we should try to select as many as  possible high-return, strong, well-managed capital goods  enterprises to carry out the reform of shareholding system and  promote closed corporations where employees are shareholders so  as to speed up the transformation of mechanism of capital goods  enterprises.    Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure  the normal operation of capital goods market. Currently, China's  system is at a stage where the old is being replaced by the new  and China's economic development is at the stage of rapid growth  with soaring demand. Resources are relatively tight, market  development is very immature, and macroeconomic regulation and  control is particularly indispensable in regard to capital  goods. The supply and demand situation, price level, and the  direction of allocation of important capital goods needed for  production and construction all require macroeconomic regulation  and control. In the second half of 1993, when the capital goods  market was sliding, in order to support production enterprises,  state-owned capital goods enterprises procured and stored  800,000 tons of steel products, 40,000 tons of nonferrous metal,  and a number of automobile, thus making positive contributions  to the development of the national economy.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Dollars 47.4m at GWR LOSSES virtually doubled at Great Western Resources, the USM-quoted oil, gas and coal company which almost collapsed earlier this year following litigation with its largest customer. The group, which is based in the US, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Dollars 47.4m (Pounds 31.1m), against Dollars 24m last time. Sales were 44 per cent lower at Dollars 74.9m for the year to September 30. Losses per share deepened from 26 cents to 52 cents. There was no dividend. Mr William Phillips, finance director, said the increased losses reflected the impact of litigation and a Dollars 10.7m writedown on oil and gas assets. Mr Phillips said the litigation had depressed coal profits by about Dollars 15m. In the year just ended, the company had incurred about Dollars 1.4m in costs associated with the litigation. GWR planned a Dollars 34m capital expenditure programme in the current year, to be funded by revenues and existing cash balances. The group also planned to develop its main oil and gas asset, he said. The group was not expected to return to profit in the current year, Mr Phillips said. 'This is not just an overnight scenario,' he said. 'It will take a little time to rebuild.' GWR is still in dispute with its former chairman, Mr Dan Pena. The flamboyant businessman who founded GWR is suing the company over his dismissal in April.</p>

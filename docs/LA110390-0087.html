			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 46TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;  </P> <P> CHAIN LETTER CAMPAIGN AGAINST ROOS RESURRECTS TIES TO MORIARTY  </P> <P> A wildcat political action group has launched an unorthodox campaign against  powerful Los Angeles Assemblyman Mike Roos, flooding his district with chain  letter-style mailings that blast the six-term Democrat for a past brush with  scandal.  </P> <P> The group, calling itself Californians Against Corruption, claims to have  reached nearly all 65,000 voters in the mid-Wilshire district using a network  of volunteers who each mailed up to 100 packages of literature at their own  expense.  </P> <P> The group has filed no campaign statements and is not registered with the state  because it has raised no funds, its organizers said.  </P> <P> The two mailings, the first spread over several weeks and the second reaching  voters in the week before Tuesday's election, cast Roos as one of the "corrupt  politicians . . . strangling the effectiveness of government."  </P> <P> Both contain reprints of newspaper articles on Roos' involvement with fireworks  magnate W. Patrick Moriarty, who was convicted in January, 1986, on corruption  charges. Although it was disclosed that Roos, who is Assembly Speaker pro tem,  made a $50,000 profit on a Moriarty condominium project at the same time he was  pushing a bill helpful to Moriarty's fireworks firm, Roos was not charged with  a crime.  </P> <P> The letters urge a vote "for anyone but Mike Roos in November!"  </P> <P> Although most members of the group have declined to identify themselves,  leaders said they come from across the political spectrum and are mainly  businessmen drawn together by their opposition to restrictions on gun  ownership. They organized last year in response to the state's assault rifle  ban authored by Roos, said one of the founders, Manuel Fernandez.  </P> <P> The group's first mailing, which started to go out about 10 weeks ago,  apparently got a boost when a national gun enthusiasts' newsletter published a  how-to column urging readers to write the Pasadena-based organization for voter  rolls and basic literature.  </P> <P> After the article appeared, volunteers wrote in from all around the nation  requesting materials, Fernandez said. Each was instructed to reproduce the  10-page mailer, mail it in a stamped, hand-addressed envelope and return the  voter lists with the recipients' names crossed out.  </P> <P> Though Roos is considered by professional politicians to be unbeatable in his  bid for a seventh term in the 46th District, where Democrats outnumber  Republicans 2 to 1, Roos was apparently jolted by the letter campaign.  </P> <P> Roos appeared at several community meetings this week and met his Republican  challenger, Geoffrey Church, in a debate Friday, a gesture that is virtually  unheard of for an incumbent in such a commanding position.  </P> <P> Church said a Roos staff member told his campaign manager that "the phones were  ringing off the walls" over the letters. Church said he is not affiliated with  the group, although he supports its viewpoint.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Roos camp responded in a letter from the Los Angeles Police  Protective League, received by voters this week. It characterized the attack on  Roos as an illegal campaign by the National Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the NRA said the organization has no connection with  Californians Against Corruption and said the NRA's attorney has notified the  Police Protective League that its letter contained "actionable libel."  </P> <P> Neither officials of the Police Protective League nor Roos' office returned  phone calls from The Times.  </P> <P> Californians Against Corruption also denied any connection with the NRA, which  one of its leaders characterized as "a sporting club" that doesn't care about  rights.  </P> <P> Fernandez said the group is no longer motivated only by firearms issues, but is  taking on corruption throughout government.  </P> <P> "We started looking into Mike Roos because we wanted to recall him," Fernandez  said. "The more we looked into him, the more garbage we found."  </P> <P> He said the group decided to target Roos in Tuesday's election after conducting  surveys in the district that showed a high degree of voter apathy and a lack of  knowledge about Roos' connection to Moriarty.  </P> <P> Fernandez said the organization will continue to seek Roos' recall if he wins  and will target other elected officials it finds lacking in integrity.  </P></p>

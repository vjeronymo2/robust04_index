			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic from Rome for </F> Croatian radio]    [Excerpt] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs, who arrived in the Italian capital  this morning, has met Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Beniamino  Andreatta, his Italian host. Even though the two ministers had  talks behind closed doors for more than two hours, we have  learned from reliable official sources that their talks  primarily focused on ways of finding a political solution to the  crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina. It is clear that the  international community is interested in this. Europe is more  interested than the United States, on the one hand, and a group  of Islamic countries on the other, because the latter group  supports the lifting of the embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Croatian side said, therefore, that we support the peace  negotiations, but not to the detriment of the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian side also asked a question --  not only of the hosts but also of the international community --  on where Muslims had obtained the weapons for fighting Croats.  Did not someone give weapons to them, thus violating the  embargo, or maybe even use humanitarian convoys, Minister Granic  asked at a news conference following the talks.    He added that the figures on the alleged involvement of the  Croatian Army in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina were fabricated,  and that they were blown out of proportion with regard to the  HVO [Croatian Defense Council].    Italian Minister Andreatta said at the news conference that,  in line with EU [European Union] policy, his country was  insisting on a negotiated solution. He added that all three  sides should display more goodwill and that it was necessary to  achieve a territorial demarcation as soon as possible. In this,  Italy supports the proposals on access to the sea for the  Muslims and the setting up of an arbitration commission for  territorial demarcation.    Andreatta did not fail to stress that those who are most to  blame and whose share of responsibility is the greatest are the  Serbian aggressors, the initiators of the crisis. [passage  omitted]</p>

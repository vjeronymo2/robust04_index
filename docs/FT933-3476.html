			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Councils hit at plan to expand Heathrow PLANS TO construct a Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport, and government proposals to increase the number of night flights, have led to fierce opposition from local authorities near the world's busiest international airport. The London Borough of Hounslow yesterday voted against the expansion proposals, arguing that the plans put forward by BAA, the privatised airports operator, would create unacceptable increases in road traffic, aircraft noise, night flights and pollution. It said there would also be pressure for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow. 'The economic benefits of Terminal Five are outweighed by the disadvantages of the massive new development,' said Mr Bob Whatley, a Hounslow councillor. BAA is anxious to develop a fifth terminal to meet future air-travel demand at the already congested airport and to fend off other European competitors such as Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt which are seeking to challenge Heathrow's role as an international hub. Hounslow is the first of a number of London local authorities getting ready to fight a planning inquiry into the new terminal project which is due to start in 1995. The Hounslow move also coincides with a challenge by local authorities around Heathrow against government proposals to change night-flight regulations at the airport. The local authorities, including Richmond, Windsor and Maidenhead, Hillingdon, Hounslow, and Slough, have won a judicial review of the government proposals. The government is planning to introduce a new quota system for night flights based on the noise performance of aircraft, replacing the system based on a specific number of aircraft movements. The local authorities say that the new system would increase the overall number of night flights and cause more disturbance for local residents.</p>

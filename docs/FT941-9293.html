			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (2): Message from the sponsors - Kodak Kodak has been associated with the Olympics for many years, both as a sponsor and provider of imaging products and services. At Lillehammer, our ID system will help strengthen the security set up to safeguard the athletes and spectators at the Games. We will speed diagnosis and treatment of injuries by enabling the digital transmission of radiographic images. Our cameras will supply images which can be downloaded to a computer for viewing, editing and transmission - and our Photo CD system will store and manage picture files. Information is the breath of modern life. The way we communicate that information will either help or hinder the way we understand and assimilate it. This supplement has been designed to enhance our knowledge of the Winter Games and the ideals of the Olympic movement. We are delighted to be a part of it. Mr Anthony J. WaterlowChairman and Managing Director, Kodak Limited</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Birmingham Midshires rises by 38% to Pounds 24.7m Interim pre-tax profits at Birmingham Midshires Building Society advanced by 38 per cent to Pounds 24.7m following a rise in income and a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. While highlighting Birmingham Midshires' aim of acquiring other societies, Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive, admitted there was little immediate pressure on smaller societies to agree to be taken over. Net interest income rose to Pounds 46m (Pounds 43.7m), despite a narrowing of interest margins, as the society competed aggressively for retail savings. Sales of life insurance policies largely accounted for the rise in non-interest income to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 10.3m). Mr Jackson said expenses had risen to Pounds 30m (Pounds 27.2m), and that the cost/income ratio had also increased, to 51.5 per cent compared with 50.4 per cent in the first half of last year. The society was investing in a new headquarters and in upgrading its computer systems.</p>

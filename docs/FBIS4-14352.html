			<p>BFN     [Text] On the basis of a draft bill whose urgency was  approved in yesterday's Majles session, any change in the price  of goods and services provided by the government will require  the approval of the legislature.    On the basis of this single article bill, from the date of  the approval of the bill, any increase in the prices of goods or  services can be implemented only on the basis of the proposal of  the Economic Council and the approval of the Islamic Majles.  Any price increases that have been announced by the Economic  Council or any other source since the start of the current year  [starting 21 March 1994] will be null and void. If this bill is  approved, the government will also be dutybound to exert precise  supervision and control over the prices that have been approved  and should take legal measures against those who violate the  approved prices.    It should be added that on the basis of the internal  regulations of the Islamic Majles, the single article draft bill  on controlling the prices of goods and services will be  discussed and studied out of turn by the specialized [economic]  committee, and will be probably debated and ratified by the open  session of the Majles within the next 20 days.    According to some experts on economic affairs, the  ratification of the single bill article regarding the  intervention of the legislature in controlling prices will be a  way of expanding the scope of decisionmaking on the increase of  the prices of goods and services. Consequently, when necessary,  any changes in prices will be implemented after a deeper expert  discussion and on the basis of realities and needs. This will  prevent some illogical decisions that may be taken by some  executive officials regarding unprincipled price increases. At  the same time, this move to control prices in itself will be  regarded as a lever for controlling inflation.    It should be noted that the First Development Plan of the  country [which concluded 20 March 1994] was drawn up on the  basis of a balanced economy. In other words, the prices of  government goods and services should have been set at a level  which would, at least, cover the cost of the production of those  goods and services; so that, on the one hand, by lowering its  costs, the government could reduce its financial liabilities  and, on the other hand, those revenues [thus saved] could be  spent on development projects and investments in infrastructure.    Consequently, the consumers should pay an appropriate price  for making use of government goods and services, so that the  sick economy of the country will be directed toward recovery and  its structure will be corrected.    During the past five years, in order to implement a balanced  policy, economic programs were drawn up in such a way that in  the medium term to support the oppressed [poorer classes] the  level of cash payments and subsidies would be gradually reduced  on a balanced scale so that the consumers could adjust their  purchasing abilities with the prices.    In the same connection, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani has  explained the government policies on a balanced economy, and  stressed the need to increase the people's income and purchasing  power. He said: There should be a balance between the people's  income and expenditure, so that they will need government  assistance. Therefore, in the policies of economic equilibrium,  hand in hand with correcting the prices of goods and services  there should also be an increase in the purchasing power and  salaries of vulnerable classes. In the same connection, His  Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the esteemed Leader of the Islamic  Revolution, in his 12-point instruction to the government,  stressed the need for serious legal support for all the  oppressed classes of society in various fields. The esteemed  president of the Islamic Republic also described the achievement  of social justice as the main target of the Second Development  Plan of the country.    In any case, under the present conditions when our country  is  in the process of its economic reconstruction, the legislative  and executive powers of the Islamic Republic of Iran are  determined to pave the way for the achievement of economic  independence and public welfare of the Iranian people.</p>

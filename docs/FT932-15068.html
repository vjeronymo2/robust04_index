			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / An industry in great need of a holiday: Queens Moat has upset the UK hotel sector Mr Rocco Forte will today present the results of another miserable year for the UK's biggest hotel and restaurants group. Analysts who follow the Forte group expect him to announce a cut in the company's dividend. Expected profits of just over Pounds 70m compare with Pounds 190m two years ago. That most City analysts and journalists will be preoccupied with the financial crisis at the rival Queens Moat Houses will be a mixed blessing for Mr Forte, who took over from his father as Forte chairman last October. The positive side of the Queens Moat saga, from Forte's point of view, is that a dividend cut would now look like a financially prudent step at a difficult time for the hotel industry. The negative is that the Queens Moat crisis has cast a pall over the whole sector. Leisure sector analysts, many of whom had been positive about Queens Moat until the suspension of its shares on March 31, say investors are likely to steer clear of the sector. 'Hotels are in bad odour with the City,' says Mr Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson. 'I can't think of another issue in my career that's had the effect that Queens Moat has had.' Buoyed by rising asset values throughout the 1980s, many hotel groups expanded on the back of borrowed money. Whatever the outcome of the investigation being conducted at Queens Moat by accountants Grant Thornton, lenders and investors are likely to be wary about hotel groups' future growth ambitions, particularly with balance sheets weakened by diminished property values. That disillusionment, while intensified by the Queens Moat crisis, has been evident for a while. Groups with hotel interests, such as Forte, Queens Moat, Friendly Hotels and Ladbroke, outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index for much of the late 1980s and early 1990s, before plunging last year. Hotels have performed significantly worse during the recession than other parts of the leisure sector, such as foreign holidays. While the number of holidays taken abroad last year by UK residents rose to an all-time record of 21.75m, British hotels suffered the lowest occupancies in living memory. Mr Andrew Duncan of leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster Associates, says that while occupancy in London hotels rose 3.8 percentage points to 68.3 per cent last year, this compares with figures in the mid-70s in the 15 years to 1990. Although London occupancies rose as the year went on, the average room rate fell 3.9 per cent to Pounds 76.97. In the English provinces, occupancies rose slightly to 56.1 per cent from 55.9 per cent in 1991, but average room rates fell from Pounds 46.24 to Pounds 44.11. In Scotland, occupancy rose 2 percentage points to 63.1 per cent, while average room rates remained more or less constant at just above Pounds 46. When inflation is taken into account, all regions saw substantial real decreases in room rates. Even last year's occupancy increases are less impressive than they look, as 1991 figures were blighted by the Gulf war. Mr Duncan adds that hotel customers who have become accustomed to demanding discounts are unlikely to drop the habit as economic recovery gains pace. 'The discount culture is very widespread now. The buyers have got used to value for money over the past few years and it's going to be difficult to go back on that,' he says. On the positive side, Mr Duncan says that hotel groups have cut operating costs during the downturn and that any increase in business will quickly be reflected in profits. But while occupancies will continue to rise, the hotel sector's recovery will be slower than many in the industry think. 'It's difficult to see glimmers of hope,' he says. Even some hoteliers appear to find it hard to summon up much optimism. Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy Group, which earlier this month announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.43m in 1992, said only that 'there is a reasonable chance that 1993 will be a better year than 1992'. Some operators are more upbeat. The devaluation of the pound is bringing back American visitors, they say. British hotels are of far higher quality than they were a decade ago. Mr Michael Hirst, chairman of Hilton International, part of the Ladbroke group, says that unlike some consumer goods, hotels do not go out of fashion for good. When travel picks up, hotels do too. One of the most encouraging features of recent months, he says, is the increase in UK companies booking hotel premises for training programmes. 'Whenever companies start to accentuate training, it shows they're getting ready for an increase in business.' Mr John Jarvis, chairman of the privately-owned Jarvis Hotels group, says he sees no reason to revise his plans to take his company public within two years. He says gloom surrounding the industry in the wake of the Queens Moat saga will lift as summer approaches. Mr Jarvis says: 'I believe in six months time it will be considered a blip. This is a high profile industry and it gets far more than its share of attention compared to industries like engineering or chemicals. I can see us looking back on this time and saying, 'what was that all about?'' Mr Jarvis says his company's bookings by foreign visitors are up 28 per cent on last year for the period between now and September. Bookings by short-break holidaymakers in the UK are up 32 per cent. Mr Hirst argues that the level of discounting at any time is a reflection of the balance between supply and demand. When rooms are filled, hoteliers can afford to reject demands for discounting. If the tentative recovery in other sectors of the UK economy continues, hotels are likely to gain from the upturn. While the fax machine and the telephone have, to some extent, replaced the need to travel, the search for new customers and the re-establishment of links with old ones requires face-to-face contact. Even if the memory of empty rooms fades, however, the shock of the rapid financial reversal at Queens Moat is likely to linger on.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN STEPDAUGHTER'S DEATH  </P> <P> A Lake Los Angeles man has pleaded not guilty to murder in the beating death of  his 4-year-old stepdaughter.  </P> <P> In the same proceeding in Lancaster Municipal Court on Monday, the girl's  mother pleaded not guilty to child abuse.  </P> <P> William Sherman Welshans, 24, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Welshans, 23, are  charged in the Oct. 24 death of Christine Blalock, 4. They remained free on  bail of $6,000 and $3,000, respectively.  </P> <P> A preliminary hearing on the charges was set for Jan. 3.  </P> <P> William Welshans was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after his wife  returned home, found her daughter's body and called authorities, according to  court documents.  </P> <P> Welshans first told investigators he believed Christine was fatally injured  when she fell from a woodpile at the couple's home in the rural eastern  Antelope Valley. However, Welshans admitted to beating the girl with his fists  on the day of her death and during the previous three days, according to court  documents.  </P> <P> Welshans told investigators he did not mean to kill the girl and said he did  not take her to a hospital because he feared the abuse would be discovered, the  documents said. He told investigators he was under stress because of marital  and financial problems.  </P> <P> The murder charge was filed last week based on a coroner's report and  investigators' findings.  </P> <P> Welshans' $6,000 bail was set and paid before the murder charge was filed.  Prosecutors decided not to raise the amount because Welshans does not appear to  be a threat to the community and because the charge will probably be  second-degree murder or manslaughter rather than first-degree murder, said  Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley. The degree and type of murder has not yet  been specified, he said.  </P> <P> Welshans also is charged with child abuse.  </P> <P> Mary Welshans told investigators she left for work on the day of her daughter's  death, although she knew that the youngster was ill and that Welshans had  beaten the girl, as well as his 5-year-old stepson and the couple's  19-month-old daughter, according to the court documents. She said she returned  home to find Christine dead and Welshans asleep in another room.  </P> <P> William Welshans' stepson, who is Mary's son, and the couple's daughter have  been placed in foster care homes, authorities said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTE OVER TBS ABORTION PROGRAM  </P> <P> Re Rick Du Brow's Nov. 10 column about the protest against Turner Broadcasting  System's Dec. 7 documentary, "Abortion Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives":  </P> <P> The tirade by Nellie Gray of the March for Life and Rep. Robert Dornan against  Ted Turner's TBS channel station for not having a panel discussion after the  program is typical of the moral and intellectual dishonesty of the  fundamentalist/far-right movement.  </P> <P> Arguing that Turner is guilty of being one-sided, they conveniently overlook  how one-sided their own beloved Trinity Broadcasting Network is.  </P> <P> TBN broadcasts 24-hour-a-day, mind-numbing propaganda that exhorts viewers to  wage Christian warfare against society. It offers virtually no balance.  </P> <P> There is no "other side" for these "bozos," as Turner aptly referred to them.  Ted, bozos is too kind a characterization.  </P> <P> LARRY SIEGEL  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

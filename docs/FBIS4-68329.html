Yakovenko; UDC 528.225:629.783]    [Abstract] The Geo-IK satellites represent an important  stage in the development of Russia's program for studying the  Earth's gravitational field. They have been used to create  planetary models in the form of harmonic coefficients of  geopotential and in the form of a system of point masses. The  harmonic coefficients of the GPZ-90 model (i.e., Earth's  Gravitational Field for 1990) were determined with long-range  radio, laser, and doppler measurements from ground stations;  radio-altimeter measurements by Geo-IK; and measurement  information from the ground complex for controlling the GLONASS  navigation system; and average gravity anomalies for a 5 x  5 frame. The result was the GPZ.200 model, which enables  determination of geoidal rise to with an rms error of about 1.5  m. References 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

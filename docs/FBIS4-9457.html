			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 26 (CTK) -- "For the time being, it  will probably be more useful not to push for the principle of  exclusive membership -- allowing citizens to be members only of  a single party -- to be embedded in the law on political  parties, as time will surely solve this question," the  right-oriented daily TELEGRAF writes today.    Besides the question of the financing and income of  political  parties and the possible suspension of their activities,  exclusive membership is likely the most controversial issue  linked to the bill on people's associating in political parties  and movements, which is to be debated in the parliamentary  session which begins today, the daily states.    Coalition deputies insist that exclusive membership be  included in the bill, while the opposition opposes the idea,  arguing that the principle would violate the Charter of Human  Rights and Freedoms, TELEGRAF reports.    The new bill is likely to eliminate the possibility of  collective membership of political parties, which enabled  political entities to circumvent electoral law, especially  regarding the minimum percentage of votes required for an  election coalition to be represented in parliament, the daily  explains. It gives an example of the Liberal Social Union  (LSU), which acquired parliamentary seats in the last elections  though it associated four political entities and its share of  the vote only slightly surpassed 5 percent.    In the last elections, held in June 1992, 5 percent of votes  were required by law for a party to be represented in  parliament, while a coalition had to receive 7 percent of the  vote and more, according to the number of entities associated.    Government coalition deputies are afraid that if the new law  on political parties does not embed exclusive membership,  electoral law might be circumvented again. "Members of political  parties wanting to create a latent election coalition, will  become parallel members of a sort of an umbrella party to  compose a joint list of candidates," the paper writes.    Moreover, the advocates of exclusive membership argue that  it  would be "absurd" if one could be simultaneously a member of  such different parties, as the (extreme-right opposition)  republicans, the communists and the (government coalition) Civic  Democratic Alliance (ODA), TELEGRAF notes.    However, the Constitution clearly states that people can  freely associate in any groups, the number of which is  unlimited, the paper writes.    It is not necessary to re-interpret the Constitution and  push  for exclusive membership, as time will solve the question. "Now  most citizens are already reasonable and would not strive for  membership of two parties. In future, voters will prefer a  party with a clear structure which could embed exclusive  membership in its own statutes, to a party trying to gain  parliament seats at any cost, through various latent  coalitions," the paper concludes.</p>

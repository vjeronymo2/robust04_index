			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Garel-Jones to resign as minister for Europe: PM's close ally to see Maastricht bill through MR Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister for Europe who has played a central role in heading off Tory Euro-sceptics' attacks on the Maastricht treaty, is to resign next year. He announced his unexpected decision last night, telling Mr John Major, the prime minister, in a letter: 'You have known for some time that I hanker after a change.' His decision is a setback for Mr Major who has suffered a bruising parliamentary session since April's election. Mr Garel-Jones is expert on the contents of the Maastricht treaty and, from his past job as a government whip, on tactics for its ratification by parliament. However, he will remain in office until the bill has completed its Commons' stages - probably in late spring. Whitehall colleagues and officials were adamant last night that Mr Garel-Jones was genuine in his wish to pursue other interests. In his letter, he wrote: 'I want to spend more time at home and in my constituency. I also hope to resume some of my personal interests - even perhaps buy some more pictures.' Before joining the Foreign Office in 1990 he was a government whip for eight years, often working gruelling hours. He remains MP for Watford. For anti-Maastricht MPs his decision was not a cause for regret. Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford, said Mr Garel-Jones was a 'formidable adversary'. The timing of the announcement suggests that Mr Garel-Jones, who appeared unlikely to secure one of the top Cabinet jobs, wanted to make clear his determination to step down. It reinforced signals from Downing Street that no reshuffle of Cabinet or other ministerial posts is imminent. Mr Garel-Jones told the prime minister in 1991 that he wanted to return to the backbenches after the general election, but was persuaded to stay for Britain's European Community presidency and the buildup to the Edinburgh EC summit. Replying to Mr Garel-Jones, Mr Major said: 'Your contribution at the Foreign Office, especially during the British presidency, has been immense, and played a considerable part in the outcome at Edinburgh last week.' Mr Garel-Jones has a low public profile, but is a close political ally of Mr Major. In the past year, Mr Major has seen two other allies leave Whitehall - Mr Chris Patten, now governor of Hong Kong, and Mr David Mellor, former National Heritage secretary.

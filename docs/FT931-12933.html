			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cut in UK base rates lifts Continent THE cut in UK base rates lifted many Continental markets, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw further bad news in the car sector depress prices but overall the market was firmer and the DAX index closed 6.92 higher at 1,576.16. Turnover rose to DM5.4bn from DM4.3bn. Porsche, down DM24 at DM440, announced a loss of nearly DM66m for 1991-92 and said that it would make substantial job cuts. James Capel in London comments that the results 'underline the parlous state of the luxury sports car segment and, in particular, the loss of competitiveness on the part of the company due to a weak model range, poor productivity and the adverse effect of the strength of the DM'. Recommending a sell, the brokers welcome the appointment of Mr Helmut Sihler as head of the supervisory board but believe that it is too early to buy for recovery. BMW added to Monday's declines with a fall of DM4.50 to DM497, but Daimler, helped by good sales figures for Mercedes models, gained a modest 30 pfg to DM573. Volkswagen slipped 70 pfg to DM272.30. Elsewhere Siemens put on DM8.50 to DM607.70 after announcing new orders. PARIS featured Euro Disney which rose FFr2.70 or 4.3 per cent to FFr67.20 on rumours that a US broker had upgraded the stock. The shares had earlier fallen to a day's low of FFr63.20 after the company reported a loss of FFr492m in the first quarter of fiscal 1992-93. The CAC-40 index closed 12.60 higher at 1,792.55 in turnover of some FFr2.4bn. Elf came in with a 36 per cent fall in 1992 net profit which was better-than-expected and the shares closed FFr6.40 higher at FFr330.70, while Total improved FFr5.50 to FFr223.50. Matra-Hachette eased FFr7.40 or 7.4 per cent to FFr92.00 with some 3.2m shares traded on arbitrage related activity. MILAN finished a mixed session firmer after inflation indicators for January lifted hopes of a discount rate cut. The Comit index added 1.0 to 473.09. Firmer banks and insurers took their lead from a strong performance by Generali which rose L60 to fix at L32,600 before spurting to L33,550 after hours amid domestic demand from regional retail banks. Fiat, widely expected to post an operating loss for 1992 later this week, still managed a L9 advance to L4,295 at the fix before putting on a further L7 in late business. Rinascente rose L270 to fix at L7,735 before moving on up to L7,750 amid renewed speculation that it may be sold by parent group Fiat. Montedison dipped a further L35 to L1,181. It faces a demand for compensation by state energy group ENI over a former joint venture. ZURICH was mixed in fairly active trade. The SMI index eased 1.1 to 2,084.3. Insurers had a firm session on a view that the sector had recently been neglected. Participation certificates in Winterthur Insurance, SFr18 higher at SFr596, topped the active list. Nestle lost SFr15 to SFr1,065 amid market rumours that it might be planning a capital increase soon. After the stock market closed, the company reported a rise in consolidated sales for 1992 that was in line with, or slightly below, most analysts' expectations. SMH rose SFr40 to SFr1,525 when new buying set in after recent declines. AMSTERDAM eased, while Daf's scheduled announcement of its restructuring package was postponed. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 97.7 with many issues affected by the weaker dollar. Royal Dutch went against the trend with a Fl 1.20 rise to Fl 144.80. Hoogovens, flat at Fl 25.40, announced after the close that it would be increasing steel prices by up to 15 per cent from April. MADRID improved in late trading encouraged by a firmer bond market and the general index rose 3.13 to 233.23 in turnover of Pta17bn. Endesa rose Pta100 to Pta4,085. STOCKHOLM came back from early lower levels but the momentum faded in late trade. The Affaersvarlden rose 3.8 to 896.2 in heavy trading. The forestry sector turned lower after Stora announced a preliminary 1992 loss of SKr1.4bn. Stora's B-shares closed SKr7 down at SKr263.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 26                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1077.93     1079.55     1080.84     1082.73 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1151.29     1155.02     1155.75     1157.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1084.45     1085.58     1084.91     1084.24 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1157.77     1157.18     1157.83     1156.52  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 25    Jan 22    Jan 21    Jan 20    Jan 19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1077.68   1091.64   1091.44   1091.84   1090.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1146.87   1156.91   1154.96   1153.29   1155.89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1086.43 ; 200 - 1161.02 Low/day: 100 - 1077.91  200 - 1150.40  .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

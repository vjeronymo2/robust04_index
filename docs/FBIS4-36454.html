			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qasim al-Ma'mar] </F>   [Text] Our righteous peasants and farmers are making  greater efforts in the general national campaign to harvest  wheat and barley in all parts of the country.    Sajar Zubayr Ja'atah, president the General Federation of  Cooperative Peasant Societies, told AL-THAWRAH: The necessary  measures have been taken to bring this campaign to a successful  conclusion. Supervisory committees have been set up and  Executive Bureau members have been appointed in various  governorates to coordinate with the local federation branches  and unions on how to overcome any obstacles facing the campaign.    Ja'atah added: Priority has been given to the manual  harvesting of small plots belonging to families of martyrs,  POW's, and the missing in action. The mechanized harvesting of  large areas of wheat and barley is continuing at the same time.    Ja'atah called on peasants and farmers to work to complete  the harvest by the established deadlines, avoid waste, sell all  their crops to the receiving stores, centers, and silos, and  block those who tamper with prices and those who hesitate to  market their crop.    The president of the federation praised the unlimited care  and attention given by the beloved leader of the people Saddam  Husayn to the agricultural sector. He pointed out that  meritorious prizes and rewards will be given to outstanding  peasants in the harvest and marketing operations, according to  the rules.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Housing: good and bad IS THERE a ray of sunshine in the housing market? National Westminster Bank believes so. It says estate agents have indicated an increase in activity and a rise in mortgage applications in the first two months of 1992. The hard news from the market is still bad. This week, two house price indices showed that prices are falling steeply. Nationwide's index revealed a 1.2 per cent fall in February and an overall drop of 4.1 per cent since February 1991. Halifax came up with a drop of 1.1 per cent in February and 4.3 per cent in the past year. Halifax agrees there are some signs of a revival - it would be surprising if there were not, with the temporary cut in stamp duty and the January cut in mortgage rates - and says it is now expecting small rises in house prices by the second half of 1992. Abbey National's chief executive, Peter Birch, says he thinks the worst of the depression in the housing market is over. He concedes, however, that repossessions will remain high throughout this year and probably 1993, and that this will dampen the market. While everyone is casting around for good news, any stirrings must be seen in context. There has been a 3.5 per cent drop in prices since November, according to Halifax. If lenders and the government had not stepped in, however, this monthly trend could have marked the beginning of a much more serious drop. And John Wriglesworth, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says none of the remedies tried so far will be enough to enliven the market. There is another option, though: increase MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source). In December, the Council of Mortgage Lenders put a scheme to the government which would 'front-load' tax relief. Under its provisions, first-time buyers would be allowed to claim relief on loans up to Pounds 60,000 instead of the present Pounds 30,000, but only for a limited period. On Tuesday, we will know if the chancellor has been swayed by their arguments.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jon Immanuel and Raine Marcus] </F>   [Excerpts] A man claiming to be a Fatah Hawk from the Khan  Yunus refugee camp said yesterday he murdered two Israeli drug  addicts in Ramla last Friday. Three other Gazans also  participated in the murders, according to a leaflet.    Fatah is committed to refraining from attacks on Israelis  under the Israel-PLO accord.    A man claiming to be Ihsan Farid Qaysi, 21, told Palestinian  reporters in Gaza that he left his ID card with the bodies of  the two Israelis to prove he killed them.    Hayim Weizmann, 30, and David Bublil, 44, were found hacked  to death in their Ramla apartment; the blood-stained kitchen  knife used in the killing was left nearby. Police also found  part of an identity card belonging to a Gaza Arab, who security  services are still hunting. Nothing had been stolen from the  apartment, and a leaflet taking responsibility for the murder  was left there. [passage omitted]    A leaflet pasted on the wall of the Khan Yunus central  mosque  said that a group called "The martyrs of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish"  killed the two in revenge for the death of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish, a  Fatah Hawk. Troops killed Abu-al-Rish by mistake a few days  after he had surrendered and was released in November under an  amnesty offered to wanted Fatah gunmen. [passage omitted]    Fatah officials said opponents of the peace accord may have  been trying to implicate Fatah in the murder of Israelis to  destroy the peace process.    According to the ASSOCIATED PRESS, Fatah officials in Gaza  said they had issued no orders for any operation and any Fatah  activist involved was acting on his own.</p>

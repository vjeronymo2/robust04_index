Opposition newspapers, in  particular MUKHALIFAT [name as transliterated], present what is  happening as a sensation and maliciously hint that the  president's political party is not destined to be long-lived.    However, it is not a question of major political or  ideological differences. It is just that party functionaries in  the upper echelons have let themselves become embroiled in the  fighting that usually flares up when people display  irrepressible appetites. They are squabbling not in their  offices but in two popular newspapers, NEW AZERBAIJAN and SES  [name as transliterated]. The former has ambition, the latter  has accusations to make.    Deputy General Secretary Ali Nagiyev, who, informed sources  report, is the president's agent, has come under fire. He is  being charged with various crimes, which, observers believe, is  not that important compared with the fact that the republic's  largest political organization has unexpectedly started making a  show of its "internal feuding."    That will hardly affect the rating of the president-general  secretary. It was, after all, Heydar Aliyev's prestige and his  wealth of political experience that helped to boost the image of  the party itself. Admittedly it has not so far held a  constituent congress, although, according to some reports, it  has put together a fairly ramified mobile network of primary  organizations. It has none of the "dead souls" in its ranks  that are so widespread in the republic's other political  organizations.    It is deemed a matter of prestige to be a member of the  ruling New Azerbaijan Party -- its representatives are gradually  replacing former People's Front functionaries in leadership  posts. There is every indication that those who have ended up  unwanted are rebelling, trying to remove or compromise the  general secretary's most intractable associates. Amid this  hubbub a trend inherent in virtually all Azerbaijan's political  organizations is clearly appearing: Following the formation of  a new party the fight for power is stepped up followed by a  fight for prestigious posts.    By and large a trite situation that has little to do with  state organizational development or ideological support for the  democratic transformations in society being carried out under  the "president's program." In a word, what has happened had to  happen: The new party has been organizationally constituted,  without however being able, contrary to expectations, to take  the lead in society. That is one of the reasons for the  imminent split, not proximity to and influence on the party's  leader.    When assessing what is happening observers discern the  following important factor: The feuding is coming from outside,  with the intention of weakening the ranks of Geydar Aliyev's  supporters and making the party he leads a laughing stock. That  is just how the "newspaper barrage" appears, disappointing the  long expectations and belief that the avowed ideals are of real  interest to Azerbaijanis.    The party elders are making the most sensible suggestions:  They have asked the general secretary to put an end to the  growing strife and denunciations. However, things are being  aggravated by the fact that the political commission has not met  for a long time and there is no glasnost and collegiality in the  executive structure's decisionmaking. Moreover, leaders who  come after the general secretary in the hierarchy are sometimes  unable to control their own actions and emotions, causing mass  discontent among rank-and-file party members.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SELLERS' NERVES ALSO FRAY AS HOMES GO MONTHS UNSOLD  </P> <P> Buyers locked out of the Southland's pricey housing market aren't the only ones  under stress: So are thousands of sellers who can't unload their homes because  of the recent downturn in sales.  </P> <P> "It's gotten to the point where we can't even sleep at night," said Darryl  Jackson, who has been trying to sell his three-bedroom, two-bath Fountain  Valley house for nearly six months.  </P> <P> "I'll toss and turn for hours, and finally my wife will turn to me and say,  'Are you thinking about selling the house, too?' And this goes on, night after  night."  </P> <P> Jackson and his wife, Debbie, are suffering from what some realtors have dubbed  the "home sellers' blues" -- a sad litany of frustration, anxiety, desperation  and even anger.  </P> <P> It's a tune that's being sung by hapless would-be sellers in many parts of  Southern California, with backup vocals provided by millions of homeowners in  depressed housing markets across the nation.  </P> <P> Sleeplessness. Headaches. Upset stomaches and -- as one would-be seller puts it  -- "a general state of disorientation." Searching for a buyer in today's  sluggish housing market can be like looking for the proverbial needle in the  haystack.  </P> <P> "I think about selling my place all the time," said Diane Bever, an  advertising-sales assistant who has had her four-bedroom home in Whittier on  the market for nearly nine months.  </P> <P> "I think about it when I'm at work. I think about it when I'm cooking dinner. I  think about it when I go to sleep at night.  </P> <P> "It's all just sort of hovering there. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone."  </P> <P> Owners who put their homes on the market and then find no buyers feel many of  the same emotions as a woman who, after much deliberation, decides to become a  prostitute and then finds that no one will pay for her services.  </P> <P> Sound crazy? The analogy comes from Dr. Joyce Brothers, perhaps America's  best-known psychologist.  </P> <P> "It takes a lot of soul-searching to put your home up for sale, just as it  would to become a call girl," Brothers explained. "When you find out that  nobody wants your home or that nobody wants your body, you're going to feel  hurt."  </P> <P> Worse, Brothers said, the psychological pain can feed on itself.  </P> <P> "Your home isn't just your biggest investment, it's a reflection of yourself,"  she said. "When it doesn't sell, you start wondering about your taste, your  business acumen, your judgment. It hits all the sore points, and pretty soon  you're doubting yourself."  </P> <P> Too often, the self-doubt and frustration can cause marital problems.  </P> <P> "Frustrated sellers are angry at the world, and they want to place blame on  somebody for their problems," said Irene Goldenberg, a family psychologist and  professor at UCLA.  </P> <P> "You can't take it out on your (potential) buyer, because then you'd never be  able to sell your house. So you wind up taking it out on your spouse. After  all, the person that's closest to you is the one that's easiest to kick."  </P> <P> While even the strongest of marriages can be tested by a soft resale market,  it's even worse when a couple doesn't get along when they first put the home up  for sale.  </P> <P> "I had one couple that I had to keep physically separated or else they'd come  to blows," remembers Temmy Walker, a veteran realtor and president of James R.  Gary Real Estate in Studio City.  </P> <P> "When an offer was made, I'd have them both come down to the office. I'd put  one in the conference room and the other in my office, then I'd run from one  room to the next to iron out problems.  </P> <P> "They were going through a pretty nasty divorce, but the soft market sure  didn't help matters. I honestly would wake up in the morning and half-expect a  headline in the paper: 'Wife Guns Down Husband,' or vice-versa."  </P> <P> One key to psychologically surviving the task of selling in a soft market is to  know what you're getting into in the first place.  </P> <P> "You've got to realize that we're not in the kind of market that we were in a  year or two ago," said Michelle Walman of Century 21/Horizon Properties in  Culver City.  </P> <P> "You're going to have to price your home realistically, and you're going to  have to realize that it could take weeks or months for it to sell. If you  expect to sell it the first day you hold an open house, you're going to make  yourself crazy."  </P> <P> UCLA psychologist Goldenberg has another tip for would-be sellers trying to  keep their sanity: Separate the things that you can control from the things  that you can't.  </P> <P> For example, Goldenberg said, a good start is to mentally acknowledge the fact  that you can't dictate how many buyers are shopping in your neighborhood. Then  focus on the items that you can influence -- like whether the house is clean,  the yard is trimmed and the like.  </P> <P> "This will give you a better sense of being in control of your life,"  Goldenberg explained. "You'll function better if you feel like you have some  power over your future."  </P> <P> Barbara and Ed Ross, who've had their newly renovated three-bedroom house in  North Hollywood on the market for six months, said they've kept their sanity by  staying in constant contact with their real estate agent.  </P> <P> "He gives us updates once or twice a week on how he's marketing the property  and how many people have seen it," Barbara Ross said. "If he didn't let us know  what's going on, we'd go nuts."  </P> <P> "Nuts" is where Steve Gonzalez says he's going to go if he can't sell his  four-bedroom house in Lancaster soon.  </P> <P> He put the two-story home on the market a year ago for $199,000, then fired his  real estate agent and took down his for-sale sign when he couldn't get any  takers after six months had passed.  </P> <P> Now the home is up for sale again, but for $20,000 less than his original  asking price. Gonzalez hopes to make up for the difference by selling the  property himself and avoiding the cost of using a realtor.  </P> <P> "I've had a few lookers, but no takers," said Gonzalez, who restores classic  cars for a living. "Sure, it's stressful -- I've lost a little sleep, and I get  a little testy with my girlfriend.  </P> <P> "But hey, look at the bright side: I've lost 15 pounds since I put this place  up for sale a couple of months ago. Maybe stress isn't all bad."  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Gold Rising bond yields, a weak dollar and anxiety about inflation look like a sure-fire recipe for a rising gold price. Yet bullion has been stuck around Dollars 380 an ounce since the turn of the year. Part of the reason may be that the speculative funds which fuelled the gold rally in 1993 have switched into other commodities, notably base metals. Neither are the fundamentals of supply and demand as compelling as last year. The discretionary buying which buoyed gold in the early months of last year has fallen away. Purchases by Indian, Chinese and Middle Eastern buyers were all lower in the first quarter. The relatively smooth transition to democracy in South Africa - which still accounts for around one third of world gold production - has also reduced the risk of disruption to supply. Central banks have not been selling bullion on the same scale as last year, when between 500 and 1,000 tonnes were released. With around 35,000 tonnes in their vaults, though, the threat of liquidation is never far away when the gold price rises towards Dollars 400. Yet the biggest dampener on bullion is the rising trend in US interest rates, which has increased the cost of holding a non-yielding asset. If rising rates reflect real inflationary pressure that drag could soon be outweighed by other factors. The worst of all possible worlds for bullion would be if the US Federal Reserve has timed its monetary tightening just right. Rising real interest rates combined with relatively low inflation would be a powerful argument for lower gold.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: BELLFLOWER;  </P> <P> BAN ON SECURITY BARS FOR DOWNTOWN STORES UPHELD  </P> <P> The City Council this week upheld a 33-year-old ban on sliding security bars on  downtown storefronts.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to continue enforcing a zoning law that has forbidden  the bars since the city was incorporated in 1957. The issue was placed on the  council agenda after some residents complained about the bars.  </P> <P> Mike Egan, assistant to the Bellflower city manager, said business owners are  not allowed to use the wrought-iron bars on their windows because they  discourage business and hinder firefighters who may have to break in during an  emergency.  </P></p>

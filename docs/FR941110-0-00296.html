			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or thought to be extinct, plus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diellia erecta  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (considered threatened). The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including the above taxa, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In these notices, 11 of the taxa (including synonymous taxa) that had been in the 1976 proposed rule were treated as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Other than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mariscus pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N. kahoolawensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plantago princeps <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. p. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> acaulis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and var. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  queleniana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sesbania tomentosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. hobdyi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solanum incompletum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. haleakalense <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  all the aforementioned taxa that were proposed as endangered in the June 16, 1976, proposed rule were considered category 1 candidates on all three notices of review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  appeared as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neowawraea phyllanthoides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the 1980 and 1985 notices. In the 1980 and 1985 notices,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sesbania tomentosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. hobdyi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solanum incompletum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. haleakalense <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) were considered category 1* species. Category 1* species are those that are possibly extinct.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plantago princeps  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. p. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> acaulis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> queleniana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) appeared as a category 2 taxon and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neraudia sericea  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N. kahoolawensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as a category 3A species in the 1980 and 1985 notices. Category 2 taxa are those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Category 3A taxa are those for which the Service has persuasive evidence of extinction. Through taxonomic revisions, each of the category 1*, 2, and 3A taxa were synonymized under category 1 taxa on the 1990 list.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mariscus pennatiformis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyperus p. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bryanii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) first appeared on the 1985 notice of review as a category 1 taxon.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  first appeared on the 1990 notice of review as a category 1 species after it was rediscovered in 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having been resubmitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The findings were reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. The proposed rule published on September 14, 1993 (58 FR 48012) to list 12 species of plants from the Hawaiian Islands as endangered species constituted the final 1-year finding that was required for these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on comments and recommendations received in response to the proposal (see Comments and Recommendations, below), the Service now determines these 12 plant species to be endangered with the publication of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the September 14, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period ended on November 15, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper notices inviting public comment were published in ``The Maui News'' on October 7, 1993, the ``Hawaii Tribune-Herald'' on October 8, 1993, and the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on October 7, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received from three parties: One from an individual in support of the listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  but offering no additional information; one from an individual in support of the listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis, Adenophorus periens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sesbania tomentosa, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and providing information on the possible extirpation of the population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adenophorus periens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at Kane Nui o Hamo by volcanic activity and drought, and indicating that the actual number of plants of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sesbania tomentosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is more than 50; the third respondent provided information on three previously unknown populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sesbania tomentosa, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  one from the south coast of East Maui and two from the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii. The information provided by these respondents has been incorporated into this final rule. The information received does not indicate that any of these species are under less threat than previously thought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The threats facing these 12 species are summarized in Table 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

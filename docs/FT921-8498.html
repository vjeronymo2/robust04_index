			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Most settlements in January below 5%, IDS study shows MOST PAY settlements in January have fallen below the 'psychological barrier' of 5 per cent, making it unlikely that rising real incomes will help end the recession, according to a report by Incomes Data Services, the pay analyst. The IDS findings tally with the latest manufacturing pay estimates by the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation. The CBI says that average settlements in the final quarter of last year dipped to 4.1 per cent, the current rate of inflation. The federation says that in December the settlement average was 4 per cent. IDS says: 'Until recently the 5 per cent level tended to be a floor for pay rises. Throughout the 1980s, even when inflation dropped to 2.4 per cent in the summer of 1986, few pay deals gave increases of less than 5 per cent.' The IDS data show that three quarters of deals in January were between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent. But 'a growing number' were worth 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. A comparison with the beginning of last year shows that pay rises have in effect been halved. In January last year, with 9 per cent inflation, most settlements were in the range 8 per cent to 11 per cent. In January this year, when inflation was at 4.5 per cent, the majority of settlements were in the 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent range. Average earnings continued to rise at 7.25 per cent in December. The CBI says that settlements in service industries were running at an average of 6.1 per cent in the last quarter of last year. With much lower rises in the finance and insurance sector, however, the average level of settlements in the services sector could also start to fall. IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ASKS SWISS FOR HELP IN TRIANGLE INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> Swiss government officials said today the United States has asked for their  assistance in a probe of possible insider trading in Triangle Industries Inc.  shares in advance of its acquisition last November.  </P> <P> The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told Switzerland on Dec. 16 that it  suspected insiders were at work shortly before France's state-owned Pechiney SA  launched a $1.26-billion bid for Triangle, a major New York-based packaging  company, in November.  </P> <P> The Swiss government has frozen an unspecified number of accounts at Swiss  Volksbank, Union Bank of Switzerland, Banca della Svizzera Italiana and the  Vaud Cantonal Bank pending a formal request for legal assistance from the SEC,  a Justice Ministry official said. She declined to identify their owners.  </P> <P> The SEC had alerted France to a tenfold jump in Triangle share trading the week  before Pechiney's agreed takeover was announced. Pechiney paid $56 a share for  stock for which French investors had paid around $10.50 the week before.  </P> <P> Trade in Triangle totaled 200,000 shares for the three-day period between Nov.  16 and Nov. 18, whereas normal daily trading in Triangle shares on the New York  over-the-counter market averaged between 5,000 and 20,000 shares. Pechiney's  bid was announced on Nov. 21.  </P> <P> French regulatory officials investigating the case have said more than five but  less than 10 French operators bought Triangle shares, but have declined to  identify them.  </P> <P> Paris banking sources said Triangle buy orders had also been placed through  Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland on behalf of French investors.  </P> <P> The SEC and officials from its French counterpart, the COB, were to meet in  Paris to coordinate the expanded investigation of the trading.  </P></p>

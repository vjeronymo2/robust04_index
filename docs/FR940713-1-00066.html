Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 4 and 5 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437b, 1437c and 1437g) (the Act) authorize the Department to provide technical and financial assistance to public housing agencies (PHAs) for the development of low income housing projects, including the major reconstruction of obsolete public housing projects. The Department's regulations at 24 CFR part 941 establish: the requirements and procedures for the development of low-income housing (excluding Indian housing) by PHAs; development methods to be utilized for public housing projects; PHA eligibility requirements; the application and proposal procedures and other program requirements, which include a number of Federal statutory and administrative requirements applicable to public housing development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will in the future publish under a separate proposed rule comprehensive changes to part 941 that reflect the Department's redesign of the public housing development program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule is more limited and would only add a new subpart F to the existing part 941 to address the requirements and procedures applicable to the major reconstruction of obsolete public housing (MROP) projects. Section 111(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act) amends section 5(j)(2) of the Act regarding MROP projects. Section 5(j)(2), among other things, provides a definition for ``obsolete public housing project or building''; specifies that funding for MROP will be distributed on the basis of competition; and lists the criteria by which PHAs will be awarded funds. In accordance with sections 111(c) and 191 of the 1992 Act, which provide for rulemaking to implement section 111, this proposed rule would implement the provisions of section 111(a). The regulatory sections that would comprise subpart F are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.601. This section would provide that subpart F sets forth the basic policies and general requirements applicable to MROP projects. With respect to applicability, this section would provide that, unless otherwise stated, subpart F would apply to all MROP projects funded in Federal Fiscal Year 1995 and thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.602. This section would address MROP funding by providing that any notice of funding availability (NOFA) issued under 24 CFR part 941, subpart F, will reflect the current statutory requirements applicable to MROP projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.603. This section would describe the criteria a project must meet to be eligible for MROP funding. Some of the eligibility requirements, listed in this section, include the following: the project must be a rental project, and not a homeownership project; the project must have been financed under section 5 of the Act and be under an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC), or be a section 23 bond financed leased housing project which meets certain conditions; the existing project must have had an approved actual development cost certificate (ADCC) for five years before the application submission deadline; and the project must be determined to be obsolete. With respect to the determination of obsolete, the requirements of section 5(j)(2) of the Act, as added by section 111 of the 1992 Act are being incorporated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 5(j)(2)(E) of the Act, &sect;941.603 would prohibit MROP assistance to any project or building assisted within five years of the MROP application by Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) or Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) modernization funds under section 14 of the Act (through inclusion in an approved ``annual statement of work''). A proposed MROP which received emergency modernization funding within the time frame is excluded from the five-year prohibition stated above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.604. This section would address the limitations imposed on the use of MROP funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.605. This section would describe the general requirements applicable to the MROP program; these include (1) those set forth in subpart A of part 941, with the exception that MROP projects may only be developed by: (a) sealed bid method with award to the lowest responsible bidder; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) competitive proposal method whereby the PHA would execute a fixed price contract in which the contractor would be responsible for design of specific work items in the Request for Proposals, soliciting and contracting for construction work, contract administration and construction administration and construction inspection; the contract would either provide progress payments, or a lump sum payment after successful completion of all work; and (2) the requirements set forth in subpart B, with certain exceptions. With respect to the new MROP cost limit system required by section 5(j)(2)(D) of the Act, a methodology is proposed in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.606. This section would describe the application submission requirements of the MROP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 941.607. This section would address the MROP proposal and would provide that MROP proposals must comply with the provisions of &sect;941.404.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

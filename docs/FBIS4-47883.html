			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 4 SAPA -- Two hundred Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] instructors are  undergoing "induction training" at the South African Air Force  Gymnasium in Pretoria in preparation for the integration of MK  with the National Defence Force.    The South African National Defence Force's [SANDF] internal  communication bulletin this week said the two-week course, to  end on May 13, would enable the African National Congress  military wing members to give induction training to their  colleagues in assembly-point areas, "thus contributing to a  smoother process of integration".    The group is being trained in military terminology, military  law, personal financial planning and military etiquette,  including mess etiquette.    The bulletin said the course would overcome any shortcomings  in military skills among the trainees, adding that their basic  training might have been different to that approved by the Joint  Military Co-ordinating Council of the SANDF. "This will ensure  that they suffer no relative disadvantage in relation to the  members of the other forces involved in the integration  process," it said. "This is a pure orientation course, therefore  no formal evaluation will be done."    The bulletin said the trainees would be under the command of  the officer commanding the gymnasium and a high standard of  discipline would be expected. The bulletin also said other MK  members were being trained in ceremonial drill to prepare them  to form part of the guard of honour at the inauguration of the  new president on May 10.</p>

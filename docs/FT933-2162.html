			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Paris orders job cuts curb: Balladur demands redundancy reviews by state companies THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday ordered state-owned companies to minimise job cuts, demanding they review redundancy plans in the light of a five-year jobs package to be debated in parliament later this month. The plan urges employers to use short-time working, part-time employment and early retirement as ways of avoiding sacking staff. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, said public companies' redundancy plans would be rejected by the state if they failed to use such measures as fully as possible. Yesterday's statement followed a meeting of several ministers, chaired by Mr Balladur, which had been called in response to a wave of public sector redundancy plans. On one day last week, dubbed Black Wednesday by the French press, state-owned companies announced about 13,000 job cuts. The redundancy plans, which included large job cuts at Air France, Bull, the computer manufacturer, Thomson CSF, the defence electronics group, and Snecma, the air engine manufacturer, represented a serious blow to Mr Balladur, who has said that curbing unemployment growth is his top priority. The unemployment rate, which stands at 11.7 per cent and is forecast to exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year, is regarded as the government's biggest political liability. Last week's job losses sparked an angry reaction from unions who demanded a six-month employment freeze at public companies. Mr Balladur's orders immediately met with a favourable response from Thomson-CSF. The electronics group said it had started negotiations with unions yesterday to propose a cut in working hours in exchange for a cut in redundancies. The company said it might be possible to avoid all of the planned 1,600 job cuts due by the end of next year if the unions accepted its plans. Economists, however, were sceptical about the impact of Mr Balladur's statement. They said many state-owned groups had already received the go-ahead for job cutting plans. The government's budget deficit, targeted at FFr317bn (Pounds 36.1bn) this year, reduced its ability to support state industry and necessitated economy measures at state companies.</p>

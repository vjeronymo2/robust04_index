			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading trunk roads in Wales ACER CONSULTANTS, based in Guildford, Surrey, has been awarded the route study commission for the proposed dualling of the A465 heads of the valleys trunk road, between Abergavenny and Hirwaun in south Wales. The scheme, planned at an estimated cost of Pounds 145m, was originally announced in May 1991 as part of a Pounds 460m expansion of the Welsh Office motorway and trunk road programme. Acer's study will address the objectives of the scheme, which are to provide dual-carriageway traffic capacity by developing environmentally acceptable and safe proposals. The timing of construction will also be considered and the study will advise on priorities and whether the work should be phased. The study includes a section with particularly difficult topographical, geotechnical and environmental problems in the Clydach Gorge, between Abergavenny and Brynmawr, where it also passes through the Brecon Beacons National Park. This area contains a number of sites of special scientific interest and a national nature reserve, as well as limestone caves, woodland, landscape protection areas and sites of archaeological value.</p>

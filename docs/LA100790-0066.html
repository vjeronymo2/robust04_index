			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE CREEPS BACK INTO WEST BEIRUT  </P> <P> Night life is creeping back to once glamorous West Beirut, for years a hotbed  of street battles, kidnapings and terror, as war-weary Lebanese look for some  fun.  </P> <P> "Lebanese are aggressive and unpredictable people. You can't tie them to their  TV set. . . . They want to go out and mix. Just give them peace and quiet and  they will surprise you," said restaurant owner Chafic Abi Aad.  </P> <P> His pancake house is one of a score of inexpensive restaurants to open on the  strength of better security in mainly Muslim West Beirut and a desire for fun  among Lebanese -- regardless of the damage to their inflation-hit wallets.  </P> <P> "Just last summer I used to go around the city without finding a single crowded  restaurant among the eight or nine still open at the time," said Walid Sultani,  owner of a new restaurant in the chic Verdun area of West Beirut.  </P> <P> "Now with about 20 new restaurants opening in the area over the past three  months, you can't find an empty seat on a Saturday night."  </P> <P> Incomes in Lebanon, where 15 years of civil war destroyed much of the economy,  have been hit by soaring inflation, which bankers estimate at 150% in the last  six weeks.  </P> <P> The Lebanese pound has taken a severe battering. Before the war began in 1975,  the dollar was worth 2.5 Lebanese pounds. Now it is worth about 900 and the gap  is widening.  </P> <P> But many residents say they are so tired of war that the expense of eating out  is secondary.  </P> <P> "After spending so many months in the shelters, I am not going to stay at home  now. I will go out no matter what the prices are," said Karim Marrouche, a  political science student at Beirut University College.  </P> <P> "Lebanese don't carry a calculator with them all the time and count how much  they are left with at the end of the month. . . . They just want to have fun,"  said Abu Ghazale, owner of a pizza house in West Beirut's Makhoul Street.  </P> <P> "If prices keep increasing, people will cut on saving and other expenses to go  out -- especially for food."  </P> <P> Beirut was famous for its varied cuisine and night life until the war emptied  the restaurants, nightclubs and hotels, which had been frequented by tens of  thousands of tourists a year.  </P> <P> Lebanon's lifestyle crumbled and West Beirut, the main attraction, became a  haven for assassins, kidnapers and gunmen who looted its tourist area and for  three years transformed it into a battleground.  </P> <P> Fear kept people indoors and by night West Beirut was a ghost town.  </P> <P> Security has improved since a cease-fire in September, 1989, ended six months  of savage artillery duels across the city divide between troops of Christian  Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian forces and their local Muslim allies.  </P> <P> "At least we can go out without being afraid a shell will hit us or militiamen  will attack us," said law student Kamal Hattoum.  </P></p>

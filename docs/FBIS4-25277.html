			<p>BFN     [Text] Dhaka, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Nearly 60 participants  from 10 Asian countries gathered here from June 7 to 8 to attend  a workshop on human development report 1994 of the United  Nations Development Program (UNDP). [sentence as received]    The workshop was aimed to collect suggestions and opinions  for the world summit for social development which is set to meet  in Copenhagen in March 1995, according to UNDP officials.    At the two-day meeting, the participants from Bangladesh,  China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia,  Sri Lanka and the Philippines agreed that the post-Cold War  world is still facing the two major issues -- peace and  development.    They held that without peace, there may be no development,  while without development, peace is threatened, and for this  purpose, the UN system requires a clearer mandate, integrated  policy frameworks and additional resources.    According to the meeting, the UNDP, in its 1994 report, has  explored the new frontiers of human security in the daily life  of the people.    The report says that behind the blaring headlines of the  world's many conflicts and emergencies, there lies a silent  crisis -- a crisis of underdevelopment, of global poverty, of  ever-mounting population pressure, of thoughtless degradation of  environment.    During the discussions, the participants said both the  developing countries and developed countries are facing their  own problems.    For the developing nations, their top task is to develop  their own economy self-reliantly in accordance with the  practical situation so as to bolster the development of  education, healthcare and social security sectors, they insisted.    Yang Qingwei, an official from China's State Commission for  Planning who participated in the workshop, said that China is  facing problems similar to those of other developing countries  in the human development field.    Since China adopted the reform and opening policy 15 years  ago, the country has achieved remarkable progress in developing  its economy, which has consequently boosted the social  development, Yang noted.    He said China should gradually improve the internal  mechanism  of social development through strengthening the macro-control  over its economy while pushing forward the development of the  education, healthcare and social security sectors in a bid to  meet the requirements of forming a market economy in the country.</p>

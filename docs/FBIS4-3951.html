			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan has decided to  sign government procurement agreements with contracting parties  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year  in order to facilitate its entry into the Geneva-based world  trade regulating body.    The cabinet-level GATT task force gave the green light to  the  plan late Friday [22 April]. The task force comprises officials  from the Council for Economic Planning and Development and the  Ministry of Economic Affairs.    Previously, Taiwan rejected such agreements because of the  great number of state organizations involved.    Although the government agreed to the plan, it will seek to  exclude the International Telecommunications Administration,  Taiwan Power Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., and China Steel  Corp. from the procurement agreements, informed sources said.    Abrupt market opening might trigger unfair competition and  thus adversely affect these state-run companies, the sources  noted.    Under the new plan, they pointed out, the government will  substantially revise its current procurement practices to come  into line with the GATT codes.    For example, they elaborated, the base price for open  tenders  will be lowered from the current NT$ [New Taiwan dollars] 50  million (U.S.$1.88 million) to NT$4.7 million (U.S.$177,000).    Moreover, all the bidding procedures will be completely open  and transparent, they said.    Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September  1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.  All GATT signatories are set to become members of the World  Trade Organization, which will be given tougher enforcement  powers to supersede GATT and will start operations between  January and July next year.</p>

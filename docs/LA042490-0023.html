			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED STATES' ROLE IN TERRORISM BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Freed, referring to the 1954 overthrow of the government by the military, fails  to mention that it was the CIA that overthrew this fledgling democracy. Its  president, Jacobo Arbenz, was implementing desperately needed agrarian reform  (something like 2% of the population own 70% of the land), and in 1954 that  sounded too much like communism.  </P> <P> This snuffing out of agrarian reform coupled with the continuing fight against  so-called international communism has brought about the near-genocide of the  Mayan people who comprise two-thirds of the Guatemalan population. The Mayans  are inheritors of a rich civilization that goes back more than 3,000 years.  </P> <P> Since the military assumed power in 1954, they have brutally killed and  massacred more than a 100,000 Indians who live in the Highlands where the  insurgents make their camps; 440 Mayan villages have been destroyed while many  others are in ruins without potable water; 50% of Mayan children die before  they reach 5 years old; 150,000 refugees live in United Nations camps across  the border. Disappearances continue, and death squads operate with impunity.  Torture is practiced as a profession in the military.  </P> <P> The U.S. should discontinue all military aid to Guatemala, which is conducting  a war against its own indigenous people. In Guatemala, communism and drugs are  not the enemy, poverty is.  </P> <P> ROBIN WALLACE  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

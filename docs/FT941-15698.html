			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcoa of Australia posts 50% profit rise Alcoa of Australia, the alumina producer owned by Aluminum Company of the US and Melbourne-based Western Mining Corporation, yesterday reported a 50.4 per cent surge in profits after tax but before abnormal items for 1993, to ADollars 389.4m (USDollars 268.69m). Earlier, its US parent reported a loss of USDollars 16.7m, or 28 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, blaming a continued fall in prices for primary aluminium and aluminium sheet used for drinks cans. Alcoa of Australia warned that the outlook for 1994 was far less encouraging. 'The prolonged recession, inventory problems in the industry and consequent depressed alumina and aluminium prices present a very difficult start to 1994,' it said. Inter-government negotiations over how to deal with the industry's over-production problems are expected to take place in Brussels next week; weak demand and increased aluminium exports from Russia have sent prices tumbling to record lows in recent years. Alcoa of Australia's progress last year came on sales revenue virtually static in domestic dollar terms, ADollars 2.19bn against ADollars 2.17bn last time. However, the company said that this masked higher shipments and a lower exchange rate. Export revenue totalled ADollars 1.87bn, compared with ADollars 1.85bn in the previous year. At the operating profit level, the company saw a 35.3 per cent improvement to ADollars 584.8m, helped by improvements in productivity and lower raw material costs. After tax and abnormal items, which generated a tax-related gain of ADollars 59.7m, Alcoa's profit reached ADollars 449.1m, compared with ADollars 258.9m last time. In the final quarter of the year, net profit after tax reached ADollars 88.9m, against ADollars 55.3m, but Alcoa said the alumina production rate was cut by 6 per cent during the period because of decreased demand. This, in turn, raised unit costs.</p>

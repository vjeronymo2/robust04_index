			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government and the National Transportation  Coordinating Board reached an agreement early today, thus fuel  supplies are expected to return to normal in the next few hours  and suburban transportation to resume.    President Ramiro De Leon Carpio confirmed that the  transportation workers accepted the conditions proposed by the  government.    [Begin De Leon recording] Yesterday they accepted the  government economic policy proposed by the president. The only  [words indistinct] is that today we will issue the respective  agreements, but they accepted the economic policy. The CNT  accepted the proposals and tariffs we presented, so we are  satisfied because the problem has been resolved. There will be  no strike. At this time today they must inform their members  and transportation workers that the problem has been resolved.  This is one less problem for the country. We are extremely  pleased to see that the government's firm position was accepted,  as the government's position must be and will be accepted when  we are facing problems that require state decisions.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn has received a cable  from Shaykh As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, amir of the Islamic Jihad  Movement-Bayt al-Maqadis on the third anniversary of the  U.S.-Zionist military aggression against Iraq.    The cable says: The Jihad Movement has devoted its utmost  efforts, both in terms of funds and personal sacrifice, for the  sake of raising the flag of God is great. You were the warrior  who carried that flag to confront the gathering of infidels, who  advanced from various parts of the world in order to extinguish  the torch of freedom burning on the Land of the Two Rivers and  to subjugate Iraq just as they have subjugated other Arab and  Muslim rulers, who now rush to the Black House in Washington in  order to request mercy and pardon and to receive the infidels'  instructions to strike at our peoples and to mortage their  honour and dignity in return for a cheap livelihood and the  existence of a feeble, powerless rule.    The cable adds: The Mother of Battles was like the Mu'tah  battle in which the Muslims faced the Romans in Greater Syria  [Bilad al-Sham] under the command of Zayd Bin-Harithah, Ja'far  Bin-Abi-Talib, and 'Abdallah Bin-Rawahah, may God rest their  souls in peace. Later, the command was passed to Khalid  Bin-al-Walid, may God rest his soul in peace, who maneuvered and  then withdrew. The Mother of Battles was also like the battle  of the Prophet's grandson, al- Husayn, peace be upon him, who  faced injustice without surrendering. Al-Husayn preferred to  meet his God and enter paradise than live a luxurious life and  remain silent toward injustice and the unjust ones. There was  no parity in arms and men. There was only dependence on God and  whatever means of confrontation were available.    There can be no comparison between spiritual and material  values. Spiritual values are linked to God, and fate is ordained  in God's Holy Book and in the traditions of His prophet. So  those who faced the world with its Persian and Roman empires  with the spirit of Jihad faced death for the sake of God. They  were not afraid of the enemy's superior power.    The nation looks up at you while you still stand lofty,  telling free men that Palestine is still Arab. You are the only  one among the rulers still considering Palestine Arab. The  rulers calmed down and were therefore humbled. They removed  Palestine from the nation's map and geography. Damn them. The  nation still has men who can achieve glories. The United States  will vanish and God's order will prevail, whether the infidels  like it or not.    The cable continues: During the immortal Mother of Battles  we smelt the fragrance of history, recalling Muslim victories in  Palestine and visualizing the armies of Khalid-Bin-al-Walid  crossing the Syrian Desert to al-Yarmuk on the approaches of  Palestine.    May God grant victory to Iraq. May God make the Holy Koran  your guardian. May God make you the rightly guided leader. May  the traditions of God's prophet be your torch with which to  extinguish the fire of hatred and Mazdaism. Please, your  excellency, accept from the Palestinian people's mujahidin their  blessings and prayers for your steadfastness in the face of the  enemies. Victory will come soon after the removal of the  blockade and its unjust tools. God is all-powerful.</p>

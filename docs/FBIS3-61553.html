			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E. B. Renard, A. A. Chizhov, V. S. Vlasov, and </F> A. M. Rozen; UDC 546.791.6+546.799.4]    [Abstract] The purpose of the present work is to provide a  simple mathematical description of all known data on the  distribution of uranium and plutonium in the PUREX process  suitable for optimizing the treatment of spent nuclear fuel  (including uranium-plutonium, i.e. systems with high  concentrations of plutonium). Virtually all experimental data on  the distribution of U(VI) and Pu(IV) aqueous nitrate solutions  and 30 percent TBF (tributyl phosphate) in n-paraffins were  processed. The data are presented as regressive relationships of  distribution coefficients to component concentration. Accuracy  is 8 percent. References 11: 5 Russian, 6 Western.</p>

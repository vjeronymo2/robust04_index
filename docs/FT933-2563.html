			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts upset by short squeeze in futures market UK GILTS dropped nearly a point but recovered to end slightly higher, due to a short squeeze in the futures market. However, traders reported little buying on the lows, with international investors deterred by sterling weakness and sentiment subdued by the inflation spectre. Gilts are still 'trading on far too optimistic an outlook on inflation,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of international bond research at Yamaichi, who sees further downside for gilts. Expectations of an auction announcement by the Bank of England today also dampened interest in the cash market. Opinion remains split on the likely maturity of the issue, with some traders betting on 2004 but others calling for ultra-long dated debt. FRENCH government bonds ended the day mixed, with 10-year bonds slightly higher but 30-year bonds lower. Traders remain frustrated by the uncertain outlook for French interest-rate easing and were little surprised by the Bank of France's decision to leave its 6.75 per cent repo rate unchanged at yesterday's open-market operation. The key event today will be the release of gross domestic product data, which are expected to show a 0.2 per cent decline in the second quarter. DANISH government bonds eased about  1/4 point despite the central bank's latest rate cuts. The Bank of Denmark cut its key deposit rates to 8.75 per cent from 9.25 per cent and its two-week repo rate to 9.5 per cent from 10 per cent. While the Danish krone firmed on the news, 10-year bonds dropped by more than  1/2 point before recouping some of their losses. According to Mr Richard Gilhooly, international economist with Kidder Peabody, liquidity pressures prevented the rate cuts from feeding into money market rates, which remain above 10 per cent. This means that it is expensive for traders to finance bond positions. Traders reported a large seller of 10-year bonds in London, which further depressed prices. GERMAN bonds were less volatile but outperformed most other markets, with the bund contract ending  1/4 point higher on a late squeeze in the futures pits. Sentiment was also boosted by the Bundesbank's latest monthly report. While the central bank reaffirmed its cautious easing stance, it said money supply growth was set to slow. Analysts also welcomed its statement that western German inflation rose by 2.5 per cent on a three-month annualised basis. JAPANESE government bonds eased again, mainly over disappointment that the government's latest fiscal package was not accompanied by a cut in the 2.5 per cent official discount rate. Analysts expect the Bank of Japan to monitor the currency's reaction to the package for a while before easing, but most expect the cut to be imminent. US Treasuries continued to trade in a volatile fashion yesterday morning, posting modest early gains at the long end of the market before selling in the afternoon pushed longer-dated yields back above 6 per cent. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 103 11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.841 per cent. The day's economic news - slow August industrial production growth, a small increase in weekly jobless claims and a narrowing in the trade deficit - was mostly bullish for bonds, but given the market's uncertain, nervous mood, the data had little impact on prices. Prices opened firmer, buoyed by Wednesday's late rally which all but wiped out the day's early heavy losses. Yet the initial upward momentum could not be sustained, and prices see-sawed erratically around midday in the slipstream of trading on the futures market. By mid-afternoon prices were firmly entrenched in negative territory, and because of the Jewish new year holiday, trading was relatively thin, exacerbating the market's volatility.</p>

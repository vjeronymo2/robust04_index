			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Technology: The Earth moves in strange ways - Worth Watching Many strange facets of natural behaviour have been blamed on the phases of the moon - not least the existence of werewolves. Now, one strange phenomenon has been given the seal of authority from the highest scientific sources. The European laboratory for particle physics (Cern), in Geneva, has demonstrated that the earth's surface has tides, like the sea. These tiny deformations were discovered when scientists noticed variations in the energy of the particle beams circulating in an electron positron collider (Lep) which is helping research into the structure of matter. Over the 27km circumference of the Lep, scientists noticed variations of a millimetre depending on the phase of the moon - a miniscule amount to the layman but of the utmost importance to particle physicists. Cern: Switzerland, 22 767 4101.</p>

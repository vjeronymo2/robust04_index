			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>   [Text] Jordanian parliamentary sources have disclosed that  Syria and Israel have reached an agreement on the broad outlines  of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel  occupied in 1967, pointing out that the U.S.-brokered  negotiations between the two sides will resume soon. Citing  Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, these source  said that Damascus has made further steps conditional on an  Israeli Knesset announcement of the abrogation of the decision  under which Israel annexed the Golan Heights. The decision was  issued in January 1981. Syria has also demanded that Israel  publicly recognize UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338  on the principle of exchanging land for peace, as well as  Resolution 425 calling for Israel's withdrawal from southern  Lebanon.    The timetable for the Israeli withdrawal remains the subject  of dispute because the Jewish state is talking about seven years  while Syria insists that the period should not exceed three  years, according these same sources. If Israel meets Syria's  conditions, Damascus will be prepared to raise the level of  bilateral negotiations -- something that has been demanded by  Israel. Only then will U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher resume his shuttle tours between the two states.    In another development, Syria is demanding a piece of land  known as the Palestinian Golan Heights in the Syrian al-Hammah  area. It was annexed to the Syrian Golan Heights in 1938 and  then was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the heights  during the Six-Day War. Israel, however, refuses to withdraw  from it.</p>

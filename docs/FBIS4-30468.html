			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages between slantlines published in boldface] </F>   [Text] Many unofficial news reports have revealed that the  official visit of the Royal Government's first and second prime  ministers to Indonesia was one of the most important quests for  political, economic, and military support. Radio Australia  reported that Indonesia pledged to continue aid for Cambodia's  national reconstruction. This commitment was made by President  Suharto during an official reception hosted in honor of  Cambodia's high-ranking delegation headed by Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen.    At 2020 on the night of 22 June when the two Cambodian prime  ministers returned home and landed at Pochentong Airport, they  did not answer any questions from the press. Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh merely shouted the word "Success!" many times  and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, with broad smiles  gave KAOH SANTEPHEAP a thumbs-up in the dark of the night.    This word "Success!" clearly showed that Indonesia, a former  cochair of the Paris conference seeking peace for Cambodia,  certainly has not disavowed its pledge to meet Cambodia's needs.    The big boil has broken.    In the past, fired by its desire to bring peace to the  motherland, the Royal Government consented to lower itself to  the same level of the genocidal Khmer Rouge butchers by agreeing  to sit at roundtables with them at the behest of his majesty the  king. This already was too much of a concession by the Royal  Government when it accepted to sit with those who had murdered  their own people.    Also in the past the people had hoped that the king, the  only  one who could bring peace to the kingdom, would deliver.  However, this hope just fizzled out like salt in water  following the two failed "roundtables." On whom would the hope  be placed now? Besides the king, no one else can get peace  through talks. Now that the king has said he would not propose  a third roundtable, nothing remains for us to do.    Political analysts stress that there is only one way: to  outlaw the Khmer Rouge and turn them into rebels.    The symptom has gradually appeared, starting with the  official expulsion of the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh before 19  June. The Khmer Rouge office in the walled compound near the  royal palace has been pulled out right on time. When they were  leaving Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge declared that the only way  left for them was to resume fighting.    The Khmer Rouge declaration of fighting did not take place  only when they were sent packing from Phnom Penh. It has taken  place since 1979. The Khmer Rouge have been fighting for 15  years now. It is not true at all that fighting just started  after the "roundtable" got "smashed."    Nevertheless, while the Royal Government was kicking the  Khmer Rouge out of Phnom Penh and was taking a step closer to  declaring the Khmer Rouge outlaws, two members of the Royal  Government who had never tasted the Khmer Rouge bitter rule  before -- namely, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His  Excellency Sam Rangsi -- threatened to resign from their posts.    Hey! Hey! This is the big boil that is erupting! The  supporters of the Khmer Rouge who massacred over 3 million  people have bared themselves as starkly as daylight.    This piece of news was broadcast by Radio Australia on 21  June to be picked up by the Voice of America. Political  analysts in Cambodia maintained that we should not allow the  outlawing of the genocidal Khmer Rouge to become "hostage" of a  threat. The Royal Government also should not hesitate in  the face of resignation should there really be an offer to  resign. This is because in an organic system, when there is  "ingestion" there should also be "excretion" for the sake of  good health. "Ingestion" without "excretion" can only "harm"  your health.  The common people do not have greencards.    Only Cambodians who experienced the misery of three years  eight months and 20 days in the prison without walls know the  Khmer Rouge better than the Khmer Rouge, the pro-Khmer Rouge, or  certainly the Khmer Rouge partisans.    There was not a single family that did not suffer from the  killings, the inhuman treatment at the hands of Pol Pot and  Khieu Samphan. It is true that over the past 10 years most  vestiges of the killing-fields regime have been erased by the  common people working in coordination with the former State of  Cambodia. Yet, no one can forget it.    Some people have claimed that they are clean, love the  country, are loyal to the nation, and so on. However, their  patriotism, their loyalty always has a price in return.    Nevertheless, if anyone wants to thoroughly screen them  out, go ahead, do it! Just do not screw things up.    According to a KAOH SANTEPHEAP poll, the common people are  happy to see the Khmer Rouge declared outlaw rebels because the  Khmer Rouge have been rebels since 1979. There should not be  any difficulty declaring them as such one more time.    It would be better for those who are not happy with the move  to outlaw the Khmer Rouge and go live with them in the jungle.  But if they love Cambodians, they should have pity for  Cambodians by not trying to resurrect the defunct genocidal  rule, because the common people are not greencard holders.</p>

At the same time, he expressed the hope that Germany will  have an inflation rate "with a two in front of the decimal  point" by the end of the year. In addition, the finance  minister called for a reduction of the German net contribution  to the European Union, which is "slightly too high."    In his statements about the economic development, Waigel  mentioned a growth rate of 1.5 percent for 1994. Bonn's tight  consolidation policy was the precondition for the historically  low interest rates. As a result of the reduction of interest  rates in the past few months, an investment volume of about 30  percent was created. Waigel criticized the "punitive tax" for  persons without children, which was rejected by the CDU. The  concept of family splitting, supported by the CDU, still has to  be discussed, he pointed out.    Cassandra will not be elected, Waigel shouted amid the  applause of the 1,000 delegates. Never before since 1949 has so  much been accomplished in one legislative period as between 1990  and 1994. The CDU/CSU must now ensure that no one will govern  without or against the CDU and the CSU in Germany. Similar to  Kohl, Waigel suggested that those who do not believe in he  success of the CDU/CSU should give up their candidacy.    The CSU leader vigorously rejected a grand coalition in  Bonn.  He expressed the hope that the CDU and the CSU will not see any  need for another grand coalition in this century. Waigel  praised Kohl demonstratively for his achievements concerning  German unity. The CSU leader described the chancellor as "a  man, a tree, and a rock."    Waigel sharply attacked the SPD and its chairman Rudolf  Scharping. He described the leading democrats as "swaying  figures" whose names the leaders in other European capitals find  difficult to spell. "No one tells as many lies as the SPD."    The CSU leader warned the voters against the Instead Party  and the Republikaner. In Hamburg, the Instead Party took votes  from the CDU, but what was achieved was the SPD's absolute rule.  As a result of the protest votes for the Republikaner in  Baden-Wuerttemberg, the grand coalition there has become unable  to act on the asylum issue. Germany cannot afford a Weimar  situation. After Bismarck and Adenauer, another German  chancellor -- Chancellor Kohl -- should not be removed too early.</p>

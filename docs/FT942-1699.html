			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Train companies claim strike compensation The second one-day strike by signalmen ended last night with the train operating companies still unclear about what level of compensation they can expect from Railtrack for its failure to provide an operating network. Train operating companies said the details of a compensation scheme had yet to be worked out and they were reluctant to comment on how their claims might be resolved. One train operator said: 'The contracts are at an early stage and are being developed. We don't know exactly how they will be concluded but we don't want to make too much fuss about compensation.' Another said: 'We don't want to prejudice further discussions.' In spite of a doubling in the level of service provided by the train operators yesterday compared with last Wednesday, the train companies still lost about Pounds 10m of revenues after allowing for the fact that their operating costs were also much lower. Train operators and Railtrack confirmed that the train companies would not have to pay access charges for the two days lost due to strikes but it remains unclear what level of compensation Railtrack will pay on top of that. Railtrack said payments would relate to claims made on the train operators by their customers under the government's passenger charter and not to the gross levels of revenue lost. This is likely to mean that passengers booked to travel on a strike day would seek reimbursement of their ticket cost while season ticket holders would have their tickets extended or obtain a discount when they renewed them. An additional complication is that the train operating companies are operating under temporary access agreements which will be replaced by new ones from April 1995. The train operators are running as 'shadow franchises' still owned by British Rail. They will obtain their full independence next year when managers stage buy-out bids and other private-sector bidders put in offers. But the train operators have said that Railtrack, which has a monopoly of BR's track, signals and stations, is striking a very hard bargain in its contract negotiations. Some have said that the penalties for Railtrack of failing to provide a railway network are not sufficiently tough. Some senior managers in the operating companies have said they will seek to modify the original contracts both when they are incorporated as BR subsidiaries later this year and when they are sold off to the private sector. One manager said: 'The franchising director should not think that the train operating companies will simply buy a pile of contracts. We will want to renegotiate them. The contracts have been drawn up by civil servants and are too theoretical.'</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Mladic scorns western threats GENERAL Ratko Mladic, the commander of Bosnian Serb forces, is unfazed by threats from the international community to punish Serbs for the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Instead, he simply insists Serbs will never cave in to western demands. 'They can negotiate everything with us but will never achieve anything through pressure,' he said last week. The stocky 51-year-old is a mass of contradictions. He had a reputation for brutality even before the war erupted in former Yugoslavia and the US last year named him as a potential war criminal. But he has been described by some UN officials as a 'soldier's soldier', while others view him as an intelligent officer and a skilled strategist. Gen Mladic was born in Kalinovik, southern Bosnia, in the second world war. The death of his father, fighting with Tito's communist partisans, appears to have instilled in his son a hatred for Germany. When the war in Croatia erupted in 1991, Gen Mladic was transferred to Knin, the mountain stronghold of Croatia's rebel Serbs, where he was adored by his soldiers and the local population. A career officer in the Yugoslav People's Army, he was picked by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic over the objections of senior officers. 'He was intentionally installed by Milosevic to supervise the war in Bosnia,' one diplomat says. Last week's attack on Srebrenica, the eastern enclave, was described by the UN commander as an 'atrocity'. The attack came in spite of a promise by Gen Mladic that Serb forces around Srebrenica would not respond to 'Moslem provocations'. He has called the onslaught 'protection of Serbian villages under attack by Moslem soldiers'. He has denied that Moslem villagers are starving. 'They have plenty of food and what they lacked was delivered by the US air drops,' he said. But last month he gave the go-ahead to evacuate women and children from Srebrenica. Local Moslem authorities initially tried to stop the evacuation on the grounds it was helping Serbs in their drive to expel all Moslems from eastern Bosnia. But Gen Mladic told Mr Laurens Jolles, a senior official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees: 'You should have come with 300 trucks, I am happy if they can all get out.' He allowed a single Moslem man pleading, 'Sir, sir' to pass with the convoy of women and children. He said: 'I am not sir, I am General Mladic.' He turned to Mr Jolles and said. 'You see I've given this man back his life.' 'He is constantly contradicting himself. He can be extremely charming and extremely brutal,' says a senior UN official. When Gen Mladic is in an area, convoys pass through check points without a hitch. UN officials and diplomats believe he is in control in spite of speculation to the contrary.</p>

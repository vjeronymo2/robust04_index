			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Aid for Pakistan The International Monetary Fund board yesterday approved a stand-by credit worth 265m special drawing rights (Dollars 377m) for Pakistan, following the announcement of a comprehensive economic reform programme by the interim government, writes George Graham in Washington. IMF officials hope the credit will help lay the groundwork for a medium-term economic programme after next month's elections, and expect to combine it in the next few months with low-cost funding from the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.</p>

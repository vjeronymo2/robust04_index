			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Philips Takes the Lead"] </F>   [Text] Phillips is to invest 3 billion guilders in Russian  production facilities. The company expects production costs in  Russia to be between 30 and 40 percent lower than Western  levels. The implications of this decision are enormous. An  important multinational has pronounced its confidence in the  ailing Russian economy and above all in the still unhealthy  investment climate. Many others will follow.    The Eindhoven-based electronics concern is emphasizing what  the Netherlands business world did not finish discussing during  (Minister of Economic Affairs) Andriessen's "Global Plan" two  weeks ago: That the Netherlands will have to get used to the  fact that, partly due to the elimination of the Iron Curtain,  some industrial activities can no longer be maintained here.  The wages are too high because it is impossible to compete with  a few guilders per hour in East Europe. As low-wage countries  like Russia develop legal structures offering entrepreneurs  sufficient guarantees, then there will be a greater desire to  invest.    This shift will have major consequences for employment in  the  West. In the short term, it means that the standard of living  here will have to be sacrificed in part, in order to allow such  welfare to exist in countries like Russia, for example. That  hurts. But in the long term, it is a good development. Not aid  but trade, because this is the only way a new macroeconomic  division of labor and new equilibrium can arise. In this way,  East Europe and Russia will be given the opportunity to create  healthy, prosperous economies. And Western business will benefit  from that, too.</p>

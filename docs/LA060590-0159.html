			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> STEEL ANTI-DRUG BARRIERS SET UP  </P> <P> Using money from apartment owners in a formerly drug-infested Sepulveda  neighborhood, authorities today began replacing sawhorse barricades on streets  in the 12-block area with permanent steel barriers.  </P> <P> The barriers, which are implanted in the street, replace the barricades that  were installed by the city in November to help keep drive-through drug-buyers  out of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The barricaded area stretches south along Columbus Avenue from Nordhoff Street,  and the barriers leave only one entrance to the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Capt. Mark Stevens said drug-dealing in the area has dropped  dramatically since the neighborhood was barricaded. He said the police continue  to run undercover operations there because customers continue to come to the  area to buy drugs.  </P> <P> The four steel barriers, which can be opened for emergency vehicles, cost  $6,500 and were paid for by owners of the many apartment buildings in the  neighborhood. The city will pay the cost of maintaining them.  </P> <P> City Councilman Joel Wachs said the barriers eventually could be removed if the  neighborhood improves to the point that drug-dealing will not return.  </P></p>

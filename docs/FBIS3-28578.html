			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- Nepalese and Yemeni  papers carried articles refuting the false propaganda of the  United States on the DPRK's "nuclear issue".    The Nepalese paper DRISTI February 2 noted the United States  has been keeping its forces and nuclear weapons in South Korea,  always bringing the military importance into relief.    The "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is, in fact, a lie and its  settlement can be found only through dialogue and talks, the  paper said.    The Yemeni paper AL-RA'Y AL-'AM said the nuclear capability  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea poses really no  threat. The big threat to that country is actually the U.S.  nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea, it added.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Drop in cable rates killed Bell and TCI deal: Companies had settled all issues before agreement was called off Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc scuppered what was to have been the biggest merger in the history of the US telecommunications industry solely because of the Federal Communications Commission's action, this week, to lower cable television rates by 7 per cent, the companies said. The FCC's action lowered the anticipated cashflow of TCI, the largest US cable television service company, by about Dollars 144m (Pounds 98.6m) a year, said Mr John Malone, TCI president. This cut the valuation placed on TCI by Bell Atlantic by about Dollars 2bn, or Dollars 3.30 per share, he said. 'We were already at the low end of what we thought our company was worth, mostly because of the decline of the Bell Atlantic stock,' said Mr Malone. 'The deal just wasn't meant to be.' The companies declined to reveal the final figure of the deal, which was originally valued at between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn. Since October, when the merger was announced, Bell Atlantic's share price has fallen from about Dollars 67 to Dollars 53. Yesterday Bell closed at Dollars 54 1/2 , up Dollars 1.75. TCI's share price fell Dollars 1.87 to Dollars 22 3/8 . Before Tuesday's announcement by the FCC, both Bell Atlantic and TCI had settled 'all substantial issues, including price' regarding the merger and had even arranged board meetings for today and Saturday to approve formally definitive agreements, said Mr James Cullen, president of Bell Atlantic. Mr Cullen also said that the terms of the deal had been altered to reflect the drop in Bell Atlantic's share price over the past four months. The companies also denied any problems with the Justice Department about the anti-trust implications of the planned merger. However, the FCC's recommendation that cable TV rates be lowered by 7 per cent and that the rollback be applied to all types of cable TV systems, including TCI's most advanced services, killed the deal, both companies said. Analysts were skeptical that Bell Atlantic had been caught by surprise by the FCC's actions as a cable TV rate cut had been widely anticipated. However, Mr Cullen rejected as 'ludicrous and absurd' the notion that the deal might have been called off to put pressure on the FCC to change its recommendations for rate decreases. Bell Atlantic now wants to explore the possibility of joint ventures with TCI. The regional telephone company plans to introduce cable television service over its networks and look into an interactive television service. The collapse of the deal could 'slow but not stop' progress toward creation of 'information superhighways', offering multimedia communications services, Bell Atlantic said.</p>

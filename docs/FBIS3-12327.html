He told MENA that he and the Palestinian delegation will  leave for Tunis Sunday morning to meet with the Palestinian  leadership under the chairmanship of president 'Arafat to decide  on a response to the U.S. President's invitation.    What matters is not the venue of the talks, he said; the  talks in Egypt, both in Cairo or Taba, were going very well, and  Egypt is providing all possible support, Sha'th explained.    The issue is not where we negotiate but what we negotiate,  he  said. He urged international protection for the Palestinian  people in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles reached in Oslo.    Dr. Sha'th accused the Israeli Army of colluding with the  Israeli settlers who carried out the criminal massacre and the  horrible killings in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn  yesterday.    Without genuine protection against the Israeli settlers, the  Palestinian people will face daily massacres, he said.    These criminal acts, Sha'th added, cannot be perpetrated by  individuals. He noted the bad emotional climate and the  collusion of the Israeli Army with the perpetrators of massacres.    Sha'th wondered where the Israeli Army was, which usually  fills the plazas of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the  Palestinians pray daily in the mosque under the guns of the  Israelis. Where was the Israeli Army at the time of the  massacre, he wondered.    Sha'th stressed that eight worshipers were killed by Israeli  Army gunfire at the mosque's entrance while trying to leave.    Sha'th stressed the need for reconsidering the form, method,  and demands of the Israeli negotiators.    He pointed out that two-thirds of the draft security  agreement worked out during the talks in Cairo and Taba deal  with Israeli demands for the protection of settlers. It is the  Palestinian people that really need protection, he stressed.    Sha'th said: We demand international protection for the  Palestinian people, because this is part of the Oslo agreement,  and Israel cannot reject it. He noted that Israel has so far  been procrastinating in accepting such protection.    Concluding, Sha'th stressed that the next  Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations will mainly focus on international protection for  the Palestinian people so that the criminal massacre and the  horrible killings will not recur.</p>

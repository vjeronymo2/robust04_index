			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Only two bids received for 30% Greencore stake THE IRISH government said last night that it had received only two bids for its 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar, milling and malting group. One bid was from Archer-Daniels-Midland, a US agribusiness conglomerate, and the other from Irish Life, a Dublin-based insurance concern. No details were given of the price of the bids, but the government said that ADM had 'reaffirmed its interest' in purchasing a stake providing that 'its participation must exceed 25 per cent on a fully diluted basis'. The Irish Life bid is to purchase just 2m shares of the 25.4m on offer, 'conditional on the government selling at least 20m shares to purchasers including Irish Life'. Irish Life said last night that it was not acting on behalf of any other investors to purchase the outstanding amount. Earlier this month, the Irish agriculture minister Mr Joe Walsh said that ADM had made an offer of 260p per share. Since then Greencore's shares have risen to 270p. Mr Walsh said this week that the sale would not automatically go to the highest bidder. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said that the criteria to be used in assessing the government's decision would be 'price, the strategic development of the company and the development of the food sector in Ireland'. The government has been under pressure from trade unions and the Labour partners in the coalition to prevent the selling of the stake to a foreign company. However, the fact that no Irish food company has made a bid for Greencore and that Irish Life has only bid for less than 10 per cent of the shares on offer, is something of an embarrassment to the government. It must now decide whether to accept the joint ADM-Irish Life offers, which are not incompatible, or to abandon the sale altogether.</p>

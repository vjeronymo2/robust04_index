			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Dredging the Moat The case for an official inquiry into the affairs of Queens Moat is strengthened considerably by publication of its 1992 accounts. While one view is that its former management was simply naive in its approach to finance, the accounts show an accelerating use of quite sophisticated techniques to keep the ship afloat, even as the storm gathered force at the end of last year. These included not only a large sale and leaseback transaction in Germany on which the company is still owed DM34m. There was also a substantial extension of its incentive scheme in that country which would presumably have bolstered 1992 net profits substantially under the company's old accounting methods. Even after recent revelations, the reader is left gasping at the way in which deals involving directors were not disclosed to the stock exchange and at the capitalisation of one director's Pounds 900,000 bonus in 1991. It must be galling for small shareholders, who are still trapped by the listing suspension, to note the 5 per cent increase in the former chairman's emoluments in 1992 despite the fact that no bonus was paid. As for the future, particular uncertainty concerns the company's ability to generate cash. A Pounds 38m net inflow from operations in the first half of 1993 looked paltry against borrowings of Pounds 1.2bn. That would have necessitated a restructuring, however the assets were valued. But the new management must also be concerned that it may face fresh problems on that score if the value of the group's German hotels starts to erode.</p>

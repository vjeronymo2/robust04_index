			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No sense of nostalgia for Third Reich Sir, I would have enjoyed your otherwise interesting article, 'As They Say in Europe' (August 27), much more had it not been for the reference to the 'Third Reich' which got it all wrong. Nobody in his right mind in Austria feels nostalgic about the Third Reich. The times when people would go to Bratislava on the tram without any border controls were not during the Third Reich but during the Habsburg monarchy. Border controls were introduced after the dismemberment of the monarchy and the tram service suspended when the Iron Curtain went down only 40 miles east of Vienna. Neither did the multinational monarchy have any colonies. It is difficult to imagine any empire of the day which would have made colonials foreign ministers like the Polish and Hungarian counts Goluchowski and Andrassy, or even prime minister like Count Taaffe, the offspring of an Irish family. True, Austria is firmly anchored in the west. At the same time we have offered our neighbours to the east a helping hand on their way into the new Europe. This was stated explicitly by President Klestil only a few days ago at a meeting of eight central European heads of state. There will be no resurrection of the empire because, as you say, history is not about to repeat itself. But there will be a new dimension of European co-operation in which Austria definitely will play her part. George Heindl, press attache, Austrian Embassy, 18 Belgrave Mews West, London SW1X 8HU</p>

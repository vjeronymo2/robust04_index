			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin called on all  supporters of the government's policy not to pay heed to those  who rejoiced over spilled blood. The bloodshed was not  attributable to the peace process but rather the result of false  messianic beliefs and the hostility of the other side. The  prime minister was speaking at a mass rally in Tel Aviv a short  while after his return from Cairo.    Rabin called on his supporters to show more spirit and tell  the enemies of peace in Israel that they did not represent the  public. The Israeli people want peace and we will achieve it,  Yitzhaq Rabin asserted.</p>

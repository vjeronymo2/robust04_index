			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 29 May -- The extension of the state of  emergency in some areas of North Ossetia for another two months  currently serves as a guarantee of the safety of the republic's  citizens, North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov told  ITAR-TASS today. He strongly rejected the idea of introducing  federal government in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This will be, in his  opinion, a deadlock that may cause a new tragedy in the North  Caucasus. Galazov left for Moscow today to take part in a  meeting of the Federation Council, which will consider the  situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the  extension of the state of emergency in some parts of North  Ossetia and Ingushetia.    The president believes that peaceful negotiations should be  the main thrust in settling relations between the peoples of  North Ossetia and Ingushetia.</p>

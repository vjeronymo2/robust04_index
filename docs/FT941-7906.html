			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Moscow to hold credit auction The Russian central bank yesterday announced that it would conduct an experimental credit auction for the refinancing of commercial banks. It said that Rbs70bn would be offered at an auction next Monday in which commercial banks would submit bids to regional branches of the central bank. A central bank official said the total Rbs130bn which the bank intended to offer at auction in the first quarter of this year, would account for about 5-7 per cent of central bank credits. The aim of the operation, was to move away from the antiquated system whereby bureaucrats distribute refinancing funds for supporting priority sectors of the economy.</p>

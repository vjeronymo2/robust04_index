			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Chile offers calm in an unstable continent  -The Emerging Investor In a continent currently tinged with electoral and economic uncertainty, Chile - which is unlikely to witness radical policy changes before the presidential elections in 1999 - looks like a safe haven. 'The market . . . has defensive appeal in the current uncertain climate,' says Mr Guillermo Tagle of Santander Investment. Mr Paul Sparrow, a Santiago-based analyst at Barings, agrees. 'If you look at it on the eve of the Mexican elections and six weeks before the elections in Brazil, Chile has stability.' Unlike Mexico, Chile has no fears of post-election political turmoil after what is expected to be another victory for the ruling PRI party. Unlike Brazil, it is not faced with the possibility of a shift to the left should Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers' Party presidential hopeful, be victorious. That stability comes at a price. According to estimates of projected year-end earnings compiled by Kleinwort Benson, Chile is trading at a p/e of 19 against 14.4 in Mexico. Investors that have stuck with Chile, however, have been rewarded by dollar returns in the first eight months of 1994 of about 25 per cent, after 50 per cent gains last year. The selected IPSA index, returned to 100 at the start of each year, had by the close of trading on Friday reached 125.95 points. This year, Chile has been spared some - though by no means all - of the turmoil that rising US interest rates have inflicted on Latin American markets. A domestic investor base with assets above Dollars 20bn and the consequent reduction of dependence on foreign funds has helped to shelter Chile from international storms. Capital account restrictions prevent foreign investors from making quick dashes in and out of the Santiago exchange. However, Chile's market has internationalised through the exposure of ADRs in New York. There are now 14 Chilean ADRs, representing two thirds of the domestic market, and price moves abroad are quickly reflected at home. Chilean ADRs are generally well-regarded, partly because of their relative, though diminishing, scarcity, and partly because of the good reputation of Chilean management. Largely positive second-quarter results confirmed the reputation of Chilean companies for outpacing domestic growth. That growth has slowed this year to a projected 4 to 4.5 per cent compared with 6 per cent last year and 10.3 per cent in 1992. However, the 1994 performance has been better than expected, buoyed by higher prices for Chile's principal export products, especially copper. This has helped turn a projected annual trade deficit of nearly Dollars 1bn into a surplus of Dollars 237m in the first six months. Growth, which fell in the first quarter to 3.5 per cent against 7.8 in the same period of 1993, appears to be picking up strongly with monthly economic activity up 6.8 per cent in May, the highest in a year. Ms Janet Krengel, senior economist at Kleinwort Benson, acknowledges that Chile is 'the jewel in the crown of Latin America' in terms of economic management, but she believes its growth prospects are 'tarnished' by inflationary concerns. The government, working with a highly indexed economy, may struggle to meet its 11 per cent target for 1994, and finance ministry officials admit that achieving single-digit inflation will be a laborious process. Her fear is that the central bank will maintain high interest rates in order to smother inflation, denting hopes of the 6 per cent growth sought in 1995 and beyond. Kleinwort Benson gives Chile an 'underweight' rating, diverting funds to 'cheaper, more accessible markets such as Argentina'. Although Mr Sparrow says that the recent performance on inflation has been 'disappointing', he believes the market will continue to perform well, producing a year-end IPSA of about 140. He highlights the electricity sector, which can count on a favourable tariff structure for at least two years and which has seen demand grow 50 per cent faster than GDP. Expansion projects in Peru and especially Argentina - where Chilean companies have taken important stakes in privatised generators and distributors - should start showing profits this year. The outcome of the Mexican and Brazilian elections is likely to have an impact on markets throughout the continent. Investor caution is likely to abate given a clean Mexican poll and victory in Brazil for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the candidate favoured by business. Whether investment would then be diverted from Chile to other regional markets, or whether Santiago would benefit from the general flow of funds to Latin America remains to be seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Friday    Week on week change Stock                    Country        19/8/94      Dollars       %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Usinimas (Pfd)           Brazil          0.0016      0.0003     27.18 Otosan                   Turkey          3.4959      0.7061     25.31 Electrobras (Pfd)        Brazil          0.3897      0.0755     24.02 Eczacibasi Ilac          Turkey          0.1160      0.0214     22.63 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)     Brazil          0.0086      0.0015     21.25 Electrobras              Brazil          0.0097      0.0017     21.05 TPI Polene               Brazil          0.3751      0.0642     20.66 Kordosa                  Thailand        9.2092      1.5338     19.98 Brisa                    Turkey          0.4608      0.0760     19.76                          Turkey          0.2288      0.0364     18.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

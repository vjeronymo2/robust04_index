			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The four-legislator group  Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind), a breakaway from the Japan New  Party [JNP], on Tuesday [31 May] joined an 18-member  parliamentary group consisting of New Party Sakigake [Harbinger]  and the Group Seiun in the House of Representatives.    Minshu no Kaze defected from the JNP, which is headed by  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, due to differences with  the party leadership.    Sakigake, a 15-member party, is headed by Masayoshi  Takemura,  former chief cabinet secretary in the preceding coalition  government.    The three-member Seiun, also a breakaway from the JNP, left  after Hosokawa failed to carry out a planned merger with  Sakigake.    Political sources said there are still some members within  the JNP who are opposed to the leadership's close ties with the  key coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] led by Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata.    They predicted that the division within the JNP could lead  more breakaways to join the 22-member parliamentary group  comprising Sakigake, Seiun and Minshu no Kaze.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED SOX, TWINS DON'T EXACTLY DOUBLE THEIR PLEASURE  </P> <P> Doesn't anybody make just one out in Boston any more?  </P> <P> Tuesday night against the Minnesota Twins, the Boston Red Sox became the first  team to hit into two triple plays in one game.  </P> <P> The double play was the thing Wednesday night when the Red Sox and Twins set  another major league record by hitting into 10. The Red Sox hit into six to set  an American League record.  </P> <P> They broke the major league record of nine, set by the Angels and Red Sox in  1966.  </P> <P> The Red Sox, who won Tuesday, 1-0, also won this one, 5-4, to increase their  lead in the AL East to 1 1/2 games.  </P> <P> The Red Sox hit into double plays in each of the first four innings, with Kevin  Romine hitting into two of them.  </P> <P> Rookie Tim Naehring started a four-run rally in the fifth inning with his first  major league homer as the Red Sox tied the score, 4-4. Wade Boggs doubled in  the seventh and scored the winning run on Carlos Quintana's single.  </P> <P> "We can keep on hitting into double and triple plays at a record clip, as long  as we keep on winning," Romine said.

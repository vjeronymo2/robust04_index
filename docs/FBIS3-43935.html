			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Osman Hassan Ali, alias Osman Ato, a member of  the United Somali Congress [USC] central committee, speaking on  behalf of the eight citizens detained by UN Operation Somalia  [UNOSOM] after being illegally kidnapped from their homes, today  addressed thousands of jovial people at 1 July Independence  Square. The demonstrators carried placards and the flag of the  Republic of Somalia, and chanted: "Down with Somalia's enemies"  "UNOSOM leave Somalia", "may the agreement to unite Somalia  succeed" and other slogans.    The rally was first addressed by Awil Ahmad Abdi, from the  Somali Democratic Movement and Mohamed Ahmad Nur, the USC  secretary for reconstruction and rehabilitation, who greeted and  congratulated the Somali citizens that UNOSOM had illegally  kidnapped from their homes. They also congratulated the Somali  National Alliance supporters, particularly those from Mogadishu  and its surrounding environs, who had been holding non-stop  demonstrations which, they said, finally forced UNOSOM to  release the officials they had illegally detained.    Speaking on behalf of the eight citizens, Osman Hassan Ali  thanked the Somali people and said that history would not forget  those people involved in the struggle against the UNOSOM troops.  Osman Hassan Ali said that they had done something which had  been lacking in Somalia and the African continent, and that this  had sent a clear signal to foreigners that they could not do  whatever they wished to an independent country and people.  Referring to the agreement reached between brother Somalis and  signed at the Kah Hotel in Mogadishu, he said he strongly  supported it, pointing out that the agreement was the key for  peace and stability to come about in Somalia. In conclusion, he  appealed to the Somali people to show tolerance, fortitude, and  mutual respect for each other's rights. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Delors seeks social policy on jobs crisis MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, yesterday denounced job-poaching in the European Community and led calls for a relaunch of EC social policy to help tackle the unemployment crisis in Europe. As EC foreign ministers headed by France warned that monetary instability and competitive devaluations were undermining the EC's single market, Mr Delors criticised 'social dumping' whereby certain countries were downgrading workers' rights to attract foreign investment. Mr Delors' remarks at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels were widely seen as an attack on the UK. He combined them with a call for an early meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries to co-ordinate growth, possibly in April. The Clinton administration has expressed interest in closer economic policy co-ordination within the G7, but US relations with the EC have become strained after last week's imposition of anti-dumping duties on EC steel exporters and yesterday's decision to restrict EC bids on federal public procurement contracts. At yesterday's opening session of EC foreign ministers, France followed Mr Delors and other EC members in urging a 'relaunch' of EC social policy to defend workers' rights and guard against 'social dumping'. Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, said employment could not be created by countries outbidding each other for investment. He attacked the recent decision by Hoover, the US multinational, to relocate from Dijon in France to Cambuslang in Scotland as a 'serious incident'. Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, French minister responsible for European affairs, appealed for 'fair competition' among EC member states. She drew attention to the the 1986 Single European Act providing for sustainable, non-inflationary growth, a high degree of economic convergence, social cohesion and solidarity among EC members. EC diplomats said the reference reflected French concern about the impact on its competitive position of maintaining a strong franc but also described it as an attack on the UK for opting out of the Maastricht treaty's social protocol. It was also implicit criticism of Britain's decision to promote growth by floating sterling outside the European exchange rate mechanism and progressively cutting UK interest rates.

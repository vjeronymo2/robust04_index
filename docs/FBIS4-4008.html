			<p>BFN     [Text] Almaty, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng and Kazakhstan President N.A. Nazarbayev held two rounds of  talks here today on bilateral relations and international issues  of common concern.    Li Peng told Nazarbayev that China attaches great importance  to its ties with Kazakhstan, which he described as a new type of  relationship based on mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit,  and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.    Nazarbayev said that Li's visit was an historic event in  terms of bilateral relations, which would serve to deepen the  friendship between the two countries.    "Relations with China enjoy a top position in Kazakhstan's  foreign policy," he added.    According to a Chinese spokesman Nazarbayev said that  Kazakhstan adheres to the position of non-interference in each  other's internal affairs, opposes national splittism as well as  hegemonism, and will never allow factions of "East Turkestan" to  involve themselves in activities here against China that will  hurt Sino-Kazakhstan relations.    Nazarbayev also stressed that Kazakhstan will not develop  any  kind of official relations with Taiwan, which it recognizes as  an inalienable part of China's territory.    Li voiced appreciation for Nazarbayev's remarks on not  allowing national separatists to engage in activities against  China in Kazakhstan and for his stance on Taiwan and Tibet.    "The Chinese Government appreciates the efforts made by  President Nazarbayev as well as the Kazakhstan Government to  develop bilateral ties and to safeguard peace and stability," he  said.    He noted that China and Kazakhstan share identical or  similar  views on many international issues.    The two leaders spoke highly of the signing of the Sino-  Kazakhstan border agreement, calling it "an event of historic  significance and an important indication of the further growth  of friendship," according to the spokesman.    "It shows that Sino-Kazakhstan relations are based on mutual  trust and full of vitalities," Li said.    "We will work together for the building of a new 'silk road'  and turn our common border into a bond of everlasting peace,  friendship and cooperation," he added.    Nazarbayev said the development of equal and  mutually-beneficial trade and economic cooperation between  Kazakhstan and China has a broad basis, and Kazakhstan hopes to  "further enrich the content, expand the scope and raise the  level of such cooperation."    Li voiced full support for those aims pointing out that  China  takes a positive attitude towards President Nazarbayev's  proposal for furthering bilateral cooperation.    "The two countries should encourage their enterprises to  develop cooperation," he said, adding that the improvement of  transportation would create better conditions for trade and  economic cooperation between China and the entire central Asia.    Li conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's invitation for  Nazarbayev to visit China again, the spokesman said.</p>

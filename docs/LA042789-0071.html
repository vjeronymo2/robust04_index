			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: CUPS, SPOONS: MEASURING TOOLS OF THE TRADE  </P> <P> Yes, we all know great cooks who never measure an ingredient and everything  they make comes out perfect. Most of us, however, would be courting disaster if  we started throwing in a pinch of this and a handful of that. Precise  measurements not only assure consistent results, they sometimes can make the  difference between the success or failure of a recipe.  </P> <P> We're limiting this discussion to the tools most commonly used to measure  ingredients in recipes developed for American consumers. Although the metric  system of measuring by weight is recognized as being more accurate, volumetric  measures are still the most commonly used in the United States.  </P> <P> Liquid Measuring Cups:  </P> <P> Liquids should be measured in standardized glass or clear plastic cups. Most  glass measuring cups are heat-proof and can be used safely with boiling liquids  or near hot surfaces. You need to be a little more careful regarding heat when  using plastic varieties, although they are less likely to break.  </P> <P> The handles and spouts on these cups aid in pouring; a little extra space at  the top of the cups prevents spillage. Most liquid measuring cups are now  marked with both English and metric units. The most common sizes have one-,  two- and four-cup capacities.  </P> <P> To measure accurately using liquid measures, place the cup on a level surface  and with your eyes level with the markings, add the amount of ingredient  needed. Bend over if necessary rather than lifting the cup to your eye level.  </P> <P> Dry Measuring Cups:  </P> <P> The cups used for measuring dry ingredients usually come in graduated sets of  four: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup, although 1/8, 3/4 and two-cup measures are  available. Generally, the cups are made of aluminum, stainless steel or  plastic.  </P> <P> A future Back to Basics column will show the techniques used to accurately  spoon or pack ingredients into a dry measuring cup, then level them even with  the rim. By using the exact size of dry measuring cup called for in a recipe,  you can assure success.  </P> <P> Measuring Spoons:  </P> <P> Smaller amounts of both liquid and dry ingredients are measured using  standardized measuring spoons. Fill spoons to the rim with liquids; level off  dry ingredients to ensure accuracy. Dense ingredients need to be packed into  the spoons to eliminate air pockets.  </P> <P> The spoons typically come in sets of four: 1/4, 1/2 and one teaspoon and one  tablespoon. Some sets, however, include a 1/8 teaspoon and a 1/2 tablespoon.  </P> <P> Aluminum, stainless steel and plastic are again the most common materials from  which these tools are made. Shapes vary, but it's easier to scrape out  ingredients from the round and oval varieties than the square or rectangular.  Often the spoons are held together with a ring.  </P></p>

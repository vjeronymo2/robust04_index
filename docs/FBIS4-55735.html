			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah al-Hajj and As'ad Taha: "Izetbegovic </F> Tells AL-HAYAH: Expect Tangible Change; We will Not Allow More  Concessions To Be Imposed on us"]    [Excerpts] Jeddah, Zagreb -- Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic arrived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at dawn  yesterday, Wednesday, to perform pilgrimage. He is accompanied  by 500 citizens, including some war wounded and handicapped.  [passage omitted]    The Bosnian president spoke about tangible progress in the  Bosnians' defense of their rights. He said: "You will see a  change in the coming days."    Izetbegovic announced his country's total rejection of  occupied Brcko's inclusion in the safe areas. He said: "Brcko  has a Muslim majority and this will continue to be the case. If  it is not possible to retrieve it peacefully, we will work to do  so by force of arms." He added that declaring it a safe area  perpetuates the Serb occupation, which controls half of it.    On the recent peace initiative, he stated sternly that "the  international community cannot put further pressures on us, as  we have offered sufficient concessions. We now believe that the  shape of our future relies on our strength, God's help, and the  support of our friends throughout the world, especially the  Islamic world."    Asked about the Bosnian Army's ability to liberate the Brcko  area, he told AL-HAYAH: "I can now confirm that I am certain  that we are capable of doing that, that the successes achieved  by the Bosnian Army in recent days prove it, and that conditions  are now different from past conditions."    He announced his opposition to lifting economic sanctions on  Serbia, even it accepts the new peace initiative. He said:  "The real boycott is imposed on us through the arms embargo on  us. Nevertheless, we have stood fast and begun to break the  shackles, and you will see a tangible change in the coming days."    On the contradiction between the powers to be exercised by  the Bosnia-Herzegovina president and the federal union  [al-ittihad al-fidrali] president, which will be held by a  Croat, he said: "I am the president of all unified and  internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. The federal  state is part of this state."    The Bosnian president warned about the Serb forces'  increasing violation of the fragile cease-fire agreement in and  around Sarajevo. He added that the Serbs are exploiting  international laxity to seize more Muslim territory in Bosnia,  especially in central and north Bosnia. They are currently  planning to initiate battles to seize Tuzla, as the day before  yesterday Serb forces shelled the city of Kladanj, which is  situated between Sarajevo and Tuzla to the north.    Izetbegovic belittled the importance of the new European  initiative, warning of overoptimism, as "the Serbs have  persisted in breaking their promises as a result of Europe's  sympathy with them." He appealed to the Islamic states to offer  more material support and exert diplomatic efforts to try to  lift the "arms embargo imposed on Muslims, in order to enable  them to defend themselves."

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its analysis, the Council developed a model to predict how much whiting would be taken by each sector under each option and under certain conditions and assumptions (section 7.2.3 of the EA/RIR). The resulting ranges of estimated production for the shore-based sector are listed in the following table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 6,L2,i1,s50,10,10,r50,r50,xs60 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Estimated Harvest Guideline (HG) and Whiting Catch by the Shore-based Fishery Under the Assumptions Used in the EA/RIR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=4 --> [in thousands of metric tons] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Year <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1HG <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Reserve (40% HG) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Option 1 (proposed) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Option 2 (1993 %'s) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Option 3 (no alloc.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 260 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 104.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 60&hyph;134 mt  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 23&hyph;52% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59&hyph;77 mt  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 23&hyph;30% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 21&hyph;57 mt.  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 8&hyph;22%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1222  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 88.8 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59&hyph;112 mt  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 27&hyph;50% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59&hyph;66 mt  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 27&hyph;30% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 15&hyph;47 mt.  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 7&hyph;21%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1166 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 66.4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59&hyph;80 mt  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 36&hyph;48% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 50 mt  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 30% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 8&hyph;32 mt.  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> 5&hyph;19%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 1Based on 80 percent of the estimated U.S.-Canada acceptable biological catch. The actual harvest guideline will not be announced until January 1 each year, and the actual harvest guideline for 1995 and 1996 may vary from these estimates. (Source: Tables 7&hyph;2 and 7&hyph;3 (EA/RIR)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Biological and Environmental Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> No significant biological or environmental impact is expected as a result of the proposed rule. The bycatch of rockfish and salmon is expected to be similar whether the proposed rule is implemented. Although it is possible that a short, intense pulse fishery could have localized impacts on bycatch species, it also provides the potential for avoiding species more likely to be caught at other times of year. The incentive to minimize bycatch may be less if the season is short and vessels race to take their allocation. However, observers have been carried onboard both the at-sea processors and shore-based catcher vessels for the purpose of monitoring bycatch. In general, bycatch rates of yellowtail rockfish and Pacific ocean perch are more likely to increase if the fishery occurs predominantly in the northern areas, and bycatch of bocaccio/chilipepper rockfish are more likely to increase if fishing occurs off California. A number of regulations were implemented in 1993 for the purpose of minimizing bycatch of salmon and rockfish in the whiting fishery (50 CFR 663.23(b)(3)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Council heard testimony that a later and longer season would benefit the whiting resource because the fish would be larger later in the season and it would take fewer fish to fill the harvest guideline, the actual difference in yield is small. An analysis conducted in 1992 indicated that even if the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> entire  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> harvest guideline were taken in September compared to April, the potential increase in yield would be about 10 percent. This 10 percent would include increases to liver and gonad weight, and therefore is not likely to represent an equal increase in marketable flesh. Since none of the options considered by the Council provided for the entire fishery being taken in September, the increase in yield from an extended season would be less than 10 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The economic cost-benefit analysis developed by the Council for the 1993 allocation did not provide adequate information to support any allocation decision. However, one more year of fishing and marketing experience, and revised data were incorporated into a new analysis. Even though data were available in the recent analysis that did not exist at the time the previous analysis was prepared, the results still should be interpreted with caution and are contingent on assumptions about the effects of limited entry, and the quality of the data. However, given these limitations, the Council's cost/benefit analysis does provide consistent ranking of the three options, suggesting that the proposed rule may provide the greatest net economic benefit to the nation, even though the amount of that difference may be quite small. In all instances the no allocation option (Option 3) was ranked lowest in terms of net economic benefit to the nation. The differences between Options 1 and 2 were insignificant in most cases. Three important factors, based on 1993 prices, appear to drive the results: (1) Shore-based headed and gutted operations are the most profitable (highest net economic benefit); (2) shore-based waste utilization adds to the net economic benefit; and (3) surimi prices are highest for catcher/processors. Applying the new data to assumed levels of participation by each sector, and using observed prices, the total difference between the proposed rule and the no allocation option is only about $3 million over the three-year period. Even though the exact dollar amount may not be known, this indicates a small economic difference among the options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council concluded that although the net economic benefits are similar for Options 1 and 2, the no allocation (Option 3) was clearly inferior. In short, the cost-benefit analysis concluded that shore-based activities appear to produce a slightly greater net economic benefit, in part due to the slower operating pace and to the multi-faceted nature of the shore-based sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Council perceives a clearer difference between the options with respect to distributional effects, believing maintenance of a robust shore-based whiting fishery is essential for the preservation of the social and economic structure of the west coast fishing industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Abu Dhabi set to sue auditors linked to BCCI The government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is preparing to sue the firm of accountants that audited the investments it handed to the bank for management. It is preparing legal action against J B Benbow &amp; Co and its successor firm Benbow Anderson &amp; Co, the small firms based in Grand Cayman that audited Abu Dhabi's account with ICIC Overseas, a BCCI subsidiary. A writ may be issued in the English courts as soon as spring, in an action designed as much to gain access to documents as to recover assets from the firm. Mr David Sandy, a partner with Simmons &amp; Simmons, Abu Dhabi's lawyers in London, said: '(Benbow) is firmly in our sights. Our client has told us to go ahead. They are our next target.' On Monday Abu Dhabi launched action against 13 former BCCI executives for Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn), claiming that it recovered less than Dollars 600m of Dollars 2bn it invested in the 1980s. Benbow was appointed auditor to account 20071 at ICIC Overseas in Grand Cayman in 1988 after what Mr Sandy said was four years of pressure from Abu Dhabi to appoint an independent adviser to study the figures. Mr Swaleh Naqvi, chief operating officer of BCCI, drafted a letter in November 1989 to Abu Dhabi which was never sent, but laid out a number of reasons for not appointing a larger firm of auditors. He argued that 'there is no guarantee of secrecy in big firms . . . particularly when their staff come and go and it had been often found that they talk irresponsibly'. J B Benbow's first audit of the financial position of the portfolio with a valuation of Dollars 3.5bn in the year to June 30 1988 was signed off as showing 'a true and fair view' in a statement dated July 11 1988. The firm also provided a detailed valuation report on the account at March 31 1989. An invoice in August that year shows it charged Dollars 58,600 at a 'concessional rate' for the work and expenses. Benbow Anderson &amp; Co, its successor firm, verified the value of portfolio balances as Dollars 3.9bn at June 30 1989. It provided a further audit for the portfolio valued at Dollars 4bn for the period to December 31 1989. The two audits and additional work during the period were billed at nearly Dollars 33,000. Mr John Benbow, a partner with the firm, yesterday said he could not comment without approval of ICIC's liquidator.</p>

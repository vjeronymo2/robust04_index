			<p>BFN     [Text] The Union of Russian Federation Citizens of Tallinn  [Soyuz Rossiyskikh Grazhdan Tallinna] was formalized on 9 April  at an inaugural assembly in the Estonian capital. Yuriy  Kotenkov, one of the founding members, told an RIA correspondent  that the union intends to defend the rights, freedom, and  sovereignty of the 400,000 Russians in the republic. As a last  resort to accomplish their goal, Kotenkov said, the organization  reserves the right to rise up in revolt against tyranny and  oppression.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Tidying up the US corporate landscape - Proposals to tighten restructuring and other one-off charges The fashion among US companies for taking big restructuring charges may be drawing to an end. In recent years, such one-off charges have become a familiar part of the corporate landscape as many of the country's biggest companies have sought to overhaul their operations to make themselves more competitive. Often, this work has been carried out under the broad-ranging (and fashionable) banners of 're-engineering' and 'downsizing'. Tighter accounting regulations are about to make the process less attractive. Last week, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's emerging issues taskforce agreed on a stricter set of rules to govern this area of financial reporting - though they do not go far enough, according to the securities regulators. The problem until now has been a lack of definition. What future costs should a company recognise in its current accounting period? Being by definition a prudent breed, many accountants like companies' accounts to reflect certain future liabilities, otherwise their current earnings would not reflect the reality of their business. However, drawing the net too widely allows companies to bundle up costs that should properly be charged against future earnings. That leads to bigger up-front charges and flatters future profits. (Perhaps for that reason, it is not uncommon to see the biggest charges being taken by companies that have recently had a change of management at the top.) The FASB has edged its way towards an answer piece by piece. In May this year, it came up with an answer to how the costs of planned redundancies should be handled. Last week, it reached a consensus on the more thorny subject of other, non-redundancy costs associated with restructurings. And early next year the board will conclude its thinking on a related area: the write-down in the value of assets, which often occurs in connection with a corporate restructuring. The title of its paper on the first two aspects of this work, due to be published on 6 December, gives a fair idea of how the emerging issues taskforce's thinking has developed. It is called, rather long-windedly: 'Liability recognition for costs to exit an activity (including certain costs incurred in a restructuring)'. As this makes clear, taking a one-off charge in future will be limited largely to where companies are shedding businesses. Only those costs 'not associated with, or (which) do not benefit, activities that are continued' will count. At one sweep, this appears to wipe out many of the opportunities for taking restructuring charges that companies have used this year. Among the clearest examples (and ones highlighted in this column in March) were the series of restructuring charges taken by US regional telephone companies last winter. Nynex, for instance, said a Dollars 400m charge it took included 'retraining employees, relocation expenses (and) systems re-engineering'. BellSouth, which took a Dollars 1.2bn charge, said Dollars 550m of the cost was related to 'implementing new, state-of-the-art systems'. Clearly, these items would not meet the new taskforce rules. There are many other examples around. In a speech earlier this month, Mr Walter Schuetze, chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said a review by his agency had turned up 'restructuring' charges that included: 'future expenditures for equipment such as computers, software for those computers or computers already on hand, relocating and retraining employees, advertising and legal services, consulting services, expected adverse factory overhead variances on future production runs, expected increases in returns and allowances on future sales, increased warranty liabilities on future product sales, and the like'. The new emerging issues taskforce regulations lay down a tighter set of rules for the circumstances in which charges can be taken, and the types of cost that can be included. Those one-off charges that still qualify can only be taken after a company has committed itself to a restructuring plan (which normally means getting board-level approval). Also, the plan cannot simply be a vague expression of a future intention: according to the FASB, companies will have to have identified the method by which they are going to dispose of the businesses concerned, as well as the expected date they will complete the exercise. The expected completion of the plan has to be soon enough for it to be unlikely that a company's management will change its mind about the idea. Also, restructuring costs can only be taken if they meet one of two tests: they must either be extra costs that a company faces as a result of the restructuring plan, or contractual costs that it cannot get out of (an example of the latter would be the cost of terminating a lease on property which is no longer needed in the business). There are those who think the rule-makers have not gone far enough - among them Mr Schuetze at the SEC. Speaking earlier this week, he said: 'In my opinion, they have allowed for the recognition of liabilities that do not meet the FASB's definition of a liability, and which are more in the manner of contingencies.' Liabilities should only be recognised when there is some contractual or legal obligation to make a payment, he says. 'Obligations do not arise because a board of directors decides something.' Mr Schuetze concedes, though, that the FASB has at least reduced the scope for abuse. Before the accounting regulators began their work early this year, 'the ingredients and amounts included in restructuring charges ran from A to Z'. Now, he says, 'they're reining it in: it runs from A to G, or maybe A to I'. Whether the SEC will be satisfied with this, or whether it will push the matter further, remains to be seen. At this stage, Mr Schuetze refuses to be drawn on the question. In theory, some big restructuring charges already taken - including those reported by Nynex and BellSouth - could be open to challenge by the agency. The new taskforce regulations, though they come into force before the end of this year, are not retrospective. That means they apply to charges taken during the final quarter of the year, but not those reported in earlier accounting periods. However, the SEC has the power to force companies to restate figures included in earlier regulatory filings. It is a power the agency is most likely to use when vetting prospectuses issued by companies in connection with the sale of new securities. In the meantime, the emerging issues taskforce is getting ready to issue its thoughts on asset write-downs. Here, again, there is a temptation for companies to take big one-off charges to reduce future amortisation charges to earnings, whether from tangible assets or intangibles like goodwill. The taskforce's approach is based on the use of discounted cashflow analyses: when the book values of assets, or groups of assets, are higher than the present values of the future cashflows the assets are expected to generate, they should be written down. This, at least, is one area where the SEC is likely to go along with the FASB. Unlike an expected restructuring cost, an asset represents 'a prior expenditure, not a future expenditure', says Mr Schuetze. 'That is a vital distinction.'</p>

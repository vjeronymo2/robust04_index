			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Serbs pay high price for their role in Bosnia Mr Nikola Jankovic, a Belgrade pensioner, rifles through the pockets of his shabby overcoat looking for 25 D-Marks (Pounds 10) to pay for his medicine. The German currency has all but replaced the dinar as accepted currency in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Jankovic's monthly pension of DM2 is 'only enough to die with', he says. He buys a double portion of tranquillisers because it is cheaper that way. The monthly rate of inflation in Serbia has hit 50,000 per cent, surpassing the record 44,000 per cent inflation of the Weimar republic in 1923, according to Mr Mladjan Dinkic, a Belgrade economist. Serbia's economy is disintegrating after nearly three years of war and 9 months of United Nations sanctions. Industrial production last month fell by 38 per cent. Prices are climbing into the trillions. Belgrade economists say the federal government will soon strike another six noughts from dinar notes. The UN was told on Tuesday that the sanctions, imposed for Belgrade's role in the violent carve-up of Bosnia, had cost Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn). By the end of this year, per capita income is expected to be Dollars 200 to Dollars 250 a year. Spending cuts on public transport mean that trams are packed so full they drive with the doors open. The government on Monday ordered electricity cuts after early winter weather had overloaded local power stations. Despite official denials, diplomats in Belgrade forecast that electricity restrictions will soon be become a regular occurrence. On Belgrade's Bulevar Revolucije, cash transactions are based only in D-Marks. Mrs Sonja Durovic, the chemist, dismisses any idea of a revolt against Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, despite the hard times. 'The Serbs are used to being stomped on,' she says, explaining that people are preoccupied with making ends meet rather then finding someone to blame for the crash in their living standards. With an iron grip on state television, Mr Milosevic has managed to channel popular resentment about the economy towards the west for imposing sanctions on Belgrade. However, Mrs Durovic points out how the economy had already begun to slump on the break-up of trade between the former Yugoslav republics in 1991. Mrs Durovic somehow seems to cope but she fears she will soon have to close down her chemist's shop. The Serbian government last month passed a diktat ordering 200 private chemists to meet prescriptions - locally-produced drugs are free, while imports have to be paid for - and receive payment from a state health fund later. 'Now we've all withdrawn our drugs from the shelves. We cannot give them away for free. The state is trying to run us out of business,' she complains. In the run-up to elections, Serbia's ruling Socialists are eager to create the impression that they are reviving the economy. Official propaganda is in stark contrast to the grey picture on the icy city streets. Black marketeers hawk their wares - smuggled from Turkey, Bulgaria or Hungary - indoors, state shops are empty. Serb officials say 70 per cent of commerce is on the black market, eluding tax collectors. Strapped for cash, Serbia has ordered the non-stop printing of diners to try to lure any D-Mark savings from the 9.8m citizens. Economists estimate that national savings have dipped to an average of DM240 per household. Marko, a scarf wrapped round his face, says he escaped from Bosnia, but can barely eke out an existence selling soap, washing powder, and tins of humanitarian aid. 'Everyone asks the price, but no one buys anything.'</p>

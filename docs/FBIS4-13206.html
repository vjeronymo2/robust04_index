			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakech, Apr. 15 (MAP) -- The GATT ministerial  conference to wind up this Friday in Marrakech Thursday  unanimously adopted the decision on the creation of the World  Trade Organization (WTO). The conference also adopted decisions  relative to trade and environment and the debts stemming from  the implementation of the GATT accords.    This Friday, head of the delegations attending the  conference  are to sign five implements of the Uruguay Round, namely the  final act of the round, the accord setting up the WTO, the  accord on public projects, the accord on dairy produce and the  accord on beef.    GATT Information Director David Woods said at a press  briefing here Thursday the signing ceremony will be held in the  afternoon and will be preceded by a meeting of the trade  negotiations committee which is to adopt the declaration of  Marrakech and ministerial decisions.    On the accord setting up the WTO, Woods said some countries  will sign the accord without conditions while others will do it  under the reservation of its ratification by their parliaments.  He explained the non signing of this accord will have no legal  incidence since all the countries signatory of the Uruguay Round  final act committed to submit the accord for approval to the  [words indistinct] competent authorities.    The other three accords, which are partially new, will be  signed by some countries and the accord on public projects will  be signed by 22 countries including those of the European Union  under the reservation of ratification.    The accord on dairy products which dates back to the Tokyo  negotiations and which was not renegotiated by the Uruguay Round  will be signed by seven or eight entities, only, including the  European Union on behalf of its member counories, Woods said  adding the same is true for the accord on beef. Another  implement, namely the accord on civil aircraft of 1979 will be  presented for signing by GATT members, woods said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special envoy Pedro Manuel Otero from Cartagena </F> de Indias, Colombia for the "Evening Information Review"  newscast]    [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos told Cuban  media in this city that unlike previous summits, the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit to be held this coming Tuesday and  Wednesday has specific objectives.    Bolanos described the summit called by the United States in  December as a quasi-hemispheric meeting. Without Cuba, he said,  the meeting will not be a meeting of all American countries.    Bolanos also said Cuba will ask to the host the 1999 summit.    [Begin recording] [Bolanos] This summit is taking place in a  different international environment; for example, regional  integration efforts are stronger at this fourth summit than at  previous ones. On the eve of this summit, the Group of Three  will sign a free trade treaty. The Association of Caribbean  States has emerged as we approach the summit, and while it is  true that the purpose of this association is not to promote  integration, it aspires to promote agreements, cooperation, and  trade and therefore contributes to integration.    This summit overshadows the so-called hemispheric summit,  which I prefer to describe as quasi-hemispheric because a small  part of the hemisphere will not be represented.    The region's heads of state will meet to design what the  North Americans call a Latin American [words indistinct] policy,  which we cannot [words indistinct] in Latin America, a policy  that is obviously trying to lay the groundwork for a new version  of the policy the United States set for Cuba and Latin America  in the 1970's with the Alliance for Progress and Cuba's  expulsion from the OAS and to take a firmer grip on the Latin  American market to check growing competition from Japan and the  European Community.    That is the context for the Cartagena summit, and that is  why  it will be different from the first, second, and third summits.  We always attend summits with the purpose of obtaining specific  results based on what we think is best for the region. We want  results that foster integration, cooperation, and everything  that contributes to the progress in the region and to a  reaffirmation of regional identity. As a great Cuban  intellectual used to say, by reaffirming our identity, we also  define our differences from those who are not like us.    [Otero] Does Cuba expect any support or declaration by the  presidents against the U.S. economic blockade?    [Botellos] [Words indistinct] a delayed resolution. I do not  think this summit will do less than that. I think we will make  progress because the world is different and there have been  events with contribute to the issuance of a resolution more  advanced than that issued in Bahia last year.    Observers and political experts analyzing this summit agree  that the Bahia summit revived the principles established in  Guadalajara and projected them in a very Latin American  dimension, especially the development aspect, which is what  hurts our region. Our region's main problems are the results of  underdevelopment. The Bahia summit promoted discussion of this  issue with the well defined intention of encouraging development  not just for its own sake but for social progress. I think this  was [words indistinct] the organizers of this summit. Any  intention to [words indistinct].    [Otero] You referred to the hemispheric summit as a  quasi-hemispheric summit. Many believe this summit was convoked  by the United States simply to interfere with the Ibero-American  summit. Do you agree or do you think it is the result of a  strategic policy by the U.S. Government?    [Bolanos] I do not think the United States has ever liked  the  Ibero-American summit. From the time the United States became a  country, it has grown accustomed to influencing Latin America.  I do not know if convoking that summit is the result of a  policy, a doctrine, or of a need to prevail. [Words indistinct]  have always existed to influence and dominate Latin America.    The Ibero-American Summit is a different project, an  Ibero-American project that has a cultural basis, historical  roots, and common problems, a project that includes Europeans  who are not the most developed of that continent. There is a  feeling of equilibrium that would not exist if the North  Americans participated.    I think the quasi-hemispheric summit is a call to a meeting  that has [word indistinct] intentions, the same intentions and  ideas that motivated the founders of the Ibero-American summit,  but the fact that Cuba is excluded highlights the difference  between the spirit of that call and the spirit of the  Ibero-American summits. That summit is intended to establish a  policy that is not responsive to Latin America's needs, that  includes discrimination against Cuba, and that forces Latin  America to a sad dichotomy: going along with the principles set  by the United States with a revision of its 1970's policies and  turning their back on the Latin American people.    [Otero] Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

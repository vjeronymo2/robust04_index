			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Observer: Hard of hearing London Forum, the private-sector talking shop set up by GrandMet chairman Sir Allen Sheppard to promote London overseas, seems to have a bit of a communications problem. More than two months after London's business leaders held their first meeting on a battleship moored opposite the Tower of London, it is still impossible to get the telephone numbers of London Forum, and its little sister, London First, by ringing directory inquiries. It seems to confirm Observer's worst fears that the members of this odd outfit are more interested in talking than listening.</p>

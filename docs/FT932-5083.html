			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Warburg gives up Pounds 80m equity plan S. G. WARBURG, the UK's leading merchant banking group, has dropped plans to raise Pounds 80m of new equity after sounding out its leading institutional shareholders. The bank had been considering raising the new equity although there has been no formal stock exchange announcement. In the middle of the week, Cazenove, which acts as Warburg's stockbroker, took soundings from the merchant bank's institutional shareholders about whether they would be prepared to buy Pounds 80m of new convertible preference shares. That process is known as 'pre-marketing'. The broker took the view that the institutions were not keen to subscribe, and so the share sale plans were dropped. Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, refused to comment yesterday. However, the bank said at the time of its results ten days ago that it had no pressing need for new equity. At March 31, it had total capital resources of Pounds 1.2bn, including shareholders' funds of Pounds 889m. But the ratio of its shareholders' funds to gross assets, an important measure of balance-sheet strength, fell in the past year from 5.9 per cent to 4.6 per cent. The bank does not publish its risk-asset ratio, the internationally accepted measure of the strength of a bank's balance sheet. Warburg's three biggest shareholders, regarded as strong supporters of the merchant bank, are the Canadian National Railway Pension Trust Fund, with 12.3 per cent; Munich Reinsurance of Germany, with 5.8 per cent; and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life of Japan, with 4.3 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FREE SPEECH, ANARCHY AT ISSUE IN GADFLY WAR;  </P> <P> POLITICS: BURBANK OFFICIALS BELIEVE A NOVEL TACTIC WILL PERSUADE CRITICS TO  SPEAK LESS AT COUNCIL MEETINGS. THE CRITICS ARE UNPERSUADED.  </P> <P> It is after midnight on a recent Tuesday. A handful of community activists --  who have waited all night to address the City Council -- saunters up to the  podium.  </P> <P> Several council members, slouched in their chairs and looking bored, do not  even acknowledge the first man at the microphone. One councilman checks his  watch, another yawns helplessly, as the speaker launches into yet another  tirade against alleged widespread corruption in City Hall.  </P> <P> Just another typical Burbank City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Hounded and harassed by gadflies for years, the Burbank City Council has tried  numerous times to restrict public comment on non-agenda topics in an effort to  discourage verbal attacks and to shorten its seemingly endless meetings.  </P> <P> But critics of the council have repeatedly cried foul.  </P> <P> "The Bill of Rights supersedes the petty whims of council people," said Jules  Kimmett, gadfly par excellence and the only member of a group he calls  Concerned Citizens of Burbank.  </P> <P> Those seeking the podium often invoke the Constitution when they defend their  right to speak at council meetings. But state officials and legal experts say  the "right to free speech" at public meetings is a complicated legal issue and  can, in fact, be limited by local government agencies.  </P> <P> A 1987 amendment to the Ralph M. Brown Act, the state's open-meeting law,  requires all local government agencies to set aside time for public comment on  any topic. But, Deputy Atty. Gen. Ted Prim said, the law also provides those  agencies with the authority to provide "reasonable limits" on the amount of  time an individual can speak on agenda and non-agenda items.  </P> <P> Last week the Burbank council backed off from a more stringent limitation and  instead voted not to televise the second portion of "oral communications,"  hoping that would discourage some of the rambling discourses. During this  comment period, at the end of each meeting, speakers are allowed to address the  council on any topic they choose.  </P> <P> "We're trying to be responsible to the voters and deal with the business of the  city," Mayor Robert R. Bowne said in defending the council's action to limit  television coverage of its meetings. "What has happened is the direct result of  the conduct by 10 or 12 individuals who continually violate the rules of order.  I'm not going to allow important business of the city to be taken over by a  small group of people bent on anarchy."  </P> <P> Ted McConkey, a member of the Burbank Rancho homeowners group and an outspoken  critic of the City Council, disagreed, saying that better decisions are made  when the public is allowed to speak and be heard on important issues facing the  city. "The whole thing was silly," McConkey said of the council's ruling.  "Obviously, they don't like the legitimate comments of the speakers. It's not a  question of unfair criticism, but not allowing the public at home to judge for  themselves. The real losers are the people of Burbank."  </P> <P> To be sure, Burbank has its share of people who regularly attend City Council  meetings and harangue council members and city staff. In addition to Kimmett,  who regularly campaigns to recall all five council members, there is Melvin  Perlitsh, a longtime critic who has as much trouble sticking to the subject at  hand as he has adhering to the five-minute speaking limit; and S. Michael  Stavropoulos, a neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Burbank  Board of Education last year and now spends most of his time at council  meetings denouncing the board.  </P> <P> All three have been forcibly removed from City Council meetings on numerous  occasions for speaking out of order, and both Kimmett and Perlitsh have been  arrested for carrying on at school board meetings.  </P> <P> "The truth has a way of irritating people," Kimmett said.  </P> <P> The 1987 amendment to the Brown Act is designed to balance the right of the  people to address their elected officials with the need of a government body to  get its work done, Prim said. But the problem, according to Prim, is that  reasonable limits can be interpreted in different ways.  </P> <P> For example, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, following its own  interpretation of the Brown Act in 1987, voted to limit the number of times  that an individual may address the supervisors on any topic he chooses. Instead  of once a week, a person is now allowed to testify before the board only once  every 90 days on non-agenda topics.  </P> <P> In addition, no more than five people may address the board on non-agenda items  in any single meeting.  </P> <P> "We think it works pretty well," County Counsel D.W. Clinton said. "You can  draw your own conclusions as to why we did it."  </P> <P> In an unusual twist, the Los Angeles Board of Education last week voted to  limit the amount of time board members can comment on issues to five minutes  per subject in an attempt to shorten their often lengthy meetings.  </P> <P> Given the provisions of the Brown Act, there are various options that cities  have employed to limit public comment on topics on and off the agenda. Some  cities limit comment to five minutes, others to three minutes. Some  municipalities put the public comment period on non-agenda topics at the  beginning of the meeting; others, such as Burbank, put it at the end.  </P> <P> In Burbank speakers are allowed to address the council for five minutes at the  beginning of each meeting on agenda topics, and three minutes at the end of  each meeting on any topic they choose. But the number of speakers is not  limited.  </P> <P> Not all government agencies, however, have had to confront the problem. City  officials in Glendale, Thousand Oaks and even Los Angeles all say that their  meetings run pretty smoothly and that they have not felt the need to limit  discussion.  </P> <P> "Really we don't have that kind of problem," said Los Angeles Senior Assistant  City Atty. George Buchannan, who advises the Los Angeles City Council. "Sure we  have people that stand up and beat the drums and look at the television  cameras, but they don't really get belligerent. This council, which has 15  members, is pretty patient with people. I've been here 19 years and I've never  seen them turn anybody off."  </P> <P> The allusion to television cameras is not accidental; when the camera starts  rolling, existing problems seem to intensify. Bowne said that since the Burbank  council began televising its meetings on cable two years ago the gadfly problem  has grown worse.  </P> <P> And that was the reason Bowne and two other council members voted to limit  coverage of the council's meetings.  </P> <P> But Councilman Tim Murphy, who voted against the measure, said the council  should not try to decide what is appropriate for the viewer to watch.  </P> <P> "I feel uncomfortable being associated with censorship," Murphy said. "It seems  it would be easier for the viewer, if he is offended, to turn it off, than for  the government to take action and pull the plug."  </P> <P> Pomona Mayor Donna Smith, whose city is also known for boisterous public  debate, agreed with Bowne that television has probably added to the problem of  attracting gadflies. Pomona began broadcasting its meetings on community cable  television two years ago.  </P> <P> But, unlike Bowne, Smith thinks that the public would not want the city of  Pomona to tamper with television coverage of the meetings.  </P> <P> "It has its pros and cons, but the main thing is we have an informed  community," Smith said. "I really don't think the community would allow or want  the City Council to pull the plug on any portion of it. It's just too popular  here. It's the hottest thing going. I think it's better watched than 'Monday  Night Football.' "  </P> <P> But Bowne said he is confident that the council's decision "is a step in the  right direction toward conducting City Council meetings in an appropriate  manner."  </P> <P> "I want to change the image of our city," Bowne said. "I don't think we want to  have our city meetings viewed as some form of cheap entertainment. I really  feel we're doing the right thing here."  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL GADFLIES:  </P> <P> City Clerk's records on the number of times certain speakers have addressed the  Burbank City Council; records are from 28 council meetings, from May to  December 1989:  </P> <P> Jules Kimmett -- 20 times during the first oral communications session, taken  at the beginning of each council meeting; 17 times times during the second  public comment period, taken at the end of every meeting.  </P> <P> Melvin Perlitsh -- 19 times during the first oral communications; 12 times  during the second period.  </P> <P> Dave Golonski -- 15 times during first session; 11 times during second session.  </P> <P> S. Michael Stavropoulos -- 11 times during the first oral communications; 10  times during second period.MATT MOODY / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

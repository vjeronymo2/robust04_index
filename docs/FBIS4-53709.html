			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong- ku said on Monday the exchange of fuel rods at a  5-megawatt atomic reactor at Yongbyon, North Korea is believed  to have been 10 to 15 percent complete so far. Yi's remarks mean  that of the total 8,100 fuel rods at the reactor, about 1,000  have been replaced.    Speaking at a National Assembly Foreign Affairs and  Unification Committee meeting, Yi said the initial report from  an IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspection team  indicated that there is no significant problem with respect to  the storage and future gauging of selected fuel bars from the  reactor. "The IAEA will have full-fledged negotiations with  North Korea over this matter beginning Tuesday," Yi said.    Earlier in the day at a breakfast meeting hosted by the  Korean Newspaper Editors Association, Yi said his recent remarks  that "the South-North denuclearization declaration will be made  void and null if North Korea were found to have even a half  nuclear weapon" was the expression of his view directed  indirectly toward the United States.    Yi made the remarks when asked by Democratic Party Rep.  Namkung Chin what was his view of a recent statement of U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry, in which Perry spoke as if  his country would connive at one or two nuclear weapons in the  possession of North Korea.</p>

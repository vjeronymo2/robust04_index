			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 10 May -- The dismissed head of the Yemeni  Government, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, has called for a halt to  the current fighting in Yemen, abandoning any ideas to divide  the country, and using dialogue to solve the pending problems.    In an interview with the Tunisian EL-CHOUROUK, published  today, he said: Entering war is an easy task we had cautioned  against, but getting out of war is a difficult operation.    He attributed the military fighting in Yemen to the  existence  of forces he described as influential and clinging to their  positions, which reject the provisions of the agreement signed  by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali  Salim al-Bid in the Jordanian capital Amman last February.    He added: These forces have waged war to maintain their  control -- particularly the tribal one -- influence, and narrow  interests in the country, throwing experience, the union, and  everything away.    He added that the current situation in the Republic of Yemen  mixes up the militarization of the regime and the tribe and the  state, and this is the core of the problem and the main motive  of the war, which has been fed by the influential forces in the  country.    Mr. al-'Attas accused the previous leadership of Northern  Yemen of not respecting the unity agreement signed in May 1990  between the two northern and southern parts of Yemen.    He said the previous leadership of North Yemen had resorted  to "the elimination of the leading members of the Yemeni  Socialist Party through intimidation, assassinations, and  various other actions."    Al-'Attas denied the existence of a regional factor in the  fighting currently raging in Yemen. "There is no country  influencing the events in Yemen or interfering to settle  accounts," he said. "The reports talking about a role for the  neighboring states to feeding the conflict are mere hearsay and  misinformation designed to cover up the practices and behavior  in this war, in which every Yemeni is a loser, and because of  which unity, democracy and the future of Yemen in general are  being slaughtered."    Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Salih dismissed yesterday  evening Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas and appointed a  new defense minister, Staff Brigadier Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to  replace the dismissed southern Defense Minister Haytham Qasim  Tahir.</p>

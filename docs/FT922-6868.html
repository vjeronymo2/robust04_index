			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / TUC threatens to bar AEEU entry THE Amalgamated Engin-eering and Electrical Union will be told today that it will be unable to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress if it goes ahead with a merger between its electrical section and the breakaway union Cabin Crew 89. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, and Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, TUC president, will tell AEEU leaders that affiliated unions should not associate with breakaway unions. Cabin Crew 89 was formed three years ago by 5,000 former members of the TGWU general workers' union. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, has said that the TGWU will leave the TUC if the merger between Cabin Crew and the EETPU electrical section of the AEEU goes ahead. Talks between the EETPU and Cabin Crew began before the electricians merged with the AEU engineering workers at the start of this month. Although most AEU executive members would be against a Cabin Crew merger, Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general secretary, said last week that he would not allow other unions to run AEEU affairs. The talks were already likely to be tortuous before the Cabin Crew issue emerged. Since the EETPU was expelled from the TUC in 1988, it has merged with several breakaways from unions, most of which want their former members back. Moreover, leaders of both the AEU and the EETPU had questioned the value of TUC affiliation. AEEU leaders have agreed not to go ahead with the Cabin Crew merger while TUC discussions continue. However, a merger is not possible until later in the year because Cabin Crew will have to ballot its members about the move. Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, who will attend today's talks, said yesterday he was anxious to create a climate that would enable the EETPU to rejoin the TUC. The leadership of the Balpa airline pilots' union is to be contested between Mr Chris Darke, who has been recommended for the general secretary's job by the union's executive, and Mr David Lebrecht, an assistant general secretary.</p>

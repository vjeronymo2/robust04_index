			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. M. Belyakova, A. V. Kornilov, Department of </F> the Regional Geochemistry and Soil Geography, Moscow State  University; UDC 502.55(203 574.53)]    [Abstract] Metals are released by virtually all of  Chimkent's industries: cementmaking, refining, phosphorus  processing, asbestos cement construction, thermal electric power  generation, etc. The situation is worsened by the city's  tendency to develop inversion layers, coupled with low winds and  low precipitation levels. The distribution of metals in the  lower atmosphere over Chimkent was studied by analyzing the  quantity and spatial differentiation of pollution, the daily  pattern and dynamics of concentrations of toxins in relation to  synoptic-meteorological conditions, and by identifying the  sources of pollution. The experimental method of the study is  described. Lead was found to be the most hazardous pollutant,  with concentrations reaching 25-50 times the maximum permissible  concentration during some periods. The lead smelting plant and  the coal burning thermal electric plant were found to be key  sources of pollutants. Figure 1; table 1; references 6 (Russian).</p>

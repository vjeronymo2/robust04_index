			<p>BFN     [Text] A fully charged antitank mine was found on Tuesday  morning on the railroad station square in Vilnius. The police  received information about the mine at 0645. The fire brigade  and police blocked all approaches to the railroad station. The  mine was disarmed. It had been wrapped in a polyethylene bag  and could explode if touched by a passing vehicle. It took 45  minutes to eliminate the danger. During this time all  operations at the Vilnius railroad station were stopped.    The police had difficulty shutting trading kiosks as their  owners, according to policemen, preferred to lose their lives  than leave their property.</p>

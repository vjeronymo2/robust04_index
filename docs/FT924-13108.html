			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Mixed reception given to one-point reduction THE GOVERNMENT acted yesterday to head off a further slide in economic and political confidence by announcing a 1 percentage point cut in interest rates. The reduction to 8 per cent is likely to lead to lower home loans for most of Britain's 10m mortgage holders and was generally applauded in industry, although many executives said more reductions were needed to get the economy moving. On financial markets, the announcement prompted a grudging reception, on the grounds that the move smacked of a hasty response by the government to political pressures caused by mounting job losses and general economic gloom. The move to Britain's lowest base rates since mid-1988 was signalled at around noon when the Bank of England cut the rates at which it lends to the banking system. This was followed quickly by commercial banks reducing their base lending rates from 9 per cent to 8 per cent. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the decision to cut rates was 'fully consistent' with the objective of lower inflation. He said all the recent evidence in the UK and other countries was that 'disinflationary forces remain strong and confidence weak'. He added: 'Provided cost and price inflation are kept firmly under control, British industry can look forward with confidence to a pick-up in domestic and overseas sales.' Three of the biggest mortgage lenders - Abbey National, National &amp; Provincial and Northern Rock - announced cuts in mortgage rates of up to 3/4 point to 9.25 per cent. Other lenders are expected to follow soon, although few are likely to pass on the full 1-point cut. The timing of the announcement - three days after the Bank had signalled that imminent interest rate cuts were unlikely - unsettled some investors. Reflecting this, the pound was initially marked down by 2 pfennigs to a low of DM2.438. It recovered slightly, closing in London at DM2.4475 for a loss of 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar, the pound lost more than 4 cents, closing at Dollars 1.6570. In New York sterling was quoted at DM2.4400 and Dollars 1.6485 at the close. On the London stock market, shares initially gained but fell back later, with the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closing up 17.3, at 2,563.9, after at one point being 41 points ahead. Gilts closed up to a point higher. Background and reaction, Page 8 Currencies, Page 15 London shares, Page 17 Lex, Page 26 Finance and the Family, Weekend II-III</p>

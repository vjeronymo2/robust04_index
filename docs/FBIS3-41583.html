			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Nov 18 (CTK) -- The ecological policy  pursued by the Czech Government is pragmatic, not  fundamentalist, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus writes in an open  letter addressed to the former Czech Environment Ministers Ivan  Dejmal and Josef Vavrousek, and their deputies.    The environment ministry's scheme for ecological policy is a  good one, Klaus stresses in the letter, in which he responds to  a letter sent to him recently by the above mentioned figures.    The government's ecological policy is not torn out of the  context of social transformation, is not implanted in some  conceptions of `sustainable development', which are far from the  reality, but it focuses on the protection and improvement of the  environment to the extent allowed by our means, the letter says.    Ecological policy of a country depends on the country's  possibilities and it is limited by its economy, Klaus insists in  the letter. Therefore he finds it senseless and misleading to  compare the Czech Republic's spending on the environment with  those in the advanced countries.    These countries have the smallest problems with the  environment, as their economies provide them with funds to  protect it. Inappropriately high demands regarding the funding  environmental protection could stifle the Czech economy as early  as the very beginning of its transformation, Klaus stresses.</p>

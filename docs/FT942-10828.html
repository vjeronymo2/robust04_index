			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Companies' CD probe fears ease Record companies are increasingly confident they will be cleared by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of charging excessive prices for compact discs, but say they are still unsure whether the large market share of leading music retailers will be criticised. The commission's report on the music industry, launched last year, was sent to the Department of Trade and Industry last month. The DTI said yesterday that recent reports on the outcome of the inquiry were 'speculation'. Music companies say they have still not seen the commission's report. Record industry executives say the tenor of their correspondence and meetings with the commission has led them to conclude that the inquiry had moved away from the CD pricing question to the issue of music retailing. The national heritage committee's report last year criticised music producers and record retailers for charging too much for CDs. The committee said that music companies had failed to justify the difference in the prices they charged UK and US dealers for CDs. The price difference on full-price discs was between Pounds 1.50 and Pounds 2. The committee was even more critical of the industry for charging dealers Pounds 2.50 more for compact discs than for cassettes. Music companies say, however, that they expect the commission to accept that many consumer products are more expensive in the US than in the UK and that British CDs are the cheapest in Europe. Industry executives believe the position of music retailers is less clear. The national heritage committee said last year that the retail market was dominated by WH Smith, Our Price, Virgin, Woolworth and HMV, who together controlled 54 per cent of UK music stores. Last March, WH Smith, which owns Our Price, said it was merging the chain with Virgin Retail, with which it had previously had a joint venture. The committee said that large retailers had not done enough to reduce CD prices and had simply passed responsibility on to the music companies.</p>

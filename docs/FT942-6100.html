The deal comprises the purchase from Bass, for an undisclosed amount, of 59 pubs in the Midlands, London and south-east England. Mr Adam Hogg, previously an executive with Courage, and Conquest's managing director, said he welcomed the involvement of The Ann Street Brewery as the company's majority shareholder. Mr Ian Steven, Ann Street's chairman and chief executive who is also chairman of Conquest Inns, said: 'We have been looking for opportunities to invest outside the Channel Islands for some time, and Conquest Inns fits our strategy of investing in management teams in industries in which we have experience.

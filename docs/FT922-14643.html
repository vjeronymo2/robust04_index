			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Heron discloses pounds 100m losses: Property group outlines plans for rescheduling debt payments HERON International yesterday announced operating losses of Pounds 100m for the year to March 1992 - the first time in its 27-year history that Mr Gerald Ronson's private international property group has incurred losses. The disclosure came when Heron asked 80 banks and some representatives of bondholders to reschedule payments on Pounds 950m of its Pounds 1.35bn of bank debt and bonds. Bankers predicted that many lenders would reject the rescheduling terms, although they praised the 'quality' of Heron's presentation on the proposed reconstruction. One bank said bondholders would find it difficult to accept the terms because they were not being offered any 'sweeteners'. Another banker said there would be arguments about Heron's proposal that lenders to its UK subsidiary, Heron Corporation - which has Pounds 400m of debt - would not be asked to reschedule repayment of principal. Heron insists there is no question of rescheduling this debt because Heron Corp has substantial net worth. Under the proposal, Pounds 950m of bank and bond debt would be divided into two categories, 'A' and 'B'. Interest on the A debt would continue to be paid and the principal repaid from cash generated by the ongoing businesses and asset disposals. The B debt would have interest rolled up and would be repaid once the principal on the A debt was paid. Much of Heron's principal payments would thus be rescheduled to the late 1990s. Holders of Pounds 450m of Eurobonds are being asked to convert 60 per cent of their principal into A bonds and the rest into B bonds. At the 90-minute presentation, Mr Ronson said accounts for the year to March 31 would show net assets had fallen to around Pounds 135m, compared with Pounds 585m at March 1991. The bankers, chaired by Barclays which is owed around Pounds 125m, then discussed the plan. Other members of the banks' steering committee are Royal Bank of Canada, National Westminster Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, the US bank soon to merge with Chemical Bank, and Bank of America. The collapse in Heron's net asset figure will put it in breach of its banking covenants when the accounts are audited, so Heron is being forced to renegotiate the terms of its loans. However it insists that it has enough cash to meet its obligations until the end of 1993. Heron is not seeking any new borrowings. The entire investment property portfolio of around Pounds 1bn will be sold over the next seven years. There was a Pounds 250m reduction in the value of the property portfolio, which includes Pounds 135m in write-offs on UK, French and Spanish development, and Pounds 38m on housebuilding land. A significant contributor to the decline in asset value was a Pounds 134m charge in respect of Pima, a US savings and loans business. The balance of the decline came from Pounds 100m of operating losses and Pounds 100m in extraordinary charges and provisions for tax on property disposals, costs of selling property, and anticipated costs of debt renegotiation.</p>

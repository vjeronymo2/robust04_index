			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP), whose pullout has plunged the coalition government into a  minority, will seek parliamentary cooperation with the new party  Sakigake [Harbinger], a top SDP official said Monday [9 May].    SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama will visit the headquarters  of  Sakigake Tuesday for talks with Sakigake leader Masayoshi  Takemura in a bid to create a political alliance, the official  said.    The SDP wants to secure Takemura's consent to form a joint  parliamentary group between the two in a bid to confront the  fragile minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  political sources said.    The move, if materialized, might trigger a fresh momentum to  start a "second reconfiguration of the political community" by  motivating some Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rebels to join  their prospective alliance, they said.    The SDP has been seeking to bring about a convergence of  social democrat forces and liberal political forces.    However, Takemura may face some intraparty resistance to the  proposed merger with the SDP, as its 15 House of Representatives  legislators are former defectors from the conservative LDP that  has strongly upheld the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the sources  said.    The policy stand of the LDP breakaway also clashes with  other  aspects of the socialists, who have called for a scaling down of  the Self-Defense Forces and balked at the proposed expansion of  Japan's dependence on nuclear power generation, the sources said.    The SDP stormed out of the coalition on April 26 after it  was  infuriated by the sudden formation of a 130-member parliamentary  bloc comprising conservative coalition parties in the lower  house following a bitter policy row within the coalition.    The SDP has stood up to the Shinseito-led conservative  mainstream in the coalition, which has called for a hike in the  consumption tax and close security cooperation with the U.S.  Forces to deal with a possible contingency on the Korean  peninsula.    The SDP's Murayama earlier suggested that close cooperation  with Sakigake would help alleviate the voter perception of the  party as a left-leaning ideological hard-liner, saying,  "cooperation with Sakigake will change the image of the SDP."</p>

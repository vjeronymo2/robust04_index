			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin Fletcher in Washington and Arthur </F> Leathley: "U.S. Visa for Adams Angers No. 10"]    [Text] President Clinton rebuffed and angered the British  Government last night by granting Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein  leader, a restricted visa to enter America to attend a  conference on Northern Ireland in New York tomorrow.    The President did so despite his Administration's failure to  elicit from Mr Adams the unequivocal renunciation of violence  and declaration of support for the Anglo-lrish peace effort that  it had agreed with Britain should be the minimum conditions for  letting him in.    The decision comes on the eve of the visit to Washington by  Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, and seems certain to raise new  questions about the so-called "special relationship" since Mr  Clinton took power. It is almost inconceivable that the Bush or  Reagan Administrations would have delivered such a public slap  in the face to America's closest ally.    Though the move caught Downing Street officials by surprise,  they said the decision to provide a visa was "a matter for the  U.S." British officials in Washington were making  representations to the White House at the weekend. Putting a  brave face on events, Downing Street said it hoped the New York  conference would impress on Mr Adams the need to end violence  permanently. There was no indication that John Major considered  Mr Adams's words as amounting to an acceptance of U.S.  conditions.    Mr Adams said last night that he had received no official  notification of the American decision but had had "a very  interesting exchange of views" with American consular officials.  He said he had not been asked to renounce violence.    John D. Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said the  decision was despicable and that the Clinton Administration had  "given in" to pressure from the Irish lobby in Washington.    Mr Clinton has been under pressure to let in Mr Adams from  Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose  support he needs for his health care reforms, and from 38  congressmen who argue that the U.S. should foster "constructive  dialogue" instead of violence.    The State and Justice Departments and the FBI had agreed  with  Britain that Mr Adams's application should be rejected because  of his terrorist links, as eight before it had been. Their views  were apparently overruled by the National Security Council and  by Nancy Soderberg, NSC third-in-command and a former aide to  Senator Kennedy. The White House said Mr Clinton supported the  decision which he believed would "help advance the cause of  peace in Northern Ireland."</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SKY DIVER HURT IN JUMP AS CHUTE OPENS IN PLANE  </P> <P> A sky diver whose parachute inadvertently opened inside a plane was forced to  leap when only 800 feet off the ground but landed in a clump of trees and  survived.  </P> <P> He was listed in guarded condition at a hospital, apparently with back  injuries.  </P> <P> The chute had caught on the plane's door, opened and was sucked outside. "He  had to jump out. Otherwise he would have been pulled through the wall of the  airplane," a witness said. He said sky divers typically prefer jumps from 5,000  to 10,000 feet.  </P> <P> Drag from the partly opened chute helped break the man's fall Sunday and may  have saved his life, a companion said.  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (16): Modest planning prevails  -Kevin Done follows the progress of VW's investment in Skoda The Czech government has been given a bumpy ride by Volkswagen, since it chose the German carmaker four years ago to take control of Skoda, the Czech car producer. In the euphoria that surrounded VW's ambitious forays into eastern Europe, the group made lavish promises about the scale of the future investment planned for Skoda. In early 1991 VW said that it planned capital investments totalling DM9.5bn for Skoda by the end of the decade. It would more than double Skoda's production capacity to about 390,000 cars a year and it would build a new engine plant. Subsequent events have been a sobering experience both for VW and for the authorities in Prague. The original contract agreed in 1991, which gave VW an initial 31 per cent stake and management control, has been under renegotiation for the past 15 months following Volkswagen's withdrawal without warning in the autumn of 1993 from a prestige DM1.4bn project finance facility for Skoda. Since the signing of the original contract conditions have changed drastically at VW itself and in the European car market, and the company accepts that its initial planning was hugely over-optimistic. 'There was the thinking that the future could only be bright and clear,' admits Mr Volkhard Kohler, Skoda vice-chairman. 'But today we can see there are risks . . . When the iron curtain came down there were ideas that you could speed up development, but today it is clear that that cannot happen,' he says. Volkswagen itself was also overcome by the recession in west Europe. It plunged into record losses of DM1.94bn in 1993. The robust regime initiated by Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial chairman of the VW group management board who was appointed at the beginning of 1993, set out to cut costs to the bone, and the Skoda project has been subjected to the same relentless review as the rest of the group's operations, with little regard to the sensitivities of VW's partners. But late last month VW and the Czech government initialled a new agreement giving Prague backing for a revised development plan for Skoda and including a commitment from VW to the further development of the Czech automotive components industry. Under the terms of the deal VW has won approval for a more modest capacity expansion, and it has dropped the plan for a new engine plant. The current capital spending plan totals about DM3.7bn from 1991 to 2000, but this amount can be reduced further if VW can find additional investment cost savings. Volkswagen has agreed to raise Skoda production capacity to 340,000 a year by the late 1990s from about 230,000 at present. Its plans include: A second car range for Skoda, due to be launched in 1996-97. This large family car range will have a unique Skoda body and interior, but will be part of the VW group's ambitious strategy to rationalise its product development and engineering operations. It will derive from the VW's so-called 'A' platform, which will also form the basis for the next generation VW Golf. Building a new paint plant at Skoda's main production facility at Mlada Boleslav. Building a new assembly plant for the second car range. Development of Skoda's existing all-aluminium 1.3 litre engine for use in both its planned car ranges and for possible use by Seat, the VW group's Spanish subsidiary. The addition next year of estate car and pick-up versions of the new Skoda Felicia small family car range - unveiled in October as the replacement for the outdated Favorit. Continued reduction of the size of the Skoda workforce as productivity is raised. It will fall to under 16,000 in 1995 from more than 17,000 last year, and could be reduced by a further 3-4,000 over the next five years. As part of the new agreement VW has secured full title to the use of the Skoda brand name - previously disputed by Skoda Pilzen, the Czech engineering group - and has resolved all property title disputes over the Skoda plants. The deal opens the way for Volkswagen to raise its 31 per cent holding to 60.3 per cent by the end of December - including the conversion of preference stock into ordinary voting shares - and to 70 per cent by the end of 1995. In total, VW will have paid in three tranches DM1.4bn for the 70 per cent stake - DM200m to the Czech government for the acquisition of part of its holding and DM1.2bn in new equity capital for Skoda. The development of a more efficient Czech component industry was a key element in the original VW acquisition of Skoda, and its renewed commitment to this programme will be part of the new agreement with the government. According to Mr Kohler 'a velvet revolution' is under way in the Czech supply industry. Since VW moved into Skoda nearly four years ago about 40 joint venture components operations have been established, which already supply 44 per cent of Skoda's purchases of materials. A further 6.5 per cent of purchases come from greenfield site operations. About 80 per cent of Skoda's total purchases of CKr21bn a year are made in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and more than half of total purchases are already coming from suppliers with access to western technology. VW is now seeking to break new ground at Skoda by establishing supplier operations directly inside the car plant, moving a step head even of the Japanese model of having suppliers grouped in close proximity to the plant. Three suppliers - Lucas, Johnson Controls and Pelzer - already work inside the Skoda plant, producing respectively rear axles, seats and carpets.</p>

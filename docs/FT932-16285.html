			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BA hit by broker revisions UK FLAG carrier British Airways fell sharply as a number of securities houses, including the company's broker, lowered profits forecasts. One analyst is believed to have reduced his prediction by a third. The shares were also depressed by worries over passenger yield. The initial decline came when the shares were marked lower to take account of the 7.54p final dividend, brought forward by the company to beat tax changes announced in the Budget last month. However, dealers then became concerned about passenger yield figures ahead of the release of traffic data for March. Although these revealed an 11.8 per cent increase on a year ago, in line with market expectations, the airline confirmed that passenger yields remained under pressure, prompting heavy selling of the shares. UBS, the company's broker, downgraded its current year profits prediction by around Pounds 30m to Pounds 320m, which still leaves it at the top of the market range. Another leading securities house was said to have cut its figure by Pounds 100m to Pounds 200m. The market was also concerned about the possibility of a price war on both BA's European and Atlantic routes. The shares lost 12 1/2 at 275p xd, with turnover rising to 5.7m.</p>

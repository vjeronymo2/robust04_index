			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Appld Holographics Improved control of overheads and other costs enabled Applied Holographics to cut interim losses from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 681,000 pre-tax. Within the results of this USM-quoted designer and producer of holograms, the UK holographic activities were profitable while the foil activities of TAPF suffered a loss as did the US operations. Turnover for the six months to September 30 was static at Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.47m). The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest charges of Pounds 34,000, compared with income of Pounds 75,000. Losses per share came out at 4.5p (8.7p).</p>

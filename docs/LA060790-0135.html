			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTY A 'HERO' FOR PERSISTENCE IN HIT-RUN CASE  </P> <P> It was a haunting hit-and-run case, Sheriff's Deputy Guy Van Sickle remembers,  the kind he just couldn't get out of his mind.  </P> <P> A young Mexican immigrant, working seven days a week to save up enough money to  buy a truck, had been killed March 24 when a car ran a red light and hit him  broadside as he bicycled across Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance.  </P> <P> The victim, 24-year-old Jorge Rodelo, was dragged beneath the car for more than  100 feet, severing one of his legs and strewing bicycle and car parts along the  street, police said.  </P> <P> A witness told police that the car's driver continued on for more than a  quarter-mile before he pulled over, yanked Rodelo's bicycle loose from the  front of his car, and sped away.  </P> <P> Armed with a partial description of the car and its driver, Van Sickle began  patrolling his beat, keeping a special eye out for gold-colored Firebirds and  Camaros. On Wednesday, his efforts paid off when Torrance police arrested a  suspect based on information Van Sickle provided about a car he had stopped on  May 13.  </P> <P> Investigators now believe that John Tupeona Tago, 26, of Wilmington, was  driving the gold 1972 Pontiac Firebird that struck and killed Rodelo. Tago  reportedly had borrowed the car for the day from his brother -- who apparently  was driving the car when it was stopped by Van Sickle.  </P> <P> Investigators said Tago, who does not yet have a lawyer, has denied any  involvement in the accident.  </P> <P> After being notified on Tuesday that police had a warrant for his arrest, Tago  agreed to surrender Wednesday morning. He was being held in lieu of $11,000  bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on one count of felony hit-and-run  driving and one count of misdemeanor manslaughter today.  </P> <P> The arrest follows an eight-week search by Van Sickle -- who made the case a  priority even though it was not officially a Sheriff's Department  investigation. He learned of the fatal accident after it was reported over  police radio.  </P> <P> For roughly two months, the Lomita sheriff's deputy stayed on the alert as he  cruised, checking cars in his rear-view mirror for signs of front-end damage  and stopping at least 10 cars for a closer look and a chat with the driver.  Though each possibility fell through, Van Sickle refused to give up.  </P> <P> "It was the principle of it that got to me, I guess," Van Sickle explained  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "A crime like this, it sticks with me," he said. "I felt for (Rodelo) and his  family and I guess I felt anger toward the guy who did it. He willfully took  off. He knew what he was doing. He hit this guy and just kept on going. . . . I  just kept looking, every day."  </P> <P> Torrance Police Officer Dale Robbins, who investigated the case, said he might  never have found a suspect without Van Sickle's efforts.  </P> <P> "He's our hero in this," Robbins said. "That deputy made the case for us. For  him to have beaten the bush and read the teletypes. . . . We weren't getting  anywhere until he brought our attention to this car."  </P> <P> Robbins said broken car parts found at the scene of the accident, including a  portion of a car's front grill, matched pieces missing from the impounded  Firebird. He said lab technicians also found bits of fabric stuck to the car's  undercarriage that matched clothing worn by Rodelo on the day he was killed.  </P> <P> "The grill piece just fit right in there, like a missing piece from a puzzle,"  Robbins said. "So we knew we had the right car. . . . We had to figure out who  was driving it."  </P> <P> Police took photos of Tago, his brother and four men not related to the case  and showed the six pictures to the man who witnessed the accident. He  identified Tago as the driver he saw hit Rodelo, Robbins said.  </P> <P> Tago "has been cooperative, but he will not admit to the accident," Robbins  said.  </P> <P> Rodelo's family said they are pleased that police did not give up on the case.  </P> <P> "We just wanted to find the guy so that nothing would happen to another family  like (what) happened to this family," said Mayra Rodriguez, 20, one of Rodelo's  cousins. "Nothing is going to bring (Rodelo) back, but we want justice."  </P> <P> She said her cousin was a quiet, hard-working man who had been an elementary  school teacher in Mexicali, Mexico, before a teacher's strike there led him to  move to Harbor City two years ago. He had been taking English classes at Harbor  College in Wilmington, preparing to be a teacher here.  </P> <P> In recent months, Rodelo had been working two jobs -- five days as a  gasket-maker at a Torrance engineering firm and two days at a Redondo Beach  coffee shop as a cook -- to save up for a new truck. He was $200 short of his  goal when he was killed, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> He habitually sent a portion of his earnings back to his mother and two younger  brothers in Mexico to help support them, Rodriguez said. Last year, he bought  an old station wagon and drove it to Mexicali to give to his mother.  </P> <P> "He was working so hard, taking care of everyone," she said, starting to cry  softly.  </P> <P> "What kind of human could do this? (The driver) even stopped the car to get the  bike (out of the way). . . . How could someone do something like this?"  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Brussels pulls back curtain The European Commission yesterday adopted plans to make the conduct of EC business less secretive, establishing the principle that most EC documents should be made available on demand, writes Lionel Barber. It is also moving tentatively toward creation of a register of lobbyists, but both these moves depend on agreement with the European parliament. A database would be set up on interest groups which would be open to the parliament, Commission and public. Also planned is a directory of all non-profit organisations; commercial groups would form their own register and a draft code of conduct. Under the new guidelines, documents would remain confidential if their disclosure were judged damaging to national security, monetary stability, judicial procedures, commercial confidentiality, personal privacy, or the EC's financial interests.</p>

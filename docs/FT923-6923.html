			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Moscow to reorganise trade ties RUSSIA is yet again to reorganise its foreign economic relations by setting up an Agency for International Co-operation and Development, embracing foreign investment, debt and international organisations, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. The move means the abolition of the Foreign Investment Committee headed by Mr Leonid Grigoriev, who was yesterday said to be unsure whether he would be kept on in the new agency. The latter will be headed by Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for foreign economic relations, a post itself created only a few months ago to supplement the existing Foreign Economic Relations Ministry. President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree for a new mineral resources tax in Russia. Interfax news agency quoted the president's office as saying that this would be levied on enterprises exploiting the country's richest oil and gas fields, with the aim to prevent superficial development and waste of resources. No details were available about the size of the tax or whether foreign joint ventures will be liable to pay it.</p>

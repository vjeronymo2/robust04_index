			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Advertising is not harmless Sir, I have just read your most interesting article about the advertising of toys, particularly on television ('Harnessing pester power', December 23). I think the statement by Mr Peter Waterman, vice-president of corporate affairs at Hasbro, that 'advertising to children is an entirely harmless activity', is the most cynical I have read in a long time. All over Britain parents are being made to feel guilty because they cannot spend huge sums or are building up huge debts that will cripple their lives for months to come. As a teacher and mother, I happen to think that this is extremely harmful. Britain obviously lags behind other countries in controlling this insidious exploitation.

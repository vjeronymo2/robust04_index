			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has  announced it has stopped granting "soft loans" at a low interest  rate to Thailand, saying the economic growth of the kingdom is  now at a level where it no longer qualifies for these  concessionary interest rate loans.    The bank said Thailand's annual economic growth rate had  remained consistently high and the average yearly per capita  income was now US$2,300 per annum which now disqualifies it from  receiving the low interest rate soft loans. The maximum income  per capita allowable is US$1,800.    ADB had previously sent a report to the Finance Ministry,  saying that in the next decade Thailand looked set to become a  new major industrial force in the region, bringing it up to the  status of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.    The bank said it was obligated to distribute concessionary  loans of this kind to more deserving cases, countries which have  less developed economies and lower income rates than Thailand.    According to the report, the bank plans to grant soft loans  to east European and Latin American countries. Initially, it  will allocate around US$500,000 million for the granting of such  loans. The bank will, however grant soft loans totaling US$500  million to Thailand's state enterprises, although it did not go  into detail about this.    Somchai Ruchupan, director-general of the Fiscal Policy  Office, said the withdrawal of this loan privilege will not  seriously affect Thailand's development as Thailand can seek  loans from alternative sources.    A source at the Finance Ministry said ADB ceased granting  loans of this type as of February this year.</p>

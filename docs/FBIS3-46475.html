The Prime Minister said the country would progress further  if  the people adopted a moderate approach, were not greedy and  careful in their outlook.    Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia was successful because its people  had not forgotten their struggle and objectives. He said this  in his New Year message over Radio and Television Malaysia  tonight.    The Prime Minister said the peace, stability, prosperity and  progress now enjoyed by Malaysians did not come by accident.  Much of it was the result of hard work and co-operation from  all sides -- the rakyat [people], Government, workers and  entrepreneurs.    The concentration of efforts by everyone had helped Malaysia  achieve encouraging performance in all fields throughout 1993,  he said.    Dr. Mahathir said societies in any country wished for  prosperity. This led to the creation of numerous theories and  ideologies like socialism and communism as well as a welfare  state system.    Wanting to have equality among the people is good but these  ideologies do not take into account the human consideration.    "Equality among us exists only at birth, when we are all  clean of any sins. Whether or not we succeed to become decent  human beings when we grow up depends on our attitude and efforts.    "Others can help us. The Government can help us but in the  end, what will bring us success is our own effort."    Dr. Mahathir said this was why the people could not hope for  society or the Government to provide all the facilities as  promised by a western-style welfare state.    He said: "Having only one section of the people working hard  and with full responsibility while others who have less work and  responsibility enjoy similar wages is not a sound practice.    "If everyone is given equal benefits, no one will want to  carry a heavy task. And there is no way to make work equally  light."    Dr. Mahathir said attempts to provide an equal salary for  different types of jobs would only obstruct progress.    "A country that does not progress and prosper will not be  able to provide a good life for its people. What is easy to  divide equally is poverty and a hard life."    A welfare state which depends on the forces of law will not  succeed as one, which is why they, along with the communist and  socialist states, are facing declining economies.    "But this does not mean that welfare states cannot exist at  all. They can if the people who are capable and efficient are  allowed to freely seek wealth.    "If a society has caring qualities and is always ready to  donate to those in need, then a welfare state can exist. But  the intention is not for those less fortunate to be as rich as  the donors.    "The intention is to help those who have not succeeded, for  whatever reason."    If this happens, then the gap between the poor and the rich  would not be too wide, he said.    The Government would still have a role in a welfare state.  It would impose taxes on the rich to help finance facilities  which are used by all, he said.    But he pointed out that the taxes should not be too high  that  they would demoralise those who can increase their wealth.    "Those efficient in seeking wealth are useful to the welfare  of society and country. Without them, or as in the communist  countries where they are not allowed to amass wealth, there will  be no one from whom the Government can collect taxes which could  be utilised in the public's interest."    Dr. Mahathir said the theory that the Government could carry  out business and reap all the profits and not just a part of it  through taxes was baseless.    Businesses carried out by a government often face losses,  especially if all its members and staff are paid equally as  suggested by communism and socialism.    Moreover, the government bureaucratic system limits  management from acting as a business operator. As such profits  are difficult to obtain.    "The experience in Malaysia is that government companies  need  the government's help all the time."    Dr. Mahathir said government-owned companies often faced  demands for pay hikes and threats of strikes from its workers.    "If the demands are not entertained, there is a possibility  that the Government will not get the support when a general  election is held. On the other hand, by entertaining the  demands, losses will be greater or the prices of goods will  increase.    "The Government's income will be reduced and it cannot  finance supply for public interest," he said.    The Prime Minister said the Government, on the other hand,  cannot seek excessive profits. Therefore, the Government as a  business owner cannot pay good salaries to its employees.    "With a low pay, the people working with the government in a  western welfare-style state, cannot afford expensive goods which  normally give higher profits."    Dr. Mahathir drew attention to Malaysia's unique philosophy  in which all sides are given suitable freedom because the  Government believes that everyone -- from manual workers to  businessmen, investors, politicians and managers, had a role to  play.    "They each have a different role but they all contribute to  progress," he said.    Dr. Mahathir spoke of the rise of communism and socialism in  the West during a time when investors, once regarded as highly  important, became so greedy that they did not value the role of  workers and managers.    But he cautioned that a communist and socialist society in  which workers were given too much emphasis would not bring  success and fairness.    Today, Dr. Mahathir said, the Western societies were putting  too much value on managers who are believed to hold the key in  the success of a business or operation.    Because of this, the managers demanded very high salaries  with bonuses and share option schemes and all sorts of perks.    In Malaysia, a similar approach was developing. Managers  were demanding high salaries and perks. He said that there had  been instances when managers were demanding wages and other  benefits valued at almost RM [Malaysian ringgit] 2 million a  year.    He said it was this kind of a greedy approach that led to  the  big corporate giants in the United States to decline. They  placed so much emphasis on quick profits that they did not  invest in research and development or expansion.    The Prime Minister said: "We must remember that we all have  a role to play. Whether we are manual labourers or owners of  companies whether we are in the public or private sector, no one  can consider himself more important that he does not depend on  others.    "Big or small, we all have our roles to play. Therefore, we  should place a value and appreciate every effort fairly."</p>

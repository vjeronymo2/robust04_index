			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / US gets ready to redraw its electoral map: Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington, identifies some of the changes in the political landscape exposed on the long road to the White House EVEN before the votes are finally counted tonight, the analysts will be dissecting the entrails of this election. Their purpose will be to draw up a new national electoral map, not merely to identify where the winning candidate put together his majority, but how and why. The American electorate is a remarkable overlapping hodgepodge, in which quite small shifts of allegiance can determine who inhabits the White House. Its main constituent parts are obvious. Men and women, young, middle-aged and old, middle class and working class, caucasian and minorities, town, country and suburbs. Given the decline in the influence of the two main political parties, each component part has been the target of the candidates. Women, for example, tend to vote now in greater numbers than men. But women cannot be reduced to a simple bloc. They may well have a tendency to vote more for 'peace' than 'war,' which helped President George Bush among Republican women in his primary struggles against the more bellicose Mr Pat Buchanan, but the election proper has not provided such a sharp contrast. Pollsters, for example, detect marked differences between women in the labour force and those who stay at home looking after families. Both are concerned about economic issues, but both seem to display different perceptions, because they receive different messages, about the nature of the country's problems. If Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, does win today, the post-election analysis is likely to show that he benefited from a gender edge over Mr Bush and that it will probably be most pronounced among women who work and who, therefore, may well be juggling employment and family responsibilities. The Republican appeal to traditional family values, so much a feature of the Houston convention though played down later, may well be seen as ill-conceived, perhaps even a fundamental mistake. Both Mr Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent, score more heavily among men than, on balance, does Mr Clinton. In part this may reflect the outwardly 'macho' nature of Mr Bush's campaign, conducted in attacking, sometimes militaristic, terms. For the Bush-Perot generation, not to have worn military uniform may well indeed be a sign of an insufficient manhood. But it is also possible that this election will show as much of a generation gap as a gender gap. This would be a complete reversal from the 1980s, when a politically disengaged younger generation felt perfectly comfortable with President Ronald Reagan, if it voted at all. The shift may principally reflect a decline in employment prospects for the more affluent college-educated young, the quintessential 'yuppies' of the prosperous 1980s. But it may also be attributable to the appeal of the 'baby boomer' generation embodied in the Clinton-Gore ticket. A key element in the Clinton message has been the need to pick up again the cause of government involvement in the nation's affairs that was so much a feature of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations of the 1960s, when he and Senator Gore came of political age. The Bush counter has been to highlight what he sees as the risks inherent in activist government, particularly its 'tax and spend' proclivities. Mr Clinton, however, has continued to insist that the middle class will benefit from tax cuts under his regime. In effect, he has been trying to re-awaken a constituency which had repaired to the suburbs and become politically less active during the Reagan years. Four out of 10 Americans live in suburbs. As such they constitute the largest, albeit amorphous, national group, and it is not for nothing in the final days that Mr Clinton has been stressing his own middle class credentials. The skilled American working class, suburban or inner city, and often ethnically strong, was also prime territory for the Republicans in the 1980s. It has also been among the most economically vulnerable in the downturn of the past two years. It obviously no longer responds in a reflexive political manner to the dictates of its union leadership. Nowhere is disaffection with the established political parties more evident than among skilled blue collar workers, especially in the 'rust belt' states. This was where former Governor Jerry Brown did best in the Democratic primaries and, apart from Texas and the independent-inclined mountain states, is where Mr Perot carries most appeal today. The engagement of minorities this year is very hard to predict, not least because it has become so diversified. There is, for example, a substantial difference between the inclinations of Hispanic Americans in Florida on the one hand and in New York and Los Angeles on the other. Florida's Cubans have tended to vote Republican, whereas New York's Puerto Ricans and California's and Texas's Mexicans have tended to prefer Democrats, though not to the point of heavy turn-out. Black Americans are, of course, overwhelmingly Democratic and there are polls suggesting that Mr Clinton commands the allegiance of upwards of 80 per cent of them. But again, the question is whether they vote in sufficient numbers to make a difference. Cutting across all the socio-economic divides must be the public's assessment of the character of the candidates themselves. Mr Bush's campaign had shrewdly worked out that if this was an election that became a referendum on the state of the economy, it was unwinnable. It therefore became necessary to discredit Mr Clinton as an individual - by whatever available means. Americans like fighting campaigns and have become pretty much accustomed to seeing them waged ruthlessly. What is incalculable is the extent to which they may sense that there are lines which should not be crossed. They certainly seem to have proved tolerant of Mr Clinton's past, while not resolving all their doubts about his suitability. They have repeatedly emphasised their dislike of orchestrated smears, and their preference for discussion of issues of substance. The evidence is, however, also that they are still not over-enamoured with the choices on offer. The New York Times this week summed up the public perception: 'Mr Bush is out of touch, Mr Clinton is slick, Mr Perot is flaky.' It is not the sort of national mood that is likely to give an overwhelming popular mandate to any of them.</p>

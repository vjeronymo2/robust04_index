			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Watchdog reassured on power reliability THE OVERALL reliability and security of the electricity transmission and distribution systems in England, Scotland and Wales have been maintained since privatisation, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, said yesterday. In his annual report on the industry, he detailed the performance of individual electricity supply companies by supplying data on the number of interruptions and the time taken to restore supplies. These showed wide variations, with London Electricity suffering fewer than 50 supply interruptions per 100 customers while South Wales Electricity (Swalec) and Hydro-Electric suffered about four times as many. But several of the regional electricity companies in England and Wales reported exceptional weather conditions which added to operating difficulties. Prof Littlechild said many electricity companies were now targeting the high-voltage system as the best way to increase overall performance at lowest cost. He said he would ensure that customers gained the best value for money.</p>

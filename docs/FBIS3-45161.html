			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Major Shock Is Likely To Be Caused in the </F> Reorganization of the Three-Tiered Assemblies"]    [Text] The three-tiered administrative structure of the  British Hong Kong Government must be disbanded in 1997 together  with the end of British rule and administration in Hong Kong.  This is the inevitable consequence of the British side's act in  undermining the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995  electoral arrangements. In a recent statement, the spokesman  for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office made  this point plain so that Hong Kong people could clearly see the  development of events and would make joint efforts with the  Chinese side to reorganize the three-tiered assemblies in 1997  in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law.  This will be conducive to the smooth transition of Hong Kong.    Hong Kong people generally hope for Sino-British cooperation  to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and to effect  the smooth transfer of government in 1997. When Chris Patten  dished out his "three violation" constitutional reform package,  many social organizations and activists opposed it and urged him  to return to the path of "three conformities" to restore  cooperation with the Chinese side. When the Sino-British talks  on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements began, Hong Kong  people generally hoped that China and Britain would reach an  agreement so that the political structure before and after 1997  would converge. However, although the Chinese side made great  efforts to strive for the conclusion of an agreement and made a  series of compromises, the British side continued to  deliberately impede the talks from proceeding in line with the  "three conformity" principle. Finally, Patten brought part of  his constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council and  this led to the total termination of the Sino-British talks.    Facts during the past year and more repeatedly showed that  the British side had no intention of following Hong Kong  people's wishes nor of keeping its own promise and settling  problems through talks in accordance with the "three conformity"  principle. Hong Kong people's hopes have completely fallen  through and the Chinese side's efforts were also in vain. Hong  Kong people cannot but discard their illusions of the British  side and join the Chinese in doing intensive preparatory work in  all fields for recovering Hong Kong.    The British refuse to cooperate but the sky will not fall  down. In 1997, the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies  may cause certain shocks but Hong Kong people do not need to  worry about this. President Jiang Zemin recently reiterated in  his new year message to Hong Kong compatriots that "no matter  what happens, we shall be of one heart and one mind with Hong  Kong patriotic compatriots in all circles and the principle of  'one country, two systems' will remain unchanged, the principle  of maintaining the Basic Law will remain unchanged, and our  determination to resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong  will remain unchanged. Hong Kong will certainly be able to  maintain long-term prosperity and stability and we have  sufficient ability to do this and have full confidence in this."  Obviously, the reorgnaization of the three-tiered assemblies in  1997 will certainly be made strictly according to the principles  specified by the Basic Law. Therefore, the reorganized  three-tiered assemblies will give expression to the principles  of the Basic Law and will guarantee the balanced participation  of all social strata in local administrative affairs. This  prospect should be clear.    At the same time, the Chinese side will also listen  extensively to Hong Kong people's opinions on the way to  reorganize the three- tiered assemblies. It is believed that  after the three-tiered political structure of the British Hong  Kong authorities is disbanded, members of the three-tiered  assemblies elected in 1994 or 1995 may still be able to reenter  the assemblies as long as they satisfy the requirements  specified by the Basic Law, love China and love Hong Kong, and  are willing to continue to serve the local community. In short,  as long as the vast number of Hong Kong residents actively  support the work of the Preliminary Work Committee and make  joint efforts with the Chinese Government, the shock caused by  the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies will be  reduced to a minimum and Hong Kong's long-term stability and  prosperity will certainly be maintained. Hong Kong compatriots  should completely set their minds at rest on this point.    The colonial government will come to an end on 30 June 1997.  Hong Kong people completely support China's recovery of  sovereignty over Hong Kong and the implementation of the "one  country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong. They will be masters  of Hong Kong and Hong Kong will continue to be their home after  1997. Therefore, they know that the British who will return  home after the Union Flag is lowered may not take a responsible  attitude toward Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997.  Only the Chinese Government shares the same interests with Hong  Kong people and really cares about post-1997 prosperity and  stability and will inevitably assume a responsible attitude in  adopting the transitional measures. Therefore, the sooner  preparations are made to get rid of Patten's disruptive role by  working out the method of forming the first three-tiered  assembly structure of the special adminsitrative region, the  more favorable things will be for a smooth transition.    As long as the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies  constantly follows the principle of orderly and gradual  progress, respects history, and gives consideration to the  current reality, then the work can be done in line with the  principles specified by the Basic Law and can be suited to the  actual needs in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity.    Moreover, the fact of China's vigorous economic development  is greatly conducive to Hong Kong's post-1997 stable  development. Hong Kong and the mainland are closely  interdependent. The Chinese Government will certainly try by  every possible means to keep Hong Kong's existing social system  unchanged, to ensure the stable and smoth development of  democratic politics, and to continuously raise the living  standards of the local residents. This will be favorable to  China's four modernizations and will also be conducive to the  practice of "one country, two systems."    The Chinese Government will also give consideration to the  performances of foreign companies and Hong Kong enterprises  which have made contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and  stabiity in the transitional period and will offer them more  favorable conditions to seek future development in the mainland  market. Cooperation will benefit both sides. Those who follow  Patten in disrupting the order in Hong Kong will have no future.  Those who cooperate with China and help keep Hong Kong's  stability will have very bright futures. All foreign and local  businessmen not support the reform package which just creates  confrontation and trouble. Therefore, Patten will have less and  less influence as he finds scant support for his unjust cause.  On the other hand, China will enjoy abundant support for its  just cause of striving for Hong Kong's smooth transition. China  will also be able to achieve the goal of preventing any shocks  appearing in Hong Kong in 1997.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu to cut prices of desktop PCs FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer maker, is to sell desktop PCs at substantially reduced prices, in a move that promises to fan the fierce price competition in the Japanese PC market. Fujitsu's move follows an announcement earlier this month by NEC, Japan's number one PC manufacturer with 53 per cent share of the market, that it will introduce a series of desktop PCs priced substantially lower than previous models. Fujitsu declined to reveal the price range for its new low-cost series but said they were likely to be comparable to those of NEC's lower-priced series. Japanese computer manufacturers have long been able to maintain high prices due to their strong hold over the domestic market. But recently they have been forced by the introduction of cut-price US machines to review their pricing strategies. Compaq, for example, announced a machine at about half the price of comparable Japanese machines. The Fujitsu move leaves Toshiba alone among the top five manufacturers in Japan to maintain its traditionally high pricing strategy.</p>

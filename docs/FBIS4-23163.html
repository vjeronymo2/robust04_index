			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 30 SAPA -- A draft document  approved by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] as the  basis for a national policy for the defence industry was  released in Johannesburg on Monday [30 May]. The draft policy  was produced by the TEC's sub-council on defence and approved by  the TEC in April as the basis for the government's defence  industry policy.    The document says that because the defence industry is one  of  the country's major assets "it would not be in the national  interest to totally discard it". However, the new defence  industry policy should be seen within broader political and  moral considerations as part of the general industrial policy  for manufacturing in South Africa. The draft document calls for  retention of some of the defence industry's capabilities for  military and security application, but also proposes  diversification and conversion to meet civilian market needs. A  diversification council has been recommended to encourage this.    According to the proposals, no new industry establishment,  through state funding, should be undertaken where capabilities  already exist in the public or private sector.    Central to the new defence policy is the retention of  research and development spending at the current level of R420  million [rand] a year. Unless the expenditure is maintained the  industry will lose its technological edge and much of its design  and development capabilities, the working document states. A  joint management system has been recommended for technology  development and to co-ordinate long-term planning of all  military research and development. The draft proposals say the  state should encourage industry to invest in defence research  and development.    Turning to an arms trade policy, the proposal includes the  development by the Defence Ministry and the approval by a  parliamentary defence sub-committee of guidelines regarding  customers of conventional armaments. A list of recipient  countries should be approved by a cabinet committee. Armaments  should be sold only to recognised governments and not to  guerrilla or other movements, the document proposes.    It also says South Africa should refrain from trading in  weapons of mass destruction, while the present system of arms  trade control should be rationalised. The Defence Ministry  should control all arms exports and imports and related  technology transfers on behalf of the government. Wherever  possible, South Africa should reveal the type of products it  sells and who its clients are by contributing to the United  Nations conventional arms registers -- provided trading partners  approve of such disclosures.    According to the proposals, South Africa should no longer  strive for complete self-sufficiency in arms, as this is neither  affordable nor necessary. In certain areas the policy should be  to purchase overseas, in others to procure on a competitive  basis, while in strategic areas limited self-sufficiency should  be maintained.    Turning to the acquisition of defence systems, equipment and  services, the working group recommended the Defence Ministry  should be responsible for planning and budgeting for the SA  [South African] National Defence Force. Certain regulatory and  policy-making functions currently performed by Armscor should  also be handled by the ministry.    The draft also proposes greater transparency and  accountability to parliament, the public and to the  auditor-general.    Speaking at a news briefing in a Johannesburg hotel, Dr  Andre  Buys, the convenor of the TEC working group that produced the  proposals, stressed the document was merely a draft. It was  being submitted to an open, public debate where it should be  considered in terms of South Africa's security, socio-economic  and industrial policy requirements. This was a move away from  past policy-making behind closed doors, he said. "We are  inviting criticism and debate in the spirit of democracy," Dr  Buys said.</p>

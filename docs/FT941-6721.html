			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Four Hungarian state companies put up for sale Hungary yesterday launched the country's Ft4bn (Pounds 25.8m) mass privatisation programme by announcing the first four public offerings in hotel chain Pannonia, plastics manufacturer Pannonplast, brewer Soproni Sorgyar and food retailer Global TH, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. A tranche of state shares in the national telecoms company, Matav, which remains after the Dollars 875m sale of 30 per cent to Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US, will follow in the autumn. Over several years Budapest expects to sell state shares in 70 companies worth a total of Ft120bn, including holdings in MVM, the electricity utility, and Mol, the national oil and gas company. The government aims to broaden share ownership beyond the foreign investors and state company managers who have dominated Hungary's four-year privatisation drive, though it plans to offer only minority tranches in companies already managed by an industrial investor. While state sell-offs have helped Hungary attract a total of Dollars 7.1bn of foreign investment, and management buy-outs have become more common in the past year, public offerings have involved only about 25,000 retail investors out of a population of 10m. The privatisation authorities said that they expect to persuade hundreds of thousands of Hungarians to pay the token Ft2000 fee to join the small shareholder programme and buy up to Ft100,000 worth of shares on highly preferential terms.</p>

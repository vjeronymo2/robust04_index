Brussels and Havana have been  holding talks on finding a solution to the matter. But  meanwhile, given that both countries are not planning to give up  their principles, the Cubans could well be staying with the  ambassador for a long time. In the meantime, Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina has announced that he will hold a  conference with the Cuban community in exile. [passage omitted]    "But all Cubans may leave Cuba if they want to," the Cuban  embassy spokesman in Belgium said yesterday by phone. "If they  just follow the standard procedures. They can apply for a visa.  But it cannot happen this way. Cuba must ensure that the  immunity of the diplomatic premises in Havana is respected and  the security of foreign diplomats is not threatened. Therefore,  we cannot allow such actions." Observers emphasize that it is  not customary for the host country to decide who visits the  ambassador.    Both Cuban and Belgian diplomats stress that the talks are  "firm but friendly." But it remains very doubtful whether a  rapid solution can be found. Both countries have opposite  opinions on the question and they will not abandon them quickly.  Very cautious diplomatic action will probably be necessary to  reach an agreement.</p>

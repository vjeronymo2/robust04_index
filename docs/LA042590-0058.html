			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TYSON TO FACE TILLMAN IN LAS VEGAS, KING ANNOUNCES  </P> <P> Mike Tyson's first opponent since losing the heavyweight title in February to  Buster Douglas will be Henry Tillman, the last fighter to defeat Tyson before  Douglas' victory in Tokyo.  </P> <P> Tyson will share an outdoors heavyweight doubleheader with another former  champion, George Foreman, at Caesars Palace June 16, promoter Don King  announced Tuesday night. Foreman meets the first ranked opponent he has faced  in his 21-bout, three-year comeback, Adilson Rodrigues of Brazil.  </P> <P> Tillman was 2-0 against Tyson as an amateur in 1984. Tillman, beat Tyson, then  17, twice at the U.S. Olympic boxing trials and kept him out of the Olympics.  Tillman was the Olympic heavyweight champion in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Tyson graduated to far greater achievements as a pro than Tillman. Tyson won  his first world heavyweight title in 1986 and earned nearly $50 million in  1988. He seemed unbeatable when Douglas, a 42-1 underdog, registered one of  sport's all-time upsets with a 10th-round knockout Feb. 10.  </P> <P> Tillman was selected as Tyson's first post-Douglas foe after a series of  possible opponents would not agree on what King was said to be offering, about  $250,000. Rejected for what King called outlandish demands were Alex Stewart,  Renaldo Snipes, Greg Page and Walter Masseroni of Argentina.  </P> <P> Tillman, 6-3 and 220 pounds, turned pro in 1984 and had a 10-0 record, but was  upset by Bert Cooper in June, 1986. In February, 1987, he dropped down to fight  Evander Holyfield at cruiserweight (195 pounds) and was stopped in the seventh  round.  </P> <P> His career seemed to bottom out in November, 1987, when he was stopped by  journeyman sparring partner Duane Bonds at Las Vegas. Since then, he has fought  only four times, losing a decision at Edmonton, Canada, to Willie deWit, then  stopping three little-known fighters. Tillman had defeated deWit in 1984 to win  the gold medal.  </P> <P> Tillman, 29, is 20-4, with 14 knockouts. Tyson, 23, is 37-1, with 33 knockouts.  </P></p>

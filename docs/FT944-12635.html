			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Farmers fight National Grid over pylon upgrade Today sees the start of a marathon of public hearings at which National Grid Company is fighting landowners and farmers over the biggest upgrading of Britain's electricity grid network since the 1950s. The government has given National Grid approval in principle for a Pounds 200m plan to erect 400,000-volt powerlines through 50 miles of Cleveland and North Yorkshire, but no work can start unless it has landowners' and occupiers' consent to the installation of new pylons and lines. The upgrading, requiring 240 pylons, each 150ft high, has provoked opposition and the formation of a pressure group, Revolt - Rural England Versus Overhead Lines Transmission. In return for way-leaves - the licence required to erect pylons and overhead lines - NGC has offered annual site rental payments of about Pounds 80 per pylon, plus - as a incentive to prompt agreement - one-off sums of Pounds 300 per pylon and Pounds 200 for overhead lines. In spite of this it has obtained by voluntary means only 25 of the 138 way-leaves it needs. Now it wishes to resort to compulsion. The result is a seven-week programme of hearings, starting today in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, and moving later to North Yorkshire. At these hearings independent Department of Trade and Industry inspectors will weigh the conflicting views of NGC and the way-leave refusers. One of those refusing way-leave is Mr David Dugdale, a farmer and Revolt member. He said: 'The general feeling is there's no semblance of any sort of national need or national good about this proposed route. It's purely related to private gain by shareholders and senior executives of the electricity companies.' NGC insists upgrading is critically important to allow transmission of more, cheaply generated electricity from gas, hydro and nuclear stations. The protestors' objections include the pylons' visual impact and the hindrance they create for modern farming methods. There is also deep unease about the possible link between electro-magnetic fields and cancer. NGC, which is funding research into this, said that while a possible connection existed with childhood leukaemia, the National Radiological Protection Board had not issued any precautionary guidelines on electro-magnetic fields and high-voltage transmission. Mr Dugdale and other NGC opponents insist that potential risk should not be ignored. 'It must be a policy of prudent avoidance,' he said.</p>

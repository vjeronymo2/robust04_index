			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Louw] </F>   [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has taken  its first decisive step to rein in rogue elements in the South  African Police [SAP] during the election period with the  establishment this week of a National Police Inspectorate [NPI].  At a meeting in Pretoria the NPI was quietly brought into being  with the specific task of keeping a check on the various  policing agencies -- including the SAP -- during the election  period.    Its first task will be to concentrate on the "flashpoints"  of  Natal and the Wits/Vaal [Witwatersrand/Transvaal] area. The  first of the 13 members of the NPI -- five civilians, four SAP  officers and four officers from homeland police forces --  started moving into their new offices on the 10th floor of the  Saambou Building on Tuesday [29 March]. The existence of the NPI  will only be announced next week, but the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN has  been leaked details of the secret launch meeting this week in  the Saambou Building in Pretoria. Chairing the meeting was  Peter Gastrow, who heads the TEC's law and order subcouncil.    It was revealed at the meeting that a national complaints  mechanism is to be established in 10 days' time for civilians to  protest about unacceptable police conduct.    The NPI will take over many of the functions of police  officers who are presently operating under the National Peace  Accord.    Described by our source as the eyes and ears of the TEC, the  NPI will identify rogue elements in the SAP and the homeland  police forces, and report to the TEC on possible crises in the  police, logistical plans, problems of low morale and tension  between different policing agencies. It will also see to it  that decisions by the TEC's law and order subcouncil are  implemented. All police plans regarding control of the election  process will be reported to the subcouncil by the NPI's nine  regional inspectorates.    All steps taken by police will be measured against a  national  police plan, which was recently accepted by the law and order  subcouncil. With less than four weeks to go before the  elections, short cuts were taken in appointing a director for  the NPI. It was decided at Tuesday's meeting that Fanie Bosch,  project leader of co-operative education and programme  development at the Technikon RSA in Florida, Transvaal, will be  the executive director. Bosch, who attended the meeting as an  observer, was instructed by the law and order subcouncil to  convene the first meeting of the NPI before the existence of the  new body was made public. Because of the time limit, those  attending the meeting were told to squeeze the TEC for as good a  financial package as possible.    Gastrow is believed to have promised that the subcouncil  would support its demands, because at this late stage it hoped  not to readvertise for the position.    Members of the NPI were told that although they should not  impose themselves, they should be part of decision-making  meetings of the various police forces all over the country.  Decision-making meetings outside the security forces -- such as  city council meetings -- should also be attended.    The NPI will be expected to evaluate unrest regulations and  report to the subcouncil on what steps to take. Members of the  NPI were warned to be specifically on the lookout for tensions  between homeland police and the SAP, and to report any problems  to the subcouncil.    Joint operational centres (JOCs) will shortly be established  in many parts of the country for the various policing agencies,  and the NPI members will have an important role in seeing that  everything is in place for the elections.    Gastrow warned during the meeting that the politicians and  experts had done very little forward thinking on the key issue  of the integration of South Africa's various police forces, and  that serious problems could be expected.    A police general at the meeting also warned that there were  morale problems within the police, and that there was a need to  motivate the police to play a constructive role before the  election and under a new government.    During the meeting Bosch made it clear that he was not  prepared only to criticise the police, as the inspectorate was  designed to help the police as much as the TEC.    Gastrow said his subcouncil also wanted to help the police  to  do their job properly, in part by identifying weaknesses in the  police force.</p>

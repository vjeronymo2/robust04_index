			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Mexican budget set to cut inflation: Target is surplus of 1.7% of GDP THE Mexican government has sent Congress plans for a budget surplus next year of 1.7 per cent of GDP, and is forecasting an inflation rate of 7 per cent and growth of 3 per cent. The tight budget, which is sure to be approved by the Congress, reflects the government's determination to achieve single-digit inflation next year. At a time of sluggish growth, it reveals the concerns over the financing of the current account deficit in an uncertain international environment, and the desire to put in place the conditions for sustained low-inflation growth in time for the 1994 presidential election. The government will run a budget surplus of 0.4 per cent of GDP this year, but inflation will be around 11 per cent, and the current account deficit 6 per cent of GDP, according to official forecasts. The high budget surplus reflects in part a change in definition of government spending, which now excludes state bank credits to the private sector. Under the definition used for this year's budget, the surplus would have been 0.7 per cent of GDP. The government said total spending next year would fall 0.2 per cent in real terms, thanks in large part to an expected reduction on interest payments on the public debt of 20.7 per cent compared to this year. While the government expects to run a primary surplus of 4.8 per cent of GDP next year, spending on social programmes, as defined by the government, will increase by 13.7 per cent. The budget predicts a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP next year. The presidency said the budget was aimed at achieving four objectives: to reduce inflation to 7 per cent, promote employment and achieve growth of 3 per cent, deepen structural reforms to make the economy more productive, and promote social development by supporting needy sectors. The main winners from the budget are education, health and rural development, which have been granted 15.3, 12.8 and 9.3 per cent increases in spending respectively. The president's anti-poverty programme also receives a spending increase of of 4.7 per cent in real terms, to Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn), although the increase is smaller than in past years. The Bank of Mexico reported inflation at 0.7 per cent in October, bringing the cumulative rate for the first 10 months to 9.5 per cent.</p>

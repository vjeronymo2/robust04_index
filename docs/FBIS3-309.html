The  research initiatives survey of 8,004 respondents shows 83 per  cent of black voters and 85 per cent of white voters intend  casting ballots. However, only 50 per cent of coloureds and 55  per cent of Indians intend voting. The survey shows six per  cent of blacks, eight per cent of whites, 19 per cent of  coloureds and 23 per cent of Indians intend abstaining.    Motivation to vote among blacks is highest in the Eastern  and  Western Cape (93 and 95 per cent) and lowest in Natal and the  Eastern Transvaal (74 per cent). Among coloureds, it is lowest  in the Western Cape (47 per cent) and in the North-West Region  (46 per cent). Indian voters in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region are more motivated than those  in Natal (62 and 54 per cent).    Women are less motivated than men in all regions except the  Western Cape. The gender gap is between seven and 12 per cent,  except in the Eastern Transvaal where 85 per cent of men and 62  per cent of women will vote, and Natal where 80 per cent of men  and 68 per cent of women will go to the polls. The gender gap  is highest among Indians, at 29 per cent.    Principal reasons for not voting are confusion about  political events, personal reasons (such as "too old", "against  religion") and ignorance about elections and voting. Among  blacks, lack of identity documents is the fifth most important  reason for not voting. The survey also shows the secrecy of the  ballot is either doubted or mistrusted by about 25 per cent of  voters. Belief in ballot secrecy is highest among blacks, at 81  per cent. The figure for whites is 77 per cent, for coloureds  70 per cent and for Indians 74 per cent.</p>

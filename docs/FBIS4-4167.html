Today,  as the special plane carries a full load of Central Asian  (?friendship) [ha ba de 0761 1572 1795 -- language unknown], the  "Silk Road" has all along been the delightful topic of  conversation for both the hosts and the guests -- from the  mountain city of (Bishikaike)[3024 0087 0418 0344] at the foot  of the Tianshan Mountain to the "Apple City" of Almaty at the  fringe of the (Yilialatao) [0122 3680 7093 2139 1152] Mountain.    At various functions during his tour, Premier Li Peng has  repeatedly made clear to leaders and people from all sectors of  the four nations the sincerity of the Chinese people, saying:  We would like to reinvigorate the ancient "Silk Road" with the  Central Asian people, and let friendship endure as the universe.  In speeches delivered in both Tashkent and Almaty, where he  expounded on China's four basic policies in developing relations  and its six-point advocation in developing economic cooperation  with Central Asia, Li Peng has expressed the common feeling to  invigorate the "Silk Road."    There were even more praises from the enthusiastic hosts on  this passageway that symbolized traditional friendship. Uzbek  President Karimov said that today we have all the reasons to  rejuvenate the "Silk Road" which linked the Uzbek and the  Chinese people as early as 2,000 years ago. Turkmen President  Niyazov also said: It is time to invigorate the great "Silk  Road" which has tied together the Turkmen and the Chinese people  over the past few centuries. Kyrgyz President Akayev wanted to  make the new "Silk Road" a "Road of Friendship and Cooperation."  Kazakh President Nazarbayev said the "Silk Road" was historic  evidence of Kazakh-Chinese friendship. If promoting  good-neighborly relations and developing cooperation of mutual  benefit has been the objective of Premier Li Peng's four-nation  Central Asian tour, the "Silk Road" has covered it all.    Today, the opportunity facing us, topographical advantage,  and support of the peoples have put us in a superior position to  rejuvenate the "Silk Road." Because of the important  contributions made through Premier Li Peng's trip, we have an  entirely new time and space concept of the "Silk Road" and it  has given the route a richer content. The premier said: "China  will forever be the good friend and good neighbor of Central  Asian nations."    Premier Li Peng repeatedly stressed that the Eurasian  Continental Bridge should remain open and unblocked.  Improvement in transportation has become an issue of common  concern to people. In view of this, China and Kazakhstan  reached an understanding on developing rail through-traffic  during Premier Li Peng's trip, and China and Turkmenistan  indicated they would strive to achieve Beijing-Ashkhabad direct  flights as soon as possible. The ancient Silk Road which once  resounded with the ringing of camel bells is changing into a  thoroughfare which travels through time and space.    Premier Li Peng's trip will load the "Silk Road" up with  more  fruits of exchanges and cooperation. In addition,  government-to-government economic and trade cooperation, Chinese  entrepreneurs who accompanied the premier on his trip signed  over 20 agreements involving cooperation in many fields with  enterprise circles from various nations. If we carry out our  tentative plan to build the Turkmenistan-China-Japan natural gas  pipeline, 10 to 20 billion cubic meters of Turkmen natural gas  will be transported through more than 6,000 km of pipelines to  our country and Japan.    As Li Peng said: The contemporary "Silk Road" is not only a  glory path of friendship, it is also a broad road of cooperation.</p>

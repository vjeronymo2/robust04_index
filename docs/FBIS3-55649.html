Minister Will Have New  Deputies"]    [Text] The just completed New Year and Christmas season  has brought about more changes in Russian diplomacy. According  to information available to KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the question of  appointing Aleksandr Panov, the current ambassador to Seoul, as  deputy foreign minister, has for all intents and purposes been  resolved. It has come to light simultaneously that Igor Ivanov,  ambassador to Madrid, will probably become yet another deputy  for Andrey Kozyrev.    Georgiy Kunadze, whose place will probably be taken by  Aleksandr Panov, was in charge of Foreign Ministry personnel  policy and relations with the countries of Asia and the Pacific  region. Kunadze was not quite successful in the personnel job,  though, some high-ranking diplomats note. One of the probable  reasons is the fact that he has not been a career diplomat  (before joining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he was in  academic science), which is why they argue on Smolenskaya  Ploshchad that he could not entirely get rid of his "outsider"  image. Last October, personnel work was entrusted to an  "insider" -- Sergey Krylov -- and some time later, the question  of Kunadze's appointment as ambassador to Seoul was resolved in  principle. This leaves the Asia and Pacific region "untended,"  and now Aleksandr Panov is to step into this breach.    As for Igor Ivanov, according to some information, he is  tipped to take the place of current First Deputy Minister  Anatoliy Adamishin, who has become a member of parliament. It  is still not clear, though, which Foreign Ministry areas he will  be in charge of if one thinks that changes in the ministry's  structure (and the redistribution of duties among top diplomats  it entails) have not been yet completed.

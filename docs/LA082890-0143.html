			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS TO 6-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit narrowed dramatically to $22.58 billion from April  through June, the lowest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the  government reported today.  </P> <P> However, analysts were quick to note that the deficit had been pushed lower  primarily by falling oil prices, a situation that has been reversed by the Aug.  2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the 14.1% improvement from a first-quarter deficit  of $26.28 billion reflected lower petroleum imports and a record level of U.S.  export sales.  </P> <P> For the second quarter, U.S. exports totaled an all-time high of $96.74  billion, up 0.5% from the previous record of $96.26 billion set in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is counting on continued strong export sales to provide  the momentum needed to keep the country out of a recession, a prospect that has  grown more uncertain with the economic shocks coming from the turmoil in the  Mideast.  </P> <P> U.S. imports fell 2.6% in the second quarter to $119.32 billion, an improvement  of $3.2 billion.  </P> <P> The $22.58-billion trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports,  was the smallest since a $21.3-billion deficit in the fourth quarter of 1983.  </P> <P> As usual, the biggest imbalance occurred with Japan, a deficit of $10.4  billion, up slightly from a $10.3-billion first quarter deficit.  </P> <P> The United States posted a rare $1.5-billion second quarter surplus with  Western Europe, up from a $400-million surplus in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The figures in today's report on merchandise trade, calculated on a  balance-of-payments basis, confirmed trends noted in the department's monthly  merchandise trade reports, which showed a second quarter deficit of $20.15  billion.  </P> <P> Petroleum imports, which had risen sharply in the first quarter, declined by  $3.5 billion in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a sharp decline in  price.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Chengdao is a little known area near the area where  the Huang He enters the sea. However, it has caught world  attention with the discovery of China's largest shallow sea oil  field--the Chengdao oil field, which has recently been put into  development. The development of this oil field not only presents  a bright future for China's eastern oil industry, it also opens  a new era in the development of China's shallow sea oil fields.    About 100 kilometers north of the famous oil city of  Dongying  in eastern China and out into the sea where the Huang He enters  the sea, one sees four offshore oil rigs. According to the  Shengli Shallow Sea Company, this oil field has a daily output  of 1,500 tons. It has produced, up until late August this year,  42,000 tons of crude oil. This is very encouraging news as the  oil field has just been put into production.    The change from long-term exploration alone to exploration  and development at the same time in the Chengdao oil field was  necessitated by the development of the Shengli oil field and  also the development of Eastern China's oil industry. The  Shengli oil field is China's second largest oil field, with an  output last year of 33.50 million tons, about one-fourth of the  nation's total oil output. The Chinese government, in its Eighth  Five-Year Plan, states the strategy of "stabilizing the east and  developing the west" in oil development. However, it is no easy  task to stabilize and maintain the current level of output in  the east. The development of the Chengdao oil field has  significance as a backup oil field to Shengli and also as a  reserve area. This is an integral part of China's oil industry  development strategy.    The Tarim Basin and Bo Hai Wan are China's two brightest  stars in the oil industry. Bo Hai Wan, adjacent to Shengli, is a  shallow sea area with an average depth of less than 20 meters.  The layer of sedimentary rocks lies flat on top of each other on  the sea bed. Bo Hai Wan has rich oil reserves. It is also a  strategically important area in China's oceanic development.  China views the continental shelf oil development and Tarim  Basin oil development in the west as the keystone in its oil  industry.    Bo Hai Wan is about 80,000 square kilometers in area and it  is an integral part of the North China oil and gas area. The  Chinese government started specific gravity measurement and  exploration in Bo Hai Wan as early as 1965 and this work has  never stopped. For the Shengli oil field, ever since the latter  half of the 1980's, exploration has focused on the Bin Hai area,  with the discovery of Gudong and other oil fields. In 1988, in  the Bo Hai Wan area where the Huang He enters the sea, the  Chengdao oil field was discovered. This field controls an  oil-bearing area of 36 square kilometers. It was discovered and  verified that the oil field has oil and gas reserves exceeding  100 million tons, and by the year 1995 its capacity could be  developed to an annual total of 1 million tons of oil. The  annual increase of oil geological reserve is about 30 percent of  Shengli's annual increase of reserve. Its long-term reserve is  expected to reach several hundreds of million tons. The  discovery was ranked as one of China's top 10 technological  achievements in 1988 and is highly regarded by China's oil and  technological circles. Shouldering the task of exploring and  developing China's largest shallow sea oil field at present is  the Shengli Oil Field Shallow Sea Exploration and Development  Company. This is the only company in China capable of shallow  sea and ultra-shallow sea oil exploration and development. The  company not only undertakes the exploration and development of  Chengdao oil field, it also dispatches oil rigs and ships to  Liaodong Wan and North Bay to work in the shallow waters there.  The company is a significant force in the exploration and  development of continental shelf and shallow sea oil development  in the eastern part of China.    The company has about 2,600 employees, three docks, five  offshore oil rigs, a floating platform and 34 auxiliary vessels  including two triple-purpose vessels equipped with  satellite-guided navigational aids. The special-purpose wharf  was completed and put into operation at the end of July. The  dock can accommodate all ship and platforms.    With the decision in 1984 by the Chinese government to set  up  the Shengli Oil field Shallow Sea Oil Drilling Company, Shengli  Oil Field Shallow Sea Development Company also underwent  corresponding changes to keep up with the development. Its scale  of operation expanded continuously. The technology of oceanic  oil development went to new highs. This is particularly so since  last year when good news came in oil drilling. Eight oil wells  each with a daily output of 100 tons were drilled one after the  other, greatly increasing the oil-bearing area of Chengdao oil  field and also the geological reserves of the oil field.    Wei Xueyi, deputy general manager of Shengli oil field, is  also general manager of the Shallow Sea Company and the person  responsible for the development of the Chengdao oil field. He  remarked that the change from exploration alone to exploration  and development together is an historical change. Chengdao will  be responsible for 30 percent of the increase in production in  the Shengli oil field and this is very significant in the  nation's oil development strategy of stabilizing and maintaining  the east. However, he said, because of various limitations such  as capital, the pace of development cannot be pushed too fast.  The task this year for Chengdao oil field is to have eight  exploration wells and three production wells and to have an  additional geological reserve of 20-30 million tons. The company  takes "the easy one first, the high output ones first, early  development and early harvest" approach. The company is taking a  pragmatic approach of building smaller and easier drilling  platforms and trying to put into production as soon as possible  the wells that have been drilled.    In order to expedite the development of shallow sea oil,  Shengli Shallow Sea Oil Exploration and Development Company  relentlessly explored new technology and has successfully raised  the technological level of oceanic oil exploration. Over 100  technological achievements were made. One of the technological  achievements is the self-designed and built "Shengli No. 2"  shallow sea "Walking" oil rig, which can walk in ultra-shallow  waters at a speed of 60 meters per hour--the world's first  ultra-shallow sea walking oil rig--and is ranked as one of the  top 10 technological achievements for 1992.    In order to develop the rich reserves of this shallow water  oil field, Wei Xueyi and his management team are traveling  throughout the nation and also overseas for the purchase of  offshore oil drilling platforms, oil rigs and various transport  vessels and equipment so as to expedite the development of this  oil field. This is also the golden opportunity for foreign  companies to sell equipment and technology to China.    Obviously, the development of Chengdao oil field opens up a  new road for the development of Bo Hai Wan and China's Shallow  Sea oil development. A new horizon and new hopes are now  visible. A lot of human resources and material and capital will  be put into the Bo Hai Wan and the continental shelf development  between now and the advent of the next century.</p>

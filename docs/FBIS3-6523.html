			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "National and World News" program] </F>   [Text] In a news conference following the cabinet meeting  today, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and  industry [MITI], said the government is considering revising  controls on exports of Japanese-made passenger cars, including  the possibility of scrapping them totally from next year.    Kumagai said: As far as we see, the United States basically  has no appreciation of them at all -- at least where the Clinton  government is concerned.    Minister Kumagai also said that even though he has not  formally decided whether to continue with the voluntary  restraint system or not, such controls can bring the charge that  they show Japan's auto manufacturers are cartelling. Attention  must be paid to this point, he added.    The system of putting voluntary restraints on Japanese-made  car exports to the United States was instituted in 1981 after  such exports grew sharply. MITI thinks now that the U.S. auto  industry is making high profits while Japanese auto exports are  falling short of export control ceilings, there is little  likelihood that auto exports to the United States will rise  sharply. As such, MITI is coming to believe there is not much  point in continuing export controls.    Minister Kumagai's remark today is believed to suggest his  ministry is thinking about reviewing export controls for next  year and thereafter, including the possible abolition of the  controls altogether, once the government finalizes its measures  on opening up Japan's markets to the United States by the end of  this month.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / BNL-BCCI papers subpoenaed in NY MR Robert Morgenthau, the federal district attorney for Manhattan who last year was the first US prosecutor to indict the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) on fraud charges, has issued a subpoena to Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), demanding documents related to fund transfers between BNL and BCCI. The move is believed to be the first concrete step by a US prosecutor to probe the series of unexplained financial links between the two banks. Former officials of BNL's Atlanta branch were indicted last year in the US, with Iraqi government officials, in connection with the extension of more than Dollars 4bn of loans to Iraq, part of which helped President Saddam Hussein to finance the development of missiles, chemical weapons and a 'Super Gun.' But the Atlanta-based prosecutors have been criticised in Congress for what has been seen as their 'go-slow' approach to the BNL affair. Congressmen such as Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, have alleged recently that the State Department acted in 1989 and 1990 to delay the BNL indictments, and to prevent key Iraqi and Jordanian suspects from being charged. Mr Morgenthau's investigators, in the course of their work on BCCI, came across indications of financial links between BCCI and the BNL Atlanta branch. These are believed to include a BNL account that transferred funds to BCCI in the Bahamas, and the discovery of nearly Dollars 2.5bn of overnight money market transactions between BCCI's London, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong branches, and BNL Atlanta. BNL executives have denied any wrongdoing and are not considered the target of Mr Morgenthau's subpoena, issued in the last few days. Mr Pietro Lombardi, the head of BNL's New York branch, declined to take calls yesterday. Members of the Italian parliamentary commission examining the BNL-Atlanta case have confirmed that Mr Morgenthau has subpoenaed documents in the BNL New York office which might relate to dealings with BCCI. In Rome yesterday, this was seen as a significant move since Mr Morgenthau is acting independently of the main enquiry into the affair being conducted by Justice Department officials based in Atlanta. The parliamentary commission has taken the view that it has not received the full co-operation of the US authorities and that the Atlanta prosecution could be influenced by Washington to avoid embarrassing revelations. The subpoena of the BNL New York office documents follows discovery of potential links between accounts held under the name of Oscar Newman and transfer to banks including BCCI. 'The Manhattan attorney (Morgenthau) has recognised links between the account of Oscar Newman and the BCCI, and thus has at least competence for a small part of the BNL-Atlanta investigation,' Mr Massimo Riva, vice-chairman of the commission, was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Italian security services have been called to investigate a mysterious break-in on March 10-11 at offices in Rome where the commission held sensitive documents on the BNL Atlanta affair.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers unsettled by warning Shares in United Carriers fell sharply yesterday as it became the latest company to issue a profit warning shortly after going public. The shares dropped 33p to 115p, compared with the February flotation price of 153p, after the parcel and freight company admitted to having suffered an 'exceptionally tough' April. As a result it predicted that this year's profits would be 'somewhat less' than 1993's figure of Pounds 4.1m. Analysts had been expecting at least Pounds 4.8m. The group said that trading in February and March had been in line with expectations but that in April the parcels and freight business had seen volumes down by about 5 per cent on last year. 'The fall arose from a significant reduction in volumes from the underlying customer base as well as a net loss of business arising from competitive pressures.' In particular, it is thought that United lost market share to Lynx, the NCF subsidiary, after failing to respond to price cuts. United said that during May it has gradually begun to reduce the volume shortfall, in part by securing new business. It added, however, that it was unlikely that the shortfall in the parcels and freight business will be recouped during the remainder of 1994 with the company predicting flat volumes compared with 1993. Trading in the rest of the group, notably in the specialist transport and distribution businesses, has exceeded expectations, but this has not been sufficient to make up for the shortfall elsewhere. Directors sold about Pounds 4.5m of shares in the February placing, which was sponsored by Lazards with UBS acting as broker.</p>

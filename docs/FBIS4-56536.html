			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 19 April  1994 on page 4 reports that 800,000 pounds of chile tabasco  peppers have been exported to the United States since the end of  1993. The peppers, which are grown in Nueva Guinea, El Tuma, and  farms in the western zone are sold at 30 cents per pound.  Growers receive financing from the Nicaraguan Investment Fund  and the National Development Bank. Exporter David Robleto  explains that the peppers require no special handling for  export.</p>

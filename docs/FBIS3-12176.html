"Paradoxically the tragedy leaves Israel and the PLO no  alternative but to accelerate the peace negotiations so that the  PLO can take control in the territories as soon as possible," an  Israeli minister, who asked not to be named, told AFP.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  agreed to U.S. President Bill Clinton's appeal not to allow the  massacre to undermine recent achievements and to hold new  negotiations that will continue in Washington until a resolution  is reached.    The minister said "damage control" contacts over the last 24  hours between Israel and the PLO as well as with the Americans  and Europeans had proved positive.    "Everyone agrees that we have to push ahead with peace," the  minister said. "The negotiations could go very fast now."    There is no problem with the Palestinian leadership, what we  fear is the Palestinian street.    "The coming days will be crucial. Things could get out of  control in the territories."    For that reason, on top of international condemnation,  Israel  was under great pressure to come up with some real gestures such  as an early release of Palestinian prisoners, to keep a lid on  the violence, he said. Rabin was weighing his next move on  Saturday, the minister added.    "The decision to punish the settlers by closing off Qiryat  Arba' and to compensate Palestinian families is important.  Symbolic measures such as closing off the killer's house or  even blowing it up, as happens with the Palestinians, are under  consideration," he revealed.    He said he hoped that ultimately the massacre could reduce  the period of autonomy to under five years, allowing an early  transition to a final settlement on the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. [passage omitted]    Rabin pledged the killing would not halt the peace train.    "The crazy act of a pyschopath will not prevent the  reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians and will not  stop the peace process," he vowed.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres added: "If anyone thinks such  criminal acts will slow the peace efforts, they are sorely  mistaken." [passage omitted]</p>

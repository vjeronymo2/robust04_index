			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Political rush poses petrol pollution problem Sir, You report that the German environment minister is considering unilateral action to reduce the level of benzene in German petrols ('Bonn threatens action on petrol pollutant', July 7). Benzene is a proven human carcinogen and levels in the air of many European cities now significantly exceed recommended limits. This is a direct result of the flawed EU policy of encouraging the use of unleaded petrol, with its higher aromatic content, in cars not equipped with catalytic converters. As a consequence of removing lead from petrol, the missing octane numbers are most commonly replaced by increasing the aromatic content of the petrol, the highest average aromatic content being found in the allegedly green super-unleaded. It is to be hoped that Mr Klaus Topfer fully understands that it is not merely the benzene content of the petrol which is important but the total aromatic content as all aromatics can be converted to benzene in the engine and are emitted to the atmosphere if there is no catalyst fitted. It is unfortunate that in the political rush to remove lead from petrol we have removed a perceived problem and replaced it by several far more sinister threats to health and the environment.

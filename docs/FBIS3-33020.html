			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial  actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in  Spanish between 7 and 16 February.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 7 February reports that after  two senior citizens were killed on 31 December in Centro Habana  Municipality, rumors creating a distorted view of the events  began to circulate. Foreign radio stations directed towards  Cuba, discrediting the international image of the Revolution,  claimed that in Cuba there is no security for citizens who  receive dollars from relatives in the United States; they are  vulnerable to attack and even murder by criminals trying to rob  them.    To clarify events, Radio Progreso interviews First  Lieutenant  Alberto Molina Perez of the homicide department of the  provincial unit of police operations in Havana City who was in  charge of the investigation.    Molina Perez states that on the evening to 31 December, the  Havana City homicide department received word that a double  murder had been committed. The victims were Santiago Martinez  Hernandez, 85 years old, and Eliodora Josefina Suarez Ramos, 83.  Clues, including fingerprints, led to the identification of  persons suspected of this crime which, according to the  announcer, is uncommon and caused great consternation among the  people. During the investigation, one of the suspects confessed.    According to Molina Perez, the prompt response of the police  allowed the case to be solved quickly. The two suspects, Elmis  Barbaro Villaluz and Rolando Raul Diaz Vina, are unemployed and  have criminal records. They are being held and in the near  future will be tried for murder. Under the penal code, sentences  can range from 15 to 20 years' imprisonment to the death penalty.    Radio Progreso at 1200 on 9 February reports that Cuba plays  an active role in the fight against drug trafficking. Several  foreigners have been arrested transporting drugs within Cuban  territorial waters attempting to smuggle drugs into U.S.  territory, which were later incinerated under official  supervision.    An example of the efficiency of the National Revolutionary  Police in its fight against drugs is the case of a man in Havana  City who was arrested for growing marijuana in his back yard.  According to Detective Pablo Ibarra Martinez, Alejandro Valdes  Friel from Cerro Municipality was arrested for growing 62  marijuana plants in his back yard and for the possession of ten  packages of the drug in his home. After being arrested, Valdes  confessed that he had the plants for his own consumption.  Investigators determined that he had been carrying out this  activity for several years and had been previously arrested for  the same crime. The suspect is currently in jail charged with  the possession of toxic drugs. This crime can carry a sentence  of from three to eight years in prison.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 16 February reports that  police  charged Cesar Carrerano Ramil, head of the wholesale food  distribution department in Havana, and Angel Gustavo Landin  Otero, a driver, with stealing 64 sacks of rice for resale at  profitable prices. Carrerano Ramil and Landin Otero were  sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, while their five  accomplices were sentenced to five years' imprisonment. They  will pay the Cuban state 1,280 pesos for the rice not recovered.</p>

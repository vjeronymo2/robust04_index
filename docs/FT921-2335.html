			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Observer: Kings and roundabouts 'All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.' Whether Tolstoy's famous words are true in all cases, the present unhappy outlook for Britain's Royals contrasts with the prospects for royal families elsewhere. While the marriage troubles of Prince Andrew and Prince Charles are dragging down public esteem for the UK monarchy, in other countries monarchy is on the upsurge. The best example is Spain where King Juan Carlos, since taking the re-instituted throne in 1975, has won wide admiration, particularly for his firm stand against the attempted coup 11 years ago. But in Brazil, too, support for a monarchy is growing with the approach of next year's plebiscite on constitutional change. While the main argument is between parliamentarians and presidentialists, two sizeable groups are urging the return of a king from the Braganca family. The last one, Dom Pedro II, was deposed in 1889. Alas, typically, the two factions cannot agree on which of his descendants to promote. Moreover, in Belgrade, 50,000 demonstrators lately took to the streets demanding that Serbia's monarchy be restored in place of President Slobodan Milosevic. Similar calls have been heard in the republic of Georgia. As for else- where . . .who knows: before very much longer even the Romanovs may be preferred to Boris Yeltsin.</p>

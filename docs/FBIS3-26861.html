Cai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and executive vice governor, addressed the meeting.  He said: The main purpose of this wage system reform is to  establish a new distribution system that is needed in the  socialist market economic structure and to ensure that the new  system is on the right track. On the basis of summing up and  learning from experiences gained from the last two wage system  reforms in 1956 and 1985, this reform is in line with the  requirements of the socialist market economic structure and  personnel system reform, and different wage systems have been  established in light of the differences among various  organizations and institutions. While graduated wage scales  commensurate with one's office have been established in  government organizations, different wage systems have has been  established in insitutions in accordance with their different  natures, such as education, scientific research, public health,  survey and drawing, transportation, marine science, aquatic  products, culture, art, sports, and finance, reflecting the  different features of different sectors. In this way, we can  gradually separate the wage systems of institutions from that of  government organizations and make these systems work well on  their own special tracks. Through this reform, we will also  establish regular mechanisms governing pay raises to broaden pay  raise channels. In accordance with the plans made by central  authorities, we will launch a regional subsidy system this year.    Cai Songyue said: The provincial party committee and  government are very concerned about this wage system reform and  attach great importance to it. They demand that the pay raise  plans be implemented as soon as possible. In view of the short  time left before the Spring Festival, the provincial party  committee and government decided to pay out part of the money in  advance and allocate the rest to individuals after the Spring  Festival. He said: To do a good job in this wage system  reform, we must first have a concensus of views on the wage  reform plan drawn up by the CPC Central Committee. This plan is  the policy basis for this wage system reform. We must follow  the guiding thought and major principles prescribed in the plan  to organize and do our work. After the wage system reform is  implemented, the wages of various personnel will be raised in  one way or another, but not as much as people expect. We should  have a correct understating about this. Both the central and  provincial financial organs have done their best to carry out  the pay raise plan in this wage system reform. Under conditions  of relative financial dificulty it is not easy to allocate such  a great amount of money for wage system reform. We cannot just  use up all of the money to solve current problems. We still  need to spend money on construction and substantially increase  investment in educational, cultural, and social undertakings.    Cai Songyue stressed: The current reform of the wage  system is a major step the state has taken in exercising  macroeconomic regulation and control over the remuneration  system. The project will be complex and difficult since it is a  matter that involves a broad range of issues and concerns the  overall situation. This being the case, the established  regulations, policies, and standards must be followed while  proceeding with the project. No area or unit may go its own way  and launch its own programs under the excuse that its situation  is special. Plans drawn up by central and provincial  authorities must be strictly followed and counter moves are  absolutely not allowed. Those who disregard and disobey the  regulations, orders, and prohibitions of the central authorities  and who go their own ways must be sternly handled once their  misconduct has been ascertained. The current wage system reform  has a close bearing on the vital interests of personnel in  Zhejiang government organizations and institutions and on the  stability and unity of society as a whole. Party committees and  governments at all levels must attach great importance to the  plan and implement it with meticulous efforts. Since cadres and  working personnel will have all kinds of ideas on the reform, we  should conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and political  work among them so that we can create an environment and  conditions conducive to reform. When the reform plan is  actually carried out, governments at all levels must intensify  their coordination, promptly understand and discover new  situations, and study and properly handle problems that may  arise.    Cai Songyue urged all personnel affairs departments in  Zhejiang to seize the current opportunity to speed up reform of  their personnel systems and build themselves into stronger  departments so that they can do an even better job in serving  economic construction and contribute to building a socialist  market economic system. Personnel in charge of provincial  departments and relevant leading cadres of various cities,  prefectures, and counties attended the meeting.</p>

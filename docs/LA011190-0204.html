			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: THEY'LL BE BACK AGAIN ON SUNDAY -- TO HAVE A BALL AND SEE A BALL  (GAME)  </P> <P> "Next Sunday, you're all coming here again!" The Rams slayed the Giants, 19-13,  and John Crean's face was pink with excitement.  </P> <P> "You sure you want us all back?" a guest replied at the football-watching party  Crean staged in his Santa Ana Heights home last Sunday.  </P> <P> "Absolutely. But it looks like we'd better buy some more chairs!" he told the  SRO crowd.  </P> <P> This was no plop-on-the-floor-and-watch-football get-together. This was a party  staged in the movie-set like theater in Crean's yet-to-be-completed  40,000-square-foot mansion.  </P> <P> "It sort of feels like we're on a cruise ship, doesn't it?" said Crean,  grinning like a schoolboy as his eyes took in the room with the wall-size  screen, the plush carpet and the 20 or so padded chairs.  </P> <P> To say the least. And Crean's pals -- among them, Supervisor Don Roth and his  wife, Jackie; Ritz-Carlton Vice President Henry Schielein and his wife, Carol,  and Ted and Lois Lundberg -- were willing passengers.  </P> <P> Arriving at the mansion early for the 9:30 a.m. kickoff, they climbed its  sweeping, Tara-esque staircase with the temporary railing (made of 2x4s and  chicken wire) and swept into the gleaming new theater after selecting  made-to-order omelets, lox, bagels, fresh fruit and hot buttered popcorn.  </P> <P> "Don and I met at a Rams game," Jackie Roth said, beaming at her husband as she  settled into a chair to root for the Giants. The Giants? "Just for today!" she  said, looking sheepish. (However, the feisty redhead was on her feet rooting  for the Rams during the overtime that saw Jim Everett sail the winning  touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson.)  </P> <P> "In fact," Jackie continued, "when Don and I told Carroll Rosenbloom (Rams  owner Georgia Frontiere's late husband) that we met at a Rams game, he sent us  a beautiful gift. We've known Georgia for years."  </P> <P> Also on the scene was Katie Klein, wife of Marshall Klein, Rams vice president  of media and community relations. There could be no doubt which team Katie was  rooting for. She wore a tiny, solid gold Rams helmet around her neck.  </P> <P> "I love it," Katie said, fingering the diamond-studded pendant, a gift from her  husband. "And I love the Rams."  </P> <P> Come this Sunday, the gang will be at the Creans' home again and so will the  omelets, the agony and the ecstasy.  </P> <P> "What's more fun than this?" Crean wanted to know. "That's what this theater is  all about. It's a way to bring people together. It's more fun than all of us  being at our own homes watching the game by ourselves, isn't it?"  </P> <P> By the look on guests' faces, the answer was a gimme-10 "yes!"  </P> <P> Also rooting for the Rams: Crean's wife, Donna ("I'm looking forward to using  this theater to watch my soaps!" she said, laughing); his sons John and Andy,  with his wife, Charlene; Jerry Kobrin, and Dr. Bob Roper.  </P> <P> A Winter Dinner: On its "12th Night of Christmas" party, Opera Pacific Gourmet  Diners' Guild gave to its members: boneless pork loin, sweet and sour red  cabbage, parsley-butter potatoes, a fresh fruit platter, several pasta salads,  and a piano concert by Danny Shapiro.  </P> <P> It all happened at Bill and Laila Conlin's Chateau Musique in Newport Beach on  Saturday night, the warm and cozy kind of party that has become the hallmark of  the Gourmet Diners' Guild.  </P> <P> Chairing the second annual affair was Myril Kreuder, who attended with her  husband, Norm. "Everybody likes to come to Myril's events," said Laila, dressed  in a midnight blue satin blouse and flowing velvet skirt. "She always makes  sure everyone has a wonderful time."  </P> <P> Arriving guests were greeted with the sound of a drum roll and the sight of  little-drummer-boy decor, a theme the guild plans to use year after year.  </P> <P> After guests helped themselves to the hearty fare cooked up by Jay's Catering,  they pulled up their chairs to listen to Shapiro, who thrilled the opera buffs  with selections by Beethoven, Chopin and Brahms.  </P> <P> Laila Conlin, founding president of Opera Pacific's Guild Alliance, said the  Gourmet Guild was one of 11 guilds (with 700 members) that have contributed  $500,000 to Opera Pacific since being established two years ago.  </P> <P> "We have a variety of guilds to appeal to a variety of interests," Laila said.  "People have so many things to support we decided to come up with a new idea.  We didn't want to be a clone."  </P> <P> Guild Alliance members can join the Gourmet Diners' Guild; the Viva Guild (a  group that visits operatic productions staged by companies other than Opera  Pacific); the Prologues Guild, which stages educational events, and the Opera  Ball Guild, which is strictly dedicated to staging Opera Pacific's annual gala.  There are also tennis and bridge guilds and a newly developed guild, New You,  devoted to self-improvement.  </P> <P> "The unique thing," Laila said, "is that our members can belong to any or all  of the guilds. All they have to do is put up the money!"  </P></p>

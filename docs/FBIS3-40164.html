			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xu Yuyun (1776 7183 0061) of the Agricultural </F> Bank of China: "Several Suggestions on Perfecting the Rural  Financial System"]    [Text] When Comrade Xiaoping toured Shanghai in 1991, he  said, "Finance is very important. It is the core of the modern  economy. Putting our finances in order is like making the right  move that wins the chess game." This statement points out  succinctly the important role and function of finance in the  construction of the socialist market economy. To promote the  establishment of the socialist market economic system, the  pertinent departments are actively studying and drawing up a  financial reform program. Here, this author would like to  discuss his views on the overall program and on the development  of an agricultural financial system.    In formulating the financial reform program, we must  make theoretical preparations and also integrate the program  with reality and pay attention to its manageability.    The introduction of reform programs has been slow. There has  been one problem after another, and one important reason for  that is that we do not have a clear understanding or a good  grasp of the grass-roots situation and therefore the programs  have not been very manageable. The central bank is plagued by  this problem, and so is the Agricultural Bank. As a result, the  old system basically has been rejected, but the new system has  yet to be formulated. The rank and file below are uncertain and  often cannot carry out even their regular tasks.    In view of this situation, we should pay special attention  to  the following two issues:    One, the reform measures must be in close touch with  reality.  We must investigate and study and acquire a good understanding  of the situation at the grass-roots level, and thereupon, we can  formulate the reform program. At the same time, when the  higher-ups formulate a reform program, the grass-roots level  comrades should be asked to participate, and their suggestions  should be heeded; we must avoid doing everything behind closed  doors. We must pay close attention to the manageability of the  measures. Only in this way can we start out from reality, seek  truth from facts, shoot the arrow at the target--have a specific  goal, and pour water off a steep roof--operating from a  strategically advantageous position. Only then can we avoid  unnecessary repetition and loss and the reform measures can be  put into effect successfully.    Two, we must be decisive in implementing financial reform  and  try to achieve our goals in one step where possible. After the  reform measures are introduced, we must implement them with  resolution. If the new system is not quickly established, the  army's morale will be shaken and the troops will be unstable,  and some organs may become shortsighted--behaving improperly  from the ideological and organizational point of view, which  will adversely affect their everyday tasks and in turn  jeopardize the entire economic development. We must be decisive  when decisions are called for; otherwise, we may incur huge  losses. Agricultural Bank's profit is down this year. That has  something to do with the slow pace of the restructuring of the  economic system and our indecisiveness. The grass-roots organs  have been too eager to get their freedom and find their own  fortune and have not settled down to work. Some of the original  measures have been suspended, and the grass-roots offices have  lost their initiative and their enthusiasm. The second point is  that we must try to achieve our reform goals in one step where  possible. We might as well cut short the lingering pain and do  what we set out to do as quickly as possible and then settle  down to tackle our work. We must keep this principle in mind  when installing organs and arranging systems and  personnel-hiring mechanisms. We should treasure and seize the  opportunity before us and do a good job with the reform of the  financial institutions, give full play to the central role of  finance in a modern economy, and promote the establishment of  China's socialist market economic system and the economy's  sustained, smooth, and speedy development.    With regard to rural financial reform, the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th Party Central Committee's decision pointed  out that China's Agricultural Bank should be reorganized to take  on clearly defined policy-oriented business and that rural  cooperative banks and urban cooperative banks should be set up  step by step where necessary. The Central Committee's decision  was a correct one. The rural financial system should be put in  the context of the overall situation. Specifically, I have the  following suggestions:    The idea of setting up agricultural policy-oriented  banks is correct, but we must pay attention to their  efficiency.    In terms of the restructuring of the rural financial system  as a whole, it is essential that we separate policy-oriented  from business-oriented undertakings. This suits today's  condition of rural economic reform and facilitates the  restructuring of the rural economy and the financial system as a  whole. If we fail to make the separation, specialized banks  cannot emerge as commercial banks. As far as the rural financial  system is concerned, it still has arduous agricultural aid,  poverty relief, and economic development responsibilities. The  separation can help to guarantee the fulfillment of those  responsibilities.    What are policy-oriented banks? It is difficult to define  policy-oriented undertakings. The line between policy-oriented  and business-oriented undertakings is often blurred. Does  policy-orientation necessarily imply money-losing ventures? This  is not necessarily true.    One, what are policy-oriented banks? Policy-oriented banks  or  policy-oriented udertakings refer to supporting certain projects  in accordance with the government's macro program or industrial  policy or intention. This kind of support does not seek  immediate profit, but in the long-run, it does produce economic  benefits, although it takes a longer period of time. The  principle behind fund utilization is profit maximization. Some  of the large-scale policy-oriented projects the Agricultural  Bank once supported, such as the Huanghuahai development and the  Sanjiang basin development projects, were also profit-oriented.  Our overall goal is to turn banks into bona fide banks.  Policy-oriented banks are also banks. If they keep losing money,  they will not be banks. This point should be made very clear.    Two, policy-oriented banks' fund sources: One source is  funds  which the state used to appropriate but now lends out to banks.  They are state funds. Another source is the central bank's basic  currency (re-lending funds). This guarantees some low-cost  funds. A third source is the citizens' savings deposits and  enterprise deposits and so on which the policy-oriented banks  themselves must work hard to attract. When they make loans, they  can be business-oriented and should make sure that there is  profit to be made, or at least they are not lending money at  below cost. This is clearly different [as published] as  commercial banks do business.    Three, the installation of policy-oriented banks: We must  consider fully the realities of rural economic development and  install organs according to economic divisions, such as in  agricultural development areas and old liberated, minority  nationality, border, and remote areas; we should install fewer  or no organ in the coastal and other economically well-developed  regions. Policy-oriented banks can handle some commercial  business, but commercial banks must not seek funds earmarked for  policy-oriented undertakings. This is a necessary administrative  intervention; otherwise it will dampen the enthusiasm of  policy-oriented banks. These banks' organ installation, fund  sources, and interest policy must give expression to the term  "policy-oriented." They should be selective about certain  reform-oriented undertakings; they can enhance their ability to  tackle policy-oriented undertakings.    Four, policy-oriented banks must assume diverse functions.  The goal is to turn them into open, multipurpose, and modern  banks. They should handle international businesses, including  utilizing funds from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and  United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, but they  must not bring in foreign commercial loans.    In short, first and foremost, policy-oriented banks are  banks. They are not government agencies nor institutions, nor  are they the old, single-purpose Agricultural Bank. When we  plan, organize, and operate policy-oriented banks, we must put  them in the context of an international environment and the  greater environment of the market economy.    The installation of rural commercial banks must be  within definite regional boundaries.    China's rural areas have gone through more than a decade of  reform, and the development of the market economic system has  actually preceded that in the urban areas, and the rural  economy, especially the market economy, has developed rapidly.  It now requires the services of other compatible financial  institutions. The rapid growth of all types of enterprises in  the rural areas can provide fund sources for the commercial  banks, and facilitated by the bank's services, they can further  develop. A strong and well-developed rural economy can provide  more tax revenues for the state. This creates a benign cycle.    The installation of commercial banks require definite  regional boundaries. Commercial banks should not be set up in  poverty-striken regions; otherwise, they may draw funds away  from the policy-oriented banks. In the economically  well-developed regions, the Agricultural Bank should be  reorganized into a commercial bank. Commercial banks should be  set up according to international standards. We should smash all  kinds of rigid conventions, so that many commercial financial  institutions can exist in the same region, creating a  competitive situation and promoting better services.    It should be pointed out that setting up policy-oriented  banks is not the wisest choice. We should say that it is but a  transitional measure. Even after the policy-oriented banks are  set up, we still need a state-policy to guide the commercial  banks. For example, the state should have an incentive policy  when commercial banks voluntarily grant policy-oriented loans.  The general principle is to walk on two legs and make sure that  the state's policy-oriented undertakings are accomplished. In  this respect, we can learn from the successful experiences of  France and Thailand and other nations.    Reform of the rural credit organs should give  expression to the principle of providing classified guidance and  step by step implementation.    When talking about reform of the rural cooperative financial  institutions, it should be pointed out emphatically that they  were created and developed at a time when the cooperative  agricultural economy and the productive forces were  underdeveloped, and therefore we must give full expression to  the principle of classified guidance and step by step  implementation: In regions where the market economy is  well-developed, resources are regulated primarily by the market;  the environment has changed, the management standards are  higher, and they are financially stronger. People whom the  cooperatives used to serve and who bought shares now own only  nominal shares. Credit cooperatives exist in name only today;  the cooperative economic base is gone. Therefore there is a need  to reorganize them into agricultural cooperative banks. Promptly  setting up urban cooperative banks is practical in the  economically better-developed cities. In the poverty-striken  regions, the commodity economy is underdeveloped; they still  have a natural or semi-natural economy. Individual producers  have limited financial strength; they need the services of  credit cooperative-type organizations. Because this kind of  regional credit cooperative is small in scale, they cannot be  managed like cooperative banks. We must not use the same  measures across the board or lump everything together; we must  deal with different situations in different ways. The rise and  fall of rural credit cooperatives throughout history should be a  lesson to us.</p>

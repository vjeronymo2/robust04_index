			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION  </P> <P> What short memories we Americans have! When Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted the  surrender of Japan on Sept. 2, 1945, one of the terms of surrender required  Japan to draft a constitution pledged never to rearm again.  </P> <P> Japan accepted our demand, and for the past 40 years has poured its major  energies, money and resources into educating its young, in the fields of  science, industry, business management, art and architecture. It is little  wonder that Japan is attaining world influence in every direction. Japan has  for two generations invested mainly in its young! It has taken to heart Walt  Whitman's splendid injunction, "Create great persons. The rest all follows!"  </P> <P> President George Bush wants to be known in history as "the Education  President." He can be so known, if he makes education his and our highest  priority, taking to heart Whitman's words, "And you America . . . to girlhood,  boyhood look, the teacher and the school."  </P> <P> ROBERT STRASSBURG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

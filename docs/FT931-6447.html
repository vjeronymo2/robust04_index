			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Rome moves to restore political confidence THE Italian justice minister announced an initiative late last night aimed at restoring confidence in the country's political system, which has been battered by a widening corruption scandal. Mr Giovanni Conso said after a cabinet meeting that the government would on Friday unveil measures to 'restore legality' and ensure swift and simpler justice for corruption suspects. For many, this would apparently mean avoiding jail. Mr Conso said: 'We all feel how grave the situation is and there is a deep yearning for renewal. You can feel it in the air. We are surrounded by it. . . The country wants to turn over a new page and honest politicians must give it a chance. We must clean up every sector of our community from these worms which have undermined our democracy.' The government package will be reviewed at a cabinet meeting on Thursday. Rome's apparent intention is to ensure that public life is not paralysed by the scandals and to put some of the most common crimes beyond the reach of prosecutors. A growing number of senior political and business leaders have been implicated in corruption. Mr Conso said those who confessed and immediately paid back ill-gotten gains could request suspended jail sentences, he said. Other punishments, however, would also await them. Mr Conso said measures being discussed included barring politicians convicted of corruption from holding elected office. Businessmen found to have paid bribes would face unspecified 'commercial sanctions' and public administrators who took them would be excluded from jobs in the public service. The minister said that a new law on political party funding was needed but that the government wanted parliament to take the lead. Earlier yesterday, a former official of the Italian Communist party (PCI) was arrested by Milan magistrates on suspicion of operating a Swiss bank account to receive pay-offs from contracts in the power industry. Mr Primo Greganti, an official in the Turin branch of the PCI during 1970-87, voluntarily appeared for questioning in Milan yesterday and was later arrested for alleged corruption and illicit financing of the party. It is the first time Italian companies have been linked to alleged payments to the PCI made illicitly outside the country.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROG MAN  </P> <P> My fellow local herpetologists and I have noted the decline of frogs, but we  did not know that it was part of a larger syndrome. In Southern California, it  is easy to blame everything on development and habitat destruction.  </P> <P> This, apparently, is not the case worldwide. I do know that places I went for  frogs when I was a student in the early '60s no longer support any semblance of  the frog populations extant at that time.  </P> <P> If Jennings and Mark Hayes and other herpetologists concerned with the decline  in amphibians are correct in their theories about why these animals are  disappearing, I think we have a lot to think about -- but we better do it  quickly before this decline spreads irretrievably to the rest of the biome,  including us.  </P> <P> JERROLD J.

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANCASTER CITY COUNCIL ELECTS HARRISON AS MAYOR IN 4-1 VOTE  </P> <P> Lancaster City Councilwoman Lynn Harrison was elected mayor by a 4-1 vote of  the council Monday night.  </P> <P> Councilman George Theophanis cast the lone vote against Harrison, saying she  would not be able "to pull the council together." Theophanis said he opposed  Harrison because she and other council members had taken part in closed  discussions, which Theophanis alleged violated the state law that requires open  meetings.  </P> <P> Harrison denied the charge. She said that Theophanis had objected to a closed  discussion the council held at its April 17 meeting, but that the city attorney  had attended the session and ruled it legal.  </P> <P> Harrison took over the mayor's post from Councilman Els Groves, whom the  council elected unanimously last July after the sudden death of former Mayor  Nicholas J. Maluccio.  </P> <P> Councilmen Arnie Rodio and Bill Pursley joined Groves in voting for Harrison  Monday. They said Harrison, whose council term expires next year, would be an  excellent mayor.  </P></p>

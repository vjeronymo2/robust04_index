			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Alliance &amp; Leicester advances 45% Alliance &amp; Leicester yesterday became the latest building society to report a sharp increase in interim profits, primarily reflecting a steep drop in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Pre-tax profits at the UK's fourth largest society rose by 45 per cent to Pounds 134.4m (Pounds 92.6m) in the six months to June 30. Provisions fell 72 per cent to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 67m). The society does not have to publish interim results, but Mr Richard Pym, finance director, said A&amp;L had decided to do so for the first time to underline its accountability to its members. In an intensely competitive market, it took an aggressive stance on mortgage lending in the first half, more than doubling it to over Pounds 1bn. But in a reflection of competition and a narrowing of interest margins, net interest receivable slipped slightly to Pounds 265.6m (Pounds 270m). Other income, including fees and charges, rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 225m (Pounds 205.4m), largely as a result of higher profits from Girobank's corporate cheque and cash handling business. Mr Pym said A&amp;L was looking to develop further Girobank's relationship with Post Office Counters, if - as expected - the government gave the operation more commercial freedom. Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 320.3m (Pounds 309.6m) and the society also had exceptional expenses of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 6.2m). The cost-income ratio for the group, including Girobank, was 65 per cent - the same as in the first half of 1993. Mr Peter White, chief executive, said the general expenses included spending on developing and launching the Alliance account, and that underlying costs were flat. He expected exceptional costs of restructuring and relocating, as part of the group's strategic review, to be a continuing feature for the next couple of years. Against a background of an uncertain housing market, A&amp;L emphasised that it was not dependent on mortgage lending for growth, but had other opportunities, for example through greater cross-selling of financial products to its 5m personal customers.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UN Bosnian relief operation deadlocked The UN relief operation in Bosnia yesterday remained deadlocked over the Serb blockade of besieged Moslem enclaves, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. For the third day, Serb commanders refused to allow the passage of emergency aid across Serb lines to Cerska, a Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia. The British government condemned the Bosnian Serbs for their continued blockade and called on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to exert pressure on them to allow the free passage of aid. In a sharply worded protest, British diplomats in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, reminded Mr Milosevic of his pledges to let aid through to Moslem enclaves. The UN yesterday accused the Bosnian government of playing political games with their boycott as warehouses reached full capacity in Sarajevo.</p>

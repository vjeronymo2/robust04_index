			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboinikov, </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoi and others; from the  "Presidential Bulletin" feature]    [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan hopes that in January  it will be possible to organize working meetings between the  representatives of the Armenian and Azeri presidents concerning  a political settlement of the Karabakh conflict, INTERFAX was  told by Presidential Spokesman Aram Abramyan.    He said that at present Armenia was continuing consultations  with the Russian leadership on the issue. Such consultations,  said Abramyan, seem to be held between the Azeri leadership and  the leaders of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.    Abramyan said that to achieve a political settlement  meetings  at the level of foreign ministers, then at the level of the  presidents who are to sign an agreement had been planned. So  far, said the spokesman, it was a matter for the future.    Abramyan reaffirmed Armenia's preparedness to continue  backing Russia's peace-making initiatives.    The chairman of the parliamentary commission on  Nagorno-Karabakh, Seyran Bagdasaryan, said that not a single  politician, not a single international organization had the  right to determine the future of Nagorno-Karabakh. It was up to  the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to decide their future status.    He believes, though, that some provisions of the program on  the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, initiated by the  Russian president's aide, the well-known political scientist  Andranik Migranyan, are interesting and deserve to be considered.    IF Note: To settle the Karabakh and Abkhazian conflicts,  Migranyan proposes to grant to Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia  broad self-rule within Azerbaijan and Georgia. It is also  necessary to create demilitarized zones around Karabakh</p>

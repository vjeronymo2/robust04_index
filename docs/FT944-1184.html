			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Germany suffers drop in November bourse turnover Germany suffered a steep drop in bourse turnover in November, 17.9 per cent after a 1.9 per cent decline in October, and 22.4 per cent down from the average of the previous three months. Share prices fell 1.7 per cent on the month, notes Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the figures. On the poltical scene there were worries about the narrowness of Chancellor Kohl's majority; and international interest dropped particularly sharply, with turnover on Seaq International, London's screen-based system for dealing in international stocks, down by 28.6 per cent. Overall, European turnover declined by 3.2 per cent after falls of 3.4 per cent in October and 3.5 per cent in September. The fall was sustained in spite of turnover gains in five of the eight markets concerned, and reflected the weight of Germany in the total. The biggest individual rises in November came in France, up 10.8 per cent after a drop of 9.1 per cent in October, and in the UK, with a plus of 9.5 per cent against a previous fall of 10.3 per cent. France had underperformed for so long, says Mr Cornish, that investors were beginning to be attracted to its recovery prospects, while the UK was a cheap market in mid-economic recovery.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER              Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Bourse             Aug       Sept      Oct       Nov        US                   1994       1994     1994      1994    Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Belgium          56.27      62.29    69.68      60.31      1.87 France          146.71     169.87   154.46     171.19     31.78 Germany         152.68     134.81   132.26     108.54     69.13 Italy           46,276     52,060   47,972     41,848     25.85 Netherlands      23.90      19.50    25.80      26.20     14.90 Spain           903.85   1,011.44   978.61   1,022.72      7.80 Switzerland      18.80      19.60    23.50      25.40     19.12 UK               52.78      48.98    43.91      48.08     75.24  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Volumes represent purchases and sales.

In a statement published today by the Bahraini newspaper  AL-AYYAM, Dr. al-Iryani said these reports are baseless,  pointing out that the formation of a new Yemeni government is  presently not a subject of discussion.    The paper disclosed that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih has invited his "deputy" 'Ali Nasir Muhammad [former  president of South Yemen] to form a new Yemeni government to  replace the government of Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the current  Yemeni prime minister. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, however, rejected  the offer.</p>

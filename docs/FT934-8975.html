			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Interest costs cut Staveley to Pounds 7.5m LOWER interest rates on UK deposits reduced pre-tax profits at Staveley Industries, the measuring and mechanical engineering company which also owns British Salt. They fell from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 7.5m in the six months to October 2. However, the board declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.3p out of earnings per share of 4.9p (6p) and said the payment reflected its satisfactory financial position. 'While it is still early to predict the year as a whole, growth will be hard to obtain although the longer term is positive,' Mr Brian Kent, chairman, said. The interest charge increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 700,000, reflecting the lower income on deposits as well as higher net borrowings of Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 20.9m). Gearing at the period end was 29.4 per cent, against 26 per cent a year earlier and 22.8 per cent at the year-end. Turnover rose to Pounds 166m (Pounds 155.8m). The company said sales in continental Europe were particularly buoyant, because of the strong order position at the beginning of the year. Operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 9.2m) as the company absorbed charges of Pounds 1m associated with cost-cutting within the mechanical and electrical services and weighing and systems groups. Trading remained difficult. Operating margins fell to 4.9 per cent (5.9 per cent). Minerals contributed Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.7m) to operating profits on sales of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 15.7m), with British Salt enjoying steady volumes. Measurement gave a reduced Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.9m) on sales of Pounds 77.7m (Pounds 67.1m) as some continental European and North American businesses suffered reduced orders. Operating profits at mechanical and engineering services fell to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 1m), hit by cost cutting, on sales of Pounds 68.7m (Pounds 70.2m). Staveley said order intake showed a 'favourable swing', with contracting down 8 per cent but maintenance up 19 per cent.</p>

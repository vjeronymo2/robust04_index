			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BURN VICTIM, 12, WINS PRAISE  </P> <P> The wife of Mayor David N. Dinkins praised burn victim David Opont for "showing  more courage than people twice your age" by refusing to take drugs.  </P> <P> Opont, 12, suffered second- and third-degree burns in March when a neighborhood  bully tied him to a pole in an abandoned garage and set him afire when he  refused to smoke crack, authorities said.  </P> <P> His accused attacker, a 14-year-old, has been charged with attempted murder,  kidnaping, assault and robbery.  </P> <P> On Sunday night, at a fund-raiser for David at Manhattan Community College,  Joyce Dinkins praised the young man for standing up and saying no.  </P> <P> "True, you are just a child of 12," she said. "But when you refused to take  that poison drug into your system that fateful day . . . you took one giant  step into manhood."  </P> <P> Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, of "The Cosby Show," was the master of ceremonies  Sunday. At one point, he embraced David and told him: "David, you've got my  respect, man."  </P> <P> David had his own words of encouragement: "I've got a message for all the  children who are growing up. Have courage to just say no to drugs."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Manuel Mondino, president of the National Atomic  Energy Commission (CNEA), has proposed that the organization's  productive activities be turned into an incorporated state  enterprise that will be able to quote its shares on the stock  market.    "We have reached a stage in which the CNEA, which was born  as  a series of laboratories, has ended up creating a prolific  industrial activity that must be broken down into component  parts," Mondino said.    "The state tasks that cannot be delegated must remain within  the state and the productive components must be overseen by a  state incorporated company. The key is to maintain the  laboratory-factory unity," the CNEA chief added during the  commemoration of the organization's 44th anniversary.    The proposal to quote shares on the stock market, although  Mondino did not go into details, still must be approved by the  government. The CNEA and the Energy Secretariat still do not  have a common position on how to undertake the privatization of  nuclear activity, the only one that remains in the hands of the  state since the energy market's deregulation began two years ago.    But the CNEA Association of Professionals has demanded the  sanctioning of a law that will regulate nuclear activities.    The organization recalled that "the most advanced countries  consider energy a strategic asset."</p>

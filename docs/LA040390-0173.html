			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BOEING PROBES JETLINER SABOTAGE  </P> <P> Boeing Co. is investigating what apparently is a case of industrial sabotage,  after a jetliner failed tests because of wires that had been cut.  </P> <P> "It clearly seems to have been deliberate," T. Craig Martin, Boeing Commercial  Airplane Group spokesman, said late Monday.  </P> <P> "The evidence at this point would suggest it would be an employee but we want  to find out for sure."  </P> <P> Boeing's security personnel are investigating, the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> The Boeing 737 was in final assembly and undergoing testing at a Renton plant  when the cut wires were discovered, Martin said. It had not been determined in  what stage of construction the wires were cut, he said.  </P> <P> The damage was found about two weeks ago, KIRO-TV reported. "Scores" of wires  were severed, the TV station reported. It said there was a pattern of one or  two wires cut in a bundle of wires and the broken ends hidden deep inside the  bundle to mask the damage.  </P></p>

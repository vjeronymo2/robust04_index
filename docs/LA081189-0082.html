			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HUGE RENT-CONTROLLED COMPLEX IN SAN PEDRO TO BE RAZED FOR CONDOS  </P> <P> The Southwinds Apartments -- by far the largest rent-controlled apartment  complex in San Pedro -- have been vacated and will be torn down sometime within  the next several months to make way for luxury condominiums.  </P> <P> The 174-unit Southwinds development catered to moderate-income tenants and,  because its apartments are spacious, couples with children. Many tenants had  lived at the complex for years -- decades in some cases -- and thus paid rents  that were below market because of Los Angeles' rent control laws.  </P> <P> By last week, six months after they first received eviction notices, all the  tenants had moved out.  </P> <P> The replacement of Southwinds with condominiums follows trends in San Pedro,  where affordable housing is becoming more and more scarce as land prices spiral  upward.  </P> <P> City housing officials say the loss of Southwinds will have a significant  effect on the San Pedro rental market, where the average rent in 1988 was $694  -- compared to about $475 for new residents at Southwinds. But many tenants  were paying much less than that, some as little as $300 for a three-bedroom  apartment.  </P> <P> "It's really very sad because those buildings are basically sound," said  Barbara Zeidman, director of the city's rent stabilization program. "San Pedro  has very few large housing complexes, period. (Southwinds) is certainly the  last large block of more moderate rental units."  </P> <P> Southwinds, which sprawls over 9.3 acres between Western and Weymouth avenues,  north of 19th Street, will be replaced with 163 two- and three-bedroom  townhomes, according to San Pedro developer Eugene Bozulich.  </P> <P> Bozulich purchased the Southwinds complex with his partner, John Trutanich, in  1984. He would not disclose the purchase price.  </P> <P> The townhomes, which Bozulich said will sell for at least $300,000, will range  in size from 2,000 to 2,700 square feet and will have various amenities,  including fireplaces and two- and three-car garages.  </P> <P> The development, which Bozulich said will cost "in excess of $30 million to  build," will go up in phases and should be complete by 1992.  </P> <P> "It will be an asset to San Pedro," Bozulich said. "We're very proud of this  development. We're not out-of-towners just trying to make a buck and leave and  build a shabby project."  </P> <P> But before Bozulich and Trutanich begin construction, they must first move 48  of the Southwinds apartments to a site elsewhere in Los Angeles, to comply with  a requirement imposed by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> City officials say the requirement is intended to compensate for the loss of  rental housing when Southwinds is demolished. Bozulich said he and Trutanich  have contracted with a moving company to relocate the units but have yet to  find an available site.  </P> <P> In addition, the developers were required by city law to pay each Southwind  tenant between $2,000 and $5,000 in relocation assistance. They also hired  Griffith &amp; Associates, a company that specializes in relocation, to help  their tenants find new homes.  </P> <P> Southwinds tenants learned of the developers' plans in 1987, and occupancy at  the complex has dwindled since then. About 100 apartments were occupied when  eviction notices were sent out in February.  </P> <P> According to Zeidman, the eviction hit especially hard at Southwinds because  most of its former tenants are middle-class people -- too wealthy to qualify  for government housing subsidies, but not wealthy enough to be able comfortably  to afford San Pedro's high rents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 Qualify for Subsidies  </P> <P> Indeed, Penny Griffith, owner of Griffith &amp; Associates, said only five  Southwinds tenants qualified for subsidized housing. The rest, she said, have  had to "redo their budgets."  </P> <P> "Most of the buildings we deal with are rent-controlled buildings, and the  people are used to paying relatively low rent and they really don't want to pay  much more than that," Griffith said. "The realities are that to move, they'll  have to pay more rent."  </P> <P> Some former Southwinds tenants are now paying double or triple what they  previously paid.  </P> <P> One former tenant, who did not want to be named, said she paid $300 for a  three-bedroom apartment at Southwinds and is now paying $600 for a one-bedroom  unit elsewhere in San Pedro.  </P> <P> "You have to be rich or you have to be on welfare," she complained. "If you are  a middle-class person in San Pedro, you have no home, or you have to work two  jobs to find a place."  </P> <P> Another former resident, Lorraine Patalano, said she paid $362 a month for a  three-bedroom unit at Southwinds and is now paying nearly triple that amount  for a three-bedroom apartment elsewhere in San Pedro. Patalano, who had lived  at Southwinds for 16 years, said she splits the rent for her new apartment with  two of her children.  </P> <P> But for Patalano and other longtime Southwinds residents, the eviction meant  more than the loss of an affordable apartment. It also meant the breakup of the  Southwinds community.  </P> <P> "It's been real tough," said Christine Virgason, who was among the last to  move. "A lot of people have lived here for 20 years, and raised families. . . .  It used to be teeming with people, little kids all over the place. It was just  a nice, family-oriented place."  </P></p>

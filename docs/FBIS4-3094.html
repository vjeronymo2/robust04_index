			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Nepa Reveals $1.6m Pollution Fine Scheme"] </F>   [Text] The National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa)  yesterday announced a $1.6 million plan to improve China's  pollution charges system.    The two-year project involves a pollution study and aims to  work out new charges for offenders, said Lu Xinyuan, deputy  director of Nepa's supervision and development department.    It is being financed by a $1 million loan from the World  Bank  and 5 million yuan ($600,000) from central and provincial  governments.    All enterprises are to be taxed for emitting sulphur dioxide  before the end of the year and they will have to pay for  discharging solid waste next year.    Lu said the measures would help curb the spread of acid rain  which is caused by sulphur dioxide.    Acid rain damages crops, forests and buildings and costs  China an estimated 16 billion yuan ($2 billion) a year.    It is currently spreading from Southwest to East China, the  official said.    The country first adopted pollution charges in the late 70s.    And 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have  levied charges on 113 pollutants.    More than 200,000 enterprises nationwide have paid a total  of  18 billion yuan ($2 billion) in the past 15 years.    Last year, they paid 2.7 billion yuan ($310 million) -- more  than lO times the figure in the late 70s.    The charges have been used to subsidize the control of key  polluted areas.    And they have covered 6 per cent of the country's total  spending on the control of industrial pollution.    Studies into the uses of pollution charges in 24 large and  medium-sized cities showed 796 million yuan ($139 million at the  old exchange rate) had been levied on 3,901 enterprises in seven  years.    This cash, plus government investment, funded the  construction of more than 7,000 pollution-control projects  nationwide. They were designed to treat 794 million tons of  waste water and 199.1 billion cubic metres of waste gas a year.</p>

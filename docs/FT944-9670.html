			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Tianjin seals Dollars 1bn US deals - Contracts and Ventures Mr Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, China's third largest city, signed a clutch of agreements or letters of intent during a recent trip to the US, garnering a total of nearly Dollars 1bn in planned investments. Motorola has agreed to invest Dollars 360m to build its second manufacturing facility in the city, and General Electric plans a Dollars 246m expansion which would add four production lines to produce air conditioning units, refrigerators, washing machines and microwaves. Competition for foreign investment between China's provinces and cities has become increasingly intense. With its population of 9.2m, Tianjin is stressing its huge market, skilled workforce and 'stable society and fine public order'. However a survey of foreign investors said laws and regulations were ignored, intellectual property protection was inadequate, and its bureaucrats are incompetent, especially at the lower levels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty out of the 21 Christian hostages have been  finally released after being taken captive by the Abu Sayyaf  group in Basilan for six days. The only remaining hostage is  Father Cirilo Lacorda. The announcement was made by Armed  Forces Chief General Arturo Enrile in a news conference last  night at a military camp in Manila after receiving the report  from Armed Forces Southern Command Chief Orlando Soriano. Based  on the report, all the hostages, including 18 public school  teachers, were freed Monday afternoon. Enrile said that the  release of 20 Christian hostages was made possible with the  intervention of the civilian negotiators led by Basilan Governor  Gerry Salabudin to the local Abu Sayyaf leader Barhama Sali  alias Amir. However, the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines]  Chief of Staff did not mention whether the demand of the  kidnappers for a P[Philippine pesos] 1 million ransom for the  safe release of the hostages was paid. There are reports that  Gov. Salabudin paid P200,000.00 for the release of the 20  hostages.    Earlier, government authorities met three of the five  demands  sought by the notorious group of Muslim-based bandits for the  safe release of the hostages. Among these demands include: the  reinstatement of 737 Basilan-based schoolteachers who were  earlier terminated form service because they were not Civil  Service eligibles; disallowing the wearing of short pants by  female Muslim students during physical education activities and  allowing them to wear turbans while inside the campus and not to  allow military and police authorities to interfere with the  ongoing negotiations between the government and the bandits led  by (Juljilang).    The Abu Sayyaf group is also demanding the suspension of  military and police offensives in Basilan. However, AFP Chief  Arturo Enrile said that despite the safe release of the  hostages, massive military operations will resume against the  dreaded extreme Muslim fundamentalists operating in the  Provinces of Sulu, Basilan, Maguindanao, Cotabato and in the  cities of Zamboanga, Davao, Cotabato and General Santos.  General Enrile deployed a battalion of marine contingents from  Luzon to provide reinforcement to the government forces in  Mindanao.</p>

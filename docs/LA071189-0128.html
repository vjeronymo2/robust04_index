			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> BOY HELD AFTER CHASE IN STOLEN CAR  </P> <P> A 12-year-old boy driving a stolen car led sheriff's deputies on a 15-minute  chase early today that ended in Pasadena when he tried to run over a deputy,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Deputies found a stolen, unloaded AK-47 assault rifle in the car after they  arrested the 12-year-old El Monte boy, Deputy Pat Hunter said.  </P> <P> Deputies tried to stop the stolen car in Altadena at about 12:45 a.m., Hunter  said. The boy, however, refused to stop and led deputies on a chase through  Pasadena and Altadena at speeds of 35 to 65 m.p.h. "After the 15-minute pursuit  the youth drove the car onto an embankment as he attempted to enter the  eastbound Foothill Freeway," Hunter said.  </P> <P> As deputies approached the car on foot, the youth suddenly accelerated the  vehicle at the deputies, Hunter said. One deputy suffered a slight injury to a  knee as he jumped to avoid being struck. The boy was arrested without further  incident.  </P></p>

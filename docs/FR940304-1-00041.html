Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 20, 1993, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted a letter with attachments to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) addressing new source review in nonattainment areas. USEPA notified OEPA on October 22, 1993, that it found this submittal complete. This submittal was intended to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements for new source review in nonattainment areas, particularly the new requirements established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions for new source review in Ohio were included in the original State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on January 31, 1972, and replacement regulations submitted on June 6, 1973. The relevant regulations provided for best available control technology (BACT) and other requirements applied uniformly throughout the State. Subsequently, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 provided for designations of areas as being in attainment or nonattainment of the air quality standards, and required a further State submittal to impose additional requirements (most notably lowest achievable emission rates (LAER) and offsets) for new sources in nonattainment areas. Ohio submitted relevant material on July 25, 1980, and September 25, 1980. USEPA conditionally approved these submittals on October 31, 1980, on the condition that Ohio submit regulations delineating requirements that new sources in nonattainment areas must meet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio submitted revised regulations on October 4, 1982, and January 24, 1983. These regulations impose nonattainment area new source permitting requirements by incorporating appendix S to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 51 (appendix S to 40 CFR part 51_''Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling'') into the State regulations. USEPA granted limited approval to this submittal on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211), concluding that the regulation strengthened the SIP but did not fully satisfy the nonattainment area planning requirements established in 1977 in part D of title I of the Clean Air Act. Of particular concern were the exemptions of temporary sources and resource recovery facilities provided in appendix S (and thus incorporated by reference in the State rules) but not approvable under the criteria established in 40 CFR part 51, subpart I. By the time of this 1993 rulemaking, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 had imposed further requirements for nonattainment area new source review. The State provided USEPA material concerning the new requirements on November 19, 1992, December 2, 1992, January 13, 1993, and April 26, 1993. USEPA notified the State on June 1, 1993, that these materials did not represent a complete submittal. The State then provided additional information on August 20, 1993, which USEPA found on October 22, 1993, to constitute a complete submittal. USEPA has conducted a full review and proposes to disapprove the submittal for failing to satisfy the current nonattainment area new source review requirements of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established numerous new requirements for new source review. Among the more significant of these requirements that apply to Ohio are provisions for specific emission offset requirements in ozone nonattainment areas, including specified minimum offset rations, for review of major new sources and major modifications for nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in ozone nonattainment areas, and for an alternative siting analysis for all nonattainment area pollutants. Additionally, the State plan must include provisions for proper calculation of offsets, provisions reflecting certain substantial restrictions on growth allowances, provisions for supplying from nonattainment new source review permits to USEPA's RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, provisions relating to rocket engines or motors, provisions relating to stripper wells, provisions relating to the definition of ``stationary source'' affecting the treatment of internal combustion engine sources, and provisions relating to temporary clean coal technology demonstration projects. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The amended Act also requires that new source review requirements apply to lower size sources in areas classified Serious or above, and in some cases requires new source review for particulate matter precursor sources in particulate matter nonattainment areas. However, Ohio presently has no areas classified Serious or above, and the requirement relating to particulate matter precursors will not apply if USEPA finalizes a determination proposed on August 3, 1993, that precursors do not contribute significantly to particulate matter violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 Amendments also specify various deadlines for submittal of SIP revisions to satisfy these requirements. For areas designated nonattainment for fine particulate matter, a plan satisfying the requirements of sections 173 and 189 was to be submitted by June 30, 1992. For areas designated nonattainment and classified as marginal or above for ozone, a plan satisfying the requirements of sections 173 and 182 was to be submitted by November 15, 1992. For areas designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide, a plan satisfying the requirements of section 173 was to be submitted by November 15, 1993. The State of Ohio has areas designated nonattainment for ozone and particulate matter, for which it was required to meet these SIP revision deadlines. The August 20, 1993, material was submitted in an effort to satisfy these requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Review of State's Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Review Relative to Pre&hyph;1990 Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State's recent submittal does not address new source review requirements that applied prior to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Therefore, the USEPA review of the State's plan relative to pre&hyph;1990 requirements published on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211), remains current. The September 8 notice granted limited approval on the basis of the strengthening effect of the 1982 regulations relative to the prior SIP, but found the State's plan to be insufficient to meet the pre&hyph;1990 new source review requirements. The 1982 regulations essentially incorporate appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 by reference. USEPA identified deficiencies relating to the exemptions from offset requirements for resource recovery facilities and temporary sources provided in appendix S and therefore incorporated by reference into Ohio's regulations. Since these deficiencies have not been addressed, the State's new source review program continues to fail to satisfy part D requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The September 8 notice also noted that the provisions of appendix S, as incorporated by reference into Ohio's regulations, are not as explicit as the current requirements of subpart I of 40 CFR part 51 for annual, actual emissions offsets. Although USEPA interprets Ohio's regulations to require that federally enforceable actual emission offsets be obtained as a condition of any permit pursuant to part D, section 173(c) requires that Ohio clarify that this requirement applies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Review Relative to Post&hyph;1990 Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The substance of Ohio's submittal of August 20, 1993, is a document entitled ``Ohio EPA New Source Review State Implementation Plan_Requirements for Major New Sources in Nonattainment Areas.'' This document focuses on requirements established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and identifies OEPA's plans for implementing these requirements. This document is referred to below as Ohio's statement of permitting criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State's submittal provides no new regulations to govern review of new sources in nonattainment areas. Instead, the submittal states that regulations adopted in 1974 provide the necessary authority to implement the new requirements for new source review, and that these SIP approved regulations in conjunction with the submittal's statement of permitting criteria should satisfy Clean Air Act requirements. Thus, a key question in this rulemaking is whether USEPA can approve this approach and enforce the intended permitting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA, in its technical support document, evaluated the adequacy with which Ohio's submittal satisfies selected key requirements. USEPA's review indicated that the statement of permitting criteria does not provide adequate specificity and clarity of criteria by which detailed implementation decisions would be made. The following discussion of sample requirements illustrates the basis for this conclusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that specified offset ratios for volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions and presumptively for nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) emissions must be obtained in ozone nonattainment areas. That is, any significant increase in potential emissions for either of these pollutants must be accompanied by an decrease in actual emissions that is larger by at least a specified ratio. Ohio's statement of permitting criteria includes: (1) A preliminary clause stating that ``the following additional requirements will be applicable,'' (2) an item 1 identifying ``minimum required offset ratios,'' and (3) an item 4 noting that ``NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  . . . shall be treated as a nonattainment pollutant'' in ozone nonattainment areas. No definition of offset ratio is provided, and so it is unclear what averaging time applies, whether offsets are to reflect allowable or actual emissions, whether all emission increases must be offset (e.g., fugitive and secondary emissions), where the offsets must occur, and whether interpollutant offsets are permissible. (Item 4 of Ohio's statement implies that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  offsets must come from the same county as the emission increases.) The statement also does not explicitly state that either VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  offsets are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second new requirement is that the other various major source requirements (e.g., lowest achievable emission rates) also apply to major sources of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in ozone nonattainment areas, unless USEPA makes certain determinations that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control would not be beneficial. Ohio implies the applicability of these requirements by making the above statement that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is to be treated as a nonattainment pollutant. Ohio's statement continues that ``[n]ew source applicants are required to meet the major new source definitions and major modifications thresholds as specified in the CAA.'' However, the Clean Air Act itself does not explicitly define ``major new source'' and does not specify major modification thresholds. Also, Ohio's statement could be read to require all sources to meet the size minimums for major new sources or major modifications. Ohio's statement continues: ``For major modifications, these CAA requirements will be applicable to sources of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  greater than 40 tons per year.'' It is not clear whether Ohio intends this apparent reduction from 100 to 40 tons per year of the threshold of source sizes at which major modifications trigger new source review requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review of further requirements established by the 1990 Amendments is provided in the technical support document. The conclusion of USEPA's review is that the statement of permitting criteria does not address many of the questions that would arise in imposing the identified requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Analysis of the Need for Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above examples clarify a central issue in this rulemaking, i.e. whether formal regulations are necessary to establish the requirements dictated by the Clean Air Act. Ohio's statement and the submittal cover letter present the State's position that existing Ohio statutes and regulations already require that the provisions of the amended Clean Air Act be met. Specifically, Ohio notes that its Rule 3745&hyph;31&hyph;05 requires that permits to install shall be issued only if the construction and operation will ``not result in a violation of any applicable laws,'' which is defined to include the Clean Air Act including any amendments. Although Ohio proceeds to describe in general terms how it intends to apply the new requirements, the submittal cover letter expressly states that ``the current, federally approved, Ohio SIP is adequate for fulfilling the requirements of a NSR SIP, and that no changes are necessary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio's position raises fundamental questions about the role of implementing regulations. In general, statutes present general criteria that must be met, whereas regulations define the specific requirements that apply in each circumstance. In limited circumstances a statute may be enforced without implementing regulations, but generally regulations are necessary to define the precise obligations of affected individuals and the precise criteria by which relevant decisions (e.g. determinations of compliance) will be made. The proper adoption of clearly defined criteria for making relevant decisions is essential to support these decisions. Therefore, in the absence of exhaustively detailed statutes, the adoption of detailed regulations is essential for successful program implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of new source review, the Clean Air Act identifies general provisions which are to be included in State plans. The State's statement of permitting criteria closely parallels the language in the Clean Air Act. As the above examples illustrate, Ohio's submittal fails to define many of the details of how these requirements would be implemented. In the absence of these details, a subject source could not be expected to know its obligations pursuant to these requirements, and could object to the imposition of the general requirements based on the failure of the State to pre-define the specific criteria that would be applied. Further, as a commenter noted when the State proposed its SIP revision, the statement of permitting criteria was not adopted according to the full procedures in Ohio for adoption of regulations, even though this statement is intended to serve purposes normally served by regulations. Consequently, the statement of permitting criteria lacks the specificity, the regulatory standing, and the assurance of being enforceable that are needed to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA's review indicates that Ohio's submittal does not clearly establish the specific criteria by which judgments in new source permitting will be made. Furthermore, by relying not on properly adopted regulations but rather on a general regulatory provision (requiring compliance with the Clean Air Act) in conjunction with a statement of permitting criteria, the State has failed to follow proper procedures to become authorized to impose specific, detailed permit conditions in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements. In addition, the existing regulations exempt two types of sources which may not be exempted under applicable USEPA regulations. For these reasons, USEPA proposes to disapprove Ohio's submittal for failure to satisfy part D requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 179(a)(2), if USEPA takes final action to disapprove a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, USEPA must apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to USEPA: highway funding restrictions, and a requirement for two-for-one offsets. The 18-month period referred to in section 179(a) would begin to run at the time USEPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval would trigger the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). Separate rulemaking is being conducted to identify which sanction would apply first and to address related issues on the application of sanctions, for example whether USEPA must publish final approval of a new submittal before the deficiency may be considered corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment is solicited on this proposed rulemaking action. Comments received by [Insert date 30 days from date of publication] will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this disapproval action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Nitrogen oxides, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur dioxide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  7401&hyph;7671q. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David Ullrich,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Regional Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4992 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

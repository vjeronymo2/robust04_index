			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Mines at risk as bidders stay away HOPES OF RESCUE for a large number of pits discarded by British Coal were fading last night after it emerged that private-sector companies were interested in mining only one of the first four on offer. British Coal said it had received bids, accompanied by bonds of Pounds 50,000, for three of the four pits. However, in two cases, Cotgrave and Silverhill in Nottinghamshire, the proposals involved only the surface assets of the mines and there were no plans for continuing mining at them. The Union of Democratic Mineworkers has already announced the formation of a joint venture with Vista Partnership in an attempt to create up to 900 jobs for former miners at Cotgrave and Silverhill. The plan is to build domestic waste recycling and disposal facilities on the sites. The one pit of the four where mining may still continue is Easington in Durham. RJB Mining is thought to be among the bidders and may be the only one. Yesterday's developments mean British Coal is likely to move swiftly to close finally the Bolsover mine in Derbyshire, the last of the four to be offered in the first batch. Another 15 pits are on offer with bidding deadlines still open. Industry observers believe it is unlikely that more than six of the 19 pits will be mined, although more than 300 initial expressions of interest have been received by British Coal.</p>

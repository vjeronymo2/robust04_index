			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (22): Group D - Greece Greece, helped by the withdrawal of Yugoslavia, one of the seeds in their group, galloped through their qualifying matches. Apart from Germany, the holders, they were the first European country to qualify for the US. It will be Greece's first finals appearance. Even so, for many of their players, it was too late: these are the ancient Greeks. In recent friendlies they have used up to seven over-30s and three over-35s. Captain Tasos Mitropoulos is 37, goalkeeper Antonis Minou is 36. The team's recent form has been poor. It lost 3-0 at home to Colombia, was booed in a 0-0 draw at home against Bolivia, and lost 5-0 at Wembley against England. In that game the Greeks passed prettily and skilfully but were carved open by the English. It seems that, on their debut, the Greeks will be happy to adorn the World Cup. Even the one win that could carry Greece into the second round could be beyond them.</p>

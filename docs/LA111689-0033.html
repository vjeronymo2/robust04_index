			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RISING VANDALISM OF U.S. MAILBOXES UNDER INQUIRY  </P> <P> A rash of mailbox vandalism in La Canada Flintridge has prompted U.S. postal  inspection officials to step up investigation of the problem.  </P> <P> In the last six months, 40 incidents of mailbox vandalism have been reported to  the U.S. Postal Service, according to La Canada Flintridge Postmaster Penny  Stevenson.  </P> <P> "But that number is even higher," Stevenson said. "Many of these crimes go  unreported."  </P> <P> U.S. Postal Service spokesman John Conte said, "The area has recently been  plaqued with the destruction of mailboxes with clubs or baseball bats or  similar instruments."  </P> <P> Postal Inspector Donald Obritsch termed this type of vandalism "mailbox  baseball. Kids ride around in a pickup truck or convertibles and strike the  mailboxes," he said.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement division of the U.S.  Postal Service, has been called in to step up the investigation. This includes  notifying high school teachers and parents of the problem and punishment  involved. In addition, postal inspectors "home in on a few suspects," Obritsch  said.  </P> <P> "We already have some leads and other information that we hope will result in  some arrests soon," he said.  </P> <P> Obritsch said officials are concerned about the recent increase in mailbox  destruction because the trend has not declined as expected following the usual  rash of neighborhood vandalism during Halloween.  </P> <P> Destruction of mailboxes is considered a federal offense and carries a penalty  of up to $10,000 or 10 years in jail or both.  </P></p>

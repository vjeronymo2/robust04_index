			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: Cool recycling technique - Worth Watching Freezing temperatures could provide an economical way of recycling used tyres. Aga has installed a recycling plant for the Swiss company Elude which uses a process called cryogenic fragmentation. The tyres are shredded and fed into a tunnel where liquid and gaseous nitrogen cools the fragments to below -80`C. A hammer mill then pounds the chips which separate into their components: steel, textiles and rubber granules. The rubber granules can be used for athletics tracks and even rubberised asphalt for road surfaces. Aga: Switzerland, 61 821 7282; UK, 0203 650 566.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Events" newscast] </F>   [Text] Tomas Borge, member of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN] Board of Directors, said the FSLN does  not oppose the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility [ESAF].  It opposes the harsh terms contained therein. Borge said at a  FSLN political activity held during the weekend that they do not  oppose the foreign resources that the signing of the ESAF by the  national government and the IMF would guarantee. Borge  disclosed that the FSLN told the government and the ESAF experts  during a meeting held last week to discuss the terms under which  the financial institution would loan the government  approximately $82 million, that those resources should be  earmarked mostly for production and not for the payment of  Nicaragua's foreign debt.    According to the Sandinist leader, they proposed to Violeta  Chamorro's government as well as to the IMF that the freezing of  the foreign debt should be urged. To avoid a social outbreak in  the nation, they also proposed less harsh terms with regard to a  massive dismissal of government workers, as well as other terms  that will adversely affect the needy sectors. Nevertheless, the  government paid no heed to the FSLN recommendations.    Tomas Borge said the nation must unite to face the  international financial institutions and their impositions. The  FSLN leader stated that only the nation's unity can save it from  the disaster resulting from the measures that the IMF will  impose through the so-called ESAF agreement. To approximately  200 FSLN members this weekend, Borge made reference to the ESAF  as follows:    [Begin Borge recording] We cannot go against the  possibilities of foreign aid for this country. Therefore, we do  not oppose the ESAF in general. What we oppose are [words  indistinct], the conditions, the terms set out, and terms of the  agreement. These matters deeply violate the nation's  sovereignty. Currently, however, sovereignty is described in  other terms - we cannot speak in the same terms as in the past.    The international financial institutions are now going to  decide on Nicaragua's internal budget and tax policies. The  high-ranking leaders of the private sector have decided this. I  am very pleased that [words indistinct] government its fiscal  policy. But if I were the government I would be ashamed if a  condition is imposed on me. [Words indistinct] outright  violates national interests. Many of the aspects agreed upon,  in principle, violate the nation's Constitution and other laws.  What is more, it is indicated that if any law of the Republic  approved by the Legislative Assembly contradicts this agreement,  such as [words indistinct], it will be vetoed by the Executive  Branch.    We believe that the international organizations should, in  effect, contribute to this country with foreign aid, as long as  it does not harm the nation's sovereignty and dignity, and much  less harm the workers' rights. The outlook for this country is  greater poverty, growing unemployment, and generalized hunger.  This is what it appears to mean. Now, what choice do we have?  It think it would be wise to unite the whole nation, [words  indistinct] if the government itself were united. [end recording]</p>

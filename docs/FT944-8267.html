			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Metals Base metals prices enjoyed an extraordinary trading period last week. The prices of copper and aluminium clambered 5 per cent in frantic trading on the London Metal Exchange. That was the culmination of a bull run which has driven base metal prices up more than 60 per cent since January. The rise in some of the metals may be justified. Reserves of copper on the LME have fallen nearly 50 per cent since this time last year, leaving less than five weeks' stocks. Demand, driven by rapid economic growth, is expanding fast. Meanwhile, new supply is not due to come on-stream until the second half of next year. Similarly, aluminium stocks have fallen 20 per cent, with demand strong and supply controlled until at least the end of 1996 through a voluntary agreement by manufacturers. But stocks of tin, lead, zinc and nickel, all of which have posted impressive increases this year, have risen over the last 12 months. Even if demand is strong, supply appears stronger. The arrival of speculative commodity and hedge funds indiscriminately buying baskets of metals are the main cause of the explosion in prices. They have viewed commodities such as metals as a hedge against inflation. But the scale of the funds has swamped the fundamentals of the metals markets. No doubt, when the fashionable money flows out again - and it will because metals pay no interest - prices will suffer a sharp correction. With many funds anxious to book profits before the year-end, the base metal bubble could burst before Christmas.</p>

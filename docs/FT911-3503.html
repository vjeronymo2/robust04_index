			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Made in Britain, Japanese-style: Car manufacturing in the UK is still set to expand, despite the immediate problems of recession The 1990s was supposed to be the decade of opportunity for the motor industry in Britain. But as one crisis meeting succeeds another this week, one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry is slipping back into the dark days of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The chief executives of Rover, Ford of Britain, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot troop into the Treasury today to tell Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of their deep concern at what they see as an attack on car manufacturing in last month's Budget. Tomorrow union leaders have been called to talks with Mr Albert Caspers, Ford of Europe's director for manufacturing operations, amid speculation - strenuously denied by Ford itself - that the future of the US car maker's British assembly plants at Halewood, Merseyside and Dagenham in Essex, is again in doubt. Yet the paradoxical fact is that more car assembly capacity is under construction in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. By the mid-1990s output is forecast to be more than double the crisis level of the early 1980s. As the Japanese car makers march in, component suppliers that have previously shunned manufacturing in the UK are buzzing towards the honey-pot. The script looked promising, but for the moment the plot appears to be going badly awry. After five successive record years from 1985 to 1989 UK new car sales have fallen ominously. Registrations last year were down by 12.7 per cent - admittedly from a record level - and have plunged by a further 21.6 per cent in the first quarter. Highly indebted car dealers - reputable groups as well as fringe operators - are collapsing into receivership and liquidation in worrying numbers. Leading component makers are suffering sharply falling profits and workforces are being cut. 'The current climate is hostile and in many of our markets customer demand is erratic and uncertain,' says Mr Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, a leading UK auto components maker. Truck sales are only half the level of two years ago and the slide into recession is sharper than any UK truck maker can remember in the post-war period. 'Heaven only knows how some manufacturers are surviving,' says Mr Peter Foden, chairman of ERF, the last publicly-quoted, independent UK truck maker. Most UK truck makers are running up big losses, and short-time working and redundancies have been the order of the day for more than a year. Against a background of such immediate traumas Mr Derek Barron, chairman of Ford of Britain and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Mr George Simpson, chief executive of Rover, Mr Paul Tosch, chairman of Vauxhall, and Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot Talbot, will seek to convince the chancellor that he has kicked the industry when it was already down. As the economic cycle turned down, they had been looking to the government for support and encouragement in the attempt to make the industry a driving force again in the UK economy. Instead, in a Budget principally designed to extricate the government from the poll tax debacle, the industry was hit by higher value added tax - but no relief in the discriminatory special car tax  -fuel tax increases and scale charge increases for company car benefits above the level of inflation, and the imposition on employers of national insurance contributions on company cars. The motor industry worries that the government is looking to it for a quick fiscal fix. Memories run deep of the 1950s and 1960s, when the government sought to regulate the economy in part through car hire purchase controls. 'The industry wants reassurance that this is not the beginning of it being used again as an economic regulator,' says Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the Commons trade and industry select committee. Above all the car makers are seeking a cut in the 10 per cent rate of special car tax. The industry argues that no other leading vehicle producing country in Europe singles out cars for such a discriminatory levy as the special car tax. This year is probably already a lost cause for the industry - the latest forecasts suggest car sales will struggle to exceed 1.6m-1.7m units and truck sales could hit the lowest level for decades. Nevertheless, the worst fears of the industry chiefs may well turn out to be only short-term; Britain could still prove to be one of the strongest growth areas of the 1990s in the world auto industry. The current recession is certainly causing painful job losses beyond the labour force reductions of an industry seeking greater productivity and efficiency. But the deepest and most painful restructuring moves were already achieved in the 1980s. A report by the Institute of Manpower Studies showed that from 1980 to 1987 the UK vehicles and parts industry had shed 185,000 jobs, or 45 per cent of the workforce at the start of the decade. In the same period labour productivity rose 66 per cent. Profits certainly fell last year at Vauxhall, Peugeot Talbot and Rover. At Ford of Britain, they fell sharply: the company was hit by industrial action last year and is now also carrying the heavy losses of Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker it acquired at the end of 1989. But that is a far cry from the sea of red ink in which the industry fought to stay afloat a decade ago. It is altogether leaner and fitter now. 'The UK is probably top middle in productivity in Europe,' says Prof Rhys, 'way behind Germany, probably behind Spain, but perhaps ahead of France. But what saves the UK is its relatively low wages. With middling productivity and the lowest wages, the UK has one of the best cost bases in Europe.' Wage costs in the UK motor industry last year were the lowest among all the world's leading automobile-producing countries, according to statistics compiled by the German Automobile Industry Federation (VDA). Some assembly capacity in the UK still has to be closed - most notably part of Rover's Cowley, Oxford plant - but the accent in the 1990s, at least in the car and components sectors, should be firmly on expansion. According to Prof Rhys an optimistic forecast would suggest a leap in UK car assembly capacity from 1.7m in 1989 to 2.7m-2.8m by the end of the decade. It is the motor industry in Britain that will be growing, however, not the British motor industry. In terms of ownership precious little of the latter remains. What is transforming the sector's prospects is the wave of inward investment by Japanese car makers into the UK. The decisions by Nissan, Toyota and Honda to begin car production in the UK appear to guarantee that output in the second half of the 1990s will exceed 2m cars a year, more than double the level of the first half of the 1980s, and the build-up of production promises eventual relief for the sector's chronic trade deficit. To Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of France's Peugeot group and philosopher-king of the lobby to restrict Japanese car sales in Europe, the UK is fast becoming a 'Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe,' and 'Japan's fifth-largest island'. The alarming trend of UK car sales, imports and production in the 1970s and 1980s explains at a glance, however, why the government has welcomed Japanese car makers to Britain so enthusiastically. Since 1983 the UK balance of payments has shown a deficit on manufactured goods - and the motor industry has played a key role in the slump. The motor industry trade balance has deteriorated sharply since the end of the 1970s and been firmly in deficit since 1982. In recent years it has accounted for close to a third of the total UK visible trade deficit. The first relief came last year, as the deficit fell to Pounds 4.6bn from Pounds 6.6bn in 1989. The biggest factor in the improvement was the impact of the recession, however, which cut imports as new car sales fell. Now there are also the first signs of structural improvement, as UK car exports begin to grow appreciably. Export programmes by Vauxhall, Ford and Peugeot have been important. But for the first time exports by Nissan are also having a significant impact and this year Nissan begins to export cars to Japan from the UK. The drama of the fluctuations in the fortunes of motor manufacturing in the UK can hardly be overstated. From the early 1930s to 1955 the UK had Europe's largest motor industry. It is currently ninth in the world production league and fifth in Europe behind West Germany, France, Italy and Spain. In 1968 when the UK-owned industry combined its forces to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation, the company accounted for 40 per cent of UK new car registrations. Today the rump company that remains from British Leyland, Rover Group, is 20 per cent owned by Honda of Japan, and last year it held 14 per cent of UK new car sales. Compare that with the rise of the Japanese. Back in 1952 Nissan was producing Austin cars in Japan under licence from Austin Motor, and Honda did not even market its first car until 1963. It now appears a racing certainty that by the second half of the 1990s Japanese car makers will account directly for about a third of UK car production of about 2m units a year. Another third may be European-owned with Peugeot of France producing at Ryton, Coventry, possibly with an enhanced capacity, and Rover Group at least nominally UK-owned. Rover is already importantly dependent on Honda technology, however, in addition to its minority ownership. The remaining third of the UK car production base will be US-owned, with Ford also controlling Jaguar and Aston Martin and General Motors (Vauxhall), Lotus. With total planned investments of more than Pounds 1.8bn the Japanese are now committed to closing the yawning gap between UK car production of 1.296m last year and domestic car sales of 2.009m: Nissan will build more than 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 700m Sunderland plant by 1992-93. Output totalled 76,000 last year and is expected to reach 120,000 this year with 80 per cent earmarked for export. Nissan is also investing in UK R&amp;D facilities. Toyota is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by late 1995 rising to 200,000 cars a year by 1997-98 at Burnaston, near Derby, but this timetable could well be brought forward. It is investing Pounds 840m in car assembly and engine plants. Honda is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by 1994 at its Pounds 350m Swindon assembly and engine plant. Rover is producing up to 40,000 Honda Concertos a year at its Longbridge Birmingham plant. Nissan has indicated its ambition to expand to a capacity of 400,000 cars a year by the late 1990s, and both Toyota and Honda are expected to expand significantly beyond their present publicly declared targets. The next time a chancellor attacks the UK motor industry, the deputation on his doorstep may well include Nissan, Toyota and Honda as well as Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dollar rally and buy programs boost Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices rose sharply in heavy trading yesterday, buoyed by a dollar rally, computer buy programs and hopes that lower interest rates will boost economic activity, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.77 at 3,305.16. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 3.59 to 419.95, while the American SE composite gained 1.99 at 384.81 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 6.35 to 581.24. Turnover on the New York SE reached 222m shares. The dollar's performance - it held its ground early on in New York before rallying to a DM1.4258 close - and gains overnight in Japanese and European equity markets set the tone for a positive day's trading. Sentiment was also lifted by hopes among some investors that the latest decline in interest rates will eventually feed through into economic growth. Prices did not take off, however, until mid-afternoon when a series of buy programs hit the market, lifting share prices across the board. The market was also helped by expectations that President Bush would unveil some new economic proposals in his speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The speech, however, contained nothing new, although most stocks held on to their gains. Chubb fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 75 1/4 after Kemper Securities lowered its 1992 earnings estimate to take account of losses which the insurer will incur as a result of Hurricane Andrew. Estimates put those losses at between Dollars 35m and Dollars 45m for Chubb. National Semiconductor firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 12 on fiscal first- quarter net income of 17 cents a share, a sharp turnround from the Dollars 1.64 a share loss taken after a charge at the same stage of 1991. Gillette declined Dollars 1 but recovered to end only Dollars  1/4 off at Dollars 57 1/8 after announcing the acquisition of UK group Parker Pen Holdings, for about Dollars 561m. The acquisition will be financed with new borrowings. Best Buy closed off the day's high and up just Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 17 1/2 after the electronic appliance retailer said it was 'comfortable' with analysts' forecasts of 25 cents a share earnings for the third quarter. On the Nasdaq market, Apple shed Dollars 1 initially to Dollars 48 in heavy trading after the computer group announced a restructuring which would lead to job cuts and a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of Dollars 20m. The stock recovered along with the market, however, and ended a net Dollars  1/4 up at Dollars 49 1/4 . Alliance Pharmaceutical plunged Dollars 4 3/4 , more than 30 per cent, to Dollars 10 on news that clinical trials on two of the company's products will not resume this month. Canada A RISE in the Bank of Canada's key interest rate, combined with worries over the weakness of the Canadian dollar, kept Toronto from following Wall Street's good rally. The TSE 300 index slipped 5.1 to 3,443.9 but rises exceeded declines by a small margin of 280 to 257. Volume was a fairly heavy 30.5m shares. PWA gained 5 cents at CDollars 3.45 and Air Canada retreated 40 cents to CDollars 3.90 following PWA's acceptance of the proposal to merge its Canadian airlines with Air Canada.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tories short of doorstep ammunition - Labour is poised for gains in the west Midlands ACROSS the red-brick conurbations of the Midlands, candidates are confronting a deep mood of austerity that in some cases assumes almost Dickensian proportions. A visit to an ordinary household trapped by falling house prices and numbed by the fresh poll tax demand is a visit to Bleak House. But the worst of times for Conservatives has been the best of times for Labour. For the first time in nearly 20 years, Labour is in a position to win political superiority in the west Midlands. It needs a swing of 10 per cent across the region to regain the status it had in 1974. Events of the last two years and the impact of the campaign suggest, however, that the swing is not so much towards Labour as away from the Conservatives. Behind the displays of Conservative faith and the fighting talk, the cracks are showing. The Tory campaign has not gone well. You can see it in the offices, on the streets and among the party workers. Heads are down and recriminations are whispered. Mr David Gilroy Bevan, with a tenuous Conservative hold on Birmingham Yardley, admits: 'The electorate is not responding because we have not got the message over sufficiently well to have persuaded people of the real facts.' Local Labour leaders sense this: at a meeting this week of council chief executives, the talk was that Labour councillors were beginning to look smug. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives have much to fear in the west Midlands from the Liberal Democrats, whose best chance of winning a seat lies in Birmingham Yardley. This is not to say that they will fail to pick up votes, however. They could benefit from election boredom and the distaste for the bickering of the two main parties - most noticeable during the 'War of Jennifer's Ear'. Yet a poll for yesterday's Birmingham Evening Mail gave Labour a strong lead in Yardley. The poll, by Quality Fieldwork, gave Labour 40 per cent (up from 36.6 per cent in 1987), the Conservatives 35 per cent (42.6 per cent) and the Liberal Democrats 24 per cent. People feel that they have done everything the Conservative government has asked. They have rejected the union extremists. They have accepted new working practices and strike curbs. Yet the bargain has not cut both ways. There is no job security. While many in the west Midlands earn more and live better than they did a decade ago, the region experienced only a brief period of prosperity between two severe recessions. The downturn of the early 1980s damaged the manufacturing sector, although the parts which survived emerged leaner and more resilient. But even during the short-lived recovery of the mid and late 1980s, the number of manufacturing jobs continued to decline. This has been offset by the growth of the services sector, but growth has been curtailed by the current recession. The regional economy is still in the throes of adjustment, and the latest surveys convey the message that any thought of sustained growth can be put off until next year. Against this background, it is not surprising that the Conservatives are short of ammunition on the doorstep. The choice of daily themes from Central Office seems to bear little resemblance to the realities of life. Concerns are basic. 'People do not actually ask us what is the theme for today. On one canvass last week people were more worried about the state of the pavements in the shopping centre,' says Mrs Sandra Brew, the election agent for Mr Roger King, defending the Conservative marginal of Birmingham Northfield against Labour's Mr Richard Burden. The Tories have made great play of the tax issue. But while the Budget concessions at the lower end of the tax bracket were handy, they have not been large enough to have an impact when the main concern is whether the job will still exist next Monday. Charges that Labour will tax everybody out of existence have a hollow ring in a relatively low-wage economy; according to the West Midlands Low Pay Unit, 45.2 per cent of the region's workforce earn less than a basic Pounds 185 a week. Moreover, the regional economy is critically dependent on the car industry. Mr Gilroy Bevan says: 'Suddenly the motor business on which the west Midlands was founded collapsed. New cars were not selling. Secondhand cars were not selling and long-lease was not working. I urged the chancellor to take the whole special levy off in one go. But I was told it would be too expensive.' The reduction of the sales tax on new cars from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the last Budget may boost sales, but in Mr Gilroy Bevan's view the concession came too late to make much difference to the election. If the Conservative campaign has been undermined by recession, Labour's message has an appealing simplicity. Mr John Cooper, the candidate for Amber Valley in Derbyshire (now becoming a car county by virtue of Toyota's presence), delivers a straightforward doorstep message: jobs, health, education and jobs again, capped by the question: 'Isn't it time for a change?' Knowing that the recession has inevitably eroded the Tory vote, Labour has been chiselling at the cracks. But the bedrock could be stronger than Labour thinks, for two reasons. First, the west Midlands has a strong tradition of working-class Toryism. Its engineering plants tended to be smaller than, say, the vast textile works which once dominated the north-west and Yorkshire. This produced a closer relationship between boss and worker, making less relevant the old shibboleths of the class war. The second reason relates to little doubt that west Midlanders identify with a prime minister who did not go to university and knows what it is like to be out of a job. How this issue of identification with Mr Major will affect the outcome is unclear. The campaign revolves around the question of trust: which leader can best be relied upon to ease, and then cure, the pain of recession? The parties are getting different answers on the doorstep. The Conservatives suggest that there is a vast number of uncommitted voters. Labour claims that its new pin-striped style is attracting Tory voters. Observation on the ground suggests that Labour is likely to be proved right. It does not carry the burden of the Tories' recent economic record. However, its well-tuned campaign machine will have to work hard to get the voters out.</p>

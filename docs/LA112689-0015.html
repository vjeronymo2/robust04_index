			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF . . . CATHERINE BURNS  </P> <P> Catherine Burns, once cast as the consummate outsider, has finally found her  niche.  </P> <P> Burns snagged an Academy Award nomination for her first film role -- priggish,  pug-nosed Rhoda, the definitive late bloomer in the 1969 drama "Last Summer."  But her screen career went nowhere fast and she eventually left Hollywood for  regional theater. Now, during the film's 20th anniversary year, the actress has  emerged as a writer.  </P> <P> Burns has written about two dozen plays and screenplays in the last 15 years,  but it was only this fall that she sold her first work -- three episodes for  the CBS daytime drama "The Guiding Light." She's got an agent at Curtis Brown  to represent her latest play and a screenplay co-written with husband Kenneth  Shire (they were married in June).  </P> <P> The daughter of a journalist, Burns feels that writing is in her blood.  </P> <P> "If you do something well, you like it," she explained from her Upper West Side  apartment in Manhattan, surprising herself with the analysis. "What a  reasonable and sane thing to say! I didn't know I could say anything so  normal."  </P> <P> After raves for "Last Summer," the "out of type" actress went on to largely  forgettable appearances in "Red Sky at Morning" and several TV movies, with her  screen career petering out in the late 1970s. By her own admission, she wasn't  a typical leading lady.  </P> <P> "I am one of a kind," she quipped. "Ah, but what kind?"  </P> <P> Burns spent the early '80s as part of the highly respected Tyrone Guthrie  Theater repertory in Minneapolis, appearing in such classics as Ibsen's "Peer  Gynt" and Shakespeare's "As You Like It."  </P> <P> She doesn't rule out a return to stage or screen: "I'm gonna be terrific when  I'm about 65 doing character parts -- like 'Where's the beef?' " Mary Helen  Berg  </P></p>

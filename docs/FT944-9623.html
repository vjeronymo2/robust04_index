			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / People: Finance moves UBS, the securities house, has announced changes in its convertible and warrant business. Mark Larkin, head of convertible trading, has resigned suddenly. The fall in the bond markets is believed to have led to heavy losses in convertible trading, although UBS would not comment on its trading position. Larkin, who resigned last Tuesday, has been replaced by his former deputy, Colin Dimmock. Separately, Michael Hammond has joined UBS in New York as executive in charge of international convertible and warrant sales. He comes from CSFB, where he was in international convertible sales for five years. Grant Williams is to join UBS in London on December 1 as director of Asian equity derivative trading from Robert Fleming where he has been since 1985, most recently as manager of south-east Asian trading.</p>

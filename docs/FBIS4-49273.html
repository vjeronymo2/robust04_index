			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat wrote down his reservations on the maps annex before he  signed it at the ceremony for the signing of the Gaza-Jericho  self-rule agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  here today.    During the ceremony 'Arafat first signed three copies of the  agreement, but refused to sign the annexes of the maps of Gaza  and Jericho that will become autonomous zones.    Then Rabin signed the agreement without signing the annexes  either, which led to a brief recess of the ceremony for last  minute consultations.    They returned to the hall a few minutes later. 'Arafat then  wrote down his reservations in arabic and signed the annexes.    Informed sources told XINHUA the words he wrote in Arabic  were "these maps are not final and they are still under  consideration."    Rabin listened to 'Arafat's reservations through an  interpreter and then signed the annexes without making any  statement.    Israel agreed to give 62 square kilometers to Jericho but  Palestinians demanded more than double.    Chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'ath said after the ceremony  that the size of Jericho will be further negotiated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A deputy of the State Duma, Viktor Kobelev, who  withdrew from the parliamentary faction of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) promised to "destroy" the  party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, both as a personality and a  politician if he continued to use personal insults and libel "as  the main means for the destruction of his enemies."    "I have arguments which allow me to say this," he told a  news  conference in Moscow Wednesday. Kobelev, until recently the  second party leader after Zhirinovskiy, made it clear that the  arguments related to the financing of the LDPR election campaign.    On the eve of the LDPR congress on April 2, Kobelev and two  more deputies of the same faction, Aleksandr Pronin and  Vyacheslav Marychev, received telegrams saying that they had  been expelled from the party and that they could not participate  in the congress.    Another deputy who claimed he withdrew from the party  faction  Wednesday, said his step had been provoked by Zhirinovskiy  himself. Vladimir Borzyuk, the head of the LDPR Orel branch, was  quoted as saying that he could serve, but not be servile. Still  another deputy, head of the LDPR branch in Udmurtia, Vladimir  Novikov, officially announced Wednesday he was withdrawing from  Zhirinovskiy's faction. The deputies said they still supported  the LDPR program and charter and considered themselves members  of the LDPR.    Kobelev said they will be followed by other LDPR deputies  who  may hold an LDPR congress of their own once they constitute a  sufficient number. At the same time, Kobelev said it would be  difficult to work in the parliament outside the faction. He did  not preclude joining some other faction or deputies' group in  the State Duma. Among them, he indicated the nationalist  patriotic Russian Way led by Sergey Baburin and Anatoliy  Lukyanov, liberal reformist Union of December 12 headed by Boris  Fedorov, Sergei Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity and Concord  and the deputies' group New Regional Policy led by Vladimir  Medvedev.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Surge at Gap bucks US trend Gap, the US casual-wear retailer, shrugged off the poor apparel sales affecting other US stores to report a 53 per cent jump in net profits, from Dollars 41.5m to Dollars 63.5m, for the first quarter to April. The San Francisco-based company attributed the improvement mainly to better margins, largely resulting from a switch to more feminine-looking clothes for women in its main Gap stores. The number of stores opened rose from 1,319 to 1,398 at the end of the quarter. Of these, 848 were Gap, 179 Banana Republic, 324 GapKids and 47 Old Navy Clothing Co or Gap Warehouse. Outside North America, it had 44 stores in the UK and three in France. Total sales rose 17 per cent to Dollars 752m, while sales at stores open a year earlier rose 7 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 29 cents to 44 cents. Gap said one factor behind the improvement in margins was the reduction in promotional activity compared with last year's quarter. This meant more goods had been sold at the full price, it said. More significantly, the company had a good response to its shift away from unisex, basic clothing such as T-shirts and jeans to more gender-specific merchandise, particularly for women. The stores now stock more skirts, dresses and embroidered tops. Gap has also launched a retailing format called Old Navy Clothing Co for shoppers who find the group's other stores too expensive. It will gradually replace the Gap Warehouse chain.</p>

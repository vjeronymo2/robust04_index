			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to what is known, the  katyusha was fired by a Palestinian organization called 13 Black  September, but Israel says the shelling could not have been  carried out without an understanding with Hizballah, thereby  pointing an accusing finger at other elements. Operation  Accountability ended in response to a U.S. effort to bring about  a cease-fire. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  intervened personally with Israel and Syria to achieve the  agreement. Israel's interpretation, therefore, is that the  understandings were achieved with Syria, which is responsible  for maintaining them. [passage omitted]</p>

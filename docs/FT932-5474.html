			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Seagram chiefs outline Time Warner strategy SEAGRAM, one of the world's top drinks groups, was putting USDollars 2bn into Time Warner because it 'represents the way the world is going' and would prove a strong long-term investment, Mr Edgar Bronfman, chairman, said. The group had looked in vain for a important beverage investment, Mr Bronfman told the annual meeting. However, after considering several alternatives outside beverages, it had bought 5.8 per cent of Time Warner, the international entertainment and multi-media giant. Seagram will raise this to 15 per cent through market purchases of Time Warner stock for a total investment of around USDollars 2bn. 'It was my son Edgar's choice and eventually my brother Charles and I came around. We are fully supportive of Time Warner's new leadership and we feel management will accept our contribution in future, as did Du Pont a decade ago,' Mr Bronfman said. He said his son Edgar would later join the Time Warner board. 'We think Time Warner has rising and adequate cashflow to handle its debt.' 'Seagram will buy Time Warner stock as the market presents opportunities and I don't see any need to go any further,' he said. Mr Bronfman said Seagram had 'no difficulty' with US West, the US telecommunications company, investing in Time Warner. 'We think (Time Warner) has tremendous growth potential in the entertainment and communications fields, and that our choice is the best we could make for all Seagram shareholders.' Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president, said Seagram was moving aggressively to capture a bigger share of the North American, European and developing markets for spirits and wines. He told the meeting Seagram was concentrating heavily on new brands and extensions of existing brands. 'We are going after emerging markets where currencies are stabilising and import restrictions are being lifted,' he said. It was aiming at 52m Ukranians, 45m Argentines and Chileans and 1bn Chinese as future markets, he said. Seagram was building firm foundations to distribute in all these key future markets. Tropicana held just over 3 per cent of the world market for juice beverages, and it aimed to be the world brand leader, he added. Seagram reported net profit of USDollars 162m, or 43 cents a share, for the first quarter ended April 30, up 6 per cent from Dollars 153m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier (before accounting changes). Tropicana and North American spirits and wine operations did well, but the recession in Europe, Japan and Brazil more than offset this. Operating income overall was Dollars 148m, against Dollars 163m. Profit benefited from lower interest expense and a bigger contribution from its 26 per cent holding in Du Pont, the US chemicals giant. First-quarter beverage sales and other income was Dollars 1.2bn, against Dollars 1.24bn, and dividend income from Du Pont was Dollars 72m, against Dollars 69m.</p>

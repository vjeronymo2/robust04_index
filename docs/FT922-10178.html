			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Shortage of skins hitting profit at Strong &amp; Fisher NOT ENOUGH lambs to the slaughter is a rare reason for a profits warning, but Mr Mike Buswell, chairman of Strong &amp; Fisher, used that when telling shareholders at the annual meeting that first half profits would be 'significantly down'. The news cut the share price from 35p to 31 1/2 p. He stressed, though, that the group was trading profitably. In the first half to June last year it reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.23m. Strong &amp; Fisher is 70.3 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, the international food group, which rescued it in December 1990. Following a restructuring the group was able to announce a dividend. Mr Buswell said the serious shortage of lambs - or rather 'hoggets', which are last season's lambs - being killed in the first quarter of the year meant the group could not buy sufficient skins except at prices too high to make a profit. The group buys one-quarter of all lambskins available in the UK. Supplies halved in January, because of a change in the system of support payments to farmers which encouraged them to send the lambs to slaughter in December. In the first quarter supplies were down by 25 to 30 per cent. Mr Buswell said it was a 'one-off' problem and that this year's lambs were now coming to be killed in 'ever-increasing numbers'.</p>

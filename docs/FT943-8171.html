			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: The Wharf improves 26% to HKDollars 1.77bn at midway The Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the late Sir YK Pao, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in first-half net profits to HKDollars 1.77bn (Dollars 230m) compared with HKDollars 1.38bn a year ago. The company is predicting a stronger second half on the back of a full six months' rental from Times Square, its retail and office complex. About 75 per cent of Wharf's profits are derived from property. Times Square, which opened at the end of last year, yields about HKDollars 900m a year in rentals. The complex, in the prime shopping district of Causeway Bay, boasts 2m sq ft, and is fully leased. Next year will be the first full year of contributions, as tenants began moving in early in 1994. The redevelopment of the Harbour City complex on Kowloon side is set to lift second-half profits - tenants have started moving into Gateway I, the new 1.24m sq ft office and retail complex. Mr Gerry Higginson, executive director, said developments due over coming years, including 2.7m sq ft at Gateway II, a large shopping mall in Kowloon, and the former San Miguel Brewery site, in which Wharf has a one-third interest, would ensure robust recurrent earnings. He said the government's attempt to cool the residential property market had had no impact on the office sector, due to the continued rush of multinationals and other blue-chip companies coming to Hong Kong. The best example is Gateway I, where rentals have doubled since marketing started in January. The interim earnings include an exceptional item of HKDollars 243.3m, from the sale of a Kowloon investment property. Turnover rose 60 per cent to HKDollars 4bn from HKDollars 2.5bn in the first six months of 1993. On a per share basis, earnings rose 23 per cent to 80.3 cents, from 65.2 cents. More modestly, the proposed dividend of 22 cents marks a 16 per cent increase on 1993's interim 19 cents. Earnings from infrastructure, including Modern Terminals Limited in which Wharf has a 44.8 per cent stake, were strong and are expected to grow as the group's second berth at the new Terminal Eight facility is developed. Wharf retains ambitious plans for its cable TV network. It believes it can sign up 250,000 subscribers by the year end, in spite of having only 100,000 now.</p>

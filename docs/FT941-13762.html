			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Anglo-Irish co-operation The Anglo-Irish strategy for bringing peace to Northern Ireland has not yet brought about a ceasefire, but that is no reason to abandon it. Launched shortly before Christmas over the signatures of both Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, its great strength is that it is a joint enterprise. This confers a political advantage that the terrorists cannot match. It puts London and Dublin unequivocally on the same side in promoting the use of the democratic process as the sole legitimate means of solving the problem of two communities living together on one island. In contrast the perpetrators of violence appear to be divided. The Irish Republican Army is evidently unwilling to stop its murderous campaign. Perhaps it is unable to do so, for fear of provoking self-destructive in-fighting. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, speaks of an opportunity for peace, but has not shown himself capable of delivering a ceasefire. Instead he has ducked and weaved, talking of time for consideration, asking for clarification, trying to shift the blame for the violence to the British - in short, playing for time and appealing to a wide range of public opinion. 'Unionist veto' Mr Adams' argument, and in particular his insistent objection to what he calls the 'Unionist veto' over any future pan-Irish settlement, was demolished by Mr Reynolds on Thursday night. In an important speech, the Taoiseach recalled the UN charter, the Helsinki Final Act, the UN declaration on principles of international law (1960) and even South Korea's acknowledgement that reunification with North Korea should not be sought by violent means. All these authorities, plus Irish history, were invoked in support of the contention that 'the people of Northern Ireland have the right to determine by a majority whether they wish to stay with Britain or join a sovereign united or agreed Ireland'. The Irish prime minister noted that his joint declaration with Mr Major also recognised the right of self-determination of the nationalist - that is, Catholic - community in the north. But a united Ireland could not be achieved by either political or military force, only by persuasion. 'Accordingly, there is not merely no moral justification, but also no coherent ideological basis for a continuation of armed struggle,' he said. IRA isolated Given time, the persistent demonstration that the IRA cannot justify its attacks, even to most people in its own natural constituency, will isolate it, both within these troubled islands and internationally. The speech by the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, on Thursday night pursued a similar objective. Rejecting negotiations with Sinn Fein while violence continued, Sir Patrick offered 'clarification' of how the nationalist party could be brought into the political process, once the use of arms was renounced. He thus showed that Britain might be flexible, without abandoning the principle that a ceasefire must precede serious talks. Mr Major's weekend reply to a letter from Mr Adams was in the same vein. This sensible strategy, and the entire Anglo-Irish concordance, would be enhanced by a removal of the ban on the use of Sinn Fein voices on British radio and TV, following the lifting of more draconian restrictions by Dublin. No-one can expect with confidence that this approach will end IRA attacks. The UK government should nevertheless proceed with talks on new constitutional arrangements for Ulster, while taking care to keep Dublin on side at every step. It is well placed to ask for Mr Reynolds' wholehearted support for and co-operation with security responses to whatever level of violence occurs. The Irish government has at last published a bill that would close legal loopholes in extradition procedures. It can no longer plausibly defend the possession of certain explosives and weapons as political offences to which extradition would not apply. Likewise, if further security measures, even draconian ones such as internment, have to be considered, Britain and Ireland should act in unison. Whatever Mr Adams does next, the alliance of purpose between London and Dublin is the most powerful enemy he has faced.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: MEPC's Pounds 222m cash call 97% taken up SHAREHOLDERS of MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, have taken up 97 per cent of the Pounds 221.9m rights issue announced last month. MEPC said that the rate of take-up was the highest achieved by a large property company this year. It demonstrated shareholders continued support for MEPC and its policies, said Mr James Tuckey, managing director. The group plans to use the new funds to accelerate its refurbishment and redevelopment programme and to expand its portfolio by selective property and corporate acquisitions. Over the medium term, it wants a gradual increase in the retail content of its portfolio and a reduction in its exposure to central London offices.</p>

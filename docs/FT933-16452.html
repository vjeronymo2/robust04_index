			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Clayform seeks Pounds 27m in order to repair the balance sheet CLAYFORM Properties, which recently appointed Mr Martin Landau, a property entrepreneur, to its board, yesterday announced a Pounds 27.1m placing and open offer to repair its balance sheet. The company is changing its name to Development Securities to reflect 'a new phase in the development of the group focused on expanding its investment and development property portfolio'. The placing is unusual in that the new shares, which are priced at 35p per share, will be issued at a premium to its net asset value, which stands at 30p per share. The share price rose yesterday from 35p to 40p, reflecting investors' willingness to back Mr Landau who until 1990 was the deputy chairman of Imry, a property company now owned by Barclays. The shares have risen from 11p per share since June 11 when Clayform announced the appointment of Mr Landau. Clayform is issuing 80.3m shares on a 2-for-1 basis. The new shares have been conditionally placed by Flemings, subject to clawback by qualifying holders under the open offer. In addition to taking up his entitlement of 2m shares, Mr Landau has agreed to purchase up to 3.13m additional shares, depending on the take-up under the open offer. He currently holds a 3 per cent stake in the company. About Pounds 6m of the money raised will repay existing banking facilities and Pounds 21.1m will initially be put on deposit. The injection of new capital has allowed directors to renegotiate the group's main banking facilities.</p>

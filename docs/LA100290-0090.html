			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: VIENNA;  </P> <P> SHADOW OVER AN ELECTION  </P> <P> Austria holds parliamentary elections Sunday against a backdrop of heavy  anti-foreigner sentiment.  </P> <P> The two mainstream parties that have ruled Austria since 1955 -- the Socialists  and the Christian Democratic Austrian People's Party -- have been put on the  defensive by the small Freedom Party, which has made gains with its anti-crime,  anti-immigrant platform. Targets are the 150,000 Poles, Romanians and  Czechoslovaks who poured into Austria legally and illegally after the opening  of Eastern Europe's borders during the past year.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Socialists fear a potential coalition between the People's and  Freedom parties, which would mark a sharp turn to the right for Austria.  </P></p>

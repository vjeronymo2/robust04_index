			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Record Pounds 546m of drugs seized CUSTOMS and Excise seized a record Pounds 546m worth of illegal drugs last year including more than two tonnes of cocaine, according to figures released yesterday. There were 2,568 arrests and 47 drug smuggling gangs were broken up during the year, the 1992 annual drug seizures statistics show. Cocaine hauls totalling Pounds 329m - more than twice the amount of the previous year - were confiscated. There were seizures of heroin with a street value of Pounds 48m and cannabis worth Pounds 134m. The seizure values rose from a total of Pounds 271m in 1991, but included declines of a quarter in the value of synthetic drugs confiscated to Pounds 35m, and of nearly two thirds for opium to Pounds 37,000. The figures were released two weeks after Customs announced its latest anti-drug co-operation agreement with the Cruising Association, signed at the London International Boat Show. The guidelines call for yacht users to keep constant vigilance and to report quickly anything suspicious. They should in particular notify officials of suspicious vessels or crews, unusual activity in remote places, small boats approaching larger vessels or suspect packages on beaches, at ports or at sea. In return, Customs pledges to treat any information in strict confidence and to help educate yacht users in how to avoid being exploited by drug traffickers.</p>

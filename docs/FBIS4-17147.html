			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Parlariya and Sergey </F> Ostanin]    [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Army General Pavel Grachev, the  Russian defense minister, considers that the Bosnian conflict  can only be resolved by political means. "We reject the use of  air strikes by UN-operated aircraft, regarding it as extremely  dangerous," the Russian minister stressed today after signing a  Russian-Turkish agreement on cooperation in the  military-technical sphere. He feels that this path will not  yield any positive results whatsoever. On the contrary, Pavel  Grachev pointed out, these "often inaccurate strikes humiliate  the military."    He said that the Russian Defense Ministry does not have a  clear view of the situation around the Bosnian town of Gorazde.  "We do not believe in whitewashing the Bosnian Serbs. Both  warring parties are to blame in this situation," Pavel Grachev  noted. The minister disclosed that on Sunday he had spoken to  General Mladic, the commander of the Serb Army in Bosnia, and  had asked him not to attack Gorazde. As a result, the defense  minister added, the Serbs held their fire for two days, but the  immediate response of the other side was to go on the offensive.    Replying to a question on the possibilities of sending  additional Russian peacekeeping forces to the former Yugoslavia,  Pavel Grachev stressed that 200-300 men would not improve the  situation. In his opinion, in order to solve the Bosnian  problem by military means it would be necessary to enlist  60-70,000 servicemen of the UN peacekeeping forces. "But this  is unrealistic," he noted. "This would mean the beginning of  large-scale combat operations, war."    In Pavel Grachev's opinion, the Russian president's  initiative, which was expressed on 19 April during his telephone  conversation with German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is  worthy of attention.    It essentially means that the presidents of Russia and the  United States, the leaders of the countries of the European  Community, and the political and military leaders of the former  Yugoslavia should meet in any European country to discuss the  prospects for a way out of the crisis.</p>

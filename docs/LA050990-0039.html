			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP LAUNCHES NEW AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> Letting loose a barrage that probably will not cease until Election Day, John  K. Van de Kamp will launch a television advertising campaign today meant to  reintroduce California voters to the man who has been the state's top law  enforcement officer for eight years.  </P> <P> The advertisement hits the airwaves on the heels of the Los Angeles Times Poll,  published Sunday, which showed Dianne Feinstein 13 points ahead of the attorney  general in their tussle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The poll  contained very little good news for Van de Kamp, showing Feinstein broadening  her base of support, appealing more to men and Southern Californians than she  had earlier in the race.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's ad mimics a radio commercial his campaign has been running in Los  Angeles and other major cities. It offers biographical information on Van de  Kamp -- his prosecutorial background and opposition to assault rifles. It bores  in on the three initiatives that Van de Kamp has pushed as his platform and the  opposition the initiatives have summoned.  </P> <P> "He's hated by oil companies, chemical companies, the gun lobby," the 30-second  ad says. "Measure the man by the enemies he's made."  </P> <P> Feinstein's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, criticized the ad as "election year  hyperbole."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's campaign chairwoman, Barbara Johnson, said the ad is the first in  a series that will run through primary day, June 5. But representatives from  the campaigns of Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson said their research  indicates the television buy may be more limited.  </P> <P> Regardless, voters across the state are likely to be deluged with  advertisements in the closing four weeks of the campaign. Campaign sources said  that Feinstein is expected to renew her television campaign next week, unless  the Van de Kamp announcement forces a change in her timetable. Feinstein  campaign officials declined to confirm when their television ads would resume.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp is attempting to sway the vast number of undecided voters -- 39% in  the Times poll. In contrast to an earlier commercial that was critical of  Feinstein's tenure as San Francisco mayor, the latest Van de Kamp offering does  not even mention the opposition.  </P> <P> "He's resorted to the high road in desperation," said Myers.  </P> <P> Kam Kuwata, a Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the  gubernatorial race, said the ad is meant to flesh out Van de Kamp for voters  who are still uncertain what he stands for -- other than opposition to  Feinstein.  </P> <P> "One thing Van de Kamp lacks is a very strong message," Kuwata said.  "Obviously, he's got to broaden his appeal and give people a reason to believe  in John Van de Kamp."  </P> <P> Before the two candidates had exchanged ads critical of the other, Feinstein  had aired a well-received commercial touting her background. With that ad,  political experts said, Feinstein gave voters a look at her that Van de Kamp  had, until now, neglected to deliver.  </P> <P> The advertisement opens with a series of pictures of Van de Kamp: the attorney  general at his desk, in a press conference, running a meeting, conferring with  women.  </P> <P> "He's defended our environment. Sent murderers to Death Row -- 42 times. And  banned assault rifles," the ad says.  </P> <P> Actually, while Van de Kamp has supported environmental initiatives and was  instrumental in the state ban on assault rifles, he personally did not send  murderers to Death Row. That was done by his underlings during Van de Kamp's  tenure as Los Angeles County district attorney.  </P> <P> The ad then highlights the initiatives Van de Kamp has been pushing for the  November ballot. An initiative that would limit terms of officeholders and  impose other ethical strictures is identified as one that would "crack down on  political corruption."  </P> <P> The environmental initiative -- called "Big Green" by its proponents -- is  described as one that would "save the coastline, control pesticides and  reforest California."  </P> <P> The third initiative is an alternative to Proposition 115, a Wilson- and  Feinstein-backed plan to speed up trials and make it easier for prosecutors to  impose the death penalty.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp has opposed Proposition 115 on the grounds that it would strip  Californians of privacy protections now in the state Constitution and thus pose  a threat to abortion rights. Van de Kamp says his version would "preserve a  woman's right to choose." Supporters of Proposition 115 angrily deny that the  threat is real.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp had previously described his anti-crime effort as a drug-fighting  initiative.  </P></p>

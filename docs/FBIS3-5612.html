Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito, one of the ruling seven  parties, wants to visit the United States for talks with top  U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the sources said.    According to Shinseito leaders, the government has yet to  decide on sending Ozawa as special envoy, but Prime Minister  Hosokawa may have unofficially asked Ozawa to go, they said.    Following the collapse of the framework trade talks between  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in February, the  Japanese Government will announce by the end of March a plan to  reduce Japan's huge trade surplus and to open up various  markets, the sources said.</p>

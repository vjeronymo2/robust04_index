			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> FORD AND GM REPORT STEEP DROPS IN INCOME  </P> <P> The nation's top two auto makers, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.,  reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings Thursday.  </P> <P> * GM's quarterly profit fell 38% from the year-ago period to $900.1 million as  costly incentives were put into effect to draw buyers into showrooms. Revenue  edged up to $33.9 billion from $33.5 billion.  </P> <P> Through the first six months of the year, GM said its earnings fell 46.7% to  $1.6 billion on revenue of $64 billion, a 4.2% decline.  </P> <P> * At Ford, the nation's No. 2 car maker, earnings for the same period plummeted  45% to $770.7 million. Revenue was $26.9 billion, an increase of $982 million  from the year-earlier period.  </P> <P> For the first half, Ford's earnings fell 56.7% to $1.2 billion as revenue fell  2.5% to $50.5 billion.  </P> <P> In the United States, the auto makers struggled with a 6.3% drop in sales from  a year ago despite costly incentives. A slump in usually robust overseas  operations further reduced income.  </P> <P> Ford expressed some optimism: "We believe our (market) share will improve with  full availability of our new 1991 products," Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling and  President Philip E. Benton said in a statement. During the first half of the  year, Ford's share of the U.S. car market was 21.3%, down one point from its  share for all of 1989.  </P> <P> But GM managed to pick up market share in the quarter, and was the only U.S.  car maker to do so. It noted that it held 36.5% of the U.S. passenger car  market and 34.4% of trucks. Both were above the prior year's level, GM said,  although it did not give the previous figures.  </P> <P> Both companies said their second-quarter earnings were dented by economic  problems in Brazil, where inflation was running at an annual rate of more than  1,000% until the government put the brakes on the economy earlier this year  with such moves as a currency freeze.  </P> <P> Both sets of earnings were in line with what Wall Street analysts estimated.  </P> <P> Analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York said GM's and  Ford's automotive earnings were actually a shade better than he had expected in  light of Brazil's troubles and increased tax payments.  </P> <P> "The earnings are much better than they look," he said.  </P> <P> Ford and GM each have large operations in Brazil -- GM its own and Ford with  West German auto maker Volkswagen AG in the Autolatina joint project.  </P> <P> "The culprit continues to be incentives," said Wertheim Schroder analyst John  Casesa. He said incentives, which are used to lure customers into dealer  showrooms, are averaging about $1,000 a car.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. is expected to announce second-quarter profits Tuesday. Analysts  expect net income to be about half the $341 million the company earned during  the period last year.  </P> <P> Ford said lingering effects of strikes in Britain and Belgium contributed to  sharply lower European earnings, longtime strengths for the company.  </P> <P> In Europe, Ford had labor problems in the United Kingdom in the first quarter  and in Belgium in the second.  </P></p>

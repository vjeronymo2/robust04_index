			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis confirmed  that the Cyprus Government expects the UN secretary general's  report to be issued tomorrow. He added that the government  believes that it will be an objective report that will record  the facts that attribute blame to the Turkish side. He also  noted that the confidence-building measures [CBM's] issue has  ended. Mr. Kasoulidhis further said that the government does  not see any reason for President Glavkos Kliridhis, who is  visiting New York, to discuss the CBM's with the UN secretary  general.    The spokesman added: The Cyprus Government believes that the  Security Council should find other ways to participate in the  process of promoting a Cyprus solution. He also made it clear  that the government desires to participate in any of those  alternative plans of action, which should be decided by the  Security Council on the basis of Resolution 889.</p>

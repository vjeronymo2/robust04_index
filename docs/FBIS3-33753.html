			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ['Ali Ibrahim article: "The Arab-Israeli Gas Projects"] </F>   [Text] There are no reservations regarding discussion of  projects with Israel but it is important that the Arabs should  link this to progress in the peace nogotiations.    The Qatari foreign minister's confirmation that his country  is discussing with Israel the construction of a gas pipeline has  ended the controversy which had been going on for over a month  with press reports about the project and denials by officials, a  familiar state of affairs considering the development of the  region and the current direct contacts with Israel in the  context of the peace negotiations.    The Qatari gas pipeline project is not the only one. Press  reports have been talking about another Egyptian-Israeli project  although that is a different case because Cairo has full  diplomatic relations with Israel.    It is clear that the Arab official inclination, deduced from  officials' statements and interviews with them, is to hold  exploratory talks on joint projects with Israel provided their  implementation is made conditional on progress in the peace  negotiations and on prior conclusion of political agreements.  That is the correct way because it would be improper to offer  free prizes while the peace negotiations were stumbling.    As a matter of principle, there ought to be no reservations  regarding ideas and issues of that kind, for as long as we  accept the principle of negotiations for a comprehensive peace,  it follows that there will in the future be full relations  including trade, investment, tourism, and so on.    But there are some apprehensions which should be discussed  frankly. Peace and normal relations would not mean harmony of  interests nor would they mean the disappearance of  contradictions. Peace in the general sense means that the  parties to the conflict agree not to resort to arms in the  settlement of their differences. Realistically, nobody even  expects full normal relations overnight because the element of  trust requires time and requires dealing for some time. That is  why international strategists do not expect a flow of relations  between the Arabs and Israel immediately after peace is  achieved. They expect the two sides to take their time in  exploring one another.    In the view of these strategists, joint projects could, if  concluded at regional level, speed up the elimination of  suspicion and distrust and create common interests, although  what is required at the same time is that such process, if  useful, should be within a framework that would give priority to  Arab market interests.    Another concern is that there are some ideas that Israel  will  be the Arab economies' bridge to the international market. If a  new regional economic system is going to emerge with Israel as  part of it, the Arab side should have more say because it is the  bigger part.    The Israeli economy may be bigger and much more advanced  than  the Arab economies but, according to international studies, the  general Arab economy is the one with great opportunities for  growth, expansion, and progress. With the dense Arab  populations, if the per capita income grows, the Arab markets  will surpass what was achieved by the Asian tigers.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Russian returns with few gifts: Kuriles row blocks large-scale aid Mr Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy prime minister, set off back to Moscow from a five-day visit to Japan yesterday bearing gifts. The Japanese government considers it discourteous to let official visitors depart without a hand-out, even if they rarely obtain everything they want. At the same time, Mr Soskovets' ears will be ringing with his host's politely couched refusal to be more generous. Mr Soskovets, the most senior Russian to stage an official visit to Tokyo for just over a year, returns with a mixed bag of useful trade and economic accords, marking slight progress in the two sides' efforts to set their strained relations on a more normal footing. Yet the Japanese government continued to hold back large-scale bilateral aid, pending resolution of the big outstanding dispute between them: ownership of four islands in the Russian-controlled Kurile group just off northern Japan, seized by Russian troops at the end of the second world war. Foreign Minister Yohei Kono turned down out of hand the Russian request for aid for the Kuriles. It would have been politically unwise for him to do otherwise, given the passions the islands arouse both in government and opposition. Russia was equally firm on a Kuriles-related row over the right of Japanese vessels to fish the surrounding waters. Over the past year, 18 Japanese boats have been seized there by Russian patrols, in clashes in which four fishermen have been wounded. Mr Soskovets said he would do his best to avoid a repeat of such events, but warned Japanese fishermen to be careful. At the previous official Russian visit, by president Boris Yeltsin in October last year, Tokyo was prepared to relax, but not lift, aid restrictions in exchange for talks about the islands. Mr Soskovets said he was ready to talk about the Kuriles, as was Mr Yeltsin, but offered nothing new. The Japanese package he obtained in return reflects this - a small advance but nothing spectacular. It includes restructuring Dollars 280m (Pounds 180m) of debt to Japanese trading companies and state-controlled Export Import Bank; a small part of Japan's Dollars 5bn private and state credit to Russia. The delegations agreed to keep talking about another Dollars 1.1bn owed by Russia to Japanese exporters. They will also restart blocked negotiations on a Russian request for official Japanese export credit guarantees for Japanese suppliers of equipment to Lukoil, Russia's largest oil group. Lukoil already has a Japanese aid package to buy equipment for a field in west Siberia, but the Japanese suppliers want to be sure of being paid. On top of this comes a series of political accords, for Japan to support Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation, and for establishment of a joint committee to talk about bilateral problems.</p>

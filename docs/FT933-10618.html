			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: New drink tastes force take-home changes - A look at the background to Bass's sale of Augustus Barnett to Allied-Lyons BASS's impending sale to Allied-Lyons of its Augustus Barnett off-licence chain continues the consolidation of specialist retailers in the face of aggressive competition from the multiple grocers in the take-home drinks market. The deal, worth an estimated Pounds 40m, will enlarge Allied's Victoria Wine business, giving it about 1,500 shops throughout the country and closing the gap on Whitbread, the market leader. Whitbread bought the Peter Dominic chain from Grand Metropolitan for Pounds 49.5m nearly two years ago to boost its Thresher retail operation to about 1,600 outlets. In 1991, Greenalls Group also increased its Cellar 5 off-licences to nearly 500 with the acquisition of Blayneys from Vaux, the north-east England brewer. The moves are a response to growing changes in British drinking habits. An increasing amount of alcohol is being drunk at home, rather than in pubs or restaurants - more wine with meals, more beer by the television set, more whisky nightcaps. In the 1960s only 2 per cent of beer was drunk at home. Ten years ago the proportion had grown to 10 per cent. Today it is more than 20 per cent. The take-home trend has been accelerated by recession with consumers seeking better value by staying at home with a six-pack instead of having a night on the town. But many other forces are driving the development, including the drink-driving laws, an ageing population and more home entertainment facilities. A growing taste for wine, which now accounts for 20 per cent of UK alcohol sales compared with 9 per cent in 1965, has contributed to the trend. So has the swing to imported bottled lagers and the improvements made by brewers to canned ales and stout. 'New experiences in drinking are very much in vogue,' says Verdict, the retail analyst, and the take-home trade has proved adept at encouraging and satisfying the demand for variety. As a result, take-home is one of the fastest growing sectors of the drinks market, worth an estimated Pounds 6.1bn, about 25 per cent of the total spent on drinks last year. With wine sales amounting to Pounds 2.12bn, spirits to Pounds 2.04bn, and beer to Pounds 1.73bn, according to Verdict, drinks form one of the largest areas of consumer spending and the fight for a share is fierce. The grocery trade claims 55 per cent of the overall market with eight supermarket chains - J Sainsbury, Tesco, Argyll, Asda, Gateway, Kwik Save, Waitrose and Morrison - accounting for 43 per cent. The chains have been steadily enlarging their share by tight control of costs and prices, greater allocation of shelf space and an expanding range of products. Sunday opening and extended evening trading have recently added to their competitive edge. Tesco illustrated the focus on price a few weeks ago by importing cheap Stella Artois lager through its French subsidiary rather than buying from Whitbread, which brews it under licence in the UK. But the sheer range, and increasingly skilful choice, of the supermarkets' offerings have been equally important in growing sales. In the past four years, according to Verdict, Tesco has more than doubled the shelf space devoted to drinks in its stores. It has raised the number of different wines from 370 to 650. Its complement of 100 beers is the most comprehensive in the market. Sainsbury offers almost as many beers and last year featured 400 wines, with a greater emphasis on vintage products. These two supermarket groups, each with market shares of more than 9 per cent, have headed the apparently irresistible advance of the grocers. Specialist off-licences, in many cases established by brewers primarily as outlets for their own products, were slow to respond. But they are now mounting a more robust resistance. The Thresher/Peter Dominic merger has given Whitbread national coverage and market leadership with a 10 per cent share, enabling it to match the purchasing power of the multiples. Allied-Lyons should gain similar advantages from combining its Victoria Wine business, where sales grew by 6 per cent last year, with Augustus Barnett. Greenalls' retail strength in north-west England has been complemented in the north-east by the acquisition of Blayneys. Oddbins, owned by Seagram, the Canadian drinks group, has compensated for its lack of scale - it has about 175 stores - by carving out a niche as the country's leading wine merchant. It sells 1,650 different wines with an off-beat, but knowledgeable, approach to marketing which appeals equally to young consumers and serious wine buffs. Unwins, a family-owned chain of 294 shops, which this year celebrates its 150th anniversary, has survived by a gradual move up-market. The specialist retailers are fighting back by stronger merchandising and a greater emphasis on personal service, including items such as customer advice and home delivery. They are using local consumer research to segment their stores, matching their stocks, which in some areas now include convenience foods, more closely to neighbourhood demands. Most of the bigger groups have also invested in computerised information systems, following the multiple grocers in gaining more immediate sales data and tighter stock control. The top half dozen specialists, with 63 per cent of off-licence sales and a 24.3 per cent share of total take-home sales, are now better equipped for the battle against the multiples. For the smaller, independent retailer caught between the two forces, the future looks bleak.</p>

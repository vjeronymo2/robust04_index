			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  Tuesday [26 April] asked China to upgrade its investment  environment for foreign businesses.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) made  the request during its first high-level consultations with  China's State Economic and Trade Commission, which started  Monday.    The Japanese team to the two-day talks, led by Sozaburo  Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, pointed  to ambiguous rules by Beijing on labor conditions and sudden  changes in its administrative rules on foreign business  activity, such as prohibitions on the receipt of money in  foreign currencies, a MITI official told a press conference.    The Japanese delegation also complained about deteriorating  living conditions in China for foreign corporate employees, such  as a sudden hike in rents, for example, to 10,000 dollars per  month from 8,500 dollars, the MITI official said.    The Chinese side, led by Yang Changji, the commission's vice  minister, promised Beijing will do its utmost to improve the  situation which was described by the Japanese team as "eroding  incentive for investment."    The Chinese commission explained that China is pushing ahead  with various reform programs as a way to pave the way for  China's admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), the MITI official said.    Tokyo welcomes the move, hoping for the communist country's  early entry into GATT, the official said.    The State Economic and Trade Commission was created in April  1993 as the Chinese version of Japan's MITI.    The two parties agreed to hold their second round of  high-level talks in the first half of 1995, the MITI official  said.</p>

[Begin recording] [Gabriela Guevara] In order to obtain  information and learn the views of various sectors regarding  Nicaraguan problems and possible solutions, the Association of  Diplomatic Officials at the new ambassadors level are meeting  with some local, prominent figures. Today, these diplomats held  a working breakfast with Commander Bayardo Arce, and they  discussed various topics regarding the Nicaraguan situation.    [Marcos Nunez, member of the Association of Diplomatic  Officials] Personally, and not speaking for my embassy, I want  to tell you the discussion was very good. I sensed a clear and  sincere willingness by Commander Bayardo Arce to implement  changes on substantial and basic aspects of the FSLN for  Nicaragua's benefit.    [Bayardo Arce, member of the FSLN Executive Commission] The  diplomats' questions reflected the concerns that all Nicaraguans  have, like how to achieve economic recovery and how to face  socioeconomic problems. I believe they, as diplomatics, although  they are not heads of mission, expressed a certain concern in  their questions because they see that the government is not  stimulating production. Obviously, we pointed out that that was  our main complaint against the government's economic policy,  namely, that it does not seek to stimulate production. Rather,  the government's economic policy is more interested in scoring  high marks with creditors. I believe that listening to our views  will enable these officials to play a different role in their  bilateral relations.    [Pierre Salazar, official at the Venezuelan Embassy] In my  question to Commander Bayardo, I mentioned that Nicaragua is a  country facing a very serious situation with a balance of  payments deficit, a drop in its foreign exchange, and a lack of  foreign investment. For many reasons [pauses] currently everyone  wants money. For instance, the Soviet Union wants $3 billion,  the Arabs want money, and these circumstances all affect the  situation. We must be realistic and consider all the  circumstances.    [Guevara] Another major point discussed was the FSLN's  internal debates.    [Arce] Regarding debates in the FSLN, I believe their  questions were restrained. But since questions were asked on  this topic, I told them that Sandinists have always had internal  debates, so much so that at one point we split in three groups  before beginning our fight against Somoza. We have always been  characterized by internal debates, but since 1990, and under the  new conditions, we have brought the debate out into public  light. This debate has been passionate at times and not so  passionate at others times, but that should not surprise anyone.    [Guevara] The diplomats said the meeting was worthwhile  because, according to them, firsthand information enables them  to have a clear idea of the situation and therefore they can  better contribute to Nicaragua.

Paragraph (f)(3)(iv) in &sect;31.303 is amended by revising the last sentence thereof to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;31.303  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Valid Court Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) *&blank;*&blank;* A juvenile alleged or found in a violation hearing to have violated a valid court order may be held only in a secure juvenile detention or correctional facility, and not in an adult jail or lockup. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Paragraph (f)(3)(vi) in &sect;31.303 is amended by adding the following to the end of the paragraph: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;31.303  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Valid Court Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) *&blank;*&blank;* This determination must be informed by a written report, to the judge, that: reviews the behavior of the juvenile and the circumstances under which the juvenile was brought before the court and made subject to such order; determines the reasons for the juvenile's behavior; and determines whether all dispositions other than secure confinement have been exhausted or are clearly inappropriate. This report must be prepared and submitted by a public agency or organization other than a court or law enforcement agency. A multidisciplinary review team that operates independently of courts or law enforcement agencies would satisfy this requirement even if some individual members of the team represented court or law enforcement agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19.

States may use these additional statutory allowances only where the precedent requirements set forth in paragraphs (f)(4) (i) through (v) of this section have been complied with. This may necessitate statutory or judicial (court rule or opinion) relief within the State from the 24 hour initial court appearance standard required by paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. States must document and describe in their annual monitoring report to OJJDP, the specific circumstances surrounding each individual use of the distance/ground transportation, and weather allowances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20.

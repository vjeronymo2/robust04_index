			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> BANDITS GREASE HILLY STREET, ROB 15 IN CARS  </P> <P> More than 15 people have been robbed during the past 10 days by so-called  "oilcan bandits," who greased a hilly street in an inner-city neighborhood and  then pounced on stalled motorists, authorities said. Police put a temporary  stop to the street crimes by stationing marked patrol cars at the oiled-down  intersection in the city's Army Street thoroughfare near U.S. 101. In each  case, police said, motorists unable to drive up the oil-slicked street were  attacked by five or more men wielding clubs and occasionally guns.  </P></p>

			<p>NO,   HC for Export  [.sub]x[/]  <F P=102> 94FE0329J Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Nov 93 p  13 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0329J </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] In 1995, Toyota Motor Corp. (Toyota) (president: Mr.  Tatsuro Toyoda) will install a new, double-structured exhaust  pipe on each and every export vehicle and nonexport vehicle made  at Toyota's overseas plants in Europe and the United States in  order to cope with the trend of stiffer exhaust gas regulations.  The new exhaust pipe is said to be capable of removing  hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]) from the  exhaust more efficiently than before. Accordingly, Futaba  Industries Co., Ltd. (Futaba; president: Mr. Masahiko Umemura),  a muffler maker in the family of Toyota companies, and Sango  Co., Ltd. (Sango) (Miyoshi-cho, Nishikamo-gun, Aichi Prefecture;  president: Mr. Kozo Tsunekawa) are getting ready to produce the  exhaust pipe.    An exhaust pipe, previously of single-wall construction, is  a  pipe that connects the exhaust manifold and the catalytic  converter. Toyota developed the double-wall exhaust pipe to  improve thermal efficiency by minimizing heat radiation with an  air layer between the inner and outer pipes and by reducing heat  loss with the thinner inner pipe wall. Thus, the temperature of  the catalyst can be raised faster immediately after the start of  an engine, when more harmful substances are emitted, and the  high temperature is maintained to increase the efficiency of  removing HC and NO[.sub]x[/].    Environmental regulations concerning automobile exhaust are  constantly becoming tighter in Europe and the United States; in  particular, the exhaust gas regulations in the state of  California, which are considered the most stringent in the  world, will mandate the sale of low-emission vehicles around  1997. Thus, Toyota plans to start installing the new exhaust  pipes to be manufactured by Futaba on the 1995 export car, ES300  (Japanese name: Windham).    At the same time, Sango will license its production  technology to (Arvin)-Sango Corp., the joint venture company in  the United States, where the new exhaust pipes will be  manufactured for installation on the new model, Avalon, to be  produced at TMM, Toyota's U.S. plant in Kentucky. It is also  planned that Futaba will license its technology to Walker Corp.  (U.S.) for the production of the new exhaust pipes in the United  States.    In the fall of 1995, exhaust gas regulations for passenger  cars will be tightened in Europe. Thus, the new exhaust pipe  will be installed on the Carina (Japanese name: Corona),  manufactured in the U.K., and on Japanese-made cars to be  exported to Europe. Toyota is likely to expand the adoption of  the new exhaust pipe to domestic cars to cope with a similar  trend in Japan, after assessing the development in Europe and  the United States.</p>

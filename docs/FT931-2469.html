			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Observer: Down and out, or not Eyes widened at a Reuter flash, timed 11.58am, that the Swiss National Bank said it was lowering its discount rate from 5.5 per cent. But as the new rate was quoted only as 'XXX PCT', heads were scratched also. Until 12.02pm, that is, when another flash stated: 'Subscribers are asked to please ignore earlier alert on Swiss National Bank discount rate, which was transmitted in error.' More head scratching though at 1.38pm when the bank finally announced a 1/2 point cut.</p>

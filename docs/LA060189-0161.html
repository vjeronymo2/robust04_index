			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFTS;  </P> <P> MUTUAL QUITS S&amp;L TRADE GROUP TO PROTEST STAND  </P> <P> Pasadena-based Mutual Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has withdrawn from an industry  trade group to protest the organization's lobbying stand on S&amp;L bailout  legislation.  </P> <P> The trade group -- the U.S. League of Savings Institutions -- has been trying  to persuade Congress to ease some of the tougher new capital standards  contained in a bill designed to save crippled S&amp;Ls. In a letter to the  league Tuesday, Mutual Savings Chairman Charles T. Munger said his institution  was leaving because it objects to those efforts.  </P> <P> "It is not unfair," the letter said, "to liken the situation now facing  Congress to cancer and to liken the league to a significant carcinogenic agent.  . . . In the face of a national disaster which league lobbying plainly helped  cause, the league obdurately persists in prescribing continuation of loose  accounting principles, inadequate capital and, in effect, inadequate management  at many insured institutions."  </P> <P> Current regulations require S&amp;Ls to maintain capital reserves equal to  slightly more than 3% of outstanding loans, but they allow savings institutions  to count intangible assets -- known as "goodwill" -- as part of the reserves.  The Washington-based league objects to a legislative provision requiring  institutions to replace all goodwill assets with cash over a five-year period.  </P> <P> Mutual Savings timed its announcement to register its concern over a recent  17-17 tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee on an amendment to weaken the  proposed goodwill provision, said Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Omaha-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a holding company that owns Mutual Savings' parent  company. Mutual Savings ranks 70th in assets among California S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> "The lobbying effort nearly created a vote . . . that would have taken all the  teeth out of the legislation," Buffett said.  </P> <P> James Grohl, a senior vice president of the league, said his association  supports alternative methods of meeting higher capital requirements. He said  most of the trade group's 2,800 members support the association's efforts.  </P> <P> "They (members) all have points of view, and it's impossible for us to meet the  expectations of every single element," he said. "We can't please everyone."  </P></p>

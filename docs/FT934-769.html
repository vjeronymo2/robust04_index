			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Provincial riots point to Argentina's economic weaknesses: John Barham reports on the first serious challenge to Menem's reform programme Calm has returned to Argentina's remote province of Santiago del Estero, but the problems that touched off the worst violence seen since hyperinflation gripped the country in 1989 still remain. A week ago about 5,000 people rampaged through the provincial capital. Unchallenged by police, they burned the governor's palace, the legislature and courthouse. They ransacked and set fire to the homes of politicians and looted stores. Rioting started when the government said it would not pay wages due since September and October and threatened to cut jobs. The disturbances were the first serious challenge to Mr Menem's four-year economic reform programme. Immediately, the call went out for a softening of Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's strict market-oriented policies. But Mr Menem firmly backed Mr Cavallo. He said economic policy 'is not negotiable. These adjustment plans are absolutely necessary'. He appointed a close Cavallo ally, Mr Juan Schiaretti, a federal deputy, as administrator of Santiago del Estero for five months. On Monday, Mr Schiaretti defused the unrest by paying Dollars 500 in emergency wages to each of the province's public employees and Dollars 350 to pensioners. The rioting rammed home the critical state of many of Argentina's 23 provinces. Most suffer heavy unemployment and poverty, which governments try to offset by increasing public employment. In Santiago del Estero, one third of people of working age works for the government and 15 per cent are unemployed or under-employed. Invariably, this has led to unmanageable budget deficits, worsened by widespread corruption and maladministration. Although Santiago del Estero is one of the poorest regions of Argentina, senior government officials paid themselves wages of Dollars 10,000-18,000 while public employees get Dollars 180-Dollars 500. Santiago del Estero is not the only province in deep trouble. In nearby La Rioja, which Mr Menem governed intermittently from 1973-89, unrest made the local government drop a plan to cut 10,000 jobs. La Rioja's government spent Dollars 398m last year. Roughly one-third of the money came from federal grants and loans and over half in tax-sharing transfers. It raised only Dollars 28m in taxes and still ran a 1.3 per cent budget deficit. This week has seen two more provincial governments back down from job-cutting programmes in the face of public hostility. Public employment and spending has grown strongly in the provinces in the 10 years since civilian rule was restored. With only a few exceptions, provincial governors' authority rests on distribution of patronage, government jobs and in some cases by buying votes and rigging elections. Santiago del Estero's rioters were driven not only by fury at losing jobs, but disgust at government corruption and a contempt for politicians. Mr Cavallo's demands for a minimum of financial rationality threatens the power of governors, most of whom belong to Mr Menem's Peronist party. Over the last three years, six local governments have fallen, usually leading to rule by a federal administrator. The gap between rich and poor is growing, as is an already sharp division between wealthy and backward regions. Argentina's strong growth since 1991 is restricted almost entirely to Buenos Aires and the industrial provinces of Cordoba and Santa Fe. But even Santa Fe reports rising unemployment as obsolete factories close in increasing numbers. Tension elsewhere could grow as a shakeout in industry gathers pace. Unemployment the Buenos Aires industrial belt has risen 40 per cent in a year to 9.4 per cent. The absence of a government social safety net to care for victims of economic dislocation and inefficient social policies are exacerbating the trauma of reform. Mr Cavallo has been struggling with the provinces since he took office in January 1991. Their budget deficits, uncontrolled spending, poor tax systems and worsening economic problems all threaten economic stability. Buenos Aires cannot let the provinces sink or swim, because Mr Menem needs their representatives' support in Congress, both to approve routine legislation and to garner the necessary two-thirds support needed to reform the constitution. Mr Menem wants to stand for re-election for a second term when his mandate ends in 1995, which requires a change to the constitution. Mr Cavallo promises to redouble efforts in 1994 to make the provinces reform. Last year he devolved responsibility for education and health to the provinces. He has provided money to provinces that streamline their tax systems and offered subsidies for private companies to take on surplus government employees. But usually the governors simply use the increased revenues to raise public employment. Private companies in most provinces are either in declining industries or too weak to absorb surplus public employees.</p>

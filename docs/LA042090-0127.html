			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> MAN SHOT BY OFFICER IS REPORTED STABLE  </P> <P> A 19-year-old man who was shot by a police officer after allegedly pointing a  gun at him was in stable condition Thursday at Western Medical Center-Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> Jesus Orejel of Santa Ana was shot in the chest and leg and suffered scratches  from a police dog during the incident, which occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday at  Madison Park in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Orejel was taken into custody on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with  a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Residents called police just before 8 p.m. to complain about a man who was  firing a gun in the nearby park, Sgt. Dick Faust said. Two officers responded  and when they confronted Orejel, he pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic  handgun at one of the officers, police said. As the second officer approached,  the suspect turned and pointed the weapon in his direction. The second officer  then fired several shots at Orejel, police said.  </P> <P> The suspect then tried to run away but was captured a few blocks away with the  help of a police dog, according to authorities.  </P> <P> The names of the officers involved in the incident were not released. Faust  said that the officer who fired the shots will probably be placed on a  three-day administrative assignment, which is customary in shooting cases.  SHELBY GRAD  </P></p>

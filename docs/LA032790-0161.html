			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> KINISON DRY BUT STILL RAUNCHY  </P> <P> Raunchy rock 'n' roll comedian Sam Kinison says he quit drinking because he is  getting too old to keep ignoring his health.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I've cleaned up my act a little bit," Kinison told The Cincinnati  Enquirer in an interview published today. "Turning 36, partying too much and  grabbing my heart made me think, it's time to be good.  </P> <P> "I wanted to hold out at least until the turn of the century."  </P> <P> But tempering his alcohol intake isn't part of a mellowing trend for the  heavyset comic known for his manic, screeching style and often explicit  commentary.  </P> <P> He plans to belt out his remake version of "Wild Thing" with the band L.A. Guns  here Thursday night.  </P></p>

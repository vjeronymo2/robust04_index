			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Small hurricane on the line - Financing the Family / Home insurance / Phone-based insurers offer lower premiums - provided you are 'average' Home insurance is not usually a subject to arouse much emotion. If you own a house, you insure it, and if you have possessions you would rather not lose, you insure them too. Then you forget about it, until you make a claim, or the renewal notice quotes a premium almost twice as high as you remember paying last year. Astronomical premium hikes, due to rising burglary and subsidence claims, have recently alerted consumers to the subject. The newcomer, Direct Line, a telephone-based insurer, has blown a hurricane through the formerly cosy world of home insurance, dominated by the big general insurers in partnership with the banks and building societies. Suddenly competition has broken out, and the consumer stands to benefit, though the huge back bills for burglary and subsidence have to be paid for somehow. Many homeowners have traditionally bought buildings and contents insurance from their mortgage lender. Sometimes it is a compulsory part of a special mortgage offer, but usually there is no obligation to buy the building society's own policy. But since many people are too lazy to shop around, or are under the mistaken impression that they are tied to their lender, premiums tend not to be competitive. An added disincentive is that many lenders charge an 'administration fee' of Pounds 25 or so if you buy buildings cover elsewhere. If you check the alternatives, you will find insurers so keen to grab your business that some will pay the administration fee for you. Even without that bribe, it should be easy to find a policy cheap enough to cover the cost of switching. The new telephone-based insurers can offer lower premiums, but generally only to 'average' householders: aged over 25, living in standard houses, not in inner cities, with few particularly valuable possessions. These desirable customers are being wooed by Direct Line, GA 1-2-1 and a host of others, with savings of up to 50 per cent on conventional insurers' prices. Direct Line and its clones have also inspired an outbreak of telephone-based broking services, which give access to a dozen or more insurance companies' quotes via one phone call. The one thing they cannot do, however, is shop around the direct insurers for you, so although they can find a cheaper quote from conventional insurers, it may not be quite the cheapest on the market. But what if you are not a middle-aged couple living in a three-bedroom suburban semi with a television set, video recorder and a few pieces of jewellery? Direct insurers lose interest as soon as you reveal that your home is an inner-city warehouse conversion, containing one enormously valuable abstract painting and little else. Antique collectors in manor houses are equally also unwelcome. However, 'high net worth' individuals (insurance companies seem to feel that the label 'wealthy' is offensive) and collectors of art and antiques are being targeted by a number of insurers who require lower premiums for art works than most companies charge for general household contents. For, paradoxically, owners of large quantities of precious items are seen as a lower risk than the average person, whose living-room is adorned only with consumer electronics, because such people tend to protect their collections with good security systems. Unique antiques are also less attractive to casual burglars, as they are more trouble to dispose of than anonymous electrical equipment. Companies that offer specialised policies for high-value home contents or amateur collectors include: Cox Underwriting Services, Artscope, Hiscox, Masterpiece, Art Insurance Services, LIS and Wellington. Owners of unusual buildings can also find specialist policies. Several companies, such as CGA and Holdfast, offer cover for thatched houses, which are often rejected by mainstream insurers because of the added fire risk. Other insurers have policies tailored to the needs of listed buildings and historic properties, which can cost more than ordinary houses to repair or rebuild. At the other end of the market, a few insurers have realised that the prices of many ordinary policies are out of the reach of many inner-city residents, particularly young people in rented flats or pensioners who do not need large amounts of insurance. The result is basic policies, with all the extras stripped out - no accidental damage cover, low minimum sums insured, and often replacement rather than new-for-old cover. Norwich Union recently introduced an 'Essentials' plan along these lines, while LIS at Lloyds has an inner-city policy, with the annual premium for Pounds 10,000 of cover ranging from Pounds 84 to Pounds 160. As competition for the best customers heats up, more insurers are offering discounts - for over-50s, members of neighbourhood watch schemes, people who install alarms and other security devices, and even for members of certain clubs and professions. When you request a quote, it is always worth asking what discounts, if any, are available. The other way of bringing down your premiums is by agreeing to a voluntary excess. This means that you pay the first Pounds 50 or Pounds 100 of any claim, saving insurers the administrative expense of handling lots of small claims, as well as saving them a little money on larger ones. The higher the excess, the lower your premium will fall - but you must be sure that you could afford to shoulder your part of the cost if the crunch came. Not all insurers have a system of voluntary excesses, but a few make a big point of it, particularly at the upper end of the market, where excesses can go as high as Pounds 1,000, to cut premiums by up to a third.</p>

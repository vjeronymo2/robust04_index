			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Inchcape invests in Coca-Cola's push into Russia Inchcape, the international motors, marketing and services group, is to invest more than Pounds 25m in Coca-Cola bottling franchises in the Russian Federation. Although Coca-Cola claims to be the dominant western producer of soft drinks in the former Soviet Union and in eastern Europe as a whole, it lags rival PepsiCo in Russia. However, Coca-Cola has invested Dollars 35m in a bottling plant in Moscow, already in operation, and will soon see production start from its plant in St Petersburg, on which a further Dollars 35m has been spent. Together with the investment planned by Inchcape, Coca-Cola said it was confident it would soon achieve a dominant market position. Both Coca-Cola and Inchcape said Russia represented a substantial growth opportunity. Although Coca-Cola has doubled its sales in the past two years, western brands account for only about 25 per cent of the soft drinks sold. The Inchcape franchises are in six of the 12 largest cities in the Russian Federation, covering an area south and east of Moscow with a population approaching 50m. They include Russia's third largest city of Nizhniy Novgorod (formerly Gorky) and Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad). As a first step, Inchcape has purchased an initial 11 per cent shareholding in the formerly state-owned Volzhskiy brewery and soft drinks business in Volgograd. The soft drinks operations will be separated from the brewery, with Inchcape as the majority shareholder and having management control. Inchcape and Coca-Cola are also in discussions regarding bottling opportunities in other countries - particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Inchcape has been a Coca-Cola bottler in Chile since 1983, operating five plants and investing more than Pounds 30m in the business, which has become its largest activity in Latin America with a turnover of Pounds 60m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments Received by the Forest Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FS received 84 letters providing suggestions and comments regarding the proposed schedule. In general, the comments reflected confusion over the definition of uses covered, how geographic areas would be determined, and rents calculated. Comments also suggested that the proposed rents were excessive, that the information relied upon was not representative, and that provisions regarding indexing and revenue sharing (25 percent of the gross sublease income) were not commonplace in the private rental market. Many comments expressed concern that adoption of the schedule would have an adverse impact on small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments provided several suggestions. Several suggested that additional price levels be added to improve fairness and reduce impact on permit holders in rural areas. Several comments suggested that commercial mobile radio users should not be subject to paying 25 percent of the gross sublease income when their primary business, or only use of the facility, is to rent space to other customers. With respect to television and FM radio, most of the comments suggested that the advisory committee report be the basis for setting rental payments. Several comments provided information on rents currently being paid and suggested what are considered to be reasonable rental payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BLM proposed schedule has been developed considering comments received by the FS, and the comments have been adopted or incorporated as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(9) states that it is the policy of the United States to receive the fair market value of the use of the public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 43 U.S.C. 1761(a) gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way for communication uses, including systems for transmission or reception of radio, television, telephone, telegraph, and other electronic signals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 43 U.S.C. 1764(g) requires the payment of a rental. The holder is required to pay in advance the fair market value as determined by the Secretary granting, issuing, or renewing such right-of-way. The Secretary may waive part or all of the payment when it is found to be equitable and in the public interest. Rights-of-way issued at less than fair market value are not assignable except with the approval of the Secretary issuing the right-of-way. The regulations implementing right-of-way provisions of FLPMA are found in 43 CFR part 2800. Provisions regarding rental payments are found in 43 CFR subpart 2803, and state in part that the holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit is required to pay annually, in advance, with certain exceptions, the fair market value rental. This is determined by the authorized officer, applying sound business management principles and, so far as practicable and feasible, using comparable commercial practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

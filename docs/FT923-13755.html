			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions The weak stock market has had two effects on director dealing activity. First, with few exceptions, the cash value of directors' sales is smaller than usual, even if the actual number of sales is little changed. Second, the volume of directors buying their own stock has risen - a swing which is consistent with the historic pattern of such movements. It is worth noting that only one of the sales in this week's column resulted from the exercise of an option. Scarcely surprisingly, directors choose to defer the exercise and sale of options when the market is unfavourable. Microvitec stands out as an exception on the lower cash value of sales. John Martinez-Perez, non-executive director, has disposed of almost 310,000 shares at between 31p-32p. His residual holding is 2.74m shares, still the largest shareholder on the board. During the last 12 months certain sectors of the economy have had to face an unpalatable truth - they are not immune to recession. The waste management industry is such an area and Shanks McEwan is the sector's largest company. Final results published last month revealed a drop in earnings, the first setback since Shanks came to the market. Hugh Runciman, chairman, sold 150,000 shares at 190p, near its low for the year. BM Group, the acquisitive engineering company, has been in the headlines since the resignation of Roger Shute, chairman, because of ill-health. The share price has fallen sharply from more than 400p only weeks ago. Shute bought 100,000 shares at 100p just before he resigned.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company                  Sector     Shares    Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES BMSS                     BlgM       10,000      12          1 Calderburn               Misc       50,000      84          1 Comac                    BusS      155,000      51          1 Dewhirst                 Txtl      100,000      39          1 Diploma                  Elns       14,000      44          1 Ferry Pickering          PP&amp;P       75,000      76          1 Greenalls Group          Brew       15,000      63          1 Hall Engineering         EngG       25,000      38          2 Huntleigh Techlgy        Elns       20,000     122          1 MacFarlane Group         PP&amp;P       16,555      32          1 Mercury Ass Mangmt       OFin       10,000      33          1 Microvitec               Elns      368,905     115          1 Neotronics               OthI       10,000      14          1 Scottish TV              Mdia       37,288     148          1 Shanks McEwan            Misc      150,000     285          1 Sherwood Group           Txtl       10,000      16          1 Smith New Court          OFin       22,500      24          3 Updown Inv Co            InvT      100,000     417          1 Vosper                   EngG        3,000      11          1 Waddington               PP&amp;P       15,000      30          1 Warburg                  MBnk       25,000     128          1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES BM Group                 EngG      100,000     110          1 British Steel            Metl       20,000      11          1 Bryant Group             Cont       10,000      10          1 Cable &amp; Wireless         TelN        2,306      12          1 Carclo Engineering       EngG       30,000      43          1 Dewhirst                 Txtl      100,000      39          1 Helical Bar              Prop       25,000      26          1 Kunick                   HtlL    1,000,000      30          5 Ladbroke                 HtlL      250,000     500          1 Oriflame                 Stor      450,000     792          1 Shires                   InvT        4,408      10          1 Unigroup                 Txtl      380,841      55          2 Value &amp; Income           InvT      100,000      66          1 Walker Greenbank         Misc       20,000      14          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (8): Trials and tribulations of the Old Lady - Richard Lambert traces the varied fortunes of an institution founded in 1694 to fund a war 1694. Bank established by opportunistic merchants to fund the war against France. The books are opened on June 21 at the Mercers' Hall, Cheapside, for receiving subscriptions and within 11 days Pounds 1.2m is subscribed by 1,268 people. On July 27, the Bank is incorporated by Royal Charter as 'The Governor and Company of the Bank of England'. 1696. Critical year for the Bank. Government, having failed in its attempts to start a rival Land Bank, puts heavy demands on the Bank, which in turn has to make calls on its stockholders. 1706. Closer relations with the government established as the Bank agrees to act as its direct agent in circulating Exchequer Bills. 1707. Threatened invasion of the Pretender causes a run on the Bank, met by further calls on the proprietors and - this time - a little friendly help from government. 1708. An act of parliament gives it a monopoly over the most profitable part of its business: issuing notes. 1717. Management of government securities transferred from the Exchequer to the Bank. 1720. Bank escapes disaster when its offer to take over the whole of the government debt is rejected in favour of the South Sea Company. When the South Sea bubble is popped, the Bank also hits trouble, and at one stage in the panic resorts to paying demands for cash in shillings and sixpences. 1745. Panic ensues as the army of the Young Pretender marches south. The Bank again plays for time by paying notes in small change. Disaster is averted as a powerful group of merchants meets at Garraway's and asserts its confidence in the safety of the Bank. 1763. Bank for the first time acts as lender of last resort. 1780. Mob attacks Bank during the Gordon riots. Government provides a guard of 534 soldiers, including 50 from the Brigade of Guards stationed inside the Bank. This guard attends the Bank every night until 1973, although by the end its forces have been depleted to one officer, three NCOs and eight guardsmen. The officer, unlike his men, receives no payment for this service, but may have one guest to dinner. 1781. Lord North refers to the Bank as 'from long habit and usage of many years . . . a part of the constitution'. 1793-97. Further runs on the Bank, caused by political uncertainty from the French revolution, and the failure of many country banks in England. With its cash almost gone, the Bank announces that 'the general concerns of the Bank were in the most affluent and prosperous situation'. Next day, merchants and bankers assert their confidence in the institution. 1825. A financial bubble, caused in part by the Bank's erratic management of credit. When it bursts, the Bank is seriously threatened: Rothschild intervenes at a crucial moment by transferring large sums of gold coin into the Bank from the continent. 1826. In response to this crisis, the Country Bankers Act is passed, allowing the establishment of joint stock banks with power to issue their own notes, not less than 65 miles from London. The idea is to make the banking system more orderly. 1844. Bank Charter Act passed. This separates the Bank's note issue from its banking operations, controls its issue of notes, and places severe limits on its ability to develop commercial business. The Bank, showing what is to become a well established lack of political sophistication, fails to realise until the last moment that it is being imposed upon. Prime minister Sir Robert Peel fails to respond to the bankers' moving appeals for more leeway. 1845. Bank employees allowed for the first time to take regular leave other than on holy days. 1847. Awkward moment: following the collapse of grain prices, the Governor goes bust. 1848. Chartist procession: Bank takes in extra garrison, and surrounds itself with sand bags. 1857. Widespread financial crisis crosses the Atlantic from the US. Bank rate at 10 per cent. Bank issues notes in excess of its statutory limit. 1866. Spectacular crash as the Bank allows Overend Gurney, one of the most important City houses, to fail. In the subsequent trial, prosecuting counsel observes: 'Whether stimulated by zeal or enthusiasm, or whether actuated by that insane cupidity which was too largely a characteristic of the present day, instead of adhering to the plain, honest and rational system which had been adopted by the old members of the firm, they plunged into the most extravagant speculation.' 1888. Bank plays crucial role in the conversion of Pounds 500m of British government 3 per cent stock into 2 1/2 per cent. 1890. The Barings crisis. FT observes helpfully: 'Day by day, thick clouds gather over the Stock Markets, and where they come from, and who is responsible for them, no one has a definite opinion.' Governor faces down the prime minister, and secures government help in bearing the losses. 1906. Quiet times. According to the official history: 'While the Court or the Governor operated without explanation or self-justification - it was so long since a Governor had said anything of public interest in General Court that financial journals were ceasing to insert reports of its meetings - leading bankers made occasional pronouncements on policy.' 1914. Government guarantees Bank against any loss on discounting bills of exchange accepted prior to the declaration of war. 1940. Bank survives a direct hit by a high explosive bomb. 1946. Bank survives nationalisation by Labour government. 1971. Bank pushes Competition and Credit Control policy, which scraps lending ceilings and gives market forces freer reign. The boom times are coming. 1973. Rescue of Cedar Holdings marks the start of the secondary banking crisis: Bank launches combined support operation known as the lifeboat. 1979. Bank loses one important function with the abolition of exchange controls. Gains another through the Banking Act which gives it statutory licensing and supervisory powers over UK deposit-taking institutions. 1984. Collapse of Johnson Matthey Bankers brings the Bank much embarrassment  -and further statutory powers. 1991. Another ticklish moment, as BCCI goes down.

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Reuters Those French politicians who complain about the Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to destroy European monetary union may wish to hedge their position by buying Reuters' shares. The company's rapidly advancing share price performance highlights the market's belief that Reuters will gain from currency turmoil. The connection is not immediate since the bulk of Reuters' forex trading screens generate their income from subscription fees rather than transaction charges. But the hope is that banks, which have been running down their European forex operations, may build them up again if the likelihood of monetary union recedes. Reuters would then install more screens. After several years of static installations, Reuters would return to the growth path. The theory, though, is somewhat spurious. Despite the recent beating, the concept of a single currency may be far from dead. Moreover, any likely rise in demand for screens would be marginal set against the 200,000 screens Reuters already has installed. Nevertheless, the market's instinct may prove right over the longer run. The infant Dealing 2000 forex trading system, which appears to be gaining critical mass, produces Dollars 25 of income for every deal transacted. Here, volume will clearly be critical for profitability. The product, though, will not contribute significantly to profits for a few years yet. By then, Reuters hopes that even if European foreign exchange trading quietens down, there will be increased trade between the world's more exotic currencies.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG USE SEEN HIGHER AMONG LATCHKEY YOUTH  </P> <P> Latchkey children, whether from rich or poor families, are twice as likely to  use cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana as those youngsters who are cared for by  adults after school, according to a new USC study financed by the National  Institute on Drug Abuse.  </P> <P> The study published today in the journal Pediatrics, is the largest to focus on  adolescents who care for themselves after school, according to the researchers.  </P> <P> Based on a survey of 5,000 eighth-graders in Los Angeles and San Diego, the  study found that those children who do not have adults to look after them for  at least one hour per school day -- America's so-called latchkey children --  are at greater risk for substance abuse regardless of their sex, race, family  income, academic performance, involvement in sports or other extracurricular  activities.  </P> <P> "We assumed we would see some differences . . . for example, that the children  of single-parent homes would be more likely than those in stable, two-parent  families to be at risk for substance abuse. . . . But that does not seem to be  the case," said Jean L. Richardson, the study's principal investigator and an  assistant professor of preventive medicine at the USC School of Medicine.  </P> <P> Youngsters in all economic and social strata were at greater risk for drug,  alcohol and cigarette use if they spent time on their own. And the longer they  spent alone, the greater their risk, the study found.  </P> <P> Those children who spent 5 to 10 hours a week in "self care" were 1.7 times as  likely as cared-for youngsters to use alcohol, 1.6 times as likely to smoke  cigarettes and 1.5 times as likely to use marijuana. Those who spent 11 or more  hours a week alone were twice as likely to use alcohol, 2.1 times as likely to  smoke cigarettes and 1.7 times as likely to use marijuana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Anglos Than Latinos  </P> <P> The children who were left alone regularly were more likely to be Anglo, rather  than Latino, probably because there tend to be more extended-family  relationships among Latino groups. Surprisingly, the study found that children  who were not being cared for by an adult were more likely to live in  high-income areas than in low-income ones.  </P> <P> There are "clearly important public policy issues" raised by this study,  Richardson said in an interview Tuesday. But, she added, the findings should in  no way be construed to make mothers or fathers feel guilty that they are  working, or that they should now stay home with their children.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's . . . realistic," she said. "Women are working. Men are  working. Both groups are going to continue to do so. I hope there is not a  backlash as a result of this study. The appropriate question is how do you deal  with the problem."  </P> <P> One of the difficulties in knowing how to solve the potential problems of  latchkey children is that the research does not make it clear precisely why  adolescents who are not supervised are more susceptible to drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influenced by Friends  </P> <P> Some of the youngsters who participated in the study said they had friends who  smoked or drank and who presumably influenced them. But others said their  exposure to alcohol and cigarettes was the result of solitary experimentation.  </P> <P> The study was based on anonymous questionnaires filled out by eighth-grade  students in public schools in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San  Diego. Parents were also surveyed to validate children's responses to questions  about what arrangements, if any, had been made for the youngsters' care.  </P> <P> There is no data to determine precisely the number of children who regularly  care for themselves. But certainly the number of working mothers has grown  dramatically -- from less than 40% in 1970 to more than 60% in 1985. The  divorce rate also has risen among certain groups.  </P> <P> With two out of three recent first marriages now ending in divorce, the  likelihood that children will be left alone frequently continues to rise,  experts say. Among all latchkey children, however, children of single parents  are not necessarily more likely to use drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home to Empty Houses  </P> <P> By some estimates, more than 40% of children under the age of 13, somewhere  between 2 million and 6 million youngsters, go home to an empty house after  school.  </P> <P> "These estimates may be low because parents may be reluctant to admit that  their children have no adult supervision," Richardson wrote in the article.  </P> <P> Americans have long recoiled from the idea of leaving children -- even those  who were on the verge of adulthood -- unattended. During the Depression, the  term "latchkey" children was widely used to describe the many unfortunate young  souls who went home alone, wearing house keys around the necks. In the 1950s,  Dr. Benjamin Spock counseled mothers to consult a social worker before taking a  job, because of the possible dire consequences for their children.  </P> <P> Whether such worries were justified is still not clear. The few studies of  children who care for themselves have reached different conclusions concerning  the risks and benefits involved. While one study found that children who care  for themselves after school are more fearful and depressed, other studies have  found no difference in measures of self-esteem or in academic performance of  those who go home to mother or to an empty house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effective Parenting  </P> <P> Parenting styles, rather than the presence or absence of an adult, may have as  much influence on the behavior of children as has anything else, according to  another study. That study, done by researchers at the University of Wisconsin,  found that parents are more effective when they require children to perform  specific chores after school, require the child to check in by telephone upon  arriving home and set specific limits on where the child can and cannot go  after school.  </P></p>

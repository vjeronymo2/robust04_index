Kim told Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a second  round of summit talks Saturday that South Korea does not want  North Korea to become internationally isolated and hopes the  international community will not move toward imposing sanctions  against Pyongyang, the officials said. But "the ball is in  North Korea's court," they quoted Kim as saying.    Kim, who is to leave Tokyo later in the afternoon for  Shanghai, told Hosokawa at the Akasaka Palace that he believes  China is opposed to North Korea's nuclear armament but that he  wants to listen to China's position on the matter and hold  "thorough" discussions with the Chinese leadership, the  officials said.    The president predicted the United Nations Security Council  will first move toward recommending North Korea to accept full  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  to promote dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang rather than  immediately deciding on sanctions, according to the officials.    Kim said there have not been any unusual moves in North  Korea  although military exercises have been held there since February  3.    There has also been no unrest in South Korea regarding North  Korea's situation, Kim said, citing as an example the stable  stock market.    During the hourlong meeting, Hosokawa and Kim agreed to  promote bilateral economic relations in an expanded and balanced  way, the officials said.    Kim pointed out that South Korea's annual trade deficit with  Japan stands at about 8 billion dollars and urged Japan to  import more South Korean goods.    Hosokawa agreed that Japan should make efforts to boost  imports from South Korea and promote deregulation, but urged  Seoul to try to strengthen competitiveness, stabilize  labor-management relations and beef up the environment for  investment, the officials said.    The premier added that Japan wants to support South Korea's  small- and medium-sized companies, they said.    Hosokawa agreed to study Kim's call to send a Japanese  survey  team to South Korea to study investment environment there, they  said.    Kim also voiced South Korea's interest in entering the  Japanese construction market, and Hosokawa replied he will have  the concerned ministries and agencies study the matter, they  said.    Turning to Kim's proposal to promote cooperation among  Japan,  South Korea and China in the environmental, medical and cultural  fields, Hosokawa agreed to study the proposal through  working-level talks, the officials said.    Kim suggested that the three nations cooperate on joint  projects concerning environmental problems, in the field of  modernization of oriental medicine and in their common culture  based on the use of Chinese characters, they said.    Kim told Hosokawa China has shown "positive" reaction to the  proposal.    The president also said his policy of boosting bilateral  relations with Japan by looking into the future rather than to  the past is a step away from that of previous South Korean  governments, and that he believes the majority of the South  Korean people support such a policy, according to the officials.    Hosokawa and Kim also discussed cooperation in the  ultrahigh-speed information communication field.    Earlier in the day, the two leaders held talks over  breakfast  accompanied by their wives.    Topics discussed during the breakfast included North Korea,  Hosokawa's trip to China and political reform in Japan and South  Korea, the officials said.</p>

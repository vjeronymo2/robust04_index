			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Tomkins It would be surprising if Tomkins' decision to explain its hedging strategy was responsible for yesterday's fall in the shares against the run of a rising market. There is nothing unusual about Tomkins' policy of protecting its balance sheet against currency movements, only its choice of instruments. Rather than borrowing in dollars in the manner of Hanson, Tomkins uses currency swaps to create dollar liabilities in equal measure to its US assets. If the dollar falls these assets will depreciate in sterling terms, but so will the liability under the swap agreement. Shareholders' funds should remain unchanged. There is no reason why this approach should be risky, so long as Tomkins is choosy about the banks with which it deals and has sufficient management controls. Tomkins has no natural requirement for dollar debt, so borrowing to hedge its US assets would anyway distort the balance sheet. The only worry is that liabilities under swap agreements are held off balance sheet and are therefore not visible in the accounts. One can only accept Tomkins' word that it never strays into the territory of speculation. Some investors will doubtless object on principle to companies which hedge accounting exposures with instruments that can give rise to cash movements. Tomkins also stands out from the crowd by hedging the translation of overseas profits into sterling, usually by selling dollars forward. The company argues that shareholders appreciate its efforts to make its financial results more predictable. Since Tomkins' acquisitive strategy depends on keeping its share rating well above the market average, that level of certainty has a value all its own.</p>

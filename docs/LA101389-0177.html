			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NORSE PRIME MINISTER RESIGNS  </P> <P> Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, the country's first woman prime  minister, resigned today as head of a minority Labor government, clearing the  way for a center-right coalition to take power.  </P> <P> Brundtland, 50, handed her government's resignation to King Olav at his castle  in central Oslo. The king asked Conservative leader Jan Syse to form a  government.  </P> <P> Brundtland forged a reputation as an environmental champion and fighter for  women's rights during three difficult years of government. Although economists  have credited her for much of the recent economic recovery, the price has been  record jobless levels of about 4%, in a country where full employment has been  an almost holy tradition. Norway's voters clearly thought the price too high.  </P></p>

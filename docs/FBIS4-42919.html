			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Area' Born as Bridge Movement </F> Between Center and Left"]    [Text] Rome -- A bridge between the two opposition forces,  that of the Left and that of the center. This is the plan  formulated by Ferdinando Adornato, former spokesman for the  Democratic Alliance [AD], who yesterday left the mixed group in  the Chamber of Deputies to become part of the progressive  alignment. But Adornato will carve out his own independent niche  within the left-wing front, an Area, as the group will be  called, to "multiply the opportunities for dialogue and debate,  with the aim of facilitating in as many instances as possible  opportunities for mutual coordination in parliament."    The plan carries 12 signatures. Apart from Adornato,  Deputies Serafino Pulcini and Enzo Torre also left the mixed  group, while nine other Area deputies have come from the  progressive group. There are former representatives of the  Democratic Alliance such as Giovanna Melandrini, Miriam Mafai,  Pasquale La Cerra, and Nicola Magrone, constituting part of the  AD leadership which split when the time came to choose  parliamentary groups. Willer Bordon, however, with the group of  former Republicans elected on the AD lists, did not support the  decision, and has stayed in the mixed group. Area has been  joined, however, by a number of members elected on the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] lists, including Fabio  Evangelisti, Ennio Grassi, Marco Pezzoni, and two independents,  Ferdinando Schettino and Sergio De Julio. Thus, as the  progressive forces' caucus leader, Luigi Berlinguer, noted with  satisfaction, the diaspora of left-wing deputies that took  different paths after the elections, is rallying together again:  "With the three new members, we have reached 167 and are by far  the largest group."    Adornato stressed that Area "will not be a political  subject"  but an instrument for "policy discussions" of  "liberal-democratic, Christian, and environmentalist" leanings,  open to contributions from "all interested parliamentarians."  It will be active on two major fronts: rules and  modernization. In order to "rejuvenate" the country it has a  "program for life" comprising three main points: a form of  capitalism featuring widely distributed ownership, educational  reform, and the defense of human and social relations and of the  vulnerable sectors of society -- "all issues rarely the subject  of comprehensive dialogue." With regard to rules, the promotion  of an institutional and socioeconomic federalism, the direct  election of the prime minister (with a system of checks in order  to ensure a balance of power) and antitrust legislation whereby  no single television company has more than one channel.  "Berlusconi," Adornato said, "cannot represent an impartial  viewpoint with regard to the television system. His attack on  the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] was the first time he  showed himself reasoning as a politician and not as a  businessman." Adornato suggests "making state contributions  subject to open criteria of efficiency and productivity." He  was scathing with regard to the opinion polls that the prime  minister has produced on the subject of the RAI: "I too have  conducted some opinion polls, and it emerges that what the  voters are demanding from the RAI is not a policy program but  efficiency; they want an end to the duopoly, and they consider  Berlusconi too biased." His final proposal for a comprehensive  reform of the television system was to entrust the plan to a  committee of experts, "perhaps comprising [author] Umberto Eco,  [LA VOCE editor] Indro Montanelli, former directors of  television news programs, and former chairmen of the  Constitutional Court."</p>

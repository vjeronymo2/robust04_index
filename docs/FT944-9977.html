			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Power of attorney - Briefcase I hold power of attorney over my wife's assets since, approaching 78, she is not capable of managing her financial affairs. Should I die before her, she will need to be cared for in a nursing home. I have been advised by a solicitor to include in my will the following clause: 'My trustees shall hold my residuary estate upon trust as to both capital and income for the use and benefit of my said wife during her lifetime.' I know that if I leave my estate to my wife absolutely, she would not have to pay inheritance tax. But could the arrangement above result in an IHT liability? If you leave the assets either directly to your wife or in trust for her, then the inter-spouse exemption should apply so that no IHT should be payable on your estate. But the value of the assets held by your wife, or under the trust arrangement, would form part of her estate for IHT purposes when she dies. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

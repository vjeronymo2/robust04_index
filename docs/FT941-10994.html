			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Airline aid proposal realistic Sir, In your editorial, 'Mostly wise on open skies' (February 2), you criticise the recommendation of the committee of wise men that one last round of state aid should be permitted in the context of restructuring plans that promise to make state-owned airlines viable within a strictly limited time. Whether or not this recommendation is wise or fair, it is surely realistic. The situation is in many ways analogous to the reconstruction of a public company in administration. BA could not have been privatised had the British government not guaranteed its finances in 1982. The problem now is that privatisation cannot be made a condition for approving a final injection of state aid to an ailing flag carrier. Nothing in the Treaty of Rome, which here faithfully reflects the thinking of the 1950s, would support an attempt by the Commission to issue guidelines limiting the approval of state aid in this way. One must hope that the market place will produce the desired result, as is already happening in Portugal and may yet happen in France. R. Colegate, 40 Lebanon Park, Twickenham, Middlesex TW1 3DG</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD and SILVER powered ahead in afternoon trade on the London bullion market, largely ignoring the OTC options expiry but possibly reacting to strong US economic figures, dealers said. Gold closed above Dollars 394 a troy ounce after fixing at Dollars 393.15 in the afternoon, up from a morning fix of Dollars 391.80. Earlier it was announced US durable goods orders rose 3.8 per cent in June, the biggest gain since December. and well above the average forecast 1 per cent. 'The options were all covered, so it must have been the economic data which caused the buying,' one dealer said. BASE METAL trading was slow on the LME, and minimal interest was seen, although most markets ended steadier as sentiment showed signs of becoming more positive. COPPER continued to pay little heed to fundamentals, which are hardly supportive at present. Instead, the market again pushed higher against a background of a developing squeeze between September and early October. Chicago SOYABEAN were falling at midsession, under pressure from warmer and drier weather in the western US Midwest. Compiled from Reuters</p>

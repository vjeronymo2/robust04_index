			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Unyielding equities Lower interest rates have so far done nothing to improve the lot of equity market investors looking for income. Far from sparking a recovery in high-yielding shares, the sector has fared poorly ever since base rates started to fall. Kleinwort Benson's index of the 100 largest high-yield stocks has underperformed the market by 15 per cent since the start of 1991 and shows no sign of turning. A high yield has become synonymous with a doubtful dividend: 25 companies in the index have cut their pay-out this year. Little wonder that equity income funds have, unusually, been left standing by growth funds, even allowing for reinvestment of dividends. In theory, high-yielding stocks should look relatively more attractive as nominal interest rates come down. Poor dividend growth across the market as a whole has created demand for secure, high-yielding stocks from cash-hungry investment institutions. The combination of high yield and a safe dividend, then, should be a stronger support than ever. This could be a powerful prop for water and electricity stocks, for example, despite increasing regulatory risks. For the rest of the high-yielders, though, interest rates will have to fall further. In sectors such as construction and property, where prices are if anything falling, interest rates of 8 per cent still look punitive in real terms. And while dividend cover for the market as a whole is running well below the long-term average of 2.5 times, many high-yielders have to rebuild cover from less than 1. This could be another strong argument for those seeking income to increase their investment in gilts.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Netas sale tempts foreign investors - The Turkish group hopes to raise Dollars 60m International investors are being offered a chance to bid for an 18 per cent stake in Northern Electrik Telekomminkasyon (Netas), the Turkish telecommunications group which is part of the Northern Telecom of Canada. The sales syndicate is being led by Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. It includes Salomon Bros, Morgan Stanley, James Capel, and UBS of Switzerland. The sale of the shareholding is expected to raise Dollars 60m. Telecommunications is one of Turkey's fastest growing industries. Turkey increased the number of lines by 163 per cent between 1986-91. Public and private investments in the sector are running at about Dollars 2bn a year. Today, for every 100 Turks, 16 have access to a telephone. By 1996, this is expected to rise to about 30 per hundred. The share sale will have a big impact on the direction of Turkey's privatisation effort. Turkey is grappling with the problems of how to dispose of its large state-owned monopolies, with advisers due to be appointed on the sale of both Petrol Ofisi, the petroleum retail company and Tupras, the state-owned refineries group. Netas was set up as a joint venture between PTT, Turkey's state post and telecommunications monopoly and Northern Telecom, to manufacture switches and exchanges for the national network. The company is Turkey's largest telecommunications manufacturer. Netas accounts for more than 50 per cent of the local switchgear market, which in turn comprises 60 per cent of the company's total sales - which in 1992 totalled Dollars 270m. However, there is some concern at the extent to which the the company is dependent on government payments for its revenue flows. About 80 per cent of earnings represent local revenues, although that proportion is falling, the company says. Mr Tanju Argun, the Netas managing director, estimates the 1993 sales figure at Dollars 300m, with exports accounting for Dollars 30m. By 1996, the company expects half its revenues to come from non-government turnover, mostly exports. The company has been in the vanguard of Turkish telecommunications expansion in central Asia. Netas installed Northern Telecom's DMS public exchange in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The company has three joint ventures in the Russian Federation to manufacture the DRX rural digital switch, its own design. Netas plans to exploit the growing market in terrestrial and cable television transmission systems, following the scrapping in June of the state television monopoly. There are now 14 channels. The only blight was when the company failed to win the PTT tender to install a GSM cellular telephone network, the pan-European digital standard which will link Turkey with other European users. The PTT split the contract, awarding to two separate consortia, one led by Eriksson of Sweden, another by Alcatel of France. In February, Northern Telecom paid Dollars 26m for a 20 per cent stake in Netas formerly owned by the government, bringing its shareholding to 51 per cent. The Turkish armed forces fund retains a 15 per cent stake, while the PTT charitable foundation owns 3 per cent. In addition, in March the government offered a further 20 per cent by initial public offering, although subscriptions were received for only 35 per cent of the issue. Turkish brokers expect Kleinwort to price the current deal at a discount of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent to the stock market. Netas is trading at about TL45,000 compared with the March offer price of TL8,250.</p>

Any registered voter or citizens' group  entitled to vote on the measure may submit a ballot argument of 300 or fewer  words.  </P> <P> If approved, Laguna Hills, wedged between Interstate 5 on the east and the  Aliso Viejo planned community on the west, would become the county's 29th city.  It would have about 45,000 residents on 6,000 acres. The private Leisure World  community of 21,000 people would form the geographic core of the new city.  </P></p>

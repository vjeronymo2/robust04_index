			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Opt-in to identity cards It is a rich irony that the most Euro-phobic Conservative party conference since the war has spawned a proposal for a national UK identity card. What ought to go without saying may therefore need to be said: that a thorough assessment of continental experience with ID cards needs to be made before proceeding further. This must pay particular attention to the civil liberties implications that weigh heavily in the debate. In his conference speech yesterday Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said that the government consultation paper to be published next spring would offer a range of options, including the status quo. But the specific idea he floated is bound to be taken as a starting point for the debate. He proposed a 'voluntary' card which would be used as a driving licence and as a state benefits card. 'No one else would be forced to get one,' he said, but added: 'In time carrying your ID card would seem as natural as carrying a credit card is at the moment.' It is immediately obvious that such a card would be far from voluntary for most people. About three-quarters of the population are drivers and/or state benefits recipients. If the card were truly voluntary, drivers and benefits claimants would be able to choose between an ID card or the status quo. In fact, Mr Howard clearly envisaged that such an ID card would rapidly become near-universal, since he went on to claim that it could also help tackle under-age drinking and smoking. Police powers If an ID card is to be introduced, it should be truly optional for at least a lengthy trial period. It should also be laid down in statute that the card gives the police and other enforcement officers no greater powers than they currently possess. So for traffic purposes the police would have no right to see the card on demand, and they would have no wider right to see it at all. Unless ID cards are introduced on that basis, there is little prospect of them enjoying the broad public support that is essential in a society which prizes the liberty of individuals from harassment by the police and public officials. Recall Lord Chief Justice Goddard, who sank Britain's wartime identity cards in the early 1950s by ruling that the obligation to produce them 'tends to make people resentful of the acts of the police and inclines them to obstruct the police instead of to assist them'. However, with these important caveats, there is much to be said for a voluntary ID card. If it takes the form of the most advanced type of smart card, it could serve not merely as a form of identification, but as a banking card and as a store of personal data of all kinds including donor wishes and insurance and medical records. Expected welcome Many people would welcome such a card. After all, most people happily go about their daily life with a purse or wallet full of cards: there are already some 300m smart cards in circulation; the number is expected to increase to some 3bn within the decade. Most people also appear to be happy with the increasingly widespread use of insurance numbers for non-insurance purposes. NI numbers were originally used for keeping track of insurance contributions and benefits. Now they are also used for income tax and, more recently, for personal equity plans and tax-exempt savings accounts. Even children have numbers, in the form of 'child reference numbers' issued for child benefit - all of which involves more cards or payments books. The crucial point is that only those authorised in advance by the card holder should be able to gain access to particular categories of records held on a multipurpose ID card. In theory, this could be done fairly easily by means of encryption technology. In practice, however, the costs would be high - not just for the cards, but also for the terminals necessary to read them. Furthermore, if the ID card was multipurpose, the sharing of costs between parties would be problematic. The preparation for the introduction of such a card would need to be meticulous. The government's recent record in overseeing large IT projects has been poor, yet an ID card of this kind would be as ambitious as any it has attempted to date. All the more reason, then, not to rush its introduction, nor to make it obligatory at an early stage.</p>

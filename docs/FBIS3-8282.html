			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(gag)": "The Engineers' Ambitions and Plans </F> Are in Contrast to the Army's Dilatoriness"]    [Text] Prague--The 40 companies affiliated in the RDP  Group now account for 60 percent of arms production in the Czech  Republic, said Jan Vlcek, the consortium's director general, to  reporters. Coordinating production, pooling resources and  capacities, and importing advanced technologies are not the  consortium's only aims; it is also interested in offering to  quickly and economically reaarm the Czech Army with equipment  compatible with that of NATO. In reply to a question on how the  RDP Group Board explains the inactive cooperation with the Army,  the director general of LIAZ, Jablonec, said the following at  yesterday's news conference: "We are still seeking our place in  relation to the state institutions; apart from this, the Army is  going through comprehensive transformation, which also involves  conceptual changes in procuring equipment. There is a dialogue  between us. Otherwise, it is impossible--armies throughout the  world have an important position with regard to domestic  industry. After all, it is financed from the state budget and  from taxpayers' money." Modernizing weapons and logistics, new  types of wheeled vehicles (from a jeep that is being tested by  the Interior Ministry to heavy tractors), a modular system of  hand weapons, antitank missiles, intelligent ammunition, and  effective communications systems are among the RDP Group's key  projects.    The RDP Group would like to discuss its projects with the  Army in the next few days. The director general of Avia Praha,  which will manufacture 200 special jeep-type all-terrain  vehicles this year, said that the Army still does not have a  rearmament program, which has a severe affect on the development  and production capacity of the engineering enterprises.    "The concept for the Army's rearmament was made public in  the  middle of last year, with the proviso that it should be ready in  January," added Director Vlcek. "However, it will not be  submitted until the second half of the year, and then only in  general form." According to Vlcek, this is a common problem  between a businessman and a customer. Apparently, what is worse  is that the RDP Group is losing out on a qualified expert in the  Defense Ministry, with which it could be holding talks.</p>

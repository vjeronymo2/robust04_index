One of  the main issues being discussed there are seats on the UN  Security Council. And, on the line is Nigeria's foreign  minister, Babagana Kingibe. Good morning, Mr. Kingibe.    [Begin recording] [Kingibe] Good morning.    [Obima] The issue of the UN Security Council that is going  to  be discussed -- you all seem to want to sit on the UN. Is  Nigeria still pressing for a seat on the UN?    [Kingibe] Well, as you know, we are on the UN and we are a  nonpermanent member of the Security Council. I think you must  be referring to the reform, efforts for the reform of the UN  system which would allow the expansion of the permanent  membership of the UN Security Council in such a way as to ensure  fair representation of all the regions of the world in the light  of current realities, in the post-cold war situation. And, in  that regard, of course, we should definitely be interested, if  the responsibility is going to be (?thrust) on us.    [Obima] Is that expansion a very realistic aspiration at  this  time, do you feel?    [Kingibe] Well, of course, because don't forget that the  genesis of the UN -- that is, an organization which was formed  after the First World War by the.... [pauses] after the Second  World War by the victors of that war. And, it was in fact  designed to answer some of the shortcomings of the experience of  the League of Nations, to the give the UN system some peace....  [pauses] to enable it maintain peace and security in the world.  And it is in that context that all the provisions about the  Security Council, about veto power and enforcement capabilities  and so on, were incorporated into the Charter of the UN. And, I  think a lot of time has elapsed since then. The world today is  not the same as the post-45 world and new realities have to be  taken into account. I think the current trend worldwide is for  democratization, for fair representation, for equity, and I do  not think that these concepts are only good enough within  national boundaries. They ought to be extended to the  operations and organization of the international organizations  also. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Deon Lamprecht] </F>   [Text] Former Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs George  Bartlett will soon resign form his post as head of the National  Party [NP] in KwaZulu/Natal. He will stay on as a member of the  executive council for agriculture in the provincial legislature.    Mr. Bartlett was sworn in last night [Wednesday] with six  others in Pietermaritzburg by Judge Allan Howard, Justice  President of KwaZulu/Natal.    He will resign as provincial leader at the NP's federal  congress in Pietermaritzburg on 4 June. Danie Schutte will most  probably succeed him.    Mr. Bartlett said last night that it was time for new blood  in the party. "Renewal has always been one of the NP's strong  points. I have been considering resigning for the past year.  With the election now something of the past, this is the right  thing to do. I am now 63 years old and it is time for a younger  person to take over," he said.</p>

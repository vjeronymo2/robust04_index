The local press reported that the head of the DPRK  delegation  today telephoned South Korea's chief negotiator and said that  South Korea's proposal was "a matter for rejoicing".    The exchange of presidential envoys is an urgent matter  which  could not be delayed, he said.    The three previous rounds of working-level contacts failed  to  make progress on the issue of dispatching envoys to Pyongyang  and Seoul.    According to an agreement reached last Saturday between the  DPRK and the United States, if the DPRK allows nuclear  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  opens a dialogue with South Korea, South Korea and the U.S. will  contemporaneously announce the suspension of joint military  exercises.    The U.S. also will issue the agenda for a third round of  U.S.-DPRK negotiations.    A seven-member team of IAEA inspectors arrived here today.</p>

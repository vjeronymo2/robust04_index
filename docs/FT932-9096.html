			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Hill Samuel denies Everton sale reports The merchant banker Hill Samuel yesterday denied reports that it had been instructed to arranged the sale of Everton football club. The reports, carried in the Liverpool Echo, claimed that the Moores family, which owns the Littlewoods pools and betting chain, had instructed Hill Samuel to arrange a Pounds 2.5m sale of its 50 per cent stake in the club. However, Hill Samuel spokesman yesterday said; 'Everton football club is a banking customer, but Hill Samuel wishes to make it clear that it has not been instructed to advise on raising financing for the club or on the seeking of buyers.' The Moores family yesterday also denied the report, while a spokesman for the club dismissed it as 'sheer speculation.' Nevertheless, with Everton reported to be some Pounds 4m in debt after a series of financially troubled years, the rumours have added to concern about the club's future. Founded a century ago, the club last won the championship in 1987. Since then it has had a mediocre run.</p>

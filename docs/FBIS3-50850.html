			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 8 Jan, CANA -- The St  Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) has rejected plans by the  government to privatise the sugar industry.    The SKNLP, responding to Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds'  announcement of ongoing divestment plans on Thursday, said it  would not be bound by agreements between innocent parties and  what it called an unconstitutional regime clinging to power  against the expressed wishes of the people.    The Labour Party, which is maintaining its call for a fresh  poll following inconclusive general elections last November 29,  said in a statement Saturday it was committed to using its  resources to oppose the process of divestment.    It says the Simmonds government has no mandate or other form  of accepted authority to divest a substantial portion of the  people's inheritance.    The party accused the Simmonds administration of reducing  the  sugar industry to a state which has resulted in a sharp decline  in output and considerable lay-offs of workers.    Unable to rescue, revive and maintain the viability of the  industry, the party statement said, the Simmonds government has  taken an unauthorised decision to sell in part the sugar  industry to private concerns, whose sole motive is profit.    The Labour Party re-affirmed its commitment to the retention  of an integrated sugar industry. It said an efficiently managed  industry can again be one of the effective earners of a large  chunk of foreign exchange.    The SKNLP said a concerned government has an obligation to  ensure the continued livelihood of citizens in the context of  improved wages and conditions of employment.</p>

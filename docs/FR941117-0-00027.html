Section 505 of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, which was enacted on June 10, 1993, amended section 419 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act by making minor changes to the NHLBI Prevention and Control authority. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 also added section 492B to the PHS Act which requires the Director of NIH, in conjunction with the Director of the Office of Research on Women's Health and the Director of the Office of Research on Minority Health, to establish guidelines on the inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in clinical research supported by NIH. In a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of March 28, 1994 (59 FR 14508), NIH announced the establishment of those guidelines. Additionally, in a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10648), the Assistant Secretary for Health enunciated PHS policy concerning the establishment and maintenance of a smoke-free workplace and the promotion of the non-use of tobacco products by recipients of PHS grants. Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions of that law. Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are amending regulations at 42 CFR part 52e governing grants for prevention and control projects to refer to the NIH policy on the inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in clinical research, and to make minor changes in the NHLBI Prevention and Control authority. Specifically, we are amending &sect;52.8 by adding the word ``policies'' to the heading and amending the text of &sect;52e.8 by adding reference to the new NIH guidelines on the inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in clinical research. We are also revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of &sect;52e.1 to conform them to amended section 419 of the PHS Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice, public comment, and delayed effective date procedures are being waived for this amendment based on a finding of good cause. These procedures for ensuring public participation in the rulemaking process and time for compliance are unnecessary because the substantive changes have already been made by the NIH Revitalization Act and this technical amendment changes the regulation to conform with the statutory changes. Similarly, the addition of a reference to a recently issued policy does not impose any new substantive requirements upon applicants. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A central work team headed by State Council Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua, responsible for providing disaster relief to  Guangxi, arrived in Nanning at noon by special plane today.  Accompanied by autonomous regional Governor Cheng Kejie and  other leaders, the work team rushed to Wuzhou and other places  by helicopter to inspect the disaster situation and to guide the  work of combating floods and providing disaster relief.    Leaders with Vice Premier Zou Jiahua included Chen Yaobang,  vice minister of the State Planning Commission, He Jihai, vice  minister of the Internal Trade Ministry, Li Jiaolin, deputy  director of the Grain Reserve Department, Xu Caihou, deputy  director of the General Political Department under the People's  Liberation Army [PLA], and others.    Autonomous regional party, government, and military leaders  who welcomed Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and his party at Nanning's  Wuxi Airport included Cheng Kejie, Liu Mingzu, Xu Bingsong, Mao  Hubin, and others.    Zhao Fulin, Guangxi Autonomous Regional CPC secretary, Wen  Guoqing, Guangxi Military District commander, Liu Chunliang,  political commissar of the air force stationed in Guangxi, and  others rushed to Guiping and Pingnan, one of the areas severely  affected by floods in our region, to inspect the disaster  situation, and guide the work of fighting floods and providing  disaster relief. On behalf of the regional CPC committee,  regional people's government, Guangxi Military District, and PLA  troops stationed in Guangxi, they visited and expressed their  thanks to all servicemen and civilian who participated in the  drive to fight floods and provide disaster relief.    On the afternoon of 20 June, after arriving in Guiping, Zhao  Fulin and his party took a boat to go downstream on the Yu Jiang  to Jiangkou Town, a severely flooded area. When the boat  arrived at the town, Zhao Fulin visited more than 700 officers  and men of the Tashan Heroic Regiment, who were fighting the  floods there. When he learned that these more than 700 fighters  and officers had risked their lives and sweat to erect a 14-km  flood-control dyke using 100,000 pieces of gunnysacks. He was  very excited and said: You ventured to keep off the floods with  your bodies to protect the lives and property of the people.  You have proven to be the People's Army and heroic troops.    In Pingnan County town where the water level was as high as  over three meters, while inspecting those drowned streets and  houses, Zhao Fulin asked local leaders about the floods. He  wanted to know the situation regarding safety, food supplies,  lodging, health, and other concerns of the masses affected by  the disaster. When he learned that the county had succeeded in  processing 300,000 kg of paddy into rice and that each and every  victim of floods would first get five kg of rice to ensure that  they would not go hungry, Zhao Fulin felt very happy. He  stressed: The present priority task is to rescue those of the  masses who are stranded on rooftops and hilltops as soon as  possible. We must clearly examine each and every village,  rooftop, and tree. We must rescue them as early as possible.  Those who lack grain must be provided with relief grain. Our  relief work must reflect that the party shows concern for the  masses and that our party and government leaders have strong  organization capability. It must also show the strength of  army- civilian unity and team spirit under the leadership of the  CPC.    In Pingnan County town, Zhao Fulin also took a small boat to  visit victims stranded on rooftops. He asked after their health  with deep concern and said a few words to comfort them. When  the masses witnessed the deep concern shown to them by the  regional party, government, and military leaders, they were  greatly moved.    After inspecting the flood situation in the two counties and  cities, Secretary Zhao discussed on the boat with Yulin  prefectural, county, and city leaders disaster-relief plans. He  uttered sincere words and expressed earnest hopes. When he  learned that county and city party secretaries in Yulin City,  Beiliu City, and Hongxian County, which were not affected by  floods, had each led 1,000-man rescue teams consisting of young  people's militiamen who could swim well to provide disaster  relief, he praised them by saying: Such team spirit is very  good. The foods are merciless but the men are full of sympathy.  Party and government leaders at all levels must tell the broad  masses of people affected by floods that the government and  areas which have not been affected by the disaster will  definitely come to their rescue. As long as there is the  leadership of the Communist Party, difficulties can be overcome  no matter how enormous they are.</p>

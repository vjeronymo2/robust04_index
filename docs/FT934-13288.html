			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Management: In search of the stars / A look at the scramble to find the right winners for a multitude of business awards In the offices of JO Hambro in the City of London, a panel of the great and the good are sifting through a list of captains of industry in search of the 1993 Businessman of the Year. Across town in the west end a group of women are poring over hundreds of female success stories to find Cosmopolitan magazine's Achiever of the Year. All across the country the search is on for big businessmen, small businessmen, young businessmen, old businessmen. It is on for businesswomen and potential businesswomen. It is on for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. There are so many awards for business stars that you could get from one end of the year to another eating nothing but celebratory meals at Claridges and the Savoy. Are all these awards getting out of hand? Why are there so many? Are the right prizes going to the right people? Companies like awards because they are cheap PR. If all goes well, the sponsor stands to gain copious publicity as well as getting its name associated with business success. Newspapers and magazines also like them for the PR value. Professional bodies see their members rewarded and motivated. And the public simply likes reading about the winners. 'There can't be too many,' says Rhiannon Chapman of the Industrial Society, a veteran adjudicator of business awards. 'There is a great hunger for signposts to success. People need to feel things are possible.' Yet judging the business awards is not like judging the Booker prize. A novel can be remaindered but it cannot lead a company which goes bankrupt. If a businessperson wins a prize one year and the company subsequently gets into difficulty, he or she may destroy the standing of the award in the process. The Guardian's Young Businessman of the Year award made a few unfortunate choices and came unstuck as a result. After selecting Sir Clive Sinclair, John Gunn of British and Commonwealth, and John Ashcroft of Coloroll  - all of whom ran companies which subsequently hit hard times  - The Guardian quietly scrapped the award three years ago. One way around the problem is to play safe. This is the approach adopted by judges of the Hambro Businessman of the Year award and the Institute of Management's Gold Medal. Both go for what many might consider the obvious names, often picking the same people: Sir Arnold Hall of Hawker Siddeley, Sir Owen Green of BTR, Lord Seiff of Marks and Spencer and Sir Terence Beckett of Ford have both awards on their mantlepieces, while Sir Robert Scholey of British Steel picked up both titles in the same year. But even the big names are not always a certainty. Gerald Ronson of Heron was Businessman of the Year in 1984, while last year's choice of Lord King was perhaps a little unfortunate, coming as it did just before news of British Airways' dirty tricks campaign. Whether or not the choice is a sound one, it is not immediately clear why prizes should be given to those who have already reached the top. The answer, says Ailsa Dempster of the Institute of Management, is less to glorify the winner and more to motivate others. The same rationale clearly applies to awards aimed at special groups  - businesswomen and entrepreneurs  - who are in greater need of role models. When Veuve Clicquot launched its Businesswoman of the Year award 21 years ago, it was the only prize of its sort. Now women's magazines, clearing banks, building societies, accountancy companies and office equipment suppliers jostle to reward successful women. There has been a similar scramble to give prizes to entrepreneurs and small business people, the Venturer of the Year award (sponsored by Cartier, the Financial Times and the British Venture Capital Association) being one prominent example. Most of the awards have the standard posh lunch and a standard big name presenting the prize. Some  - such as the Businessman of the Year award  - are charity functions. Some prizes are more worth winning than others: the more prominent the winner the worse the prize. The Businessman of the Year receives a trophy and a modicum of honour. The Gold Medal comes mounted in a perspex shell. The Businesswoman of the Year wins a silver tastevin, but she also gets a gourmand's trip to Rheims, a vine named after her and champagne on her birthday for the rest of her life. Cartier offers a Pounds 5,000 watch. The magazines offer money, holidays and telecoms equipment. The Cosmopolitan/Arthur Anderson High Flier gets a paid place at business school. For the sponsors the main cost is not the prize but the expense of selecting the winners. Moira Collins, who runs the Veuve Clicquot award, says picking the right person requires months of effort. It is not an exact science, but careful study of the paperwork and site visits are necessary. Collins argues women are less likely to take a tumble than men: 'Most businesswomen have plodded away. But a lot of those boys, they were higher up and had further to fall.' Veuve Clicquot has had to hide its blushes twice in 21 years: it awarded prizes to Debbie Moore of Pineapple and Sophie Mirman of Sock Shop, both companies which suffered from over-expansion in the 1980s. The awards for women face the further difficulty of having a limited number of candidates to choose from. 'When Anita Roddick won, everyone complained she has been discovered to death. When Gisela Burg won, they said 'who on earth is she?',' says Collins. The Institute of Directors, until recently a sponsor of the Veuve Clicquot prize, admits that the enthusiasm of some of its members has faded. 'There is a feeling among our 2,600 women directors that special events for them are not quite what they want,' says Gordon Leak, media relations director. While awards proliferate, many hard-working managers, burrowing away in big corporations, are excluded altogether. This is partly because their achievement is more difficult to spot and measure, and partly because colleagues can be less than supportive. Veuve Clicquot is trying to include more corporate women in its award, but finds it difficult. 'Corporate women who get nominated don't get a good time from colleagues. They get teased mercilessly  - the men are quite jealous.' Most successful business people are not entrepreneurs, they have not just done a management buy-out and they are not captains of industry. 'Being a director of a company is interesting, difficult and rewarding,' argues Leak. He believes a medal should be created to mark the unsung heroes.</p>

Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RYAN NO-HITS CLUBHOUSE THIEVES  </P> <P> Fenway Park burglars, as have so many Fenway Park would-be hitters, struck out  against Nolan Ryan.  </P> <P> Burglars broke into the home and visitor clubhouses over the weekend and made  off with several game jerseys, but got nothing from Ryan.  </P> <P> The Texas Rangers realize how highly sought Ryan memorabilia is among souvenir  collectors, so the club takes special security precautions to protect the  pitcher's personal possessions.  </P></p>

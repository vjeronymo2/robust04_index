			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Thomson buys into the market for UK holidays Thomson Travel Group, the UK's biggest overseas holiday company, yesterday made its first move into domestic tourism by announcing the acquisition of Marrhigh, which runs a holiday cottage business. The vendors are a group of institutional investors led by 3i. Marrhigh operates the Country Holidays Group, the UK's biggest holiday cottage letting agency. Neither side would say how much Thomson was paying for the group, but the sum is thought to be about Pounds 34m. The acquisition marks a significant departure for Thomson, which has never before sold UK holidays. Thomson is the UK's biggest tour operator, selling more than 4m overseas holidays a year. Lunn Poly, its retail chain, is the UK's largest travel agent with 730 high street outlets. Britannia Airways, its charter airline, is the biggest in the country. Mr Paul Brett, Thomson's group chairman, said Country Holidays was an attractive purchase because it was the UK market leader. Its 6,000 cottages are expected to accommodate 350,000 holidaymakers this year. The overseas holiday market is dominated by large groups such as Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad, which use their buying power to drive down the cost of accommodation and transport. By contrast, the UK domestic tourist market has traditionally been fragmented and dominated by small companies. The Lancashire-based Country Holidays Group was the subject of a Pounds 14m management buy-out in 1989 from Mr Philip Green, its founder. Finance for the buy-out was provided by a group of institutional investors led by 3i. Its properties are also marketed under the Character Cottages and Haywood Amaro brand names. The group recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m in the year to October 1993. Pre-tax profits in the year to September 1992 were Pounds 492,000. Mr Brett said he regarded the UK cottage holiday market as a substantial business which could be expanded. He said that despite the growth of overseas package travel many people took their main holiday in the UK. He said there was also a large weekend break market. He said Country Holidays' existing management and 200 employees would remain in their jobs. Thomson has not yet decided whether to sell UK cottage holidays though its Lunn Poly outlets. The cottage holidays are currently marketed to the public through a catalogue. Thomson has its own direct sales holiday company, Portland. Mr Brett said there was scope for collaboration between the two direct sales organisations.</p>

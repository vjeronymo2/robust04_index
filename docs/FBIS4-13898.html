			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's  statement about his willingness to dismantle the settlements in  the Golan is not a new. It does not contain anything new to  push the stagnant peace process forward. Rabin wants to precede  Warren Christopher's tour of the region with statements that  seem to offer concessions compared to previous positions. He  wants to give the impression that Israel is offering new  initiatives that require the other side, -- the Arabs, and  Syria, in particular -- to offer concessions in return.    The objectives of Rabin's attempt are obvious. He seeks to  direct U.S. pressure -- which is supposed to be directed toward  the party obstructing the peace process, Israel -- toward Arabs  who have offered everything in order to make the peace process a  success.    Rabin's statement about Israel's willingness to dismantle  the  settlements does not respond to what is stipulated in the terms  of reference of the peace process regarding the need for full  Israeli withdrawal, dismantling settlements, and evacuating  settlers from all occupied Arab territories.    According to observers, Rabin's statements are just  maneuvers  before Christopher's tour. Rabin previously took positions he  quickly revoked in order to adopt counter positions.    After the Israeli Labor party won in the recent elections,  the international community expected Yitzhaq Rabin to take the  initiative to freeze settlement building in implementation of  his electoral promises. However, after he assumed power, Rabin  came out with a new theory concerning political and security  settlements. He allocated great amounts of money in favor of  settlement building, including U.S. loan guarantees. He did so  despite the fact that he made a commitment to Washington not to  spend a single dollar from these loan guarantees on expanding  settlements.    Despite Rabin's continuous talk about his willingness to  bring momentum to the talks with Syria in order to reach a  settlement, he has aborted practically every chance of making  minimal progress. He did this when he instructed his  negotiating delegation not to get into the issue of withdrawal  from the Golan. Rabin met Syria's true peace intentions with  the expansion of settlements in the Golan and the building of  new ones.    Peace in the Middle East requires deeds, not words. Syria,  along with the Arab parties to the Washington talks, build their  stands based on Israel's deeds, not its words. Arabs have heard  a lot of Israel's peace claims, but they have not sensed  anything tangible in the Washington talks and in the occupied  Arab territories. Indeed, the reverse is true.    For its part, Syria presented a paper containing objective  and balanced principles and proposals since the sixth round.  This paper was the center of world attention, except, of  course, in Israel, which sought to block the adoption of the  Syrian paper because its sixth article discussed full Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan.    The Washington talks, which began two and one-half years  ago,  have not achieved the desired results despite sincere Arab  intentions and because all Israeli officials, from all trends,  have not directed their attention to peace. These officials  entered a competitive display of extremism and intransigence.  Settlement building, of course, was part of this competition.  The whole world community agrees that the policy of settlements  totally contradicts peace and that peace and settlements cannot  coexist and that peace and occupation cannot coexist. The UN  Security Council resolutions are clear and frank. They do not  permit occupation and settlements and demand their total removal.    The Arabs have not moved from the world's stand. Indeed,  they have called for the implementation of UN Security Council  resolutions, the removal of settlements, and the exchange of  land for peace. If Israel had responded to international law  and efforts, as well as to true Arab intentions and adopted the  Syrian proposals, peace would be prevailing in the region today.    Despite all the Israeli prevarication, there is an  opportunity today to achieve firm peace in the region, if Israel  takes the initiative to withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories and dismantle all settlements there.    The question posed by the observers is: Did Rabin's  statement  express a substantive change in the Israeli position, or is it  just a maneuver to mislead the world public opinion that  discovered the atrocities of the settlers and the dangers they  pose to the peace process after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre?    The next few days, which will see a new tour by the U.S.  secretary of state, is guaranteed to expose the reality of the  Israeli positions. The peace process is in a real predicament  and the chances to achieve peace are growing narrower and are  threatening to disappear.</p>

By a notice published August 10, 1994, the comment period on the Notice of Proposed Policy was extended until September 15, 1994 (59 FR 41194, August 10, 1994). As a result of enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization act of 1994 (1994 Authorization Act), the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA) have determined that the publication of a supplemental notice of proposed policy may be in order. This notice is being published to advise interested persons of the intention to publish a supplemental notice and to provide for an extension of the comment period to permit commenters to review and respond to the supplemental notice in their comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period is extended from September 15, 1994, to October 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed, in quadruplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Dockets No. 27782, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.

A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' (Rules of Practice) proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August 23, 1994. The 1994 Authorization Act includes provisions providing new policy guidance on the reasonableness of airport rates and charges and that direct the Secretary of Transportation to adopt guidelines, policies and procedures for resolving air carrier/airport disputes over the reasonableness of landing fees. The 1994 Authorization Act directs that such guidelines, policies and procedures be adopted within 90 days after enactment. The 90-day deadline is November 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One air carrier has already suggested that the current notice of proposed policy should be withdrawn as inconsistent with the 1994 Authorization Act. We do not agree that the 1994 Authorization Act requires so extensive a revision to the notice of proposed policy. However, based on initial review of the new statutory provisions, some modifications to the proposed policy may be in order to assure that the proposed policy conforms to the statute. Accordingly, the OST and the FAA intend to publish a supplemental notice of proposed policy with the modifications we consider to be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the supplemental notice is not ready to publish at this time, we have concluded that an extension of the comment period until October 15 is appropriate. This extension of the comment period should assure that interested persons have an opportunity to review and address the supplemental notice in their comments and should not preclude the OST and the FAA from meeting the statutory deadline for publication of final policy guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the statutory deadline, further extensions of the comment period are not anticipated. We intend to publish the supplemental notice by October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA is simultaneously publishing a separate notice in the federal Register with respect to the proposed Rules of Practice. The notice withdraws proposed subpart J, Alternate Procedure for Certain Complaints Concerning Airport Rates and Charges and extends the comment period on the remainder of the proposal until December 1, 1994. In a separate action, DOT intends to publish for comment proposed amendments to 14 CFR Part 302 to provide procedures for resolution of airport/air carrier disputes over airport rates and charges by October 15, 1994. It is anticipated that the comment period for the Part 302 proposal would not exceed 15 days. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> CHICANO SHOW MIXES ADVOCACY, AESTHETICS  </P> <P> In an epoch when polarization runs high and skins rub thin, the multi-ethnic  Los Angeles Festival wants to nurture understanding between the diverse  cultures on the Pacific Rim. Lurking behind this benign and healing impulse is  the danger that the festival might fail to draw the right balance between  ethnography and art. Too much of the one and the festival speaks only to the  already initiated. Too little of the other and it disappoints an audience  expecting entertainment or aesthetic delectation.  </P> <P> The problem nags at the most prominent art exhibition associated with the  festival. Titled "CARA" (an acronym for "Chicano Art: Resistance and  Affirmation"), it opened Sunday at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery and runs to Dec. 9.  As a measure of its ambition, it will travel to seven museums around the  country and includes about 130 works by more than 90 artists, including many  collaborative projects and suggesting the communal urge that inspired the  whole.  </P> <P> On one hand, it is an exercise in cultural history, out to educate -- even  indoctrinate -- its audience, first in the history and mores of a U.S.  subculture. But, unlike the recent "The Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists  in the United States," "CARA" tightens the focus first to Americans of Mexican  descent, then to that faction among them who wish to be known as Chicanos and  as part of the Chicano movement. An interpretive glossary to be included in the  show's yet-undelivered catalogue, defines the movement as social, cultural,  political and out to assert and regain the civil rights in a community where  some feel they have been lost. It defines Chicano as a "self-designating term  for politicized people of Mexican descent in the United States."  </P> <P> Evidently, some Mexican-Americans regard the term as a slur. According to the  glossary virtually all terms for Latin-descended U.S. citizens from Spanish to  Latino to Hispanic are offensive to somebody, proving there is no consensus on  the subject. U.S. citizens who call themselves "Americans" are generally  regarded as arrogant as the whole continent is America, north and south.  Chicanos embrace their handle as a symbol of identification with the poor and  disenfranchised.  </P> <P> The main essay by Shifra Goldman and Tomas Ybarra-Frausto says the movement is  centered in the Southwest. The geography is known to Chicanos as Aztlan and  regarded as the ancestral home of the Aztecs. During the heyday of the  movement, some Chicanos held it was plunder lost to the Anglos in the  Mexican-American War and they wanted it back.  </P> <P> The exhibition traces the movement from 1965 to 1985. The essay reviews it from  Cesar Chavez's organization of the United Farm Workers in the '60s to its  tragic apogee in East Los Angeles during a huge 1970 anti-Vietnam War  demonstration when newsman Ruben Salazar was killed by a tear-gas canister  fired by a sheriff's deputy. It moves on to such cultural matters as the  representation of Latinos in feature films like Gregory and Anna Nava's classic  "El Norte."  </P> <P> A lot of this is informative if sometimes myopically biased but it does create  a problem that is shared by the increasingly large numbers of exhibitions that  want to link fine art to social and political issues. There is always a  traumatic disjuncture between the intellectual and generalizing mind-set of the  social historian and the intensely personal and specific operation of the  artist. Even when the artist consciously shares the intellectual's goals, his  creative product and its scholarly rationale repel each another like magnets  turned the wrong way. They represent irreconcilable modes of human expression.  Art is about organic feeling which is reduced to cold ideology by advocacy  scholarship. The Chicano art movement is not well-known to the general culture.  In L.A. we have seen such occasional museum exhibitions as the County Museum of  Art's "Los Four" in 1974 and commercial gallery shows that have created  individual reputations for such artists as the late Carlos Almaraz, Gronk and  John Valadez, among others. "CARA" creates the impression that Chicano art was  less an organized movement than a spontaneous expression.  </P> <P> Spontaneity is hard to define but very convincing, as when somebody suddenly  slugs you. That is what the real art in "CARA" does and it's a big relief after  all the polemic. The art also bursts unexpectedly into song or plants a big  kiss on your kisser. You feel like you've been invited into the barrio to share  the artists' most tender and angry feelings.  </P> <P> The trademark form of Chicano art is its powerful, raw murals, like the noted  works of L.A.'s Judith Baca. They speak most clearly of a subculture struggling  for internal cohesion and individual identity. Since murals can't be brought  into an art gallery, they are represented, diluted, in a slide show. Other  installations remained unfinished as vernissage festivities approached on  Sunday, but the spirit was there.  </P> <P> The very first image encountered in the galleries is a woodcut by Carlos Cortez  Koyokuikatl, a portrait including the phrase, "Art for art's sake is an  absurdity." About three-quarters of the work echoes that sentiment. It's out to  be forceful, idealistic, heartfelt and funny rather than perfect. You want  generosity? Look at Amalia Mesa-Bains' "An Ofrenda for Dolores del Rio." There  are works echoing the artists' admiration for Mexican Surrealist Frida Kahlo  but only one of them -- by Yreina D. Cervantes -- approaches the quality of  Kahlo's art. Admiring memories of the great Mexican revolutionary muralists,  Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco, are everywhere with a dollop of Posada and a  whiff of Tamayo thrown in. Yet none of the Chicano artists display the masters'  command of materials, heroic scale or symbolic savvy.  </P> <P> The style of what we see here is that of neighborhood art. Even markedly  professional artists like Luis Jimenez retain an aura of home-grown funk.  Rather than taking that immediately as a shortcoming, let's look at it as a  diagnostic symptom. It's really not unlike what we've seen coming out from the  now-liberated Soviet underground. It's art made to express intimate feelings to  be shared with friends and family without consideration of a larger audience.  </P> <P> It would be a shame to change the candor of Carmen Lomas Garza. Her gentle  poetry is already complete in "Camas Para Suenos" where we see mother making  the beds while the kids lounge on the roof dreaming at the moon. Gilbert  Lujan's Pachuco dogs and Aztec-jaguar lowriders have already been ripped off as  boutique knickknacks, proving he can't afford to get much slicker.  </P> <P> "CARA" shows a complete sensibility. It's socially concerned, inbred, romantic,  proud, nostalgic, ceremonial, masochistic, fetishistic and original. Where  would the Anglos have been for fashion after World War II without the zoot  suit?  </P> <P> Any art judged by sensibility is of interest just as all people are of  interest. "CARA's" collective look becomes a simile of a stay-with-the-gang  subculture. That works among the home folks but in a larger world, it's  different -- as proven by the growth of numerous artists here. Now they are in  the Wight Gallery, which once housed a retrospective of Henri Matisse. That  raises the ante just as society does when Junior moves out and has to please an  objective boss, not just his mom and buddies.  </P> <P> The most successful single body of work here are the photographs. Maybe that's  because a demand for technical savvy is built into the medium. Ricardo  Valverde's "Boulevard Night" doesn't lose an ounce of eloquence from being well  composed and printed. Technique enhances the dark glamour of a barrio street  cruise and a girl with Egyptian eyes. Photos are also ideally suited to  exhibitions with a sociological bias, as witness the work of Harry Gamboa Jr.,  Adam Avila and others.  </P> <P> Graphic art looks strong because it's learnable and a natural medium for  propaganda. Rupert Garcia's red barbed-wire image " Cesen Deportacion!" is as  good as any prime Cuban revolutionary poster, but his striking image of Zapata  falls apart. It's a drawing problem around the jaw line and that's odd because  a lot of the more cartoony work shows immense natural facility.  </P> <P> To paraphrase the moribund comedian, "Dying is easy, painting is hard." More  paintings are blown among "CARA" works than in any other medium. Daniel  Galvez's dogged, hyperreal "Homegirl" is a triumph of expression over art. The  tough lady stands there in her T-shirt and the image is so present it nails us  to the wall. But no thanks to Galvez's worriful paint handling. Baca has  similar problems in "The Three Marias." When you have to agonize too much it  hurts the work.  </P> <P> "CARA's" art rarely shows Chicano artists at their best. The exhibition proves  that combining art and sociology is still a dicey business requiring more skill  than was shown here. More importantly, "CARA" proves that the issue of quality  in art will not go away. Some commentators are insisting these days that  quality is a code word for the judgmental domination of white males. Nonsense.  That's not what the word means. Quality has to do with every person's desire to  get better, to express themselves with greater eloquence, force and finesse.  The best artist in "CARA" wants to do that. So do I. So do you.  </P></p>

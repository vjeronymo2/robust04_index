			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Arts: Pygmies in the Ruins - Royal Court Theatre After the spate of Irish lyricism that we have recently had in London from Dublin, here is a touch of the harder stuff from the north. Ron Hutchinson's Pygmies in the Ruins, which opened last November at the Lyric Theatre, Belfast, to praise on this page from Antony Thorncroft, is billed as a thriller and certainly has elements of suspense; an English audience, however, might be more interested in what it tells us about the current state of Northern Ireland. The piece suggests that such is the cumulative, meaningless violence, a touch of hysteria is setting in. The central character Washburn, played by Ian McEihinney, is a police photographer who periodically goes mad because he cannot make sense of what he is seeing. Whereas the rest of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is either getting out or looking forward to going on holiday in Florida, Washburn is obsessed by seeking a pattern in the killings. Yet there is a twist. This is not a conventional play about modern Ulster. Instead Hutchinson looks back to the Ireland of 1871 when the industrial revolution was at its height and Belfast was a thriving, thrusting city, far outstripping Dublin, which that particular revolution never touched. Belfast indeed had some claim to be the second city in the empire in terms of prosperity. There were unexplained killings then, just as there are unexplained killings now. Hutchinson juxtaposes the two periods and asks the question, through Washburn, who are the people of the north? Is the damage inflicted on them from the outside, or do they do it to themselves? It is not Hutchinson's fault that he fails to provide the answer. If there is one, it has eluded everyone else. But it must be clear by now that - Yugoslavia apart - Northern Ireland is a pretty peculiar place by the standards of contemporary Europe. That is what the play is about. The pygmies are the people of modern Belfast scrabbling about in the ruins of a once great entrepreneurial city. It may have been built partly on corruption, but at least it had a sense of purpose. 'A thriving, prosperous Belfast, northern sister to ancient Dublin,' says one of the 19th century characters, 'is the best hope for an Ireland that will gather in her exiled sons and daughters . . . Dublin faces England and the past - Belfast faces the world and the coming century.' Of the several things that I admire about a far-from-perfect play, one is the absence of any overt propaganda. This is a distinctive Irish voice saying something different. There are also no stereotypes, whether gunmen, priests, poets, revolutionaries or tinkers. Hutchinson suggests that Belfast is about money; he does not rub it in too much that money is part of the protestant ethic. Religion tends to be directly confined to recurrent, rather dismal singing of 'Hills of the North, Rejoice.' 'The hills round Belfast,' someone says, 'would have made a good place for a crucifixion.' The chief fault is that the piece is too long and does not know where to end. It could finish with Washburn killing himself, as he is invited to do, or, succumbing to hysteria, turning his his gun on any or everyone else. That is part of the suspense. In the event, Hutchinson settles for a lyrical ballad spoken by Washburn and his girl-friend Nuala, played by the aptly named Fiona Victory. It tells the tale of a man on the Shankill Road who tried to slit his wife's throat, then hanged himself because he could not bear the blood. The woman survived and the man died; 'For the razor-blade was Dublin-made, But the rope was Belfast linen.' In that, as in much of the rest of the play, there is a touch of Louis MacNeice. The production, in association with the Lyric Players Theatre, Belfast, is directed by Eoin O'Callaghan. I found it pretty well faultless.</p>

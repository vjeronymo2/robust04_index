			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Strong end to year as Telegraph rises 36% A strong final quarter helped The Telegraph lift 1993 pre-tax profits 36 per cent from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 60.2m. Excluding one-off items, pre-tax profits were 15.5 per cent higher at Pounds 53.7m. A final dividend of 7.5p is proposed to give a total of 13p (11p), a rise of 18 per cent. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director, said that the trend of stronger advertising revenue had continued into the current year. The shares rose 7p to 587p, compared with the flotation price of 325p in July 1992. The group, which publishes the Daily and Sunday Telegraph in the UK, also has a 25 per cent stake in John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, and a 9.4 per cent stake in Southam, the Canadian publisher. Nearly 20 per cent of pre-tax profit comes from outside the UK, Mr Conrad Black, chairman, said. During 1993, newspaper advertising revenue rose 8 per cent while circulation revenue increased by almost 6 per cent. Mr Cooke said that the price of the Monday to Friday Daily Telegraph had been increased in February last year, but the Saturday and Sunday papers prices had not risen in the autumn as was usual. The Saturday edition's price was 'the next candidate' for an increase, he said. About 53 per cent of revenue came from advertising, a recovery from recent years, but well below the two thirds contributed in the peak year of 1989. Group turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 255.7m (Pounds 237.2m) for operating profits up from Pounds 37.5m, after Pounds 2.2m of float costs, to Pounds 42.9m. The sale of a stake in Trinity International Holdings in February contributed a profit of Pounds 6.5m. Associates more than doubled to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 5.9m) largely because of the increase in the Fairfax stake. There was a Pounds 2.8m worsening in the interest position, as a credit of Pounds 900,000 turned to a debit of Pounds 1.9m. During 1993 The Telegraph increased its stake in Fairfax from 15 per cent, at a cost of Pounds 74m and acquired the Southam stake for Pounds 66m. As a result total borrowings rose from Pounds 40.5m to Pounds 104m. However, taking account of cash of Pounds 9.5m, gearing at the year end was 31 per cent. The tax rate rose to 30.9 per cent (27.5 per cent). Earnings per share were higher at 30.6p (23.8p) or 27.4p (23.8p), excluding the investment profit. COMMENT The cycle is beginning to work in The Telegraph's favour and 1994 should see further good growth in advertising. Meanwhile, Fairfax is proving a good investment, though the cycle there is perhaps two years behind that in the UK. Later on the Southam stake should also contribute as it also responds to the cost-cutting. With profits this year expected to rise to about Pounds 65m, the prospective p/e is about 17. Suspicions over the 68 per cent stake held by Mr Black's Hollinger group seem to have been dispelled and the shares could continue to outperform. Fairfax results, Page 34</p>

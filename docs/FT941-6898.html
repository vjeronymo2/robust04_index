			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / German unions tighten screw: Wave of strikes planned this week Labour unrest in Germany will be stepped up this week, with a wave of warning strikes hitting public services such transport and rubbish collection, and plans for stoppages by postal and banking workers, on top of the action already disrupting the engineering industry. The lack of progress in wage negotiations last week both for the country's 3.5m public sector workers, and for 430,000 banking employees, has precipitated the latest escalation in industrial action, although no negotiation has broken down formally. The OTV public sector union will call out local transport workers in North Rhine-Westphalia today, and rubbish collection workers in Baden-Wurttemberg, for brief token strikes to press its pay claim. It is seeking a 4 per cent rise for its members to keep pace with inflation, while the federal, state and local government employers are all insisting on an outright pay freeze. HBV, the banking and insurance workers' union, will take longer to organise its action, but brief stoppages are expected by the week's end. In the meantime, IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, is pressing ahead with its strike ballot of more than 90,000 members in the state of Lower Saxony, to be held from Tuesday to Thursday, to decide on calling an all-out stoppage from March 7. It has been running a campaign of brief warning strikes by hundreds of thousands of workers for the past two weeks. Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the president of the German chambers of industry and commerce, warned in a radio interview that the engineering employers would react with lockouts to any strike action, in a bid to bring the action to a swift halt. As an engineering employer himself, and a former leading negotiator for Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, he still insisted that a negotiated solution to the dispute was possible. The union is seeking a package of nominal pay rises and job security guarantees; the employers are insisting on absolute cost cuts in exchange for any guarantees. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, warned in an interview in today's mass circulation Bild Zeitung that any strike action would 'destroy the gradual economic recovery' now under way. He urged both sides to agree on 'flexible deals, tailored to the differing needs of different branches and regions, and the particular problems of individual enterprises'. The public sector pay talks broke up without any new offer from the employers' side on Friday night, after the third round of negotiations. The government side, which involves both the conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn, and many Social Democrat-dominated coalitions from the 16 federal states, is insisting on a package of cuts in conditions and fringe benefits, in addition to a pay freeze.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE SENTENCE  </P> <P> The moral of the life sentence without possibility of parole given to the  22-year-old with 5 1/2 ounces of crack seems clear (Part A, Dec. 7). Persons  pursing criminal careers should, once they get two drug convictions, direct  their efforts to more socially acceptable crimes, such as armed robbery or car  theft. If this person had done either, he would be getting out in a few years.  </P> <P> BOB CLARK JR.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

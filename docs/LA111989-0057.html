			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TRACI DOES TV  </P> <P> With a video distributor recently sentenced to a year in prison for interstate  transportation of child pornography in connection with the much-publicized  Traci Lords case, NBC is quietly moving ahead with a movie-of-the-week on the  same subject.  </P> <P> We're told that Lords is actively involved in the development of "Out of the  Blue," which will portray her story from the time she was an Ohio junior high  schooler through her reign as the under-age star of such hard-core fare as  "Traci Takes Tokyo" and "New Wave Hookers."  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean "Blue" will present a one-sided view of her story,  insists producer Larry Samitsky.  </P> <P> "She is not being portrayed as a total victim," he said. "We're relying on her  input, of course, but she does not have script approval."  </P> <P> Dalene Young ("Little Darlings," "Cross Creek") is scripting, with no  production start date or casting targeted as yet.  </P> <P> Samitsky, who bought the rights to Lords' story with partner Frank Konigsberg a  year ago, added that Lords "is being very forthright about what happened. To a  certain extent she was a victim. To a certain extent she was responsible  herself.  </P> <P> "And yet, you have to wonder, considering she was 14 years old, how could it  happen?"

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Labour ready to launch its largest billboard campaign THE LABOUR party in Scotland, which today launches the biggest billboard campaign in its history, says it is aiming almost its entire election effort at removing the Conservatives from their remaining nine Scottish seats. Labour says it will not direct much campaigning resources against the Scottish National Party because it believes the nationalists stand little chance of winning seats from it. The Labour party in Scotland, which holds 48 of the 72 Scottish parliamentary seats, reckons that only by removing the Conservative government from Westminster can Scotland achieve a devolved parliament. The SNP, it argues, is largely irrelevant in this general election because it cannot form a government at Westminster. Labour believes that the SNP, in spite of standing at about between 24 and 28 per cent in the Scottish opinion polls, will not win many Scottish seats on April 9. 'The only threat the SNP pose to us is that they could let the Tories through by taking votes away from us in marginal constituencies,' the party said. 'But on the whole they're just a distraction.' However, a sizeable part of Labour's effort is being devoted to the Glasgow Govan constituency which Mr Jim Sillars, deputy leader of the SNP, won from Labour in a big by-election upset in 1988. This is one of four places where Labour is unveiling an 'ad-mobile', a truck carrying a large advertisement. The others are Ayr and Stirling where the Tories have slim majorities and Edinburgh, where Labour hopes to win two seats.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (9): Wagons-Lits is a test case - Banking and finance commission BELGIAN corporate life has never really rediscovered the excitement of 1988, when Carlo De Benedetti launched his audacious but unsuccessful hostile bid for Societe Generale de Belgique, the country's largest holding company. That may be a disappointment to Brussels brokers, but it is a cause of some satisfaction to Jean-Louis Duplat, chairman of Belgium's bid watchdog, the banking and finance commission. Mr Duplat - responsible for vetting takeover documents and listing particulars under 1989 takeover legislation - would like to see the sluggish Brussels bourse livened up, but only by legitimate and fair means. The 1989 legislation has made it impossible for wily predators such as De Benedetti to creep up on their targets. Stakes of 5 per cent or more have to be declared - Mr De Benedetti built up more than 15 per cent before revealing his plans - and all shareholders are supposed to be informed equally of a large investor's intentions. 'People now know what they can do and what they must not do,' says Mr Duplat. Unfortunately, not everybody agrees with him. The stake declaration demands seem to be working well, with many large companies choosing to enforce tougher disclosure requirements at the 3 per cent level. But there has been much criticism of the banking commission over its interpretation of the law on the launching of a full takeover bid. Unlike the British takeover code, or the draft EC takeover directive, Belgium has no set threshold above which a bid must be launched. Instead, a bid is triggered if a premium is paid for control of a company. The problem lies in defining 'control'. Attention has focused on Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism group which has just been taken over by Accor, the French hotels company, in collaboration with Societe Generale de Belgique. Minority shareholders claim the Accor offer document reveals that control of Wagons-Lits actually changed hands when La Generale and Accor bought a joint stake in the group at a much higher price in 1990. They say the full bid should have been launched at the higher price and have taken Accor to court to argue the case. A ruling is expected this month and could have significant implications for minority shareholders in Belgium and beyond. The banking commission is at the centre of the row, mainly because Accor and La Generale have defended themselves by pointing out that the commission approved both the original purchase and their bid. Mr Duplat will not comment, except to say that joint control is not the same as having a 'common attitude' to the management of a company and to point out that the commission's action has been fully explained - as required under the law - in its annual report. Whichever way the case goes, market analysts question whether the commission is equipped to carry out the job it is supposed to do. Mr Duplat argues that the increase in 'quality' staff - from 150 four years ago to about 230 now - is sufficient to cope with the added burden of supervision. 'We want to be able to intervene efficiently at the right moment in serious cases, but not to get mixed up with bureaucracy, which helps nobody,' he says. The commission has also been criticised for not having any real weapons at its disposal. In really serious cases, where the commission's published 'opinion' is ignored, the watchdog can only resort to the courts. Mr Duplat, on the other hand, does not want the banking commission to become a strong-armed Belgian Securities and Exchange Commission: 'I don't think it would be useful to transform ourselves into a super-gendarmerie, independent of the courts,' he says. Ironically, however, it will be the court's decision on the Wagons-Lits case which will decide how seriously the commission is taken by its clients in future.</p>

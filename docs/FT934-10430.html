			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / People: Turning a new page at Pentos Bill McGrath (right), currently deputy chairman of Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, is to be the next chief executive at Pentos, Britain's second largest bookseller. Five weeks ago it announced its first ever losses and passed its interim dividend. McGrath, a self-made businessman with a reputation for being 'tough but fair', will succeed the outspoken Terry Maher, who was responsible for building Pentos into an important retailing force encompassing Dillons and Hatchards bookshops, the Ryman stationery and office equipment supplier and Athena posters. He formally retired as chairman and chief executive yesterday making way for Sir Kit McMahon, former Midland Bank chairman, to take over as chairman. Sir Kit, who became deputy chairman at the end of September, will provide continuity between the outgoing and incoming chief executives but is eventually expected to make way for a new non-executive chairman. McGrath, 53, began his working life as a trainee catering officer with Cunard Steamship Company in 1956, becoming deputy chief hotel officer before leaving Cunard in 1968. He is reported to have become a wine expert while working for Asda, initially as buying controller for wines and spirits, and joined Comet as managing director of its Timberland subsidiary in the early 1980s. Between 1985 and 1987 he was chief executive of Builders Mate, a company he founded and eventually sold to Wickes. At Wickes he was appointed chief executive of Wickes Building supplies, the UK-based retail chain, and assumed responsibility for Wickes Continental and Malden Timber in 1991. Last year he became group managing director and was promoted to his current post last month; he is expected to take up the new one by the beginning of January. (See Observer)</p>

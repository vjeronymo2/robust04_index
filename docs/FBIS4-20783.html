			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Chandra Shekhar Sees Threat From GATT"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The former Prime Minister and  Samajwadi Janata Party leader, Mr. Chandra Shekhar, today  reiterated his opposition to the new economic policies and  threatened to launch a campaign against the new GATT (General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) regulations throughout the  country. To begin with, the party will hold a rally in the  Capital on March 18, the concluding day of the Budget session of  Parliament.    Addressing a press conference here today, Mr. Chandra  Shekhar  said the Government's acceptance in principle of the new GATT  regulation was a logical culmination of the policy of  liberalisation initiated in the early Eighties. Dismissing the  contention by senior Ministers that the Government's  representatives in the Uruguay Round had done their best, Mr.  Chandra Shekhar said the new regulations would "jeopardise the  nation's sovereignty and integrity."    Seeking to draw parallels with the experience of the former  Soviet Union, Mr. Chandra Shekhar said the pressures form the  industrialised West could even lead to the "disintegration of  the country."    "Nowhere has the surrender of sovereignty been so total and  the sacrifice of national interest so brazen as in the case of  the Government agreeing to the Dunkel Draft."    Stressing the need for popular resistance to the Government,  Mr. Chandra Shekhar said that while he welcomed all shades of  political opinion in the resistance movement, he wanted the BJP  (Bharatiya Janata Party) to be kept away. "Their swadeshi slogan  now and their total support to the new economic policies when it  was announced in Parliament do not get along with each other,"  he added.    Referring to the Janata Dal, the former Prime Minister  sought  to blame the V.P. Singh camp for having rejected his appeal for  unity of the Dals. Asked whether he would participate in the  `gherao of Parliament' proposed by the Janata Dal, the former  Prime Minister answered in the negative.    Mr. Chandra Shekhar made it plain today that since the  Janata  Dal had rejected the Ghaziabad unity proposal of the various Dal  factions, he was left with the only option of reviving his  Samajwadi Janata Party.</p>

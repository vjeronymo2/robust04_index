A few hours  before boarding the plane that was to take him to the peninsula  that is dominated in the north by a red dictator and the south  by a strongarm capitalist regime, as well as to the lands of an  uncertain but nevertheless much eulogized Chinese model, Mr. Ion  Iliescu strengthened the bolts and screws of the state mechanism  with one energetic key move. Prime Minister Vacaroiu tried in an  expansive statement to convey the message that the reshuffle was  according to his proposals. He could convince no one. The  reshuffle is a move that obviously reflects the will of the  president and the people who surround him, made exactly at a  time when the voyage to faraway countries demanded that a  tranquilizer be administered to the public that stays at home  and to the others who were stimulated by the desire to govern.  It was also a fortifier for the muscles of the central  administration.    The fact that the reshuffle was carried out in haste is also  seen from the given situation that, except for the defense  minister, no rotations could be found for any of the former  dignitaries. The improvisation from this viewpoint is very  clear. In order to assuage Petre Ninosu's indignation, they  quickly turned to a formula that is typical of the old regime --  namely, "he will be assigned to the Senate," as if appointing  people to the Senate would still be decided in Office Number One  and Office Number Two [reference to Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu].    After so many negotiations, delays, and euphemisms, the  hasty  reshuffle suggests an action carried out under conditions of  great irritation. One can speculate quite a bit about the  reasons for this irritation. In any event, the public attacks  to which many heads of the current political life were submitted  was not the most upsetting thing, since the changes rather  satisfy than discourage the slanderer nationalism. However, it  would not be an exaggeration to assume that the journalistic  performance, as well as the misdemeanor, to listen to the  president's telephone and disclose the stenogram of the talks  without any other obvious political reason but to simply make  noise and show "who knocks out whom?" seem to somehow be  connected with the only concrete and threatening declaration  gathered from the new dignitaries -- namely, the statement made  by the justice minister. In one of his states of strictness,  which draws water to both the mill of sympathizers and the  rivals, the president seems to have been insistent in his wish  to demonstrate "who knocks out whom?" especially before the long  journey.    The way in which the reshuffle was carried out -- compared  to  the previous declarations of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of  Romania] leaders, with the effort to pretend holding a dialogue  with various political forces and the entire current driving  force of the country -- makes us assume that the government  changes have been carried out not only with a formal  consultation of the prime minister but also over the heads of  those who made calculations and competition within the ruling  party. Not to accept this interpretation means to assume that  the PDSR is a much too conspiring formula and much too  hypocritical for an important party in a real democracy.    Still, there is a common element between the president and  the party -- the continuously monocolor character of the  government. In the light of the same relationship between the  party and the president, one should also think of the very  serious declaration made by [former Defense Minister] General  Spiroiu upon leaving the cabinet: "I can tell you that the Army  is under political control."    As a matter of fact, we are not just talking about the Army  but all the levers of state authority. That can be seen by  anyone who is looking at the list of portfolios that have been  rotated. The official declaration of the president to the  effect that the goal of the changes was to accelerate the reform  process, curb inflation, and stabilize economic life in general  sound either superficial or cynical. In this context, even the  transportation department appears significant under a strategic  rather than economic aspect. Thus, there is no doubt that the  goal of this reshuffle -- the same goal that has been pursued  for a long time now -- was to strengthen authority through a new  act of authority.    Also in accordance with a more general style, certain  appearances are also kept for those people abroad, especially  when deciding on those changes that might acquire a European  significance, when, in reality, all they do is satisfy internal  political calculations. Here is just one example: the reference  to the number of civilians who took the seat of generals is  exaggerated when one thinks of the absence of any reference to  the large file of incomplete legislation compared with the  European legislation. And all this, when one of the four  changes refers exactly to a "specialized" minister.    Smiling in a diplomatic way toward other countries, the  political behavior of our president also seems connected with  the hidden thought "who knocks out whom?"</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL FALLS VICTIM TO OLD WAYS OF EX-COACH  </P> <P> One of the major adjustments Brian Newhall made when he took over for Bill  Westphal as basketball coach at Occidental College was to all but abolish the  3-point shot upon which the Tigers relied so heavily last season.  </P> <P> Westphal left to take the coaching job at Grand Canyon College in Arizona, and,  as evidenced by his team's 88-80 win over the Tigers in the championship game  of the Occidental tournament Saturday night, he maintains his affection for the  perimeter shot.  </P> <P> Antelope guard Darryl Williford, who scored a game-high 27 points, accounted  for 7 of Grand Canyon's 11 baskets from 3-point range. Although Williford was  consistently deadly from long range -- often releasing missiles from 5 to 8  feet beyond the 3-point stripe -- Occidental fans persisted in chanting  "Shoot!" when he touched the ball.  </P> <P> "We wanted those guys to shut up," Newhall said of the taunters.  </P> <P> Occidental trailed by 20, 74-54, with 7 minutes to play when it mounted an  impressive rally led by senior forward John Keister.  </P> <P> Keister scored 9 points and Jon Crawley and Ethan Caldwell also scored as  Occidental ran off a 14-2 spurt in a span of 3 minutes to trim the deficit to  76-68.  </P> <P> But with 4:13 to play, Chris Anderson, the Tigers' 6-foot 10-inch center who  scored a team-high 22 points, fouled out.  </P> <P> The momentum did not immediately swing in the Antelopes' favor, however, as  Caldwell converted a 3-point shot and Crawley added a turnaround jump shot from  the free-throw line. Caldwell then buried a 12-foot baseline jump shot with  2:25 to play to cut the deficit to 81-75. But the flurry came too late as the  Tigers were unable to catch Grand Canyon down the stretch.  </P> <P> Craig Johnson scored 15 points and Mike Ledbetter added 10 for Grand Canyon,  which led at halftime, 45-35. The Antelopes led by as many as 15 points in the  first half before Occidental mounted a short rally midway through the half.  Williford made 5 3-point baskets in the first half.  </P></p>

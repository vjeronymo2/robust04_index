"Now is the time for the cabinet and ruling parties to act  as  one in order to do their utmost to get the (fiscal 1994) budget  passed," SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference.    He said he wants a cabinet reshuffle to be timed after the  Diet approves the budget, possibly around April or later, rather  than at the end of this month.    Murayama denied, however, the SDPJ will withdraw from the  coalition if a cabinet reshaping counters his viewpoint.    Coalition sources said Hosokawa plans to reorganize his six-  month-old cabinet around next Monday after passage of the third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, ending March 31.    The SDPJ is the largest contingent in Hosokawa's seven-party  coalition, which toppled the Liberal Democratic Party from power  last August for the first time in 38 years.</p>

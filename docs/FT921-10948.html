			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: For some, marginal tax rates are already 59% Sir, To relate maximum tax rates to a present rate of 40 per cent ignores the charge on family income for those whose children are students at college. The 'parental contribution' imposes an additional tax at 18.75 per cent on the joint income of both parents. Thus, the present marginal rate of tax on income is almost 59 per cent. Under Labour proposals, the marginal rate of tax would be 78 per cent. The government imposed a massive increase in tax in the 1988 budget when it abolished any tax saving from covenants for students. Overnight, family costs increased by up to about Pounds 2,000 a year. Additionally, families lose child allowance of about Pounds 700 a year at the time when costs rise to their highest level. R D Harman, 3 Fountain Cottages, Odnall Lane, Clent, Stourbridge DY9 9PU</p>

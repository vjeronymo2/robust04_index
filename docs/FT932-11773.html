			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / GM nears plant deal for Poland GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle maker, expects to reach a final agreement by mid-May to begin low volume car assembly in Poland. Separately the group is planning to cut around 2,500 jobs at its plants in Germany, Belgium and the UK in response to the steep fall in west European new car sales. Mr Jack Smith, GM president, said that agreement had been reached 'on all aspects' of the group's plan to assemble its Opel Astra in Warsaw in a joint venture with FSO, the Polish state-owned carmaker. 'These understandings need to be incorporated into the draft final agreement, which can be done quickly,' he said following a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. In the first stage of the project GM is planning to assemble up to 10,000 Opel Astras a year in Poland. GM will send car bodies from its assembly plant at Antwerp, Belgium for final trim and assembly in Warsaw. GM plans to invest around DM30m (Pounds 12m) for the first stage of the project. It will have management control of the joint venture in which FSO is expected to have a holding of 20-25 per cent. In a second stage GM could move later to full assembly of car kits in Warsaw including body welding, when capacity would be increased to 33,000 a year. GM Europe said yesterday that pilot production could start in Warsaw by the end of the year with volume production beginning by the spring of 1994. Separately GM and FSO are negotiating a technical assistance agreement for the US carmaker to support FSO in the updating of its existing production of the ageing Polonez range, and GM is also planning to assist in the development of components suppliers in Poland. Mr Waclaw Niewiarowski, Polish minister of industry, said that the government had agreed to compensate GM for the high unit costs of the initial low volume car assembly, possibly through a reduction of the vehicle excise tax rate. In west Europe, Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said it was planning to cut 1,700 jobs by the end of the year at its plants at Bochum, Kaiserslautern and Russelsheim in response to the sharp fall in west European new car sales. At the end of March the company had 52,400 employees.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: CAN THEY TALK? YES -- JUST DON'T EXPECT FAIRNESS  </P> <P> "This is crazy! Why aren't these people in jail?"  </P> <P> Joan Rivers is incredulous. She is outraged. And no wonder. She has just heard  three divorced parents charge on her syndicated talk show that their young  children had been sexually abused while in the court-ordered custody of the  other parent.  </P> <P> Each has told Rivers a similar story of a separate cold, indifferent judge who  had ignored or rejected the evidence presented by the "good" parent and  perpetuated a child's stay with the "bad" parent. In effect, America is told,  this was court-mandated sexual abuse.  </P> <P> Rivers is beside herself. Her face twisted into an expression of intense  suffering, she demands to know: "What's going on here?"  </P> <P> Court is what's going on here. Talk Show Court, a TV phenomenon of the '80s  that's seeping into the '90s.  </P> <P> Lose in real court? Take your case to the more sympathetic Talk Show Court.  Clowns like Zsa Zsa do it, serious people, too. No Judge Wapners here. In this  court, the talk show host is a hanging judge who hears what you have to say,  commiserates, then convicts and passes sentence on the other side without  hearing the other side. On occasions like this -- when the accused is given no  opportunity to respond to charges against them -- Rivers is a one-person lynch  mob.  </P> <P> But she's not alone.  </P> <P> At various times, and in various degrees, all the major daytime talk shows  employ this tactic, especially during their frequent forays into volatile  topicality. When not featuring transvestites, these shows are revolving wheels  of adult rape and child abuse, with the consoling host invariably lending a  sympathetic ear and siding with the underdog accuser. Nice and neat.  </P> <P> Getting both sides can be a little messy. But isn't that what fairness is  about?  </P> <P> Of all the hosts, only Phil Donahue has the inclination as well as the skills  and temperament to play devil's advocate occasionally in lieu of both sides  being present. And give Geraldo Rivera credit for sometimes pointing out that  viewers are hearing only one side. Too often, however, he'll then go on to  present only that one side, hence little is gained.  </P> <P> Sally Jessy Raphael is notorious for having unbalanced shows on significant  topics. And so is Oprah Winfrey. Their sincerity isn't in question, only their  judgment in the way they sometimes approach their jobs.  </P> <P> Now Winfrey puts on some great shows, for example. Her recent session with  Truddi Chase -- a tormented woman said to have 92 separate personalities -- was  an incredible hour that was infinitely more compelling than ABC's two-part  drama about Chase. Winfrey was a warm and compassionate sponge, perfect for  this occasion. When other occasions call for a different sort of host, however,  wrong number.  </P> <P> These talk show hosts grind out so many programs that there isn't time for them  to be adequately briefed on some of the complex topics they deal with. So you  have the impression -- especially in the case of Rivers, whose magazine format  affords her even less time with each subject -- that they frequently go in  almost cold.  </P> <P> There's no harm when the subject is trivial. On this conveyor belt, however,  the dancing poodle is followed by the rape victim or vice versa.  </P> <P> Thus, today's talk show host is an extension of an even bigger TV phenomenon,  the blurring of news and entertainment. These afternoon talk shows are not the  land of Johnny Carson or Arsenio Hall, where amusement is the primary goal.  This is the land of the entertainer/journalist who wears almost as many hats as  Truddi Chase has personalities.  </P> <P> The trend has roots in another age. That Edward R. Murrow's reputation as the  icon of CBS News is chiseled in granite, for example, ignores his six-year  stint in the 1950s as arm-chair host of the chatty CBS series "Person to  Person," which was the grandfather of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."  </P> <P> We have also the tradition of the network morning shows, where the news and  funnies have been merging for years, where NBC's "Today," for example, calls  upon Deborah Norville to interview both Daniel Noriega and Miss Piggy.  </P> <P> Then, too, we have the tradition of the socialite journalist pioneered on TV by  Barbara Walters. You can catch her on ABC having serious sit-downs with world  leaders or singing and dancing with celebrities. And now Connie Chung seems  determined to carve a similar niche for herself on CBS.  </P> <P> Somehow, however, the stakes seem higher on talk shows, where heavy topics are  too often mangled by hosts who are essentially entertainers, with enlightenment  and fairness becoming a casualty.  </P> <P> The miscasting boggles. Journalist Joan Rivers? This is crazy.  </P></p>

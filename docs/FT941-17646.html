			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: A simpler, more elegant design on life. . .  -The design industry is forsaking the superficial, elitist style of the 1980s There have been pointers in the wind for a long time. As the 1980s wound down and the biggest economic boom petered out, one of the most surprising casualties of the recession turned out to be the design industry. As it had always been received wisdom that the design industry was just what we needed to lead us out of the recession this was superficially very bad news. In fact it soon became clear that in most cases the design industry had been the architect of its own fall from grace. By and large it had failed at what it was supposed to be good at - tapping into the psychology of society, meeting its subtlest needs, being a proper conduit for its true interests. There is a direct link, as Nigel Whiteley points out in a thoughtful book* on the subject between a 'society's design and its social health: design is a manifestation of the social, political and economic situation'. What seemed to happen in the UK in the 1980s is that design let us down. It began to deal in shallower, more ephemeral precepts and came to stand for what Whiteley calls 'professional middle-class taste masquerading as ethically superior 'good' taste'. So even though the recession had a huge part to play in the decline of the status of design and designers, there was much, much more to it than that. It was not just that many of us had run out of money, it was a rejection of what the design industry stood for, for the values we thought it projected. Not, of course, that it is fair to blame the design world alone. Several designers and design writers were deeply concerned about their role and where current practice was taking them, long before the recession began. Whiteley quotes Jeremy Myerson, a design writer, saying that design had come to be used as a 'weapon of exclusivity, of segmentation - the means by which many desirable goods and services are put out of reach of large sections of the community'. One has only to think of once utilitarian, functional items which were so re-designed and packaged as to put them beyond the reach of many who might need them - Alessi kettles, Phillippe Starck lemon squeezers, Versace silk shirts, designer-labelled handbags - to realise the truth of what he says. In many cases the redesign offered no technical improvement - an Alessi kettle functions no better than a Russell Hobbs but it became a cult object because of its superficial styling and high price. The designer FHK Henrion joined in the debate, attacking the notion of design as a tool for 'the yuppy fun of a moneyed minority' declaring that 'the designer's place in the economy is of crucial importance but his place in society is no less so'. While many of us in the west were engaged in a merry spending spree much of the third world looked on aghast - not just with disapproval at our frivolous ways but also filled with fear at how these values might overwhelm their own culture and way of life. Whitely quotes Ashoke Chatterjee, adviser to India's National Institute of Design, saying that he sees the common denominator in design from the west as 'one of affluence and obsolescence, the catering to inconsistent whims which spell high profit . . . the concept of real need is . . . replaced with the image of design as the five-star life-style.' He also quotes that splendid economist-philosopher EF Schumacher: 'What is at stake is not economics but culture; not the standard of living but the quality of life.' In other words, it is hard to overstate the role of designers - how very much it matters that they get it right and how deeply we feel let down when they get it wrong. So what we see around us now is not just people who are less well off than they were, but people who view the world differently. It is not just that we have lost confidence in the ability of the design industry to provide the solutions, the industry is now perceived to be part of the problem, perpetuating values we no longer accept. In our daily lives all of this is expressed, often at a subconscious level, in a seeking out of simpler things and simpler ways of living. And this is expressed not just in clothes or in houses but it invades all aspects of our lives. On the fashion front (as Brenda Polan reports here) the old formality has been loosened up, lightness, a lack of stuffiness is all. And so it is in interiors. Who, for instance, could have imagined, in the middle of the 1980s that a series of books on life's props called Chic Simple* (about the first of which - on the home - I wrote last June) would be a runaway success? Who would have imagined that in the hothouse world of interior design, where the excesses of the 1980s were most exuberant, these simple guides purveying the notion that modest things can give pleasure and be just as useful as expensive things, would prove to signal a serious new direction? Chic Simple provides the manuals, the visual inspiration, as well as the hard practical information for this new way of living. It is big on quotations from almost all the design greats. Here we have Elsie de Wolfe, the gifted American interior decorator (perhaps it is relevant to note that she began her career as an interior decorator around the turn of the century when many were beginning to tire of musty, over-crowded Victorian interiors): 'When I am asked to decorate a new house, my first thought is suitability. My next thought is proportion. Always I keep in mind the importance of simplicity.' Simplicity should not be confused with austerity. 'Light, air and comfort - these things I must always have in a room,' she said. 'We must learn to recognise suitability, simplicity, and proportion, and apply our knowledge to our needs.' Simple should never mean dull. De Wolfe, for instance, was a master of restraint as well as panache. At the time, it seems, her rooms were considered practically barren in comparison to the turn-of-the-century norm but looking at photographs of them now they seem to me to exude a high glamour that no over-stuffed Victorian interior ever did. Simple should mean fewer things but better quality and above all should never be confused with cheapness. In the Chic Simple tome on clothes tribute is paid to many classics that qualify as simple but are certainly not cheap. The Trench Coat - the Burberry, of course, what else? - reeking as it does of 'espionage, mystery, loners in the mist, drama and intrigue' gets star billing along with the humble white T-shirt, denim, the blazer, the plimsoll and cashmere ('cashmere is a tempting investment, as it provides thermal control without bulk and feels luxurious'). This is a philosophy, an approach to living that transcends time barriers. De Wolfe, born in 1870, would have been perfectly at one with Terence Riley, Director of Architecture and Design at New York's Museum of Modern Art who believed 'An anonymously made Pyrex container is about good design as much as an Alvar Aalto vase.' And both of them would have been in tune with Micky Drexler, president of The Gap, when he says 'Good taste shouldn't have to cost anything extra.' Not a bad motto for the coming year might be the Australian Aboriginal saying which has been adopted by Chic Simple as its leitmotif: 'The more you know, the less you need.' * Design For Society by Nigel Whiteley, published by Reaction Books, Pounds 16.95. * Chic Simple: Home; Chic Simple: Clothes, Pounds 12.95.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eleven NCUA commenters, including a national trade association commenter, like many FRB commenters, expressed concern about potential violations for failing to disclose as a bonus early in the year an individual item of de minimis value deemed to be a bonus when aggregated with another de minimis item given in a separate promotional program involving the same account later in the year. Comment 2(f)&hyph;5 provides guidance about aggregating only the market value of items offered for the same promotional program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven commenters, including a national trade association commenter, inquired whether the provision of free share drafts or checks would be considered a bonus. After consultation with the FRB, NCUA has clarified that provision of free share drafts or checks, whether provided to all members, or only to certain groups, such as minors or seniors, would be considered the waiver of a fee and not a bonus. This is reflected in comment 2(f)&hyph;6(ii). Another commenter requested that free meals given to the membership at an annual meeting be included as an example of a bonus, however, under &sect;707.2(r), such items are considered ``non-dividend membership benefits.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asked that the Board clarify whether the granting of a higher dividend rate on an account if the member elects or uses certain services offered by the credit union (i.e., ATM card, direct deposit, other packaged or linked account terms) would not be considered a bonus, based on the exclusion of dividends from the definition of bonus. The Board confirms this in comment 2(f)&hyph;6(vii). Nor, based on definitional reasons, would such higher dividends be considered an extraordinary dividend; this is confirmed in comment 2(m)&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Dividend and Dividends <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has clarified in comment 2(i)&hyph;1, that state law determines the nature of an account for state-chartered credit unions. This was generated in response to two commenters requesting clarification regarding whether federal or state law determined the nature (share or deposit) of accounts offered by state-chartered credit unions. The Board stresses that this is solely a matter of state law, as expressed in state statutes, regulations, interpretive orders, or by any other official means. NCUA will not involve itself in determinations of whether an account offered by a state-chartered credit union is a share or deposit account, but will rely upon applicable state law and the opinion of the relevant state supervisory authority. Similar changes were made in comments 2(p)&hyph;1 and 2, concerning the definition of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten commenters, including one national trade association, lamented that FCUs would not be able to offer fixed-rate accounts, due to the dividend rate setting process described in comment 2(i)&hyph;1 through 3. The NCUA Board wishes to stress that part 707 does not require FCUs to offer only variable-rate accounts. FCUs may offer fixed-rate accounts as long as the FCU, by contract, agrees to give at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases in the initially disclosed dividend rate. However, like a prospective rate set on a variable-rate account, if FCUs offer a fixed-rate account, the NCUA Board believes that, as discussed in comment 2(i)&hyph;3, every effort should be made in order to pay the prospective fixed-rate disclosed. The fact that a prospective rate is disclosed on a fixed-rate account, instead of a variable-rate account, does not change the nature of the dividend setting process for share accounts. To clarify this point, language has been added to comment 2(i)&hyph;1. Nor does NCUA believe that it is appropriate to counsel credit unions to make their accounts variable-rate, as opposed to fixed-rate accounts, as requested by a few commenters. The NCUA Board has no intention of limiting flexibility available under TISA and Part 707; the number, type, and terms of accounts are decisions within the proper province of each credit union's board of directors and not the federal government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten commenters believed that proposed comment 2(i)&hyph;2 promulgated a substantive federal dividend-setting process methodology for all credit unions. The comment is set forth as guidance only, and was not meant to substantively alter any contrary state laws. Therefore, the Board has modified the final comment to use nondirective language. In addition, sample dividend-setting resolutions are also provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4, to provide guidance to the boards' of directors of credit unions. The resolution provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4(i) may be used when the dividend rate is declared after the close of a dividend period. The resolution provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4(ii) may be used when the dividend rate is prospectively set before the close of the dividend period in question, but will be ratified upon the occurrence of certain conditions at the close of the dividend period. Both resolutions contemplate that a list or table of accounts followed by corresponding dividend rates will be attached to the resolution. This will prevent credit unions from having to adopt a separate resolution for each account type. These resolutions are not required, but are provided as guidance of the proper corporate form to be used in declaring dividends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nine commenters, including a national trade association commenter, questioned the guidance provided by proposed comment 2(i)&hyph;3, which stated that prospective rates may be altered ``if sufficient funds are not available, or in the event of a superseding event, such as a significant fluctuation in market rates, natural disaster or emergency that alters the assumptions under which the `prospective rates' were made.'' The commenters questioned the legality and prudence of the proposed comment. Two commenters supported the comment. Basically, NCUA proposed the comment in reference to natural disasters, such as the recent California earthquake that destroyed several credit union offices, resulting in extraordinary expenditures that reduced current and undivided earnings, therefore lessening the amount of funds from which dividends are properly payable. To provide general guidance to credit unions affected by disasters and similar situations, in order to reflect the unique nature of the dividend setting process, and to provide commentary protection in the rare event that a credit union may need to lower a dividend in response to a natural or man-made disaster, NCUA has retained the comment, as revised. It is the intention of the Board that credit unions make every effort to meet the disclosed prospective rates on accounts when such rates are properly declarable, available, and payable, and this guidance has also been added to comment 2(i)&hyph;3. However, the NCUA Board disagrees with the position taken by the commenters that NCUA could alter applicable legal principles and agency interpretations on the proper payment of dividends. The questioned statement reflects long-standing NCUA interpretations of section 117 of the FCU Act for federal credit unions, and is supported by well-grounded general corporate law in regards to dividends, as expressed in legal encyclopedias, hornbooks and other sources. Although NCUA believes that the statement would also be applicable for many state-chartered credit unions, since applicable state law controls the dividend process for state-chartered credit unions, this clarification has also been added to the comment. For further information on dividends, and when they are properly payable, NCUA refers state-chartered credit unions and their members to relevant state law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (j) Dividend Declaration Date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

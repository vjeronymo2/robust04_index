			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Austin Reed in the black at Pounds 527,000 IMPROVED turnover and margins in its UK shops helped Austin Reed, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 527,000 for the 28 weeks ended August 14 1993, compared with losses of Pounds 430,000. Turnover amounted to Pounds 29.3m against Pounds 28.4m. Directors stated that the manufacturing business 'fared less well as recession abroad took hold, though it too experienced an improvement in UK sales'. Earnings per share were 1.1p (1p losses) while the interim dividend is lifted to 2p, up from 1.83p adjusted for June's scrip issue which compensated the ordinary shareholders for the enfranchisement of the non-voting shareholders.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: Dark clouds over the holiday beaches - Wall Street WALL Street's dealing and investing community headed off to the beaches for the long holiday weekend yesterday with plenty on their minds. If anything is going to spoil their enjoyment of the Independence Day celebrations it is the state of the economy. A string of data released this week underlined the fragility of the recovery. On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management published its June report on nation wide manufacturing activity. The NAPM index fell below 50 for the first time in more than a year. When the it drops below 50, it generally means that the manufacturing sector is contracting. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported a decline in consumer confidence during June. President Bill Clinton's planned tax increases seem to have persuaded consumers to keep their spending in check, at least until they know how exactly much more the Federal government will be taking from their pay packets. Finally, yesterday the Labor department released its June employment report, and it made for gloomy reading. Non-farm payrolls rose by a meagre 13,000 last month, well short of the 130,000 to 150,000 increase forecast by Wall Street economists. Although the rise in the national unemployment rate, from 6.9 per cent to 7.0 per cent, was expected, investors still did not appreciate the sight, more than a year after the recession ended, of a rising jobless rate. At first glance, the employment data turned interest rate forecasting on its head. For most of this year, the markets have assumed that the next move in rates would be upward, as the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy to curb inflation. Yet, the June report appears to rule out any tightening, at least for the near term, and it may even herald a policy easing. Those economists who have bravely stuck to their predictions that the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate move would be down rather than up, must have felt vindicated by the jobs data. The chances of an interest rate cut, however, remain slim. The June report was not wholly negative - April and May payroll figures were both revised upwards to show increases of 255,000 and 215,000, respectively. The upward revisions led some analysts to warn that the small June increase may prove to be a freakish number, possibly skewed by the fact that the survey upon which the payroll figures were based was taken unusually early in the month. Labor department statisticians said this meant a substantial number of June hirings may have been missed, new jobs that could turn up in the July data. Government number-crunchers, however, seem to have an answer for everything. The big picture is quite clear - the labour market is not as robust as it should be at this stage of a recovery. Consequently, the June jobs report could still force the Fed to reconsider its recent decision to shift the emphasis of monetary policy towards a tightening. Analysts believe it is possible that the central bank will return the emphasis of its policy back to a neutral stance. Such a move would be good news for equities, because it would remove the immediate threat of higher interest rates. It has been the favourable interest rate environment, more than any other factor, that has propelled stocks upwards over the past two years, so more of the same should ensure that, at the least, equities hold their ground. This is exactly what stock prices did this week - hold their ground, although in a rather roundabout way. On Monday, the Dow jumped 40 points, buoyed by the latest rally in Treasury prices, which took bond yields to new lows. Then stocks turned tail, gradually at first, then rapidly, after the June employment report was released. By midday yesterday, Monday's 40-point burst had been completely wiped out, and the Dow was back where it started the week, hovering around 3,490. That is 65 points short of its all-time high (set on May 27), but still registering a respectable 6.7 per cent gain for the year. While the domestic news was almost all bad, there was one important piece of foreign news this week that, over the longer-term, should be good for equities: Thursday's cut in German interest rates. Although the half-point reduction in the discount rate was less than dramatic, it was better than nothing and, by most accounts, much needed. The US can only hope that the Bundesbank's easing will help drag Germany, and the rest of Europe, out of recession, in the process reviving US exports to the region. At the moment, the US economy needs all the help it can get.  ----------------------------------- Monday      3530.20  +  39.31 Tuesday     3518.88  -  11.35 Wednesday   3516.08  -  2.77 Thursday    3510.54  -  5.54 Friday      3483.97  -  26.57  -----------------------------------</p>

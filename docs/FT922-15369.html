			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hanson sells Beazer to US offshoot HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, last night announced that Beazer, its wholly-owned subsidiary, has been sold to one of Hanson's US offshoots as part of the refinancing of Beazer's substantial debt. Beazer was taken over by Hanson last September, just before it was to float its UK businesses on the Stock Exchange to enable it to meet obligations to its banks and make a repayment of Dollars 600m (Pounds 347m) in March 1992. Beazer's US businesses, which consist of the production of sand, gravel and aggregates, have now been pledged to Hanson's US banks as security for Beazer's debt. In order to do this Beazer has been transferred to the Hanson US subsidiary for Dollars 91m cash and the assumption of Dollars 100m debt. Hanson was obliged by the Stock Exchange to announce the move since the listing of Beazer's 8 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock is to be maintained.</p>

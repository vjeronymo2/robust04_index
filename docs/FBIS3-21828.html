			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Basilio Quesada Chanto] </F>   [Text] The Technical Customs Investigations Division (DITA)  is investigating the suspicious importation of large quantities  of isopropyl alcohol [alcohol hidropropilico] not only for  possible fiscal irregularities but also for potential links to  drug trafficking activities.    This chemical substance presumably can be used to process  cocaine, "crack," and other drugs, thus DITA personnel suspect  that a cocaine laboratory may be operating in the country.  According to the police report, this type of alcohol, which was  presumably shipped from El Salvador, cannot be used for medical  or industrial (liquor production) purposes. Furthermore, it is  described as a solvent on the list of suspected precursor  chemicals.    DITA grew even more suspicious when Costa Rican authorities  called the Salvadoran firm noted as the shipper on the customs  entry document, and the firm said it does not distribute that  type of product.    DITA will coordinate the case with the Government and Public  Security Ministry's national drug control directorate as there  is enough evidence to suggest that a cocaine laboratory is  behind the importing firm. The latter is believed to be a ghost  company as it does not have any physical location or personnel  to handle the alcohol it has brought into the country. The  company has imported more than 40,000 liters of isopropyl  alcohol from October 1993 to date. The final destination of the  chemical is unknown.</p>

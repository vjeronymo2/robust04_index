			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LOADED PISTOL ON FLOOR OF HIS CAR GETS A'S CANSECO ARRESTED IN SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics was arrested Friday on a campus of the  University of California for investigation of carrying a loaded gun, police  said.  </P> <P> Canseco, the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1988, was "totally  cooperative" when arrested by campus police at 1:40 p.m. as he returned to his  sports car after an examination of his injured wrist at the university's Laurel  Heights campus, Lt. Mark Kurtz said.  </P> <P> The A's right fielder, who is out of the lineup for at least three more weeks,  was booked at the Hall of Justice for investigation of possession of a loaded  firearm on university property, a felony, Kurtz said.  </P> <P> Canseco, 24, was released several hours later, after his wife, Esther, posted  $5,000 bail.  </P> <P> A passerby attracted to Canseco's red Jaguar in the school's parking lot  noticed the fully loaded 9mm automatic handgun lying on the floor in the  driver's side of the locked car, Kurtz said.  </P> <P> Police could find no permit on file with the state allowing Canseco to carry a  weapon but are continuing their investigation.  </P> <P> After the passerby reported the gun, "We went out, and an officer  investigated," Kurtz said. "We ran the plate and found out who the registered  owner was. We checked the visitor entry log and found he was at the facility.  We waited until his appointment was over and waited until he came out to his  car and arrested him."  </P> <P> On Jan. 21, a traveling companion of Canseco's was arrested at a Detroit  airport for trying to board a flight with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol in his  briefcase.  </P></p>

They confirmed that  Brasilia is a new route for escaped Chinese citizens to enter  the United States. In November, three other Chinese citizens  were arrested by Federal Police in Acre State. They said they  were trying to reach Brasilia to take a plane to the United  States.    Judge Pedro Paulo Castelo Branco questioned the four  arrested  Chinese citizens. They said that they purchased their forged  passports from Cesar Bezerra Lin for $7,000. Federal Police  believe Lin is one of the leaders of a gang that forges  documents for Asians who want to travel to the United States.  The gang is headquartered in Sao Paulo. It also forges visas  and possibly identity cards. The Chinese citizens arrested in  Brasilia confessed that they were aware that the documents were  forged.    Chen Gouxing, Huang Daiyuan, Chen Gongchin, and Dong Shirong  arrived in Sao Paulo, where a man identified simply as Chou --  whom the police believe to be Cesar Lin -- helped them obtain  the documents. The four traveled to Brasilia by bus. Chen  Gongchin had a forged identity card for foreigners. Aged  between 19 and 23, and without stable jobs in their country, the  four university graduates fear being expelled from Brazil.</p>

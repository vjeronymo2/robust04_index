			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler drops 3% on rights issue terms Activity was muted yesterday as some of the Continent's markets began voting in the European elections, with others to follow on Sunday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw selective selling of senior blue chips, although there was no direct reaction to the Bundesbank's decision to hold key interest rates at their existing levels. The Dax index fell 15.88 to 2,129.32, rising slightly to an Ibis-indicated 2,131.72 by the end of the post-bourse. Turnover was unchanged at DM6bn. Dax stocks which lost most ground included Daimler, down DM22 to DM782.50 after the announcement of its rights issue terms, and Volkswagen, DM11.30 lower at DM473.50. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming Securities in Frankfurt said the sheer size of the Daimler issue, nearly DM3bn, should have affected the market as a whole. Other blue chip fallers included Linde, DM16 weaker at DM923, and RWE, DM10 cheaper at DM441. Mr Wodniok commented that it did not take a lot of selling to hit the engineer's share price; but that the utility group's shares had been unsettled for some time over the conflict between state and private shareholders regarding the future management of the RWE group. PARIS lost most of Wednesday's gains as the market remained unable to break out of its current trading range. The CAC-40 index was off 18.42 at 2,028.39 after a low of 2,011.54. Turnover was around FFr4bn. Suez dipped FFr4.50 to FFr311 as Generali, of Italy, confirmed that it had withdrawn a bid for the Groupe Victoire subsidiary. Suez has said that it would make an announcement on the future of its subsidiary by June 15. Euro Disney lost FFr1.50 to FFr34.10 as investors reacted to Wednesday's rights issue news. MILAN was overcome by technical factors ahead of next week's close of the monthly account and with the tax incentives to boost industry, announced late on Wednesday, proving in line with expectations. The Comit index fell 4.21 to 756.23 in the absence of foreign demand and with domestic funds holding back in preparation for the Ina privatisation on June 27. The insurance sector, already weakened by investors lightening holdings ahead of the flotation, was further hit by the ruling by Italy's anti-trust body fining 11 companies a total of L20bn for setting up a cartel in the non-life insurance sector. Among those to be fined, Generali lost L732 or 1.6 per cent to L44,384, Ras dipped L588 or 2 per cent to L28,350, Fondiaria fell L151 to 14,975, and Sai shed L112 to L23,421. News that Generali was withdrawing its offer for Groupe Victoire came too late to influence trading. Montedison dipped L14 to L1,466 in continuing heavy volume of 32.9m shares on profit taking after the European Union's go-ahead for the plastics joint venture with Shell. Fiat dipped back below L7,000, losing L83 to L6,922 amid some disappointment at the absence of incentives to boost car sales in the government's economic package. AMSTERDAM drifted down, the AEX index finishing off 1.24 at 405.26. Amev, the financial services group, which reported a first quarter rise in profits of 18 per cent, eased 20 cents to Fl 77.30. Nedlloyd was another of the day's losers, down 30 cents at Fl 67.50. The shipping group said that it expected further improvement in capacity on Far Eastern routes. ZURICH was lower on futures related selling and with the market hesitant ahead of today's US producer prices. The SMI index fell 23.9 to 2,777.2. Nestle continued to be actively trading, but fell SFr5 to SFr1,194, unable to hold on to a high of SFr1,210. Sandoz registered, which attracted positive comment from analysts earlier in the week, managed a further SFr2 rise to SFr720. SMH, under pressure since it said on Tuesday that it expected only modest profit growth this year, bounced SFr14 higher to SFr815 as buyers returned at the lower price and the watchmaker attracted a recommendation from one bank. COPENHAGEN made an advance for the seventh consecutive session although the KFX index was only slightly higher at 103.97, up 0.21. Tele Danmark was the session's most active issue but the B shares closed unchanged at DKr320. The food and drinks sector advanced on hopes of recovery in the economy: Danisco rose DKr6 to DKr960. WARSAW fell 5 per cent, through the psychologically important 10,000 point support level and to its lowest value this year. Concentrated speculative selling left the Wig index 509 lower at 9,712.7 amid worries that the slide would continue in coming sessions. Losers led gains by 21 to one, with two issues unchanged. TEL AVIV climbed 3.9 per cent amid heavy demand from institutional buyers taking the market's cumulative gain over the week to 5.2 per cent. The Mishtanim index rose 6.96 to 185.45. This week's performance came after a month in which the market lost almost a quarter of its value.

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Congress cold on reform of healthcare The US Congress returned to Washington yesterday, after two weeks in recess, with less appetite than ever for any kind of healthcare legislation, writes George Graham in Washington. In spite of last-minute efforts to achieve a minimal compromise that could squeeze through both chambers of Congress in the next month, there is little wind left in the sails of the reform which President Bill Clinton launched a year ago with his detailed plan to guarantee health insurance to everyone in the US. It is by no means clear that even a compromise measure could spur enough enthusiasm to pass even the Senate. Its prospects in the House of Representatives seem close to zero. The coalition that would prefer to do nothing this year includes the bulk of the Republicans - some are wary of tinkering with the healthcare industry, while others are simply determined to deny the Democrats any claims of victory - and those left-leaning Democrats who favour a national healthcare system. In purely political terms, some Democrats would prefer to give up the search for healthcare reform rather than face defeat a few weeks before the congressional elections on November 8. Most members appear convinced there is little to be gained by pressing ahead with healthcare reform at all costs.</p>

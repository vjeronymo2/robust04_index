			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Draft Returned for Further Work"] </F>   [Text] At the meeting of the Committee of the Supreme  Council for Economic Reform chaired by Orazala Sabdenov there  was discussion of the draft Law "On Entrepreneurship in the  Republic of Kazakhstan," submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers.    The deputies noted that the draft that was submitted is a  codified act. Consequently, it must bring together all existing  normative acts and have the logical structure of a whole  concept, stability of legal norms reinforced in it, system, and  coordination. From these positions it was noted that the need  for the development of a codified act was not sufficiently  substantiated and its conceptual basis was not sufficiently  developed.    The draft takes into account the position of only two  laws--"On Protection and Support of Private Entrepreneurship"  and "On Freedom of Economic Activity and the Development of  Entrepreneurship."    It does not take into account the provisions of other laws  regulating entrepreneurial activity, antimonopoly legislation,  or the Law "On Bankruptcy." Thus the draft generates additional  contradictions in legislation.    The peculiarities of various types of entrepreneurial  activity (banking, insurance) are not taken into account. The  opinion was expressed that it is necessary to get away from  codification and adopt a number of individual laws--on  licensing, on trade secrets--and to make changes in existing  laws.    Taking into account the results of the discussion and the  serious remarks regarding the draft Law "On Entrepreneurship in  the Republic of Kazakhstan," it was decided to return it for  further work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb warplanes  bombed the northern Muslim enclave of Maglaj Sunday [6 March],  Sarajevo Radio reported.    The radio said the air raids occurred at 5:00 A.M. (0400  GMT)  and a second at 10:15 A.M..    Earlier last week, NATO jet fighters shot down four Serb  warplanes on a similar sortie.    However, the radio did not give details of casualties.    U.N. officials in Zagreb said they had "no information" on  any Serb air attack, and there was no immediate response from  NATO.    Maglaj has been besieged by the Serbs for eight months and  its residents are said to be living in appalling conditions.</p>

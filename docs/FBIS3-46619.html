Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwant assigned his  secretary, Rayong MP Chakkraphan Yomchinda, in coordination with  Sananchat Thephatsadin, Thai general consul in Ho Chi Minh City,  to hold talks with the Vietnamese authorities for the release of  the vessels and crewmen and reduction of the fines set by the  Vietnamese Government at $30,000 for each vessel and $800 for  each crewman. After the negotiations, the Vietnamese Government  agreed to reduce the fines to $25,000 for each vessel and $700  for each crewman. The total in fines paid was some 9 million  baht, with 6.5 million from the Foreign Ministry budget and ship  owners agreeing to pay the remainder to the Thai Government on  an installment basis.    The 11 trawlers, eight from Rayong and three from Samut  Songkhram Province, left Vietnam on 29 December and arrived in  Thailand this morning.</p>

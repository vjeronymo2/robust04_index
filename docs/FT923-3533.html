			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / People: Edington says can-do for British Steel British Steel is raising the stakes in its struggle to fight back against the threat from aluminium by poaching its new technical chief, 53-year-old Jeff Edington, from Alcan Aluminium in Montreal. British-born Edington, a career metallurgist who travels on an American passport, joined Alcan in 1982 after spells at the Batelle Memorial Institute in Ohio and Cambridge University, where he was a fellow of Darwin College. As Alcan's vice president, research and technology, Edington played a big role in developing the group's aluminium can business. In terms of size, the world steel industry overshadows aluminium by a factor of 40. But the growth in consumption of aluminium outstrips that of steel and Edington sees part of his job as redressing the balance. 'Almost everything I learned in aluminium can be transferred across,' says Edington, who replaces the recently retired Frank Fitzgerald as British Steel's managing director, technical. In terms of beverage cans, he says that aluminium has already won the battle in the US and is now in the process of mounting a serious assault in Britain. As British Steel's top technical man, Edington will play a big part in developing new steel products to meet the challenge. Providing steel for the car industry is another big area where the competition between steel and aluminium is very visible. 'There is a lot of life left yet in steel,' says Edington, who is very conscious of the environmental challenges of providing more fuel-efficient vehicles. Edington, who has spent over half his working life in North America, refuses to say whether he took a pay cut to return to Britain. However, he says he was educated at taxpayers' expense in Britain and feels strongly that a healthy steel industry is important if Britain's manufacturing industry is to prosper. If the infrastructure in Britain, the US and eastern Europe really is to be rebuilt, then Edington is optimistic that steel can become a growth industry again.</p>

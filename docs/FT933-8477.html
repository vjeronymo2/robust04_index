			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Rexrodt in bid to free shop opening GERMANY'S highly restrictive laws on shop opening hours look set to become a new political battleground, in the campaign to liberalise the German economy and make it more internationally competitive. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister and leading member of the liberal Free Democrats, promised yesterday to try to scrap the laws, or radically liberalise them, after the elections next year. The move would be fiercely resisted both by German trade unions and by traditionalists in the churches, but would be welcomed by consumers and working couples. The present law requires all shops to close by 18.30 on weekdays, and 14.00 on Saturdays, with a ban on all evening and Sunday trading. They are allowed to open late on Thursdays, until 20.00, and on every first Saturday in the month. The only exceptions are at garages and railway stations, where a growing variety of goods is now being traded throughout the day. No moves are possible before the 1994 elections, because the sensitive subject of shop opening hours was not included in the agreement negotiated by the coalition parties - including Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, and the conservative Christian Social Union from Bavaria - for the current parliament. Mr Kohl showed his own caution last night, in spite of his commitment to more liberalisation, when he spoke out in a television interview against Sunday working. He said it was essential to liberalise working hours to obtain longer machine running times - Germany has the shortest in the industrialised world - but not at the expense of Sundays. Mr Rexrodt, however, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the restrictions on trading hours were a fundamental political error, dating from the 1950s. 'The time is ripe to scrap the law on trading hours, in the next legislative period, or at least to liberalise it radically,' he said. With more time to shop, he said, consumers could promote competition in the retail trade, with more part-time jobs resulting from flexible hours.</p>

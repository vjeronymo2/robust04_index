			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Dr. Klaus Kinkel at the French </F> Institute of International Relations in Paris on 24 March:  "Germany and France in a New Europe"]    [Text] The French Institute of International Relations is  one of Europe's most renowned forums for exchanging ideas about  international issues. I am pleased, Mr. de Montbrial, to be the  first German foreign minister to address you. At the end of the  1970's, we were both planning chiefs in our foreign ministries.  I am also pleased that you, Professor Rovan, are one of the  hosts of this evening. You have been tireless in your efforts  to pave the way for Franco-German friendship.    For us Germans, the collapse of the Berlin Wall was the most  important event related to freedom in the postwar period. The  French were delighted along with us. Alain Juppe, with whom I  enjoy friendly relations and close cooperation, was at the  Berlin Wall in those days. In his book Tentation de  Venise [Temptation of Venus], he describes people's joy on  16 November 1989, the happy atmosphere of those days, and his  own emotions. Without Franco-German friendship, without Germany  being firmly anchored in Europe and the West, German unity would  not have been possible. The Germans are well aware of that.  However, reunification has at times also revived old concerns  about Germany's role in Europe.    What kind of Europe do we want? How large and how closely  integrated should it be? What role is a united Germany seeking  in a new Europe? What roles do Germany and France have in this  Europe that is drawing together following the end of the  East-West conflict and following German reunification? These  are the kinds of questions that occur to a German foreign  minister. These are also the questions that I want to discuss  with you today. They can only be answered against the  background of Franco-German friendship. Germany has no other  partner with whom cooperation is so close and so marked by  confidence. We are each other's most important trading  partners. Summit meetings twice a year and regular  consultations between the ministers are the most visible  elements of an incomparably close network of consultation and  coordination. I constantly consult with Alain Juppe, and we see  each other almost every week. There was a good reason for  visiting Paris on the day I took office, and there was also a  good reason why Alain Juppe visited Bonn immediately after he  took office! Not one day goes by without a Franco-German  meeting appearing in the schedules in Bonn and Paris. Our  embassies exchange reports and carry out joint instructions.    Franco-German friendship is firmly rooted among our two  peoples. There are 1,600 sister cities and 3,000 school  partnerships, including a youth exchange program involving over  5 million participants -- that speaks for itself. Polls show  again and again how Franco-German friendship has become  something self-evident for our citizens. It has become a model  for reconciliation in Europe.    Since 1945, France and Germany have constantly succeeded to  mark significant dates in their common history in a dignified  manner. I recall the meeting between Charles de Gaulle and  Konrad Adenauer at Reims Cathedral, and President Mitterrand and  Chancellor Kohl praying together at the graves at Verdun. There  is no doubt in my mind that the French and the Germans will be  able to recall the end of World War II and Germany's return to  the democratic community in an appropriate manner. We will also  remember France's contribution to defending the Germans' liberty  when French soldiers leave Berlin now.    The European unification process has opened up a new path  into the future for Germany. With the decision to integrate our  country into the European Union [EU], we have acted on the  conclusions that are to be drawn from German history in this  century. In 1953, Thomas Mann already advised us to seek "a  Germany that is a self-assured element in a self-assured united  Europe." That is what we want to be. The overwhelming majority  that was obtained in the Bundestag for the Treaty on European  Unification and the Federal Constitutional Court ruling have  shown that there is agreement in Germany: We need more, not  less Europe.    What links us is historical insight. Two such large  neighboring states in the heart of Europe can only exist by  coexisting. That is why Germany and France have always placed  European unification ahead of the adoption of individual or  special courses. Not only have we done well by doing so, but  both our countries have also become trendsetters for Europe.  That is the way it will remain and must remain!    All of Europe, including Germany, is experiencing economic  and structural problems today. Germany faces a third challenge:  The completion of unification. The open domestic market will  enable our partners to act on an equal footing in the  development of this region. French companies were one of the  first to seize these great opportunities in eastern Germany.  The involvement of French investors accounts for almost 20  percent of all foreign investment. In 1993, real economic growth  there amounted to a good 7 percent. What will remain  unforgettable for me is how impressed Alain Juppe was by the  development of the new laender when we and our wives visited  Dresden.    The wave of hostility toward foreigners and right-wing acts  of violence, which we thought could never occur again, horrified  the overwhelming majority of Germans. Hatred of foreigners and  hostility toward what is foreign should never again originate in  Germany! The EU needs a common asylum and immigration policy.    We Germans, especially in view of our history, believe in  the  duty to assist people who are experiencing need, violence, and  war. German foreign policy is geared toward values and is shaped  by the principle of responsibility. That is the reason for our  humanitarian involvement in Somalia, in former Yugoslavia, and  elsewhere. That is why we are involved in intensive diplomatic  efforts to resolve conflicts and that is also the reason for our  readiness to assume responsibility on the UN Security Council,  with all the rights and duties that that entails. Germany is  seeking a permanent place on the Security Council. France  supports that wish. We are grateful for that.    French soldiers have lost their lives for the cause of  peace.  We remember them with the highest respect. We are impressed by  the exemplary deployment of blue helmets in former Yugoslavia.  I am confident that we will shortly have clarification of the  constitutional conditions for participation in missions aimed at  maintaining or creating peace. That is the only way in which  Germany remains capable of integration and being an alliance  partner within the EU and NATO.    The new Europe is no longer the divided Europe of the Cold  War, but all of Europe. Germany and France have asked  themselves three questions concerning the future:     -  How can  we consolidate peace?    -  How can we safeguard the well-being of our  peoples?    -  How will we assert ourselves within a global framework?    Once again: The answer for Germany is clear. We can only  master these challenges within and along with the EU. I am sure  that France will provide the same answer. Our joint commitment  for the EU has laid the basis for the future. I am confident  that we will succeed in the historic step toward a new, greater,  and stronger Europe. The questions concerning candidates for  admission have been resolved. The expansion of the EU to  include Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will represent a  success for Europe. It would not make any sense to be held up  by the voting rights issue. The EU model involving common  institutions has superseded the idea of nothing more than a free  trade zone, an idea that we did not discard in 1957 simply in  order to approve it today. Just as we jointly acted in 1985 to  facilitate membership for southern Europe, it is now the turn of  the north.    The birth pangs of the new Europe are more painful than was  expected. In this critical situation, Germany and France must  use their combined weight to provide new inspiration to Europe.    Franco-German initiatives such as the formation of a  Eurocorps and our proposal for the resumption of the Geneva  negotiations on Yugoslavia have become EU projects. The GATT  negotiations, which are of such importance for Europe's economic  future, were a success because Germany and France reached  agreement. Neither of our countries if they had acted alone  would have had the strength to have achieved such a conclusion  to the negotiations. France knows it can rely on Germany and  vice versa. Pompidou's words have been confirmed:  Franco-German partnership is "exemplary," but not "exclusive."    We now face difficult questions concerning the further  development of the EU: They concern the rate at which new  member states are accepted, the reform of European institutions,  and the relationship between deepening and enlargement. All  these questions can only be solved if Germany and France seek to  answer them jointly. Germany and France must also retain their  pivotal function in an EU that will continue to grow. It is our  common task for the future. The Elysee Treaty provides us with  guidelines in this respect.    Germany and France have resolved that as of 1 July their  consecutive EU presidencies will be oriented toward a common  vision for the EU's future. Alain Juppe and I have agreed on  that. I envision four main areas in this Franco-German  partnership program:    First, we must implement the EU Treaty in a resolute manner.  With the common market and the European Economic Zone, we have  achieved an integration advantage in world terms. To retain it,  we have to realize economic and monetary union [EMU]. I welcome  the fact that at the second stage of EMU, France restored the  independence of the Banque de France. I am grateful to France  for its yes to Frankfurt as the headquarters of the European  central bank. Germany has also provided proof on many occasions  of its readiness to make great efforts for Europe's monetary  union, and has done so recently through the Bundesbank's  supportive action totalling 60 billion German marks in 1993.    Our common goal is the convergence of our economies. That is  why we have reached firm agreement on binding criteria for  entering the third stage of economic and monetary union. Not  all the EU member states will be able to carry out this step at  the same time. Without cohesion on the part of the first group  that meets the criteria, the remaining member states will not be  able to achieve the necessary level of performance at a later  date too. Germany and France must defend the logic of the union  treaty against all attempts to water it down!    The 18 million unemployed in the EU are a warning signal.  The globalization of markets and the international division of  labor require rethinking and painful adjustment processes.  Above all, Europe cannot afford to fall behind the dynamic  development in Asia. Europe needs a modernization boost to enter  the information age of the 21st century. There is an urgent  need to develop transportation, energy, and communications  networks all over Europe. Today, travelling by train between  Berlin and Paris takes 13 hours and involves going through four  different energy networks with three different railroad safety  systems. How long can we afford to carry on like this?    The EU must also remain capable of acting after its  expansion. That is why we now need common ideas about developing  the necessary institutional reforms. We have no choice. We and  France support enhancing the EU and we must achieve that along  with the EU's expansion. The 1996 government conference must  make the necessary decisions. The expanded EU must also  function. The rights of the European Parliament must also be  developed. The council and the commission must remain capable  of acting. It is of key importance that Germany and France will  occupy clear and convergent positions. I support the idea of  appointing a commission of wise men that formulate proposals for  the government conference.    Our citizens must once again be able to find their national  and regional identity in a Europe that is drawing together. The  upcoming European elections are a test. We must win over the  citizens of France and of Germany for Europe!    Secondly, the EU must respond to the changed security policy  challenges in Europe. This means that the development of an  independent European security and defense identity is  indispensable. That is why we are developing the WEU as a  defense component of the EU in a comprehensive manner. In  future, the WEU and NATO will engage in close coordination in  the event of crises. Our ability to engage in common defense  will thus be adjusted to meet specifically European  requirements. Our North American partners are supporting  European efforts to achieve more independence in asserting our  security. The most recent alliance summit provided impressive  proof of that.    However, future Europe also needs the transatlantic  security partnership. It is one of the formative experiences of  our recent history. For the core functions of the alliance, the  commitment of our North American partners, above all the  presence of U.S. troops in Europe, is indispensable.  Franco-German cooperation strengthens the columns that support  Europe's bridge over the Atlantic.    Concerning events in former Yugoslavia over the past few  weeks: I very much welcome the fact that France has been  particularly active in promoting NATO's decisions concerning  Sarajevo. The stabilization that has occurred in Sarajevo in  the meantime and the agreements that have been signed on the  Bosnian-Croatian federation demonstrate what can be achieved  with resolve and clear goals. I am pleased to see that the EU  peace plan, which is based on a Franco- German initiative, is  now developing into what will hopefully be a lasting and durable  international peace settlement with the participation of the  United States and Russia. This is a good example of the power  of Franco-German understanding.    We need the courage to develop visions for the Europe of the  future. After the turn of the century, everyone in Europe will  bear a responsibility for the security of others, precisely  because everyone has an immense interest in the security of  others. Next century, Europe will have to supplement the  Atlantic alliance by developing a collective security system.  We must develop the CSCE into an instrument for preventing and  resolving conflicts. Along with the French foreign minister, I  am of the opinion that an important and necessary step in this  direction was to oblige participating states to take joint  action against those who disrupt peace. In such cases,  participating states should jointly call for a meeting of the UN  Security Council and at the same time undertake to implement  Security Council resolutions jointly.    We are seeking a multidimensional, graduated networking of  the security interests of all the states in the region. It  would simply be wrong to accord the states of Central and East  Europe a place between West and East in this Europe. That is  why we cannot accept the Russian proposal of militarily  guaranteeing the security of these countries by NATO states on  the one hand and by CIS states on the other hand. The old way  of thinking in zones of influence is no longer valid. In the  new Europe, there can be no place for so-called vital spheres of  influence, for the concept of "an abroad close-at-hand." The  Partnership for Peace has created an instrument for spreading  stability to Central and East Europe and thus drawing in Russia.    In a time of new risks, arms control remains a task of  first-order importance for the international community. That is  why I have proposed a 10 point plan for preventing the  proliferation of nuclear weapons. I am pleased about the  positive response. There must be an unlimited extension of the  Nonproliferation Treaty.    Thirdly, we also need an active EU policy on the  Mediterranean region. I know how developments in the Maghreb  countries above all constitute a vital interest for France. We  share concerns about security in the Mediterranean region.  Alain Juppe and I want to investigate the possibilities for  joint initiatives in this region.    Fourthly, we need a common EU policy on the East. This is an  historic task. We must gradually lead the reformist states of  Central and East Europe into our community of stability. The  people there need firm proof that the difficult transition to  democracy and free market economy is worth it.    In 1990, Germany and France already envisaged a joint  Eastern  policy. This will be a key issue in both the German and the  French presidencies. A start has already been made: The  trilateral talks with our Polish colleagues have opened up a new  bridge of understanding.    In the security field too, Germany and France are making  progress with Poland. At the next meeting of the WEU  ministerial council in May, on the basis of the proposal made by  Alain Juppe and myself, the opportunities for our Eastern  partners to have an input through consultations will be given  concrete form.    France's initiative for a stability pact in Europe is geared  toward settling particularly critical minority and border  issues. We want to make a success of this EU project together!    I see there being five additional areas that require an  active EU Eastern policy:    Firstly, for the states of Central and East Europe that  already have an associate status, the previously agreed upon  full implementation of the opening up of markets is a top  priority. Measures aimed at closing off markets undermine the  credibility of this process! The admission of the states of  Central and East Europe to the EU has been promised. This is a  task of historic importance. It will require time. We cannot  afford to fail in this respect. It cannot be right to call on  the countries of Central and East Europe for decades to join our  Western community based on freedom, and then to say that there  are no vacant rooms left for them in the European house!    We already want to draw our association partners into common  foreign and security policies as much as possible. Germany and  France will work to achieve a better coordination of advisory  assistance for the states of Central and East Europe. I would  propose a "European Development Corps." The PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program should be  more strongly oriented toward the promotion of investment.    Secondly, the development of relations between the EU and  Russia will have a key role. We want an open, stable,  democratic Russia, which can become a capable economic partner  and reliable support for pan-European peaceful order. Just as  we have firm expectations on the Russian side, we must also be  ready to reach compromises with Russia regarding what is of  importance to it. Yes, we want cooperation, but Russia's  integration into the world economic system is only possible to  the extent that Russia establishes a free market economy at  home. The negotiations about a partnership and cooperation  treaty must be successfully concluded now! As long as Russia  says yes to Europe, we will not say no to Russia!    Thirdly, Ukraine is the cornerstone of strategic stability  in all of East Europe. The economic crisis there and the  tension with Russia affect us directly. They could have  extensive consequences. I advocate that the EU should work  toward reducing tension in Ukrainian-Russian relations. Is  there really any kind of argument against a common EU policy  toward Ukraine? We should also jointly work toward bringing  Ukraine into our European cooperation network quickly!    Fourthly, we need a coherent EU policy toward the Baltics.  The Baltic states can already display impressive reform  results. My meeting with the Baltic foreign ministers on 9  March strengthened my conviction that a united Europe needs the  Baltic states. Along with France, we want to lead these  countries increasingly closer to the EU. Appropriate European  treaties should be concluded this year. The withdrawal of  Russian troops must be completed in accordance with agreements  and according to schedule.    Fifthly, what is more important than material transfer is  the  transfer of science and education from West to East. The  development of competitive economies in the states of Central  and East Europe requires enormous efforts in the areas of  education, science, and research. To achieve a massive  expansion of this exchange, what I have proposed to Alain Juppe  is a joint initiative for an intellectual Marshall Plan for East  Europe. Let us start the ball rolling, so that thousands of  additional students and scientists from these countries can  study and conduct research in the EU and so that more EU college  professors can teach and study there. We still have a unique  chance to revive pan-European cultural traditions going back  hundreds of years. We must now seize this chance together!    Franco-German relations are also a very personal matter for  me. I have been familiar with France and French culture since my  youth. My first journey abroad, which saw me travel to France as  a schoolboy, was an important experience for me. My French  teacher, whom I shall never forget, was a particularly great  admirer of France and he instilled in me a love of Romain  Rolland and Georges Bernanos. For over 20 years, my home town  of Hechingen has been linked with Joue-les-Tours in the garden  of France, the Touraine.    Intellectual exchange is a hallmark of European history and  culture. Today, we know that European integration does not lead  to the disappearance of national identities. On the contrary,  today, anyone who allows the images of history in Europe's  capital cities to soak into him knows that the integration of  Europe has led to the blossoming of national identities. Anyone  who travels in your country today feels that "certaine idee de  la France" [preceding words in French] of which De Gaulle spoke,  irrespective of whether he visits Paris, Normandy, the Loire, or  Provence. In the same way, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, and  Magdeburg are unmistakably German. Anyone who understands that  Germany has recovered itself and unity through the integration  of Europe knows that Germany will proceed along the European  path side by side with France.</p>

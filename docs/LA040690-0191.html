			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHAMPION WILL CLOSE 2 PLANTS  </P> <P> Champion Spark Plug will consolidate its U.S. manufacturing operations by  closing two plants, company officials said today.  </P> <P> Plants in Toledo and Detroit will be integrated over the next two years into  the company's Burlington, Iowa, and Cambridge, Ohio, facilities.  </P> <P> Plans call for the company and United Auto Workers union to meet regarding the  timing and effects of the consolidation on production and maintenance  personnel.  </P> <P> There now are 245 salaried and hourly workers at Detroit and 430 in Toledo  whose jobs would be affected.  </P> <P> Company officials said new jobs in Burlington and Cambridge would be created as  a result of the move.  </P> <P> "We sincerely regret the impact this announcement would have on employees in  Detroit and Toledo and on the two cities," said Jerry Godwin, Champion  president. "Champion has been struggling for several years with an overcapacity  of production facilities, while at the same time selling a product -- spark  plugs -- whose overall market has declined."  </P></p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese camera makers turn in gloomy results JAPAN's camera makers have been forced to readjust their focus amid a gloomy earnings season in which Minolta, once the industry leader, reported an after-tax loss of Y25.8bn (Dollars 199m) and most other producers predicted a bleak year ahead. Restructuring programmes in the industry, begun when the domestic economy was expanding rapidly, have run into the troubles of recession, complicating the companies' entry into new markets. Earnings at Minolta were also dragged down by the settlement of a US patent dispute in March, forcing the company to write-off Y16.9bn. This came on top of a pre-tax loss of Y8.5bn, a turnround from a profit of Y4.9bn the previous year and the company's first loss for 26 years. Minolta was also weakened by stock market turmoil, as its unrealised gains on long-term holdings of shares fell from Y57bn to Y27.7bn, and cash deposits, seen as a mark of strength in Japan, were halved to Y14.5bn. Traditionally strong in foreign markets, Minolta's long-term strategy included the aims of increasing the share of domestic camera sales and expanding the office equipment business. But the company has had difficulty penetrating the crowded domestic office equipment market, where its sales last year fell 5.6 per cent, while exports of office machinery rose 7.3 per cent - camera exports fell 12.8 per cent and domestic camera sales were down 7.9 per cent. Minolta's total sales for the year were 2.9 per cent lower at Y215.6bn, and while the company confidently predicted sales would rise to Y228bn in the current period, it forecast another pre-tax loss of Y4bn. Nikon, the camera and semiconductor equipment maker, reported a 62.4 per cent plunge to Y7.2bn in its pre-tax profit, following weak demand from Japanese semiconductor producers, which are facing large losses on their investments in the present generation of memory chips. Sales for the year fell 9.4 per cent to Y230.6bn, and Nikon forecast a difficult year ahead, with sales expected at Y228bn and pre-tax profits declining to Y4bn. By product line, camera sales fell 6 per cent and semiconductor equipment by 21.2 per cent. Ricoh, now reliant on copiers and information equipment for most of its sales, reported a 70.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y7.4bn, and a 0.7 per cent sales decline at Y672.7bn. The company said the weakness of the US market hurt original equipment manufacturer orders for its copiers and fax machines. It also blamed 'currency fluctuations' for the downturn, that is, the appreciation of the yen.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Singapore bears brunt of bearish week Singapore suffered the most in a generally bearish week for world equities, dropping 8.3 per cent in local currency terms against a decline of 1.5 per cent in the FT-Actuaries World Index. The fall in Singapore was triggered by concern about rights issues, following cash calls from two banks, OCBC and OUB, as well as a realisation that the economy is slowing down, says Mr Michael Franklin, a director at Kim Eng Securities. Other stocks came under pressure as institutions took their profits in a thin market. Mr Franklin says the market looks vulnerable from a technical point of view, since there is little support for the Straits Times Industrial index below 1,300. The index closed at 1,334.42 yesterday. The week's second-worst performer was Johannesburg, which weakened 8 per cent following a dividend cut warning last Tuesday from De Beers, one of the most dominant components in the overall index. One analyst says the market has also been depressed by a 1.2 per cent year-on-year fall in Gross Domestic Product in the June quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of negative performance and the sharpest decline since the first quarter of 1986. He adds that no improvement in the economy, poor results from the retail sector and little prospect that the ANC and the government will return to the negotiating table soon have caused local institutions to shy away from equities. 'There is a realisation that profits at industrial companies are declining and that there is no dividend growth,' he explains. The reality, or the expectation, of disappointing results from bellwether companies were also to blame for the 4.3 per cent fall in Brussels in the wake of poor first-half figures from Petrofina, while New Zealand lost 5.9 per cent on fears that Fletcher Challenge would announce large losses at its annual meeting this week.</p>

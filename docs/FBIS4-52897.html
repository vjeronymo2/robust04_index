			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Economic and Development Authority  (NEDA) revealed today that the safeguarding of the environment  is now ensured with the approval by President Ramos of the  Philippine Program for Biodiversity Management.    This program will prevent the depletion of the country's  natural resources in the pursuit of industrialization as  envisioned under Philippines 2000.    The approval of the program was made during the recent  meeting of the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development  (PCSD) with the president.    Officially called the Philippine Strategy for Biological  Diversity Conservation (PSBDC), the program contains 18 broad  objectives intended to address issues such as biodiversity  policy, sustainable use, sustainable agriculture, recognition of  ancestral domain, public education and awareness on  biodiversity, and institutional capability-building.    The specific goals of the PSBDC include: developing and  implementing a holistic and comprehensive national program for  the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use  of its components; ensuring that the relevant activities of the  biodiversity program harmonize with those of other government  and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), private sector,  religious groups, and local community; and institutionalizing  the practice of biodiversity conservation through legislative,  administrative, fiscal and other regulatory measures.    An important issue the program addresses is the need for a  review of existing national and local policies on the  management, use, and conservation of natural resources areas,  wildlife and other biological resources.    The program thus aims to reform those policies that  encourage  the misuse of natural resources and ecologically unsound  management of biodiversity and its components.    It also proposes that policies which give incentives to  industries that practice sustainable development and  environmentally sound activities be adopted. These would  include reduction of resource consumption through waste  minimization, recycling, and conservation.    Another objective of the PSBDC is the implementation of  natural resources accounting method that promotes biodiversity  conservation. Part of this objective is the development of  satellite environmental accounts in the Philippine system of  national accounts.    This could lead to the appropriate pricing of resource  ecosystems. Today, resource ecosystems are being treated as  "free" good and their degradation does not count as depreciation  of the nation's basic capital stock in the calculation of Gross  National Product (GNP).    Another critical objective of the program is the integration  of biodiversity conservation into national and local development  planning.    "If government agencies, both national and local, are  willing  to incorporate biological diversity conservation in the planning  and management of the country, positive changes in the  ecological, economic and social spheres of development will  surely come about," the program states.</p>

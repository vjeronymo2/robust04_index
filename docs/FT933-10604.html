			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Oceonics declines to Pounds 2m and seeks Pounds 4.35m OCEONICS GROUP, a provider of survey and positioning services, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.72m to Pounds 2.04m from revenues up 4 per cent Pounds 30.1m in the year to end-March. The company also announced plans to raise Pounds 4.35m by a placing and open offer of redeemable preference shares and the redemption of existing preference shares. Operating profit was Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.2m) after depreciation of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.3m) and a charge of Pounds 141,000 in respect of exceptional losses on foreign currency overdrafts which were repaid during the year. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 489,000) and tax took Pounds 843,000 (Pounds 864,000). This year's charge included Pounds 116,000 relating to prior years, principally to profits of overseas subsidiaries, some of which could not be offset against losses brought forward in other subsidiaries. After an extraordinary charge of Pounds 426,000 retained profits were Pounds 724,000 (Pounds 1.75m). Earnings per share were 0.6p (1.2p). The company is to issue 4.63m 6 per cent cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares. All of the new preference shares have been placed with institutional investors at par. Existing holders can apply on the basis of one preference share for every 30 ordinary held. The placing is conditional on approval by holders of existing 9.25 per cent preference shares for their redemption at par plus payment of arrears and accruals of dividend in full. In addition payment of a special dividend of 1p per existing preference share is proposed. Most of the placing proceeds will be used to redeem the existing preference shares. The balance of some Pounds 853,000 will provide additional working capital.</p>

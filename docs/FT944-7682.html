			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey tussle Bank Abbey National was buffeted by two-way trade following an upbeat presentation on current trading. The one-time building society said its share of the national mortgage market was back up to 10 per cent and it had widened its retail margins. Mr Mark Eady of NatWest Securities put the positive view that 'the gain in market share has not been achieved at the expense of margins'. However, bearish Credit Lyonnais Laing drew clients' attention to the imminent figures from Royal Bank of Scotland and its Direct Line insurance subsidiary. The house said Direct Line had flagged its move into the mortgage arena, where it was offering loans of 7.1 per cent against Abbey's 8.1 per cent, and into the banking market. Abbey shares were steady at 412p, while RBoS's were also firm, at 452p. Mobile communications group Vodafone lost 2 at 204p following interim results on the right side of brokers' estimates. But it was the near 20 per cent jump to 1.64p in the interim dividend that provided the shares with most underpinning. Most houses had been expecting a payout of 1.5p. Interim results from glassmaker Pilkington were modestly better than expected but the company's message for the full year was mixed. The shares dipped 2 to 183p. Not all securities houses edged up their profit estimates for 1994-95. Some houses see Pilkington's premium p/e as a sell factor, others are more confident of the longer term. Concern over margins in the music division at Thorn EMI hit the group's shares as it reported favourable interim figures. The stock dropped 24 to 973p. Sentiment was hit further by unconfirmed reports that UBS had downgraded but the general tone was positive. Hoare Govett raised its full-year forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 411m. Granada relinquished 10 to 516p after it emerged that its television subsidiary may face a fine for repeated violations of independent television rules on products in programmes. The unexpected break-down of merger talks between metals groups Johnson Matthey and Cookson Group left Johnson 9 lower at 565p but added 2 to the Cookson share price at 247p. Fears that Northern Foods will have to make provisions of around Pounds 40m at the end of the second half for restructuring and news of disappointing interim figures sent the shares down 8 to 204p. The meeting with analysts was also particularly gloomy. Brokers downgraded full-year expectations by about Pounds 15m to around Pounds 120m. Nervous trading in Tate &amp; Lyle, which reports first-half figures today, left the shares 8 lighter at 439p. Computer software group ACT shed a penny to 102 1/2 p following news of a heavy share buy-back programme. It purchased almost 5 per cent of its equity  -9m shares - at 103p. Turnover was 15m. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome gained as analysts became increasingly enthusiastic following last weekend's positive Aids conference. Securities house Robert Fleming was said to have issued a buy recommendation and Japanese investment house Nikko Securities took investors to the company's research centre. The shares moved ahead 6 to 681p. Paper group Bowater rose 7 to 470p as Hoare Govett held a meeting with the company. Tightly traded merchant bank Schroders climbed 13 to 1428p as one house crossed a block of shares at above the prevailing market price. Stockbroker Brewin Dolphin weakened 13 to 110p. Interim figures from stock dealer ShareLink expected today are forecast to disappoint. The latter fell 4 to 183p. Chemicals leader Courtaulds shed 5 to 440p ahead of interim figures due today. The forecast range is between Pounds 75m and Pounds 87m and analysts expect a squeeze on margins but hope for some rays of hope in current trading. McLeod Russell moved forward 10 to 117p on well received final figures and an encouraging statement. A clutch of recent brokers' recommendations continued to boost MFI Furniture. The shares gained a further 3 1/2 at 141 1/2 p. Also in demand was high street retailing group Lloyds Chemists, ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting. The shares put on 5 at 313p. The poor market trend halted the recent advance in Yorkshire Water, which reports interim figures today. The shares finished 9 lower at 540p. NatWest Securities remains positive on the stock and recommended that investors add to current holdings as 'these results should underline how management is continuing to unravel the cost base'. But it also warned that 'dividend policy is unlikely to be headline grabbing'.</p>

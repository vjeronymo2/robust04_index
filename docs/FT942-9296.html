			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Bill launched to safeguard tenants A private member's bill to reform the law of Privity of Contract, which has created problems for some tenants during the recession, was presented in parliament yester-day. The landlord and tenant (covenants) bill was introduced by Conservative MP Mr Peter Thurnham, with the assistance of the Lord Chancellor's department. Privity of Contract is a law under which a tenant retains the responsibility for paying rent if the lease has been assigned to another tenant who defaults. The bill seeks to release tenants from Privity of Contract obligations for new leases after the first assignment.</p>

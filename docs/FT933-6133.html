			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: Future of Jewish settlements in doubt THOUSANDS of Jewish settlers demonstrated last night in Jerusalem, vowing to block proposals for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories by all means possible, David Horovitz reports. '(Yassir) Arafat will not be allowed to take control,' said settler leader Uri Ariel. 'Rabin has no mandate for this deal. He must go home and we must have new elections.' The clashes, in which three protesters and two police were injured, indicate that the settlements may become a flashpoint for right-wing Israeli opposition to the deal expected to be signed shortly between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 100,000 Jews live in about 150 settlements dotted throughout the occupied territories. Mr Rabin told his coalition partners yesterday that no settler would be forced to leave home under the five-year interim autonomy proposals. 'The settlements will remain - none will be uprooted,' Mr Rabin stressed. However, the long-term future of the settlements is uncertain. In its 14 months in office Mr Rabin's government has demonstrated that the settlers are far lower on its list of priorities than under previous Likud governments. State funding has been sharply reduced, and Mr Rabin has said more than once that his main concern is to maintain the security of residents of 'sovereign Israel'. About 20 Israeli settlements are located in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, where Palestinian self-rule is first proposed. During the five-year interim period, government officials said yesterday, settlers there (the areas in white in the map on the left) would remain Israel's responsibility, protected by the army. Neither Mr Rabin nor any of his colleagues have offered guarantees as to settlers' fate after the five years are over. The government may hope that those living in or near Arab population centres will decide to relocate inside Israel's pre-1967 borders.</p>

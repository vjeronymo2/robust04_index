			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Government officials  started final negotiations Tuesday [8 February] to coordinate  views on a projected 2.4 percent growth target for Japan's gross  domestic product (GDP) for fiscal 1994, beginning April 1. The  negotiations also cover a projected 2.6 percent growth target  for gross national product (GNP) for the year, the officials  said.    GNP, the value of goods and services produced by a country,  includes income remitted to Japan by Japanese companies and  individuals here or Japanese companies overseas. GDP does not.    The final targets may be revised upward from the projections  under study, since the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) are calling for a GDP  growth target ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 percent, the officials  said. But the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) has insisted on a  growth target of slightly over 2.0 percent, in the belief that  full economic recovery will be delayed until the second half of  fiscal 1994.    The estimate for GNP growth in fiscal 1993 is likely to be  cut to 0.2 percent from the initial forecast of 3.3 percent, the  officials said.</p>

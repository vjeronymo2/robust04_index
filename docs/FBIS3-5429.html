			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned Editorial: "BN (National Front) Formula for Unity"] </F>   [Text] The people of Sabah have been given a guarantee that  the post of chief minister will be held in turn by leaders of  the three largest communal groups in the state if the National  Front (BN) wins in these elections. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir  Mohamad said that in this way the BN will be able to ensure that  each communal group has a responsibility for bringing Sabah into  a new era. We feel that this is a sincere effort by the BN to  stand up for the people of Sabah so that they will not  constantly be mired in narrow communal politics full of  deceptive personal interests. We agree that the country's  success up to now has been because of, among other things,  leaders who are not only capable and dedicated, but who are also  sincere and honest in serving the people. In truth, there is  nothing worse for a country than having leaders who are greedy  for power for the sake of personal interests.    Beginning with the Alliance and continuing through the BN,  our success in overcoming communal problems is because of a  spirit of cooperation among leaders and party members  representing various communal groups. Such tolerance and  consensus can resolve any problem and create political stability  for developing Malaysia. We believe that if this concept had not  been introduced and nurtured, Malaysia would have been  multicommunal country facing frequent disturbances. As a result,  every citizen of this country would have been left behind by the  development process.    We are sure that the Sabah United Party (PBS) will use Dr.  Mahathir's guarantee to inflame the sentiments of the people of  Sabah, particularly the Kadazan community. That is the normal  political practice of the PBS when under pressure, but we  believe the people of Sabah have discernment. Their evaluation  of the BN is not merely at election time, but they look at its  "track record" throughout the era of its governance since the  days of the Alliance. The BN's concept is measured by its  success. The BN has proved its ability to unite a multiracial  people and manage the country's economy efficiently and wisely.  For us, there is no alternative to the BN. This is because the  pact among its parties is constant and lasting, unlike the  confusion of pacts among opposition parties that are made only  when elections take place. Afterwards, they scatter to  themselves and their differences. The failure of pseudopacts  among opposition parties is because their leaders are not honest  and are interested in their own pockets. This disease has  clearly spread to Sabah. What we see are former USNO [United  Sabah National Organization] leaders conspiring with the PBS. In  order to have power, they are willing to try to win the hearts  of the people, even though, having left the BN, they are forced  to ride the PBS symbol in this election. This situation is very  different from that of the BN. Because we believe that the  interests of the people are above everything, we do not object  to compromise. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was willing to  pull its candidate to make way for the Sabah Progressive Party  (SAPP) to run as an assurance that the Sabah Chinese community  will be cared for. Similarly, the MCA [Malaysian Chinese  Association] adhered to the BN concept and was willing not to  run, although SAPP had not yet been accepted into the BN. All  these things were done because of the realization that politics  for the sake of one communal group, one party, or one group of  leaders will not last. It is the opinion of those parties that  PBS leaders manipulate the Chinese community, not for the sake  of the Kadazans, but for their own interests. The BN will always  adhere to this principle of tolerance, because if we bow to an  individual or a group, the BN will face destruction. For us, the  victory of the BN in this election is very important for the  sake of restoring Sabah's economic excellence and the  advancement of its people.    We admit that there are sometimes "minor ripples" in the BN,  but they do not hurt it. On the contrary, its situation is  further strengthened when a problem is resolved in a spirit of  solidarity. What is even more important is that all communal  groups must try to increase unity and understanding. Although it  is difficult for us immediately to eliminate the identity of a  particular communal group and replace it with the sense of a  single nation, we must not inflame communal spirit, which would  bring tension to the country's political and social climate. We  need to remember that all communal groups can together obtain  greater benefit from national stability than from a single  communal group's seizing everything for itself. Therefore, there  is no reason why the citizens of the Peninsula, Sabah, and  Sarawak should fail in jointly achieving greater success for a  brighter future.</p>

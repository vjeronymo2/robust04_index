			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SMOLLER ADS LINK LEWIS TO SCANDALS  </P> <P> Democratic candidate Fred Smoller, who is challenging Assemblyman John R. Lewis  (R-Orange) in the Nov. 6 election, launched an early television attack against  his opponent Thursday with an ad that criticizes his involvement in two recent  scandals.  </P> <P> The commercial, which is to air on cable television in Orange, highlights  Lewis' indictment last year for a fake signature of President Reagan's on  campaign literature without permission from the White House. The ad does not  mention that the charge was dismissed by an appellate court.  </P> <P> Lewis was also criticized in the commercial for his connection to the so-called  poll guard case, in which Republican Party officials placed uniformed guards at  polling places throughout Santa Ana on Election Day in 1988. Smoller's  television commercial charges that the guards were hired "to frighten Latino  voters."  </P> <P> Lewis has admitted that he attended meetings at which the hiring of the guards  was discussed. At one meeting, according to court documents, Lewis joked about  driving green vans around the polling places to give the impression that  Immigration and Naturalization Service agents were lurking.  </P> <P> Lewis dismissed the attack Thursday, saying that he has been cleared in  connection with both cases and adding that he is confident of reelection  because he is more philosophically compatible with the predominantly Republican  district.  </P> <P> "He can say whatever he wants, I don't think it will have any effect on the  outcome of the election," Lewis said. "The bottom line is going to come down to  the fact that Fred Smoller is a college radical who never grew up. I think I  represent a very conservative district."  </P> <P> Smoller, a college professor, acknowledged that he had a difficult task in  trying to unseat a five-term incumbent assemblyman. But he said Lewis'  controversial recorded motivated him to run.  </P> <P> Smoller said his commercial will air on 10 consecutive evenings -- starting  tonight -- on cable television in Orange, the heart of Lewis' 67th Assembly  District. Smoller said it cost only $55 to broadcast the 30-second commercial  for all 10 evenings. DAVE LESHER  </P></p>

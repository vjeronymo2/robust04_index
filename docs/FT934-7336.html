			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Tiphook in talks over Pounds 830m sale of division TIPHOOK, the leasing group struggling for survival under Pounds 1.2bn of debt, stepped back from the brink yesterday with a proposed Pounds 830m deal to sell its container leasing business. Tiphook shares, which had fallen from a peak of 564p in October 1991, closed up 19p at 63p. The UK-based company said it was in talks with Transamerica, the US financial services and leasing group, over the sale for cash of the container division, although no assurance could be given that the deal would go through. If it does, Transamerica will jump into second position in the world container leasing market, after Genstar, the subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation of the US. Together, the two would control about 68 per cent of the worldwide industry, according to the US Journal of Commerce. Transamerica said it was confident the proposed acquisition would not encounter anti-trust problems. If containers owned by shipping groups were included, it said, its market share would be considerably less. Tiphook said the deal would substantially reduce its debt and balance sheet gearing. Analysts estimated it would cut Tiphook's gearing to less than 200 per cent, which is not considered excessive for a leasing company. The company said it would give shareholders 'details of the structure and future trading strategies of the newly shaped Tiphook'. It plans to retain other activities which it believes will be capable of servicing the remaining debt. The container division, shown in Tiphook's 1993 accounts to have gross assets of Pounds 628.8m, has made the greater part of group profits in recent years. The rest of Tiphook comprises a trailer rental business, the market leader in western Europe, and a railway wagon leasing activity. One analyst said: 'The container business is the heart of the group. Tiphook could end up with a grotty business and a pile of debt.' The stock market was surprised by the price of the deal. Since Monday, when Tiphook said it was in talks to sell its container division, speculation had centred on a price of Pounds 400m. One analyst said Transamerica was paying more per container than it would cost to buy the fleet new. Others noted that as well as an operating fleet, Transamerica would get a worldwide network of depots and offices. Tiphook's fleet totals 526,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) while Transamerica's amounts to 420,000, giving a combined total of 926,000, 15 per cent of world capacity including containers owned by shipping groups.

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (1): Descending with a bump - With a 12 per cent unemployment rate, Denmark is seeking to expand its economy by large-scale public works. Its Social Democrat-led coalition is also pledged to keep taxes low and to protect the country's cherished welfare state After a heady year in the international headlines, Denmark is facing grim reality again. A referendum in May to accept the Maastricht Treaty creating the European Union, reversing a dramatic initial rejection in June 1992, brought to an end a period in which the country had enjoyed unaccustomed levels of attention as it held the future of the community in its hands. Now, just as Denmark has slipped down the European agenda, so has the issue of Europe been supplanted at home by the more mundane but daunting problems of a faltering economy, an unemployment rate of some 12 per cent of the workforce and the strains these have placed on the country's highly-developed welfare state. Nor are more cheerful diversions in view: earlier this month, the Danish football team failed to qualify for next summer's World Cup Finals in the US, shattering the national euphoria which followed its unexpected victory in the European championship a few weeks after the first Maastricht referendum. In tune with the change in mood, the four-party coalition of Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, led by his Social Democratic Party, has made the regeneration of economic growth and 'bending down the curve' of unemployment the over-riding aim of the govern ment. The government, which includes the Centre Democratic Party, the Radical Liberal Party and the Christian People's Party, took office in January following the collapse of a Conservative-Liberal coalition led by Mr Poul Schluter. Mr Schluter had held together a non-socialist government for 10 years but was finally forced to resign in the face of a scandal over the treatment of a group of Tamil refugees in which he was found by a judicial inquiry to have misled the Folketing (parliament). With Denmark at the time holding the presidency of the European Community, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's initial priority was to ensure the approval of Maastricht in the second referendum, held after Denmark won a series of opt-outs from the treaty's provisions at the EC's December summit in Edinburgh. But the Social Democrats, many of whose own supporters were anti-Maastricht, had no special enthusiasm for the loftier goals of European Union. Since the referendum was won, the government has been happy to let slip the issues of institutional reform within the EU, preferring not to return to them in earnest until the next Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. Instead, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen has advocated that the EU concentrate on the issues that are also his chief domestic concern - how to engender growth and tackle unemployment. At home, the change in government did not produce any change in Denmark's dogged determination to maintain the value of the krone as an anchor that has helped achieve an inflation rate of just over one per cent. Although granted exemption from the goal of European Monetary Union under the Edinburgh accords, the coalition is committed to making the krone a core currency when new arrangements for the European Monetary System are eventually made. In spite of repeated speculative buffetings during Europe's currency turbulence of the past year, and some damage to exports, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's government has spurned the devaluation route taken by Sweden and the UK, two of Denmark's most important export markets and competitors. The krone was one of the currencies given a wider 15 per cent ERM band in August, but has since fallen relatively little against the D-Mark and interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels in two decades. But the coalition has struck out on a markedly different economic path from its predecessor. Backed by a large current account surplus and a low budget deficit, the government has adopted a policy - at least temporarily - of fiscal expansion. In the summer it enacted Denmark's most far-reaching tax reforms for decades, cutting the top rate of income tax over the next five years from 68 per cent to about 63 per cent and the lowest rate from about 51 per cent to 43 per cent. These will be partly financed by 'green taxes' on energy, water and packaging. Coupled with a boost to public spending, targetted on infrastructural pro jects, the measures will inject a projected DKr12bn into the economy next year, equivalent to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This will inflate the budget deficit to about six per cent of GDP. But the government estimates it will push up GDP growth to 2.9 per cent in 1994 and start to achieve the target of turning round the relentless rise of unemployment. At the same time, the coalition has pledged to defend and improve the welfare state, firmly rejecting the opposition argument that Denmark's high benefits and minimum wage levels are a barrier to employment growth. The government's approach has been to set up job-sharing and job-rotation schemes and to look to the extension of education and retraining but not to attack not the wage and benefits structure. 'The welfare state gives a security that makes people less afraid of changes. We really don't believe we would be better off with lower benefits,' says Ms Karen Jespersen, the minister for social affairs. The government parties are betting that this approach will be popular with voters and will pay off when the next general election is held, probably in the autumn of 1994. The Social Democrats in particular have placed their faith in Denmark's traditional consensus around the maintenance of the welfare state. frayed by after the referendums.' I think people in Denmark very strongly want the welfare state,' says Ms Jespersen. 'Of course there is a dilemma when people call for tax cuts. But Danes accept you have to pay taxes to sustain the welfare system.' A better-than-expected performance by the Social Democrats in this month's local elections was seen within the party as evidence that it is on the right track. But it is facing sharp opposition from the centre-right opposition, spearheaded by the Liberal Party under Mr Uffe Ellemann Jensen, the fiery former foreign minister. The Liberals have shot up in popularity since the change of government, notably among younger voters, overtaking the Conservatives in the opinion polls as the main opposition party. The party made easily the biggest gains in the local elections. The Liberal aim is to achieve a Folketing majority with the Conservatives and the right-wing Progress Party at the general election. Although clearly wary of stepping outside the 'welfare consensus', it insists that the government is ducking vital structural reforms in the economy, has over-estimated its growth projections and risks pitching the country into a financial crisis such as it experienced in the early 1980s. Mr Ellemann Jensen says the government has not grasped the seriousness of the threat to west European competitiveness from Asian economies and more especially from the low-cost emerging economies of central and eastern Europe. Beyond domestic economic policy, he is also sharply critical of the government for not playing a more active role in preparing the EU to meet this challenge. 'Jobs are moving to the east - and they should be allowed to move to the east. But we have to accept the changes in our systems this calls for. We are reaching the point where the welfare system and the public sector risk tipping the boat.' These arguments find a strong echo in the industrial community. Mr Hans Skov Christensen, head of the Federation of Danish Industries, points out that the average wage in Poland of DKr6 per hour is under a 10th of the minimum wage of DKr65 per hour in Denmark. 'We have to totally reconsider the system,' he insists. 'We need more wage flexibility to keep production here in areas where we are better, we need to improve the service sector and we need much more ambitious research and development efforts.' The signs are that Danish voters will be presented with a sharper choice of policy alternatives than they have been accustomed to when the election comes around. But if the coalition can indeed bend down the unemployment curve next year while sustaining the welfare state at present levels, the electorate is unlikely to prefer the harsher medicine prescribed by the opposition.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Lucas doubles profits after cuts SHARES in Lucas Industries rose by 12p to 167p yesterday after the automotive and aerospace components group said cost-cutting had enabled it to double pre-tax profits. The Birmingham-based group again dipped into reserves to maintain its dividend and is offering an enhanced scrip alternative. Lucas announced an extensive restructuring programme last year after recession caused its profits to slump. The group has recently cut thousands of jobs and sold several businesses. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 50.3m in the year to July 31. Sales increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn, mainly reflecting exchange rate movements and increased market share. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive, said the company had not been immune to recession in the mainland European car markets and in world aircraft production. But it had nevertheless managed to increase sales 'by virtue of our strong presence in the more resilient sectors of these industries, and by success in developing new technologies and winning new contracts'. Mr John Grant, finance director, said the group had achieved Pounds 60m of cost reductions. Employee numbers fell by 4,860 to 45,709 during the year and were down by 20 per cent since July 1990. Sir Anthony said the rationalisation programme was on track and cost reductions were gathering momentum throughout the group. 'Further improvements in profitability and cash generation will be achieved as plans already in place come fully to fruition and additional actions are implemented.' As expected, Lucas declined to confirm that it had offered the post of chief executive to Mr George Simpson, deputy chief executive of British Aerospace and chairman of Rover Group, its vehicles subsidiary. Sir Anthony said merely that good progress had been made on the selection, and the board expected to make a formal announcement on or before the annual meeting in November. Disposals of businesses brought in Pounds 7.7m of profits and cash proceeds of Pounds 56m. Further divestments since the year-end realised gains of Pounds 4.7m and cash proceeds of Pounds 19m. Gearing was virtually unchanged at 45 per cent, with net borrowings of Pounds 338m. Interest costs rose from Pounds 37.4m to Pounds 43.2m. Net research and development expenditure fell from Pounds 98.3m to Pounds 90.8m. Earnings per share rose from 0.8p to 4.3p. An unchanged final of 4.9p maintains the total dividend at 7p. There is an enhanced scrip worth 7.35p per share. BZW will offer a cash alternative of at least 7.203p. Analysis, Page 20; Lex, Page 18</p>

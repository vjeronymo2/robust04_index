			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francesco De Vito: "We'll Give Europe a Good </F> Thrashing: Antonio Martino Goes to War"]    [Text] Old Pietro Nenni, who had a good understanding of  foreign affairs, liked to define the Foreign Affairs Ministry as  "the political ministry par excellence." During the formation of  Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet, however, it was the Interior  Ministry and the Institutional Reforms Ministry that were  bitterly contested, whereas no one's feathers were ruffled when  Antonio Martino was nominated for the post of foreign  minister--someone who until that moment had been presented not  as a shrewd politician but as the economic expert of Forza  Italia.    The fact is that during the entire election campaign--and  until one week before the announcement of the new  cabinet--Martino was reputed to be Berlusconi's economist and a  disciple of Milton Friedman, who provided the inspiration for  the economic policy initially of Augusto Pinochet and  subsequently of Ronald Reagan. Martino's statements had dealt  exclusively with taxes and financial strategies. He made only  one incursion into foreign policy (and that was not until the  first week in April) to brand as "stupid" Furio Colombo's  contention that the presence of neofascists in the cabinet would  cause great concern in countries friendly to Italy. This  miscalculation by the future foreign minister was no less  serious than the one he made regarding tax rates--a mistake that  threatened to damage the credibility of Berlusconi's campaign.  Someone more familiar with the world of diplomacy would not have  shrugged off the comments that for several months had been  appearing in the most influential organs of the foreign press,  and would have understood the warning issued by Beniamino  Andreatta--Martino's predecessor at the Foreign Ministry--when  the electoral pact with Gianfranco Fini was impending. "Any more  or less technical agreement with the National Alliance,"  Andreatta said, "will be interpreted by the press and  governments throughout the world as an extremely ominous  indication of a 180-degree reversal in Italian foreign policy."  Martino, however, chose to continue believing that these were  self-serving warnings and superficial judgments that resulted  from unhealthy fraternization with the foreign correspondents in  Rome.    There are two versions as to why Martino was rerouted away  from the Treasury Ministry (the cabinet post to which he seemed  predestined) to the Foreign Ministry--a move that was announced  only one week before installation of the cabinet. The first (and  most malicious) version alleges that Berlusconi's decision was  based on the fear that Martino's ultra-free market views--if  implemented without any gradualism--could cause uncontrollable  damage. Franco Modigliani found this argument convincing and  commented: "Yes, it is better that Martino be confined to the  Foreign Ministry." A second (and kindlier) version holds that  the prime minister suddenly remembered that Martino was the son  of a foreign minister: his father Gaetano had served in that  capacity from 1954 to 1957, as a representative of the Liberal  Party. Moreover, the fact that Antonio Martino has an American  wife, Carol, and speaks perfect English without any Sicilian  accent probably convinced Berlusconi that no one could direct  Forza Italia's diplomacy better than he.    Be that as it may, Martino quickly assumed his new role.  When  asked the reason for the transfer, he replied: "I am not  embarrassed to say that Berlusconi values me and is aware of the  need to strengthen our foreign policy." He painted a  self-portrait in which he defined himself as a liberal in his  politics, a free marketer in his economics, and a libertarian in  his private life. Then--moving from paradox to paradox--he added  five more definitions: conservative, radical, reactionary,  revolutionary, and progressive. He announced that his first trip  will be to the United States, and the second to Israel, "to  explain that it is not true that the fascists have returned to  power in Rome." He acknowledged, however, that his explanation  would be more persuasive if no one from the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] had been included in the cabinet. "A foreign diplomat  even told me so," he says. Lastly, he announced a policy  which--when implemented--will immediately bring about a crisis  in relations with Slovenia and Croatia. First, Slovenia cannot  enter the European Community unless it dismantles its frontier  with Croatia. Second, before entering the Community, Slovenia  and Croatia must return the property of the exiles. Third, Italy  must be accorded a form of protectorate over Istria. A certain  slogan [preceding word in English]--often used by Martino--that  contains the word "country" or "state" has taken on greater  significance, because these words are now often replaced by the  word "power."    The world press, too, is also wondering at this point about  the orientation that the new occupant at Palazzo Farnesina  intends to impart to Italian diplomacy. In Brussels, the unease  caused by the inclusion of neofascists in the government has  been heightened by the demand for more influence as a nation as  opposed to a willingness to do more to accelerate the process of  European unity. The fear is that adoption by Italy of the  positions taken by Great Britain could lead to a deceleration of  that process. Two influential press organs express this view.  "Mr. Martino," THE ECONOMIST writes, "is the closest thing to a  Euroskeptic that you will find in Italy. His ideas with respect  to the free market, his suspicions regarding the bureaucracy in  Brussels, and his opposition to the methods used to establish a  monetary union, could for the first time place Italy on the  British side in the European debate." And LE MONDE adds: "His  reputation is that of an ultra-free marketeer who is critical of  the concept of a single currency and, in general, is mistrustful  of the Europe-building effort."  <H5>  Read My Essay </H5>   Instead of to Washington, therefore, Martino's first trip  was  to Brussels, on the same day that Berlusconi asked for the  confidence of the Senate. In the Eurocapital, rather than  seeking to dispel these fears, Martino did some things that had  the immediate effect of intensifying them. He gave complimentary  copies of a 1992 essay of his--an essay very critical of the  Maastricht Treaty and the single European currency--to the  Italian ambassadors accredited to the countries of the  Community, almost as if to prompt them concerning the new  orientation. His most cordial meeting was with British Foreign  Minister Douglas Hurd. "We determined that there is a lot of  room for Anglo-Italian cooperation within the Community  organization," Hurd announced. This was matched by the coolness  of Jacques Delors. "Experience has taught me," he said, "to  judge on the basis of deeds, not words."    In Washington--his second stopping place--Foreign Minister  Martino introduced himself with a calling card that sounded  blasphemous to anyone who believes strongly in the market but  also in the rules. "Sometimes the written rules are less  effective than the unwritten ones," he declared, adding: "In the  USA the antitrust regulations, by hindering the mechanisms of  competition, often produce results the opposite of those  intended." Then, under the banner of self-aggrandizement, he  requested a seat on the UN Security Council and a post in the  "contact group" that is monitoring the Bosnian crisis. He  received a courteous refusal of his requests. It was his good  fortune that the Americans are more pragmatic than the  Europeans--and also less interested in the plan to achieve  strong political unity in Europe. Several days later Bill  Clinton in effect opened a line of credit for Berlusconi with  the words, "Let's give him a chance."    The third stopping place was Paris, on the day the  controversy with French President Francois Mitterrand was  raging. A foreign minister who is aware that he must rebuild the  image of his country would take the trouble to activate all the  diplomatic channels with a view to setting up a schedule of  direct meetings with his European counterparts. Martino did not  do this even with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, and in a  gesture of retaliation also did not attend the dinner given by  Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace.    The most serious crisis, however, is the one involving the  Slovenes and Croats. Martino reaffirmed the veto of Slovenia's  candidacy for membership in the European Community until such  time as bilateral problems are resolved. And because retaliation  calls for retaliation, his counterpart in Ljubljana, Lojze  Peterle, replied: "If Italy wishes to reopen disputes inherited  from communism, we will be entitled to reopen disputes inherited  from fascism." Even sterner was the reaction of Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman, who said: "We are confronted by an  Italian imperialism and irredentism that are attempting to link  up with the Serbian aspirations."    In the course of his peregrinations Antonio Martino attempts  unsuccessfully to calm his interlocutors by saying that in the  new government "there are five cabinet ministers from the  National Alliance, which is different from the MSI, which in  turn is not the Fascist Party." Every day reports arrive in  foreign capitals that appear designed precisely to refute his  statement. One day it was the appointment of Mirko Tremaglia,  who fought in the service of the Republic of Salo, as chairman  of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.  Another day it was the Berlusconi interview in which the prime  minister rehabilitated Mussolini in first-rate fashion. Still  another day it was a bill endorsed by Fini that would extend to  the combatants of the Salo Republic a status similar to that  accorded the Italian Army.    Germany and France are accordingly keeping their distance.  Norway has refused to meet with neofascist ministers. Belgian  Vice Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo refused to shake hands with  Italian Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe Tatarella. Greek Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreu announced that all that has been done  is still not enough. Perhaps, with the passage of time, this  pressure will ease. There remains a mistrust, however, of a  foreign policy orientation that apears to be a strange mixture  of improvisation, mini-de Gaullism Italian style, and  nationalistic chauvinism.    Piero Fassino, in charge of foreign affairs for the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left], met with Martino both before and  after Martino's appointment and judges him to be "a gracious and  pleasant person" but views the foreign policy that Martino is  carrying out as "a factor for destabilization." "For him,"  Fassino declares, "the problem is to create a single European  market, and the rest--political unity--is a hindrance. In  relations with Slovenia, therefore, he is conditioned by the MSI  people and by some sectors of Forza Italia." Beniamino  Andreatta, now the chairman of the PPI [Italian Popular Party]  deputies, avoids making personal judgments of his successor in  the Foreign Ministry but says of the Forza Italia people, "They  are carrying out a nationalistic campaign, because they are  obsessed with the desire to show their muscles."</p>

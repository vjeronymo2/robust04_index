			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Government Proposes to USA To Hold Negotiation for </F> Establishment of New Peace Arrangement" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry  of the DPRK issued a statement today on the DPRK Government's  position for the establishment of a new peace arrangement that  will substitute for the present armistice mechanism in order to  achieve non-hostile relations and rapprochement between the DPRK  and the USA and establish genuine peace and security on the  Korean peninsula.    The statement reads in full:    The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea    The illegalities of the United States in violating the  Korean  Armistice Agreement and paralyzing the armistice supervisory  mechanism have now reached the climax.    The United States wrecked the third round of DPRK-USA talks  when there emerged prospects of resolving satisfactorily the  issues with respect to DPRK-USA relations, and now is massively  deploying its Armed Forces on and around the Korean peninsula.    Despite the unanimous opposition of our people and the world  public, the United States has defiantly shipped "Patriot"  new-type missiles into South Korea for their combat-ready  deployment by the end of April, and reportedly intends to force  the "Team Spirit '94" joint military exercises, a nuclear war  game, in November this year.    The United States has already beefed up its air fleet in  South Korea with a squadron of "Apache" helicopters, and is  reported to be planning to introduce various types of  brigadesize combat armaments in the future. On the other hand,  the U.S. Naval forces, which have clustered around the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea, still stand by there, far  from breaking up.    Thus, the United States has revealed through its own actions  that it has scrapped completely the Korean Armistice Agreement,  which was signed by the United States in the name of the United  Nations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The fundamental requirements for maintaining the armistice  arrangement are non-introduction of any operational materiel  from abroad and cessation of arms buildup on the Korean  peninsula now in a state of cease-fire. This notwithstanding,  the United States has unilaterally broken the provisions of the  Korean Armistice Agreement all along ever since the very year  when it signed the agreement of July 1953, and introduced into  South Korea up-to-date military hardware, including over 1,000  nuclear weapons.    It was at least for fear of a possible exposure of its  intentional violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement that  the United States had previously engaged in a camouflaged and  clandestine introduction of an enormous quantity of its nuclear  weapons and other armaments into South Korea, but these days the  United States is shipping in and deploying its sophisticated  missiles and combat technical equipment there openly and in  broad daylight. This vividly shows that the United States has  disowned the effectiveness of the Korean Armistice Agreement and  ignores even its existence.    Over the period of a little more than four decades, the  United States has acted against its own obligations as the real  party to the Armistice Agreement, not only violating and  invalidating the provisions of the agreement systematically but  also paralyzing the armistice supervisory mechanism.    In the years that followed the conclusion of the Armistice  Agreement, the United States violated the agreement. As its own  violations of the agreement were detected and disclosed by the  neutral nations inspection teams of the neutral nations  supervisory commission, the United States unilaterally forced  the inspection teams to withdraw from the United Nations  command-controlled area in June 1956, although the inspection  teams were established pursuant to Section C of the Article II  of the Armistice Agreement. Moreover, the United States  malfunctioned the armistice mechanism in March 1991 when it  designated a South Korean Army "general" as the chief delegate  of the United Nations command to the Military Armistice  Commission, for which he is totally unqualified because of legal  irrelevance of this action to the Armistice Agreement.    Such unreasonable behaviour on the part of the United States  has now turned the Korean Armistice Agreement into blank sheets  of paper incapable of helping to ensure peace on the Korean  peninsula and reduced the Military Armistice Commission to a de  facto nominal and inoperative body in which its legitimate  component parties have ceased to exist.    So far, the United States has systematically undermined the  provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and is now threatening  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with force, while  deploying its massive reinforcements on and around the Korean  peninsula.    Such actions only add greater clarity to the United States'  ulterior intent to strangle the socialist countries in Asia,  including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The current reality is that while the United States is  behaving itself unchallenged in shipping its Armed Forces and  armaments into South Korea and in aggravating the situation on  the Korean peninsula to the brink of war at its discretion, the  Armistice Agreement has proven itself so ineffective and  helpless that it cannot play any role as an institutional  mechanism established to prevent these actions. This situation  poses a question of what are purposes the Armistice Agreement or  armistice mechanism is intended to serve.    It is quite natural that the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea will no longer entertain any expectations of the Korean  Armistice Agreement and armistice mechanism, now that they have  failed to live up to their responsibility for stabilizing the  situation on the Korean peninsula and curbing military buildup  there and they have been used for covering up the United States'  policy of strangling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    It is only thanks to the patient and peace-loving policy and  will of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the  armistice has so far stayed in place and peace has been  maintained on the Korean peninsula.    A number of complicated and acute problems, including the  nuclear issue, have cropped up on the Korean peninsula today due  to the continued existence of the armistice under which the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, the  signatories to the Armistice Agreement, are the parties to  hostilities. It is abnormal, on every account, that the state  of ceasefire of the 1950s should have lasted unchanged for four  decades up to date.    All the developments on the Korean peninsula highlight the  absolute necessity for establishing a peace arrangement, that  will replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and  substitute for the present armistice mechanism, with a view to  achieving non-hostile relations and rapprochement between the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States and  to establishing genuine peace and security on the Korean  peninsula.    In this connection, the Government of the Democratic  People's  Republic of Korea proposes to the United States of America that  the two countries hold negotiations for the establishment of a  new peace arrangement which will help to prevent arms buildup or  recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and reliably  guarantee durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula on  a practical basis. The United States must renounce its  confrontation-oriented concept and war psychology and respond to  the above peace proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico floats peso after financial crisis intensifies The financial crisis facing Mexico's new government intensified yesterday as the peso fell sharply for the second successive day. Big outflows of funds from the country on Wednesday forced the government to float the peso, abandoning a long-held policy in which the currency was kept within a specified target zone. The government, which said it would return to targeting the currency when the market had stabilised, also announced a 60-day wage and price freeze. It activated a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) credit line with the US established last March, when a political crisis threatened to undermine the currency's stability. An additional Dollars 1bn is available from Canada. The crisis calls into question the direction of economic and political policy under President Ernesto Zedillo who took office on December 1, and has left foreign and domestic investors questioning his government's credibility. The peso closed at 4.9 to the dollar in thin trading, a devaluation of almost 40 per cent since the beginning of the year. The peso closed on Monday at 3.45 and on Tuesday at just below 4.00. Mexico's stock market had risen from its lows by midday - but was still sharply down in dollar terms - and the impact of the crisis affected other Latin American markets. The Brazilian stock market closed 6.1 per cent down while the Argentine market ended 3 per cent lower. Finance ministry officials said the moves were precipitated by a drastic fall in international reserves, which made it impossible for the central bank to defend the peso and keep it within the trading band. The band had been lowered by 15 per cent on Tuesday, but it was not enough to relieve the pressure on the peso. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the finance minister, flew to the US yesterday for talks with US government officials, and also spoke to big institutional investors in an attempt to calm nerves. 'We took a pretty hard hit,' said a senior finance ministry official. 'We had to let it (the trading band) go.' The official said international reserves stood at about Dollars 7bn, down about Dollars 10bn from November 1. Reserves stood at almost Dollars 29bn in February. The IPC index, the main indicator of the Mexican stock market, closed up 4.66 per cent after zigzagging all day. But Mexican equities in New York were off sharply, with the most actively traded stock - Telmex - closing at Dollars 40 5/8 , down nearly 10 per cent. Analysts said the devaluation would make the Mexican government's 1995 forecast of 4 per cent economic growth and 4 per cent inflation obsolete. But the government stressed that the 1995 budget would remain balanced. Markets suffer, Page 6; Lex, Page 18; World stocks, Page 35; Currencies, Page 28</p>

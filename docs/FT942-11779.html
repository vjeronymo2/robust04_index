			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Kodak to return to core with drug sale Eastman Kodak, the struggling US photographic products group, plans to sell its pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare divisions to concentrate on its core imaging business. Kodak's chairman, Mr George Fisher, said the divestment plan - which is aimed at lightening the group's Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) debt, bolstering its balance sheet and freeing funds to develop the core business - was necessary because the group lacked the resources to meet the investment requirements of all of its businesses. The restructuring is Kodak's latest attempt to restore its flagging fortunes. Mr Fisher became chairman last December after his predecessor, Mr Kay Whitmore, resigned amid shareholder dissatisfaction with the group's performance. The three divisions up for sale - the drugs and consumer health products unit Sterling Winthrop, the personal care and household products business, L&amp;F Products, and the Clinical Diagnostics division - employ 18,500 people and accounted for about Dollars 3.7bn of the group's Dollars 16.4bn revenues last year. Mr Fisher would not say whether the units would be sold or spun off in a public offering. However, he said the group's partner in a worldwide drug sales venture, the French company Elf Sanofi, would be given the right of first refusal to buy parts of Sterling, which Kodak bought in 1988 for Dollars 5.1bn. Yesterday Bayer, the German pharmaceuticals group, said it was interested in buying Sterling. Kodak said it was retaining its Health Sciences division because the unit plays a pivotal role in its imaging strategy. The group's shares climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 46 1/8 . Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it would consider upgrading Kodak's debt rating in light of the divestment plan. The plan continues Mr Fisher's strategy of devoting more resources to Kodak's core imaging business. At the start of the year Kodak spun off its chemicals division, and last month it formed a unit to spearhead its involvement in the market for electronic imaging.

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: FKI FKI, the electrical engineering group, has sold a Canadian chair control business for Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) as part of its plans to dispose of non-core and poorly performing activities. The company, Doerner, had annual sales of about Pounds 12m but was barely making a profit. It was being sold for its book value to Northfield Metal Products. Proceeds came in just before FKI's March year-end. By last September, net debt had been reduced to Pounds 50m.</p>

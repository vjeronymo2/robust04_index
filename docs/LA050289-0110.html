			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Department Stores Agree to Merge: Midwest department store operators Carson  Pirie Scott &amp; Co. and P. A. Bergner said they have agreed to merge, with  Bergner acquiring Carson for $454 million. The announcement ends a monthlong  courtship of Chicago-based Carson that began when Bergner made a $282-million  buyout offer. Carson Pirie Scott operates 33 stores under its own name, 391  County Seat specialty stores and 23 Arcadia shops. With the acquisition,  Bergner's -- a Swiss-owned chain that has operated in the Midwest for 100 years  and has 33 stores in Illinois and Wisconsin -- will become one of the top 15  U.S. department store operations with consolidated revenue of about $1 billion.  </P></p>

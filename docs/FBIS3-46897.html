The task force, headed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will hold its first meeting on  Thursday evening to discuss possible agenda items and a  timetable for its activities, the top government spokesman told  a news conference.    The establishment of a government team on employment is the  first since 1986 under the administration of Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone, when the nation was smarting from a sharp  appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar.    The task force comprises all cabinet ministers except for  the  justice minister. Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata was appointed acting head of the body.    Deputy heads of the body are Economic Planning Agency Chief  Manae Kubota, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International  Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Labor Minister  Chikara Sakaguchi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato and Takemura.    Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-strong  Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), has been seeking the  establishment of a government task force on employment as the  nation's job situation is rapidly worsening.    Government reports show the ratio of job openings to job  seekers fell to a seasonally adjusted 0.65 in November, off 0.02  percentage point from October, while the nation's unemployment  rate in the month climbed to a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent,  up 0.1 percentage point.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Health union votes for Nalgo merger CHANGES IN the National Health Service's management style have prompted a 4,500-strong health workers' union to end more than 70 years of independence and join the Nalgo public service union. The Association of National Health Service Officers said the decision had been made partly because of pressure from managers to break up national bargaining in the NHS. This meant more union negotiators were needed. Mr Roy Paterson, the association's general secretary, said another factor was that changes in NHS management style had increased the number of members facing disciplinary problems and needing union representation. In addition, lay officials were finding it increasingly difficult to obtain management permission for time off work. Mr Paterson said the union had only three full-time staff, and members needed the greater resources that joining Nalgo would provide. The association's decision, approved by 79 per cent of voters in a membership ballot, highlights the trend to a smaller number of larger unions. Many observers believe there will be four or five super-unions by the end of the century and these will increasingly act as a home for smaller organisations which would otherwise struggle to survive. The association's vote comes after a year in which Nalgo has already increased its membership by 15,000 to 760,000, against a trend of membership decline in other unions. It provides a fillip for Nalgo leadership as it prepares for a meeting of activists next week to discuss its plan to create Britain's largest union - with 1.4m members  - by merging with the Nupe and Cohse public service unions. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said yesterday he was confident a special conference of more than 1,500 union members next week would reject attempts by some branches to stop the merger.</p>

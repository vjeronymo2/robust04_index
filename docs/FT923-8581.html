			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Huntingdon helped by acquisition THE ACQUISITION last December of Travers Morgan, the engineering consultancy firm, cushioned Huntingdon International through the third quarter to June 30, more than offsetting a decline in revenue from its US engineering and environmental services activities. Overall, the group lifted revenue from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 39.2m but saw pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 3.22m. Earnings per share were 2.6p (4.2p). For the nine months revenues came to Pounds 109.1m (Pounds 88.5m), profits to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 12.1m), and earnings to 8.1p (10.3p). Life sciences increased revenues by 5 per cent, while Travers Morgan lifted its revenues and improved operating margins by 11 per cent.</p>

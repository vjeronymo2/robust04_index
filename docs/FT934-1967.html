			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / People: Simonds-Gooding - new campaign Back in October, when Anthony Simonds-Gooding (right)joined the board of Lilliput, one of the UK's leading manufacturers of miniature collectables, he acknowledged that his non-executive post was 'intriguing' but hardly stretching. He enigmatically told this column to 'watch this space'. Today the space has been filled, with the news that he is joining the advertising agency Still Price Lintas as its executive chairman, from January 17. At the same time Richard Hytner, 34, has been appointed chief executive officer of the agency, which is part of Lintas Worldwide, the world's eighth largest advertising network. Chris Still, one of the agency's founders, relinquished his chairmanship in April this year and left to form another company. Simonds-Gooding's connections with Lintas go back a long way. In his 13 years at Unilever he spent 18 months at Lintas working on Lever products. 'I worked out when I met the Lintas board recently that when I last worked at Lintas, the average age of the current Still Price Lintas board members must have been about 10. So the board today is now a combination of beauty, youth and wisdom,' says Simonds-Gooding, aged 55. When in 1989 he resigned from Saatchi and Saatchi as group chairman and chief executive, going on to be chief executive of the then British Satellite Broadcasting, it seemed as though his connection with the world of advertising might be over. And when in May 1992 he took over as chairman of the Design and Art Directors' Association, some felt that it was an indication of retirement, though with the sorry mess he found at D&amp;AD, he certainly had a task on his hands. D&amp;AD is now in much better shape and clearly he was looking for a more demanding role. Still Price Lintas, which so far this year has achieved net new billings of Pounds 25.15m, may well provide that.</p>

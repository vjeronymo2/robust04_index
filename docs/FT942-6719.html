			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Puma confident of good results for year Puma, the sports shoe maker plagued by poor results in recent years, yesterday said it would make a 'significant' profit this year following first quarter earnings of DM11.5m, (Dollars 6.8m) against a DM11.8m loss a year ago. 'We have completed trenchant and some cases drastic changes,' said Mr Jochen Zeitz, chief executive. '(We have) reached our goal of working profitably again a year faster than planned.' Mr Zeitz aged only 30, took over at Puma exactly a year ago. It was an appointment that raised eyebrows in Germany's often staid corporate environment. He said the company had reduced senior management, merged certain production stages and focused on products in mid and upper prices ranges. Puma Classics, a sports shoe first made by Puma in the 1970s and which has now been relaunched, were selling especially well in the US, Mr Zeitz said. Apart from a profit of DM497,000 in 1991, the company had made a loss every year since 1986 culminating in a loss of DM68.8m last year. As part of the restructuring Puma shed 69 per cent of its workforce in 1993, leaving it with 1,081 employees. Turnover in the 1994 first quarter was DM117.1m, compared with DM117.9m in the same period last year. However, Mr Zeitz said turnover would fall this year as Puma scaled back its loss-making discounted products. Puma closed its last German factory last year and about 90 per cent of its sports shoes are now made at low-cost sites in Asia. The company is 82 per cent owned by Aritmos, the Swedish group. Rheinmetall Berlin, the German engineering and defence group, made a net loss of DM39.8m for 1993, against a profit of DM20.2m a year earlier, Reuter reports. The dividend is going down from DM8.50 a share to DM7.</p>

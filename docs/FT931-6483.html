			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Werke unveils cutbacks KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday revealed its plan to restructure its steel operations and write off more than 50 per cent of their outstanding debts. It is the largest German company to sue for protection from its creditors under the composition procedure since AEG, the electrical equipment manufacturer, more than 10 years ago. It is also the first leading steelmaker to be forced to seek protection in the latest European steel crisis. The plan, an essential step in the company's bid to negotiate a debt-relief scheme with leading creditors, was presented to the local court in Duisburg, where Klockner-Werke is based. It proposes writing off DM1.4bn (Dollars 848m) of the DM2.7bn owed by the company's steel subsidiaries, Klockner Stahl and Klockner Edelstahl. The rest of the group is not affected by the process. Creditors with their loans secured by property or other assets would receive 60 per cent payment, and other creditors, 40 per cent, the company suggests. The restructuring involves the closure of one blast furnace at the Bremer Hutte steel plant in Bremen, reducing raw steel capacity by some 700,000 tonnes, and shedding up to 1,400 jobs. The company is also negotiating with a group of investors, led by Mr Jurgen Grossmann, the former chief executive of Klockner Edelstahl, to sell its plant at Georgsmarienhutte. A decision on that proposal is expected in the next two weeks, according to a company spokesman, although it depends on the success of the composition proceedings. The legal move by Klockner-Werke, one step short of formal bankruptcy proceedings, was announced in December. The Duisburg judge will seek expert opinion on the plan from the composition administrator, and from the Duisburg chamber of commerce and industry. The judge and administrator will decide whether to summon a creditors' meeting, which must approve the plan with an 80 per cent vote if it is to succeed. Deutsche Bank is the com-pany's principal creditor, followed by WestLB, the state bank in North Rhine-Westphalia. Both are believed to support the move. The full meeting of creditors is not likely to be called before May.</p>

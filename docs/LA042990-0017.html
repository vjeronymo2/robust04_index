			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNNY WITH FOOD?  </P> <P> Concerning the April 22 letters castigating the reviews of restaurants in  France: They are from men who take critic Ruth Reichl seriously. She obviously  is a satirist who goes to great lengths to raise the ire of we poor masculine  types who pay the tab at ultra-expensive restaurants.  </P> <P> W.E. PLUTTE  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

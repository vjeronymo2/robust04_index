			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: ESFH revenue up 200% after six months ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding (ESFH), the Luxembourg-based banking arm of Portugal's Espirito Santo group, reported a 200 per cent rise in operating revenue to Dollars 132.6m for the first six months, compared with Dollars 41.6m in the same period in 1991. The sharp rise in revenue is mainly due to the consolidation of the accounts of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), the Portuguese commercial bank which was taken over by the group when it was fully privatised last February. The Espirito Santo family owned the bank before its nationalisation in 1975. ESFH net income was Dollars 18.6m, up slightly from Dollars 17.8m for the same period in 1991. The small increase is attributed to the costs of financing the acquisition of BESCL.</p>

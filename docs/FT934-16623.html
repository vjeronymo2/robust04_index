			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (5): Focus on communications  -Information technology DISTRIBUTION companies have been swift to recognise that the delivery of information is integral to the process of delivering anything else. Knowing where the consignment is, what's holding it up, and when it will be delivered can do as much for business and the customer's goodwill as delivering the actual goods. This depends on speeding information down the line to wherever it is needed. To make the process faster and more efficient for everyone, not least the end customer, different carriers may soon collaborate and co-operate in passing information. The distribution industry should have more to gain than any other in the dismantling of European trade barriers and the rise of EDI - electronic data interchange. Information technology is being pressed into service despite different data formats, incompatible systems, nationally based telephone networks, and other historical quirks imposed by working in the real world. The industry has already capitalised on such techniques as satellite tracking, the use of bar codes and hand-held scanners for data acquisition, and on-board laptop or even dashboard-mounted computers. Its advances rely not on great leaps forward in technology, but in imaginative use of what's available, with EDI as the mortar between the bricks. 'The fast movement of information and systems to speed goods through the supply chain is what logistics is all about,' says Nick Allen, editor and publisher of the niche magazine Logistics Europe. 'It means supply chain management. It concerns everything from management of stores right to manufacturing and physical distribution. Logistics Europe, launched in January to coincide with the abolition of European trade barriers, covers every aspect of logistics and distribution. The siting of high-tech warehouses is a particularly hot topic. Technology, according to Mr Allen, plays an increasing part, and is moving at a brisk pace, with radio and satellite communications, warehousing and new barcoding tools such as the PDS417 'chequerboard' which can contain information about an entire consignment. 'There's a new philosophy coming from the US which suggests that logistics is all about customer response,' he adds. 'It's led largely by the retail and grocery business.' There are, he points out, a growing number of companies large enough to take a global view, and some of them are restructuring across Europe in response to changing trading conditions. David Hobbs, associate director of the CMG consultancy responsible for consumer products, also points to the integration of all sorts of services and technologies. These offer individual advantages, but merged together are beginning to provide a seamless flow of information from manufacturing to the distribution process. In effect, the benefits - and the responsibilities - of the 'Just In Time' manufacturing ethic are being pushed further down the line, right into the area of delivery and distribution across national borders. But Mr Hobbs sees problems in the legacy of different systems and protocols in various countries. 'What clients need is a flexibility of approach to cope with rapid change. This is reflected in the move to client-server systems, wide area networks, and the ability of powerful communications to deliver worldwide logistic information,' he says. He points to the development of such technologies as satellite tracking, which can pinpoint the whereabouts of a vehicle within 30m. Information barriers here are artificial, like many a national border. MSAS, part of the Ocean Group, is an airline carrier with a crusading attitude to the removal of barriers in its industry. It has been campaigning for the clarification of electronic information transfers, regulations, and systems. These have been complicated by a number of different standards, developments and protocols governed by different bodies. 'The question is which IT system and package is going to be acceptable and compatible with the specifications dictated by regulations, procedures, trends and market forces,' says Mr Geoff Corpe, managing director. MSAS has developed its own package, Unitel 21, which it claims to be the largest integrated information system in the world, recording information as it happens, from initial booking through to pick-up, gateway despatch, flight and delivery to consignee. Adaptability, for MSAS, means fitting in with other systems used by contractors outside the air-cargo industry, and the experience of building Unitel has given Mr Corpe a global view which looks beyond air-cargo alone. 'If EDI is to come into more frequent usage, the industry body BIFA, and large airfreight operators such as ourselves must continue to drive home its benefits. The air cargo community must have a commonality of approach to message standards, and service providers. At the moment a number of EDI message formats exist such as CARGO-IMP, ANSI. X12 and EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Trade). 'But CARGO-IMP is a format designed by and for airlines, which allows only for the exchange of information between the airline carrier and community systems such as ACP 90 (Air Cargo Processing), and very soon CCS-UK (Cargo Community System for the UK). It is too restrictive if it is to be quickly available for consignors and consignees, whereas EDIFACT is the agreed international standard, recognised by the United Nations and as such should be adopted by the air industry.' TNT White Arrow Express, part of the GUS Home Shopping Group, is another leading investor in systems: GUS has invested over Pounds 65m in its IT infrastructure over the past five years. It has concentrated on the other end of the scale, local knowledge, which it has built into its delivery structure using Geographical Information Systems. Its 38 delivery depots use 'sector management,' assigning delivery rounds not by the number of parcels but by the territory. Their data is mapped using software from GB Postcoder (the Royal Mail's database of 24m UK addresses) and a 1:25000-scale Ordnance Survey map. In consensus with the local drivers, whose long-standing expertise on an area is built into the database, each address is assigned a time value. Each depot has about 400 sectors, optimised to reflect local traffic conditions and even buildings such as blocks of flats or industrial estates. The workload then becomes easier to predict and drivers are paid by work content rather than volume. 'The system bridges the gap between local intelligence and our own skills in planning,' explains Tony Lowe, White Arrow's services director. 'All our systems are developed now to improve quality of service, not just to reduce costs. It makes us more efficient, because parcels don't get returned to the depot: we know the driver can deliver the allotted load.' He claims a remarkable improvement due to the system: delivery time within three days rather than an average seven to 10 days. Future plans include onboard computers to close the final gap; that of delivery confirmation. Federal Express has used onboard computers since the 1980s and pioneered real-time shipment tracking. Its latest innovation has, like White Arrow's, been aimed at improving courier productivity. Every courier now carries an ASTRA (Advanced Sorting Tracking Routing Assistance) label printer, which eliminates human error by converting tracking data into routing labels readable by both humans and machines. Few companies have the resources of Federal Express, GUS and MSAS for development from scratch. Wincanton Storage, a specialist in transport, warehousing and distribution, has recently adopted the Miracle package from London-based Calidus Systems. Its aim is to 'drive costs out of the supply chain' by implementing the system at appropriate manufacturing and retail customers in industries including ambient, fresh and chilled food, and DIY products. Wincanton's approach is typical of future trends, which will probably concentrate less on functional organisation, and more on business processes. This is the view of Chris Smith, marketing director for software products, based in Andersen Consulting's European Software Centre in the south of France. The spread of EDI, with client-server and distributed computing has made it possible for processors and processes to communicate. 'One of the key issues is service,' says Mr Smith. 'The process of capturing and fulfilling a requirement, from order through purchasing, manufacturing and delivery could take place from different geographical locations: ordering in one country, manufacturing in another, shipping in another, invoicing from yet another. These are all possibilities becoming a reality, enabled by a different type and style of information.' However, he sounds a warning which echoes Mr Corpe's point about short-sighted parochial borders. 'As an observer, we've noted that some organisations are better able to communicate with outside partners than internally.'</p>

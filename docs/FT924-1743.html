			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Boeing, Airbus boosted by Dollars 4.1bn contract A Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.6bn) order for US Boeing and European Airbus airliners from the Californian aircraft leasing company International Lease Finance Corporation yesterday gave a boost to the civil aircraft industry. The bulk of the package of 82 firm aircraft orders went to Boeing, which secured orders for 53 airliners. But Airbus, which clinched firm orders for 28 aircraft, also won the first firm commitment from ILFC for its new 125-seater A319 jet which it hopes to launch next year. Airbus said the decision to launch the A319 programme would hinge on the consortium winning sufficient commitments from other airline customers in the next few months. McDonnell Douglas, the other big US commercial aircraft manufacturer now trailing Boeing and Airbus in the market, won only one firm order from ILFC. The Dollars 4.1bn package announced by ILFC, the second largest aircraft leasing company after GPA of Ireland, is one of the biggest single orders to be announced in the current two-year air transport industry recession. It is unlikely, however, to ease the immediate strains in the market with airlines continuing to seek to defer or cancel earlier orders. ILFC, a subsidiary of AIG, the US insurance group, appears to have decided to take advantage of bargain prices for new aircraft and engines at a time when its financially pressed rival GPA is in the midst of negotiations with its bankers and with manufacturers to defer orders. The move will provide some relief for the big aircraft and engine manufacturers and their suppliers. Rolls-Royce said it would supply Dollars 160m worth of engines to power some of the aircraft ordered by ILFC. The US General Electric group won contracts worth Dollars 1bn for engines to power 51 airliners. ILFC ordered aircraft from the entire range of Airbus jets including the wide-body A300, A310, A330 and A340 as well as the narrow-body A320 and A321. Six A319s were also ordered. Apart from the 28 firm Airbus orders, it took eight additional options for Airbus jets. The Boeing orders include its latest wide-body, the 777, as well as the 747-400 jumbo, the 767, the 757 and the 737. Mr Steven Udvar-Hazy, ILFC's president, said he hoped the orders 'will be a sparkplug to return confidence to the airline industry'. US stocks, Page 37</p>

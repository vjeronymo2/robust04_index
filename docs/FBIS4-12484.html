			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Yemen's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Salim  Basindwah arrived in Tehran yesterday and was officially  welcomed by Iran's foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati. This  visit's aim is to submit the Yemeni president's message to  Iran's president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to hold talks within  the framework of mutual relations, as well to exchange views on  most important regional and international issues.    To this end, in a meeting that was held by Iran and Yemen's  foreign ministers, expansion and strengthening of ties between  the two countries in political and economic fields, as well as  the international situation, were discussed. During the talks,  the two sides stressed unity and solidarity among the Islamic  countries as (?necessary for combating) plots hatched by the  enemies of Islam in view of the two countries' common history  and religion. The two countries also expressed their  willingness to expand mutual relations.    In this connection, Iran's foreign minister, Dr. Velayati  said: The foreign forces cannot guarantee regional security,  hence expansion of cooperations among the Islamic countries is  necessary for strengthening the world of Islam. Dr Velayati  said: If such a strong cooperation existed in the world of  Islam, the enemies of Islam would not dare to occupy Palestine  in the heart of the Islamic countries.    In part of his speech, Iran's foreign minister informed the  Yemeni foreign minister of Iran's support for the reunification  of Yemen, and described as effective the solving of Yemen's  problems and the existence of a powerful Yemen in creating  stability and peace in the region.    The realities of political conditions and equations in the  region and the world are such that these countries have no  option other than a realistic attitude toward regional issues.  Such an attitude requires them to move in a direction in which  expansion of all-sided regional relations, both political and  economic, should enjoy top priority. At any rate, the  experiences of the past few years have shown that although the  regional countries, due to certain problems, have failed to have  desirable relations, there are valuable chances, a sound and  logical use of which can strengthen solidarity among the  regional countries more than ever in the past.    In this connection, the Yemeni foreign minister's visit to  Iran is an effective step that can be assessed within the  framework of long-term objectives in expanding all-sided  cooperation. These objectives are expected to receive further  attention of the two countries' officials and to obtain  desirable progress during the Yemeni foreign minister's visit to  Tehran.</p>

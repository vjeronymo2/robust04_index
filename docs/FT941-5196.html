			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / People: Redland constructs From specialist publishing to roof tiles, bricks and concrete - Paul Hewitt, 37, is moving from being finance director of Euromoney to be finance director at Redland, one of Europe's biggest building material groups. Hewitt has been appointed to succeed Gerald Corbett who at the end of last year was announced as the new finance director of Grand Metropolitan the food and drinks group. Corbett, who leaves Redland at the age of 42, had managed the company's financial affairs for six years and had been particularly adept in minimising the company's tax and interest liabilities. He will be a difficult act to follow. Robert Napier, Redland's chief executive said yesterday: 'Over the last six years Paul Hewitt has played a key role in the successful growth of Euromoney including its international growth.' Euromoney Publications, 75 per cent-owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust, lifted pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 17.7m in the year to September 30. Redland in the first six months of last year increased pre-tax profits by 22 per cent. Hewitt, who will commence duties at Redland this summer, was educated at St Paul's school and Cambridge University before qualifying as a chartered accountant at Arthur Andersen. He has been finance director at Euromoney since 1988.</p>

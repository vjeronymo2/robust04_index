			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ELWAY SAYS BRONCOS NOT ON THE BALL THIS SEASON  </P> <P> John Elway, the quarterback with the great arm and the bum foot, stood by his  dressing chamber with his head down.  </P> <P> Silence.  </P> <P> Soon he would have to talk about yet another Bronco loss to the man with the  microphone standing in front of the television camera.  </P> <P> Elway has guided the Broncos to three Super Bowls. He has lost all three. This  season, further evidenced by the Broncos' 19-7 loss to the Chargers Sunday at  San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, he won't likely get a chance to win his first or  lose his fourth.  </P> <P> What's the problem? "We're stopping ourselves too much," Elway said. "We just  made too many mistakes."  </P> <P> Two of which were his. He was intercepted twice by cornerback Gill Byrd.  </P> <P> "I didn't throw the ball well on the move today," Elway said.  </P> <P> Elway finished 17 of 30 for 171 yards and a touchdown. On the Broncos' final  offensive play, his pass intended for Vance Johnson fell incomplete. Then the  Chargers took over and ran out the clock.  </P> <P> There was much ado about his toe and foot injury. It slowed him somewhat, but,  as Byrd pointed out: "John being a little nicked up is still more mobile than  most quarterbacks."  </P> <P> Asked if the Broncos are flat coming off last year's Super Bowl loss to the  49ers, Elway said: "No, I don't think we have a Super Bowl hangover this year.  But in '88 we did. We need to make some plays, and get some confidence. We're  going to take it one game at a time until they say we're mathematically out of  it. We still have a chance."

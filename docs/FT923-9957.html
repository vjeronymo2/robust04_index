			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Japanese data show setbacks for economy NEW job offers in Japan fell sharply in June and consumer prices in Tokyo were slightly lower last month, reflecting the slowdown in economic activity that prompted the Bank of Japan to cut official interest rates this week. The ratio of job offers to applicants fell from 1.14 in May to 1.08, the lowest in four years, the Labour Ministry said. Most big companies have announced plans to reduce staff intake this year, and a few smaller ones have been laying off staff recently. New job offers in the manufacturing industry fell 23.5 per cent on the same month last year, with a 60 per cent fall in demand for seasonal and part-time workers. However, there is still a labour shortage in service sector businesses and in some factories. The ratio of job offers peaked at 1.47 in March last year, and has since fallen consistently, prompting the ministry to start a study into sectors with a surplus of workers. Meanwhile, housing starts in June rose a slim 1 per cent on the same month last year, with a 20 per cent increase in starts for rental houses, but a 41 per cent plunge in starts of houses for sale, the 15th consecutive month of decline, the Construction Ministry reported. The Bank of Japan argues that the bottoming-out of the housing market, at least in the rental area, means an economic recovery is not far away; but apartment prices are still declining and the share prices of leading property developers have fallen sharply over the past month. The central bank was reassured by the 0.4 per cent fall in Tokyo consumer prices this month, the first decline in five months, as it reinforced the bank's view that the inflation threat has receded. Evidence that Japan's slowdown may be intensifying prompted the Daiwa Institute of Research, linked to Daiwa Bank, to revise downward its growth estimate from 2.8 per cent to 2.5 per cent for the fiscal year to March.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Work schemes cut German jobless total GERMAN unemployment has fallen sharply and industrial production in the west increased, government officials reported yesterday. However, the federal labour office warned of 'considerable' job losses to come in the east, and Economics Ministry figures showed most output growth came from construction. The 166,000 drop in the March jobless total was relatively evenly balanced between both parts of the country. A net reduction of 70,200 in the east brought down the number officially without a job to 1.2m - 15 per cent of the work force. However, Mr Heinrich Franke, head of the labour office, said the decline did not reflect any change in real conditions in the eastern labour market. Numbers had declined mainly because of the extension of government-funded labour market support measures. Around 120,000 people formerly registered as jobless, had been given places in work creation schemes or had taken early retirement. In the west there were 1.77m out of work or 5.8 per cent of the workforce. The fall was due mainly to exceptionally mild winter weather. The weather also contributed to a 22 per cent west German building output in January and February. This helped industrial output for the two months to a 1.8 per cent rise.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Letter: CBI concerned at penal rent liabilities arising from assigned leases Sir, Your leader ('Tenants squeezed', April 6) raises an important problem that will worsen given the current recession and the massive over-supply of commercial property. The CBI receives daily complaints from people facing demands for rent for property they assigned, with the landlord's consent and often many years ago, because the present tenant cannot pay. Small businesses are being forced into bankruptcy and their owners into penury (and sometimes illness) through no fault of their own. In the worst cases, landlords have allowed many months of arrears to build up, and made no serious attempt to force the present tenant to pay. Some tenants continue to use the premises rent free. For if the landlord pursues the forfeiture procedure he would, if successful, then be unable to claim rent from the previous tenants. This cannot be right. In 1988, following a two-year review, the Law Commission recommended urgent reform. But nothing has happened. The CBI supports the compromise proposed by the Law Commission: tenants should only guarantee the covenants of their immediate successor. We proposed that the landlord would retain a right to indemnity from the previous tenant for 10 years and provided there are not material changes to the property, only if he: notifies the previous tenant he proposes to hold responsible for the rent within one month of the current tenant defaulting; secures vacant possession for that previous tenant if the latter wishes; and if he advises that previous tenant of the name and address of the other previous tenants (if any) who are equally liable to contribute to unpaid rent. VAT liability is also concerning tenants. Since 1989, landlords have been able to charge VAT on commercial rents. Should the tenant go bankrupt, or not pay for over one year, the landlord may deduct the unpaid VAT from his output liability. However, the previous tenant would be liable for the VAT and be unable to claim recovery as the payment was not for services received. This again cannot be right. CBI members accept that many long leases of major properties are held as pension fund investments. They realise that rents were fixed after indemnity provided by previous tenants. But our Common Market partners (and Scotland) do not similarly penalise tenants. The proposals put forward by the Law Commission and the CBI strike a fair balance between landlord and tenant. The Lord Chancellor should consider them, and urgently. John Banham, director-general, Confederation of British Industry, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL PARKS OFFER NATURE STUDY WITH A TWIST  </P> <P> Through the eyes of a trout or from the inside of a volcano, visitors to  America's national parks can get a new perspective on the wilderness.  </P> <P> Usually thought of in terms of gorgeous scenery, the parks have a little  something extra these days: outdoor summer-school courses on campuses that  embrace vast expanses of mountain and desert.  </P> <P> For example, you can study:  </P> <P>  -- The curious habits of the grizzly bear.  </P> <P>  -- Life in a mountain stream through the eyes of a trout.  </P> <P>  -- The brilliant sky of a summer night.  </P> <P>  -- Volcanoes, as seen from inside the crater of Mt. St. Helens.  </P> <P> Visitors to more than a dozen of the nation's popular parklands can enroll in  these and many other college-level courses lasting from a day to a week or  more.  </P> <P> The courses are offered by more than a dozen outdoor institutes and other  educational organizations closely associated with national parks and forests.  They are not U.S. Park Service programs, but several of the institutes are  operated by national park support groups and are within park boundaries.  </P> <P> Because they often provide low-cost lodging, institute programs can be one of  the least expensive ways to visit a national park, whether you go as an  individual, with friends or as a family group.  </P> <P> Special educational institutes operate at such popular national parks as  Yellowstone and Grand Teton in Wyoming; Olympic, North Cascades and Mt. Rainier  in Washington; Crater Lake in Oregon; Yosemite in California; Canyonlands and  Arches in Utah; Rocky Mountain in Colorado; Big Bend in Texas; Everglades in  Florida, and Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee.  </P> <P> Yellowstone Institute, one of the largest of the educational organizations,  offers more than 80 courses annually from its headquarters at Buffalo Ranch in  the lightly visited Lamar Valley area of the park.  </P> <P> Among the more adventurous of the institute's classes is a five-day  horsepacking expedition following the probable route taken in August, 1877, by  the Nez Perce Indians, led by Chief Joseph as they tried to flee the Army. The  area "was wild and rugged then," notes the institute's catalogue, "and remains  so today."  </P> <P> The ride covers about 20 miles a day. One aspect of the trip is learning how to  travel in the wilderness without damaging the fragile country. The course,  offered July 30 to Aug. 3 and Aug. 9-13, costs $405 per person, which includes  food and horse.  </P> <P> A topical course is "Fire Ecology,"three days of exploring the response of the  park's vegetation to the massive forest fire two summers ago. The instructor  will lead field trips to areas of both old and recent burns.  </P> <P> You should be in good physical condition, because at least one five- to  six-mile hike is planned. The cost for this course, offered July 30 to Aug. 1,  is $105 per person, which covers only class activities.  </P> <P> A most popular course each year, available at several parks, is "Alpine  Wildflowers." At Yellowstone the class is scheduled for two days, July 9-10.  Participants make day trips to the high country of the Beartooth Plateau to  study wildflowers found only in an arctic environment. The instructional cost  is $75 per person.  </P> <P> The Yellowstone Institute is one of several that can provide low-cost  accommodations for participants. Its Lamar Valley ranch has 13 rustic cabins,  each with two or three single beds and not much else. None of the cabins has  electricity, plumbing or heating, but bathrooms, showers and a communal kitchen  (you cook your own meals) are available in a nearby classroom building.  </P> <P> You must take a sleeping bag, and you may be expected to share a cabin with a  stranger. However, the fee for a cabin bed is only $7 per person a night. The  institute calls the experience "indoor camping."  </P> <P> The ranch is in the least-traveled part of Yellowstone where the principal  vegetation is sagebrush and grass. It is an area frequented by herds of elk and  bison, black bears and an occasional grizzly.  </P> <P> All of the institutes listed below are nonprofit organizations that have a  close affiliation with one or more national parks or forests. Many, like the  Yellowstone Institute, are within a park. They are sponsored by one or more  organizations that may include colleges and museums.  </P> <P> Most offer programs for adults as well as elementary- and high-school-age  children, although not necessarily at the same time. Several offer summer  courses designed for vacationing families.  </P> <P> A few play host to Elderhostel groups, in which the minimum age is 60. The big  season for classes is the summer, but programs are offered all year at  warm-weather parks such as Big Bend.  </P> <P> College credit is available for several of the institutes' courses, although  there is usually an additional enrollment fee. The programs have proved  especially popular with schoolteachers, who compose a large percentage of  summer participants.  </P> <P> Class sizes are limited, often to no more than a dozen, and many fill up months  ahead. Travelers who would like to visit one of the parks and join an institute  course should send for a course catalogue as soon as possible.  </P> <P> Among the nonprofit organizations providing educational programs in America's  park and forest lands:  </P> <P>  -- Yellowstone Institute: Entering its 15th season, Yellowstone offers the  widest variety of summer courses for adults. Its 24-page catalogue lists such  subjects as the grizzly, elk, wolf, Indian history and edible plants.  </P> <P> "Streams Through the Eyes of a Trout" is a three-day program for experienced  anglers, scheduled for Aug. 13-15 ($105). You wear a wet suit so you can watch  trout behavior directly. Family programs on other outdoor subjects are  available.  </P> <P> Course fees vary, but generally begin at about $75 for a two-day class and $105  for a three-day class. Accommodations are at the institute's Buffalo Ranch in  the Lamar Valley in the northeast section of the park. A dorm bed in a rustic  cabin is $7 a night per person. Limited kitchen facilities are provided for  cooking.  </P> <P> For information: Yellowstone Institute, Box 117, Yellowstone National Park,  Wyo. 82190; (307) 344-7381, Ext. 2384.  </P> <P>  -- Glacier Institute: One- to five-day classes focus on the ecology and  wildlife of Glacier National Park.

The fee for food and instruction is $85 per person, and you  must provide your own camping equipment.  </P> <P> Entering its third season, Pacific Northwest Field Seminars offers 55 summer  classes in 13 national parks and forest lands in Oregon and Washington.

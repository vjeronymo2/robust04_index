			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROGRESS THREATENS TO DIM LIGHTHOUSE  </P> <P> As the Coast Guard boat skims across Boston Harbor, it draws closer to the  island lighthouse, one of only five manually operated lights in the United  States. Salt water sprays off the rocks while sea birds circle around a lobster  boat a little ways offshore.  </P> <P> For 273 years, lighthouse keepers on Little Brewster Island have used the  beacon to guide ships safely. But if the Coast Guard's plans are carried out,  Boston Light, the oldest lighthouse site in the country, will become just like  450 others, lit by automatic switches instead of by people. Automation would  save the Coast Guard about $10,000 a year.  </P> <P> For Dennis Dever, keeper of the lighthouse, the change will mean a different  job. "I'll definitely be sad to leave it," he says. "I love the job out there.  It was sort of a common way of life a couple hundred years ago. Now it's a  unique way of life."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts is pushing to keep "the crown jewel of  American lighthouses" in its original, manually operated state. He recently  petitioned the Senate's Subcommittee on Transportation with his plan.  </P> <P> Senator Kennedy hopes to "buy time for Boston Light" by obtaining the $125,000  needed to operate it for the next 12 months from the subcommittee and Related  Agencies, says Kathi Anderson, a legislative aid.  </P> <P> The issue will be taken up in this month in Congress. If Congress votes funds  to keep Boston Light manned another year, a feasibility study on the light's  future will begin under the auspices of the Department of Environmental  Management and Historic Boston Inc.  </P> <P> The issue touches the hearts of many Bostonians. One group that has been  involved is the Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands Inc. "People come to  Boston from all over the country to see historic monuments," says Sheila Lynch,  vice president of the Advocacy Committee for the group.  </P> <P> Lynch has mobilized citizens to write to Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg of New  Jersey, chairman of the subcommittee on transportation and related agencies,  which holds the purse strings in the lighthouse debate.  </P> <P> If funds don't come through, and the lighthouse is automated, the Massachusetts  Department of Environmental Management staff will maintain the grounds. The  Coast Guard will still be responsible and legally liable for the foghorn and  the light.  </P> <P> "The best solution," says Lt. John Brooks of the Coast Guard, is to combine  automation with a caretaker, which could be paid for by a citizens group. Even  this, however, says Brooks, is disappointing because "it's a page of history  that's closing, and there's a certain sadness there."  </P></p>

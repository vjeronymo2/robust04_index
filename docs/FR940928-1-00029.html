			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> warning that which serves to warn, give notice or caution <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Webster's Third International Dictionary (unabridged): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> caution&blank;a warning or admonishment especially in counselling vigilance, due attention or consideration, safety or reservation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning&blank;a notice, bulletin or signal that serves to caution of the approach of danger <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, the latter dictionary lists the two words as synonyms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency believes that it is more appropriate to base its decision about these two words on the similarity of their dictionary definitions than on the ANSI standard. The public is presumptively familiar with the common usage and meaning of these words, as reflected in their dictionary definitions. Conversely, all but an extremely small portion of the public is likely unaware of the ANSI standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the similarity of the dictionary definitions, the agency believes that the public will not have any greater reaction to the use of ``WARNING'' than to ``CAUTION.'' Either word choice provides an appropriate attention-getting visual cue. However, it is worth noting that, if the ANSI distinctions were to be applied in determining the appropriate word, the stronger work, ``WARNING,'' would be preferable to ``CAUTION'' because it more accurately describes the potential degree of injury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also notes that S5.5.2 of Standard 213,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Child Restraint Systems,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> requires that each rear-facing child seat bear a label that contains the signal work ``WARNING,'' advising that the seat should not be used in air bag-equipped seating positions. NHTSA has difficulty understanding Advocates' strong reaction to the word ``WARNING'' on the sun visor label given that it did not object to requiring that the same signal word be placed on the child safety seat itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advocates also is particularly concerned about the possibility that the word ``WARNING'' will cause some people to want to deactivate the air bag. NHTSA is considering a request from the American Association of Automobile Manufacturers for a rulemaking that would permit a manual cutoff switch for the passenger side air bag in vehicles with no rear seat. The purpose of the cutoff switch would be to allow drivers to deactivate the air bag in that passenger seating position when a rear-facing infant safety seat is placed there. Advocates speculates that the two rules would have a detrimental synergistic effect. It believes that some passengers in these vehicles would use the cutoff switch to disable their air bags, not for the intended purpose of protecting an infant in a safety seat, but because they are frightened by the word ``WARNING.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advocates' concern is premature, speculative, and addressed to the wrong forum. NHTSA has not made any judgment about what, if any, kind of cutoff switch it might eventually permit. When NHTSA issues an NPRM, it will provide Advocates and other members of the public with an opportunity to submit comments to the rulemaking docket for that rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advocates also posed a procedural objection to the agency's permitting the use of ``WARNING.'' It believes that it had the right to submit its views on the use of the word ``WARNING.'' Advocates states that it relied to its detriment on what it said was NHTSA's representation in the final rule that only the term ``CAUTION'' would be used. It stated that the choice of terminology should be determined through rulemaking instead of interpretation. Advocates believes that, as part of that rulemaking, the ANSI scheme should have been presented to the public for comment. Advocates apparently did not realize that the Suzuki request was treated as a petition for rulemaking, even though the March 10 rule stated that the September 2 rule was being amended, something that cannot be done through an interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Administrative Procedure Act requires notice and comment procedures for most substantive rules, such procedures are not needed for minor technical amendments, such as permitting the use of a synonym on an information label. Since ``CAUTION'' and ``WARNING'' are synonyms in common usage, the addition of ``WARNING'' will have no practical impact on the public's understanding of and reaction to the label. Thus, the amendment allowing the word ``WARNING'' was essentially technical in nature. Further, the agency had already obtained public comment on essentially the same issue as a result of the December 14, 1992 notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the wording of the label. Accordingly, an additional opportunity for comment was not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the foregoing, there is no reasonable possibility that the order requested in the petition will be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Therefore, this petition is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30162; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on September 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23910 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

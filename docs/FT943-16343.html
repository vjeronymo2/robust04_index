			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beholden to no one but the client Sir, In his article of June 11 ('When he dies my dear, all this will be yours'), Peter Marsh wrote: 'Although many independent advisers ensure that clients get good value for money from respectable organisations, there are many others who are forced to sell poor quality products because they are tied agents trapped in a commission structure which requires them to sell or starve.' I feel that the construction of the sentence could cause confusion. The problem is with the use of the word 'many' twice. If this word is deleted the confusion disappears. To correct any confusion caused, it should be stated that 'independent advisers' and 'tied agents' are distinct categories, and no one can be in both camps; that independent advisers cannot be forced to sell poor quality products - they are wholly independent of producers; and, to make the difference even more plain, that independent advisers, alone, are the agents of their clients and beholden to no one else.

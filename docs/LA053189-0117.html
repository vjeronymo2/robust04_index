			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Local banks and savings and loans, long in need of capital, are under more  pressure than ever before to raise their levels of capital -- the basic fund  that protects them from unforeseen losses.  </P> <P> New regulations coming out of Washington are requiring banks and S&amp;Ls to  bolster their capital base, and those regulations are forcing the traditionally  lower-capitalized S&amp;Ls to come up with hard-to-get dollars.  </P> <P> The easiest place to get that cash for some institutions is to cut out  dividends, and two major S&amp;Ls in Orange County have done just that.  </P> <P> The latest, the parent of FarWest Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach, said  recently that it was terminating its quarterly 10-cent-per-share dividend "for  the foreseeable future."  </P> <P> Previously, Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach had stopped making  its quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share.  </P> <P> But some of the stronger S&amp;Ls, as well as most banks, which typically have  twice as much capital as thrifts, are continuing to pay cash dividends.  </P> <P> One parent of a local bank, Eldorado Bancorp in Laguna Hills, said it was  increasing its quarterly cash dividend by a penny, to 7 cents a share. In  August, Eldorado raised the dividend to 6 cents from a nickel a share. The  company, which operates eight Eldorado Bank branches in Orange, Riverside and  San Bernardino counties, said the increases reflect the company's strong  earnings and its effort to return about 20% of those earnings to shareholders.  </P></p>

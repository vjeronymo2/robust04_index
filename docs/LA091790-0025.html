			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> MELISSA ETHERIDGE PUTS BLUES, LEVITY INTO FOLK, ROCK  </P> <P> One of Melissa Etheridge's most popular songs is "No Souvenirs," but don't tell  that to the merchants in the Wiltern Theatre lobby, who were doing a reasonable  business Saturday during the opening of her four-day stand. Many of the shirts  and scarves were emblazoned with the title of her year-old gold album, "Brave  and Crazy."  </P> <P> Some other equally appropriate manifestoes, suitable for album title or  T-shirt, came to mind -- like "Co-Dependent and Bluesy" or "Obsessive and  Raspy."  </P> <P> Bonnie Raitt may be the pre-eminent blueswoman in pop music nowadays, and  Etheridge, a former folkie who still usually strums an acoustic guitar in front  of her minimal band, can hardly be said to work in that genre.  </P> <P> But she's got the tenor of the blues down as pat as any prominent female rocker  out there,in her own '70s-based, singer-songwriterly style.  </P> <P> She has also learned to be wary of those who would type her as a perpetual  "wronged woman," even if that is part and parcel of the cathartic blues well  she gets her sustenance from.  </P> <P> Midway through Saturday's show, Etheridge began introducing a song from her  debut album that she claimed she was reluctant to continue to perform. It  reinforces, she said, the public misunderstanding of her image as a self-made  victim who thrives on romantic torture.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, she began describing a lonely situation -- "Pretty soon all you've  got is you, yourself and your precious pain." And with that, she launched  unabashedly into the ballad of that name, which, as might be expected,  romanticizes the hurt of heartbreak.  </P> <P> It's a narrow canvas indeed that Etheridge paints on, and whether you see it as  unduly tragic or not, it's a mightily self-obsessed one as well in this day of  social consciousness. On the other hand, her second album marks a great leap  forward from her first, being less a pity party of the "Precious Pain" sort and  more a rich, involving, personal exploration.  </P> <P> Moreover, her persona takes on a distinctly different color live thanks to her  consistent playfulness, be it in a dramatic dart of the eyes or a witty turn of  her terrific barroom growl. The needed levity is more clearly there on stage.  </P> <P> At least two-thirds of Saturday's sold-out crowd was female, extremely unusual  for a rock show, New Kids concerts and other under-18 attractions withstanding.  They no doubt respond to Etheridge's dual qualities of victim-ness and defiant  aggressiveness.  </P> <P> This wasn't Etheridge's most triumphant night as a performer. The set was  almost identical to the one last October when she headlined five nights at the  Roxy, and it's no surprise that she doesn't have quite as much fire to put into  the same material after another year's worth of touring. Her highly charged  version of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" -- sandwiched between "Bring Me Some  Water" and "Like the Way I Do," her two most favored numbers -- is now, as  then, the highlight of the show.  </P> <P> Britain's Martin Stephenson &amp; the Daintees is the opening act on most of  Etheridge's tour. Their Celtic-soul-influenced set picked up extraordinary  steam in its last two numbers with the introduction of an all-important tuba.  </P> <P> Besides Wiltern shows on Tuesday and Wednesday, Etheridge plays Saturday at the  Santa Barbara County Bowl.  </P></p>

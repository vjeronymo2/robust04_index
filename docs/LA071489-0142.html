			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL PLANS FUND-RAISER FOR THEATER  </P> <P> Backers of a 1,500-seat performing arts center in Mission Viejo are moving  forward with plans for a fund-raising event and a broadening of focus to the  entire south county area.  </P> <P> More than 20 members of an advisory board for the theater met for the first  time Wednesday, laying the groundwork for the fund-raiser Oct. 14 at the  Mission Viejo Mall, according to board chairman Christian W. Keena, who also  serves as mayor pro tem of Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Keena said the group hopes to raise $100,000 at the event for a feasibility  study and preliminary drawings for the theater, which the board would like to  see located on the campus of Saddleback College.  </P> <P> With representatives on the advisory board from the college, the Mission Viejo  and Rancho Santa Margarita companies and the cities of San Juan Capistrano,  Dana Point and San Clemente, Keena said, the project is becoming regional,  rather than municipal. "The college," he said, "has become the focal point for  the performing arts in south county."  </P> <P> The DeBartolo Corp., which owns the shopping center, and the Mission Viejo Co.  have contributed cash and staff support for the fund-raiser, which will  celebrate the mall's 10th anniversary, Keena said. Tickets for the event, which  includes food and entertainment, begin at $25. MARK I. PINSKY  </P></p>

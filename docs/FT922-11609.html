			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Keep a European perspective - The Tories' fourth term / Don't be seduced by the markets' post-election resurgence: the bad news was in the price. And interest rates still depend on Germany REMEMBER NORMAN Lamont's second budget? In what seemed at the time to be a brilliant campaigning coup de theatre, Labour's shadow budget robbed it of virtually any publicity. Now that the red mists of political uncertainty have cleared, it bulks much larger on the tax landscape. What will be the impact of the Conservatives' election victory? The direct effects on after-tax income were well rehearsed. Virtually everybody will now receive an extra Pounds 100 a year, thanks to the introduction of the 20 per cent tax band on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Meanwhile, they avoid the prospect of an effective top marginal rate of 59 per cent, which would have hit hard at the disposable incomes of the wealthy. The record receipts for both Business Expansion Schemes - initial estimates suggested takings were up 59 per cent for the 1991-92 tax year at Pounds 407m, despite the recession - and personal equity plans, proved that many savers were worried by this prospect. However, what are the longer-term implications for savers and investors of the Tories' fourth term? It is as well not to be too seduced by the markets' resurgence in the immediate aftermath of the victory. A lot of bad news was in the price, and the market was artificially depressed. It is also as well to remember that the FT-SE index rose only 8.3 per cent during the Tories' third term, which began at the height of the bull market. The average UK growth unit trust rose only 8.6 per cent in the five years to the start of this month. The runaway bull market which led to the crash in October 1987 is unlikely to be repeated. But the outlook must look better for savers on a number of factors: Equities will almost certainly perform better than they would have done under Labour - consensus estimates see the FT-SE at around 2900 by the end of this year, compared with 2600 if the government had been ejected. House prices may begin to recover as confidence returns. Lenders reported that market activity was beginning to pick up, but was snuffed out by the beginning of the campaign. Now, confidence, plus the chancellor's stamp duty 'holiday', should stimulate more demand. Interest rates should have a chance to come down - certainly, sterling has been spared the test it would have undergone had Labour won. That should be good news for borrowers, even if it is not particularly exciting for savers. However, it is as well to keep the election result in the European perspective it virtually never had during the campaign. While the UK remains in the exchange rate mechanism, further cuts in base rates will, to a great extent, depend on cuts in German base rates. And do not forget the high public sector borrowing requirement, which John Smith condemned in apocalyptic terms. That should dampen any great ambitions for the UK economy over the next two years. But the National Savings products that are produced to help finance it are worth looking out for.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Italy's centre parties launch offensive Italy's centre parties have launched a desperate offensive to avoid being squeezed to insignificance by the big coalitions to their left and right in the March 27 general elections. Centrist leaders yesterday began a series of measured attacks focusing on disagreements within the Progressive Alliance led by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the potential cost of media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi's economic programme. Until now the two principal groupings forming the centrist Italian Pact  - the Popular party (PPI), formed from the defunct Christian Democrats, and referendum leader Mario Segni's Pact - have been marginalised. But in the past few days the centrists have taken heart from a growing feeling that neither the left nor the right are likely to win an outright parliamentary majority. They are thus hoping to play a broker's role in forming the next government. Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the Republican party leader and part of the Italian Pact, said yesterday: 'In the past few days the centre has relaunched itself because people have realised there are not two but three voting options . . . They also have woken up to the fact that today's alliances on the left and right would be tomorrow's government if either wins outright.' He and other centrist politicians also highlighted the contradictions in the position of the PDS's principal ally, Reconstructed Communism, formed from the hardline rump of the old Italian Communist party. Reconstructed Communism supports raising taxes on government bonds and withdrawing from Nato. At the same time, Professor Mario Baldassari, the chief economist of the Pact, said the free market proposals of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia platform risked a drop of some L45,000bn (Dollars 27bn) in budget revenues. He said yesterday the programme would be impossible to carry out without raising the ratio of debt to GDP to well over 125 per cent by 1995. Mr La Malfa went further and claimed that a government formed solely from the right - Forza Italia, the populist Lombard League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - risked provoking a confrontation with Italy's trades unions. This in turn put at risk the July 1993 tripartite agreement between employers, trades union and the Ciampi government linking wage increases to productivity and ending wage indexation. Coinciding with these criticisms, the former Socialist prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, has been pointing to the need for a broad-based government. Both Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, and Mr Berlusconi have been hinting that this was an option they could support. Playing on the large number of undecided voters and the fear of a polarised result is the best tactic available to the centre. Nevertheless, the Italian Pact and its leader, Mr Segni, still risks being the main victim of the new first-past-the-post voting system that covers 75 per cent of parliamentary seats. Both the left and right appear to have acquired a critical mass of support, making it hard at the constituency level for Pact candidates to get the most votes.</p>

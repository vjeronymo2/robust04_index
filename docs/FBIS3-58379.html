The  heads of state and government of the military alliance decided  to express their concern about the conflict in former  Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]    Several delegations, including Belgium's, refrained from  setting a timetable for intervention, recalling that it is not  up to NATO to launch air strikes, since operations in the area  are made at the request of the United Nations. Here is Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene speaking in an interview with Willy  van der Vort:    [Begin Dehaene recording] Let us say that NATO has clearly  confirmed its willingness and its support for intervention, but  that these are UN actions, and the decision has to be taken by  the United Nations. So, contrary to the impression that might  have been given after the statement by the secretary general  yesterday evening, there is no misunderstanding between the  United Nations and NATO. What NATO is putting forward today are  actions to be implemented within the United Nations, and the  final decision will be taken by the United Nations.    The Serbs said yesterday that air intervention against their  positions in Bosnia could have serious consequences. We have to  keep this in mind, but I think at the same time that to remain  without action is fraught with another danger, namely that the  Serbs will think they can do what they like.

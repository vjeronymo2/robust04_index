			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Farnell buoyed by ESD buy and organic growth FARNELL ELECTRONICS, the electronic equipment distributor, reported a 16 per cent increase in profits in the six months to July 31. However, the sale of a non-trading subsidiary - taken as a non-recurring item - lifted profits by another Pounds 6.37m and pushed the pre-tax increase up to 64 per cent. Profits, before the exceptional item, rose from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 15.4m on the back of last year's acquisition of STC's distribution business, ESD Distribution, and a strong performance from Farnell Electronics Components, the group's main division. Sales, helped by recent acquisitions, rose to Pounds 126.8m (Pounds 81.8m), while operating profits increased to Pounds 16m (Pounds 11.7m). Electronic equipment manufacturing, which remains profitable, has been split into three divisions: power supplies; components and instruments. Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, said: 'When I took over there were different trade names operating at different sites competing in different markets. Following an internal review of equipment manufacturing we have decided to refocus the division.' The interim dividend is increased to 2.8p (2.6p). Earnings per share, excluding the non-recurring item, increased to 7.5p (6.5p). COMMENT Important as ESD's contribution has been to Farnell it should not overshadow the fact that within the midst of the deepest recession since the war, organic growth was still responsible for 7 per cent of the increase in pre-tax profits. The only black spot is the German operation which is likely to remain in the red for at least another six months. However, Germany notwithstanding, the group is still expected to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.5m, giving earnings per share of 18p. This puts the shares - down 3p to 312p - on a prospective multiple of 17.3. Given its UK performance the premium rating looks fair.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. General Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule with comment period contains final regulations for the provision of Medicaid home and community-based services under waivers granted under section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act (the Act), and for the provision of respiratory care services as an optional benefit under the Medicaid program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home and community-based services are those medical assistance services provided under a State waiver that are not otherwise available under a State's Medicaid plan. These services: (1) must be furnished in accordance with an individually written plan of care that is subject to approval by the State Medicaid agency; and (2) may be furnished only to persons who, but for the provision of such services, would otherwise require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility (NF) (formerly referred to as a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or intermediate care facility (ICF)), or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR). (Under section 4211(a)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, the distinction between SNFs and ICFs under the Medicaid program ended, effective October 1, 1990. Both of these facilities are now categorized as NFs, as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, effective October 1, 1990. We generally use the acronym ``NF'' throughout this rule unless we are quoting directly from a statute or providing an historical reference. Medicaid recognizes two types of long-term care facilities_NFs and ICFs/MR.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respiratory care services as medical assistance may be provided as an option under the Medicaid program, as authorized and described in sections 1902(e)(9) and 1905(a)(20) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 1, 1988, we published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 19950) proposing to revise the Medicaid regulations governing the provision of home and community-based services under waivers and respiratory care services. This rule proposed to codify in regulations section 9502 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Public Law 99&hyph;272, enacted on April 7, 1986, and sections 9408, 9411, and 9435(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99&hyph;509, enacted on October 21, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four additional public laws have been passed that contain provisions that impact on the proposed rule. These laws were enacted either immediately preceding or subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule. The public laws are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, enacted on December 22, 1987 (sections 4102 (b) and (c), 4118, and 4211);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360, enacted on July 1, 1988 (sections 411(k)(10)(A) and 411(k)(10)(H));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TMRA), Public Law 100&hyph;647, enacted on November 10, 1988 (section 8437); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted on November 5, 1990 (sections 4741 and 4742).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule with comment period, we are incorporating provisions of these public laws that relate to many of the regulatory provisions in the June 1, 1988, proposed rule. We are inviting public comments on the revisions that we have made to this proposed rule in response to these legislative changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have also revised the proposed regulations in response to public comments. We received, on a timely basis, 16 letters from individuals, associations, State agencies, and providers of services (primarily home health agencies). While most commenters supported the provisions in the proposed rule, the majority also expressed interest in expanding the waiver program. Some commenters correctly noted that the proposed rule did not include statutory changes made by OBRA '87, MCCA, and TMRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we have made a substantial number of revisions to the proposed rule in response to legislative changes, we have organized our discussion in this preamble by specific subject areas. We are using this organization to group all of the additions and revisions to each subject in one place. We are presenting the legislative basis for the proposed rule and any subsequent legislative provisions that changed or added to the provisions of the proposed rule. We are following the legislative foundation with a discussion of the proposed regulations for that area, any public comments we received, and our responses to the public comments. We conclude each topic with a description of the applicable provisions contained in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

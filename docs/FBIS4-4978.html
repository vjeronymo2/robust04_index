			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime  Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has assured foreign investors of  protection of their intellectual property rights in the country.    The foreign investors can bring their technical know-how to  Malaysia secure in the knowledge that the rights would be  protected, he said in his message in a special supplement on  Malaysia's achievements in technology published in the April  issue of the scientific American magazine.    Malaysia would soon introduce the industrial design AIT  which  would protect the intellectual property of both Malaysian and  foreign investors, he said in the message entitled Technological  Competitiveness Towards 2020.    He also said that with excellent infrastructure, trainable  human resources and a congenial business atmosphere, Malaysia  offered an outstanding profit centre for high technology  business.    Dr. Mahathir said the country already has the Patent Act  which encouraged Malaysians to be innovative and inventive.    The sustained high investment in education over many years  in  Malaysia was paying off, where a vast pool of well-educated men  and women was available, he said.    Our workers are highly motivated, trainable and eager to  learn while their positive work culture, ethics and attitudes  have resulted in the industries being cost-effective and  efficient.    Even though wages have been rising steadily, increases in  quality and productivity continue to position Malaysia as a very  competitive location for many kinds of industries, he said.    Malaysia's political stability was also a positive  attraction  for investment in the country, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia continued to pursue an open  philosophy, open to joint ventures and open to contributing  Malaysia's share to the technologies brought in and transferred  to the country.    In the increasingly competitive global economy, it is  imperative that we tap the best available resources, both human  intelligence and material, irrespective of where they come from,  he said.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC JAM IN VALLEY FAILS TO OCCUR  </P> <P> Traffic moved slowly but major problems failed to materialize today on the  Ventura Freeway when five ramps were closed as part of a lengthy widening  project, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> "We expected a major traffic tie-up but it went really smooth this morning,"  CHP Sgt. Steve Santoro said. "It was stop-and-go traffic, but it moved quicker  than expected. I think a lot of people took heed and scheduled more time for  their commute. If they followed directions, they had an easy commute."  </P> <P> Ramps that were closed include the westbound on-ramp at Topanga Canyon  Boulevard, the westbound off-ramp at Parkway Calabasas, the westbound and  eastbound off-ramps at Valley Circle and the eastbound off-ramp at Fallbrook  Avenue.  </P> <P> Caltrans opened two freeway bypass routes in Woodland Hills to help ease the  flow of traffic to and from areas such as the Warner Center and Calabasas.  </P></p>

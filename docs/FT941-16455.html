			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: MIM sells 4% Renison stake for ADollars 43.7m MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, has sold its 4 per cent interest in Renison Goldfields Consolidated, in a deal worth ADollars 43.7m (USDollars 29.3m). The sale follows a review of non-core assets and was undertaken at ADollars 5.50 a share, or ADollars 12.8m below MIM's book value for the stake. It is believed that the shares, which were sold through Potter Warburg, the Australian broker, were bought by a single offshore entity. The ADollars 260m takeover bid by the Normandy Poseidon group for fellow Australian minerals group, Aztec Mining, has been put on hold by legal action. Aztec is seeking further disclosure from Poseidon Gold, the Normandy Poseidon subsidiary which is making the bid. The hearing, in the Federal Court, has been adjourned until January 12.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SHORTAGE OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS  </P> <P> The March 1 article neglected to include the major reason for a lack of  vocations. Vocations are given by God, but fostered or killed by the family  environment. Given the average Catholic family is neutral or outright negative  towards religious vocations coming from their children, coupled with an  emphasis on being successful in a materialistic sense, it is no wonder that so  few respond to God's call.  </P> <P> Until we as Catholics put our faith first in our lives instead of as merely an  appendage, we will continue to have few priests. It has been said that we are  given the number of vocations that we deserve. Nothing could be more true.  </P> <P> FATHER ROBERTO PIRRONE  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

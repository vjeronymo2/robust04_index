			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 9 Jun (TANJUG) -- The document signed in  Geneva falls far below our expectations, far below what had been  demanded, Aleksa Buha, minister of foreign affairs of the Srpska  republic told the SRPSKI GLAS daily in Banja Luka today.    "The warring sides were requested in an imperative way to  agree to a four-month cessation of hostilities in order to reach  a political solution in the meantime, but the Muslim side did  not accept it." In addition, the warring sides were requested  to negotiate without setting any conditions, but the Muslim side  did not abide by that either, Buha said.    "The Geneva document has been treated as the first step  toward reaching an agreement on the cessation of hostilities,  while negotiations to this end will begin in a few days," Buha  said. "Another part of the agreement contains an obigation for  the three sides to exchange POW's on the all-for-all principle  in the meantime; that is, before the new round of negotiations."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, April 7, IRNA -- Visiting Vice-Speaker of  Iran's Majles Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani and Syrian  Vice-President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam discussed important  developments in the region as well as international issues and  matters of mutual interest here today.    Deploring the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime,  Ruhani said that Israel through such practices has proved that  it was not seeking to attain peace and stability in the region  or let Palestinians achieve their legitimate rights. The  Zionist regime, under the increasing pressure from the intifada  and frustrated in its attempt to suppress the Palestinian  uprising, has resorted to negotiations to maintain its security  and get a grip on the region's economic resouces, Ruhani said.  He stressed that Iran will stand by the Syrian Government and  nation in their confrontation with the Qods occupying regime.  As for Tehran-Damascus ties Ruhani epressed pleasure over the  intimate relations between the two countries and voiced Iran's  readiness for further expansion of ties in all domains including  parliamentary and economic areas.    Khaddam said that despite the passage of 30 months after the  start of [word indistinct] Israeli negotiations, there has been  no progress in the so-called peace talks. He added that it was  unlikely for Israel and Syria to end hostility in a near future.  The Zionist regime, he said, was dreaming of taking control of  the region and materializing its hegemonist goals. Khaddam  reiterated that nobody should think that the struggle against  the Zionist regime would end. The Syrian vice president, too,  welcomed the idea of broadening bilateral ties through  continuous contacts between Tehran and Damascus.    In another development Ruhani met with general secretary of  the Lebanese Progressive Party Walid Junblatt at Iran's Embassy  here today where the latter briefed him on the lateut  developments in Lebanon. Ruhani expressed hope that the  Lebanese people would manage to bring about solid unity between  Islamic and nationalistic forces in that country. He called on  the Lebanese people to neutralize the enemy's plot to sow  discord among them, assuring them that nations always win over  aggressors.    Ruhani, who is here on a five-day official visit, said that  Iran will continue to support the Lebanese people in their just  defence against Zionist crimes. Junblatt stressed that as long  as southern Lebanon is under Israeli occupation, resistance in  the occupied territories will continue.</p>

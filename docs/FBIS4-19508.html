			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Advice to New Executive From Abete, </F> Agnelli"]    [Text] (ANSA) Verona, April 15 -- Luigi Abete, head of the  private employers' association, Confindustria [General  Confederation of Italian Industry], and Gianni Agnelli, chairman  of Italy's largest private company, Fiat, both gave some advice  to the next government on the closing day of the Confindustria  general conference here on Saturday [15 April].    Abete, who leads the powerful industrial association which  recently signed two ground-breaking labor accords with  government and trade unions, said he had four simple  suggestions, "four little measures" to be taken by a new  government that will presumably be formed after parliament  elects its speakers.    Confindustria, Abete said, would like reinvested company  profits to be made tax deductible. He said he did not want this  to be a "discount" but a "just differentiation between profit  and revenues."    Second, Abete asked that company taxes be reviewed because  of  "the country's difficult moment," referring to recession. Abete  then suggested that "something be done for the job market,"  adding: "We want more part-time and term contracts." Lastly,  Abete asked the government to review laws on government  contracts, which have been virtually frozen since corruption  scandals erupted; "We want clear relations with politics," he  said.    For his part, Agnelli said Italy's market and industry are  evolving, becoming more efficient, "fair and just for  consumers," but they are doing so very slowly. The new  government, according to Agnelli, "has the chance to work well  to lead and accelerate this change."    Before leaving for Rome, where the life senator is taking  part in the election of the new Senate speaker, Agnelli, too,  called for "greater mobility and flexibility" in the labor  market and for a reduction in fiscal pressure, especially of  direct taxes and of taxes that prevent small- and medium-sized  companies from accumulating risk capital.    He also asked for legislation favoring investments for  research, training and exports, and called for raising the  mandatory school age limit from 14 to 16.    Agnelli also suggested creating tax incentives for  industrial  restructuring, speeding up privatizations, and warned that  current debate on granting increased autonomy to regional  authorities must proceed very carefully, "through calm and  constructive discussions without controversial exasperations."</p>

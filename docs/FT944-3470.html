			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Franc falls as Delors steps down from poll line-up French financial markets reacted anxiously yesterday to the decision by Mr Jacques Delors, the head of the European Commission, not to stand as the Socialist candidate in next spring's presidential elections. His announcement on Sunday that he would not contest the vote after leading in the polls for the past few weeks was seen as a devastating blow to the Socialist party which would hand victory to the right. But it raised fears of factional feuding within the conservative ranks and a challenge from more nationalistic politicians to Mr Edouard Balladur, the Gaullist prime minister, and now the favourite for next year's election. The French franc fell to FFr3.44 to the D-Mark from its Friday close of FFr3.432. Pressure on government bonds pushed yields on 10-year securities up by 10 basis points to more than 8 per cent. However, the currency and French bonds recovered some lost ground in afternoon trading. Although Mr Balladur holds economic views similar to Mr Delors', economists pointed to the risks of divisions on the right. 'Balladur could face a challenge from those who are less committed to anti-inflationary policies and progress towards a single European currency,' said a senior economist at one French merchant bank. 'What seemed like a straight Balladur-Delors contest with little risk in policy terms has become more open,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros. The Socialist party admitted the setback dealt by Mr Delors' departure. 'We have lost our best player and so we have a difficult match to play,' said Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the party leader. The French press was more pessimistic. 'Good-bye Delors, Ciao the left, Hello Balladur-Chirac,' was the headline in the daily Le Parisien. Economists said the French franc would remain vulnerable in the run-up to the elections.

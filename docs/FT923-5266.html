			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / 'Germany bond' plan to boost federal budget: Bonn seeks ways to pay for costs of unification A NEW financial instrument, the 'Germany bond', to help Bonn plug gaps punched in the federal budget by the costs of unification, was suggested yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. The issue would offer interest earnings below market rates, but holders' income would not be taxable, he said. He also proposed that workers taking time off for sickness should work overtime without pay to compensate. The money thus saved would go instead towards care for the elderly. The government, which has repeatedly promised that there will be no further tax increases, is now searching desperately to find ways of raising revenues through indirect methods. The initial task is to fund the DM150bn (Pounds 53.7bn) pumped by Bonn each year into the east of the country. But Bonn is also under pressure from the Bundesbank, the central bank, to rein in public spending and reduce national debt at a time when the economy is under strain because of recession abroad and stagnation at home. Germany's total public sector debt - DM1,170bn, or 41.7 per cent of gross national product at the end of last year - is on target to hit 50 per cent of GNP at the end of 1995, or DM2,000bn. As Mr Waigel said yesterday at a meeting of the federal association of taxpayers, some DM350bn of the total accounted for debts run up by the former east German government and the Treuhand privatisation agency. Accumulated debts of the railway system are also heading towards DM400bn. Meanwhile, the state-subsidised health service will report a DM10bn deficit this year alone. Other revenue-raising ideas which have emerged in recent weeks include motorway tolls or increased oil duties - hence more expensive petrol - ostensibly to cover the cost of subsidising the railways. Health service patients are also being asked to pay an extra DM3bn in charges to ease the welfare system's deficits. Mr Waigel's latest suggestions followed a much-derided idea from other coalition politicians that high earners should be forced to buy non-interest bearing bonds if they did not invest in east Germany. While the minister said the idea was worth considering, he appeared concerned about the effects of such a novel instrument on capital markets, interest rates and on the standing of Germany in the markets. But it should be examined, he told a meeting of the federal taxpayers' association, together with other 'unconventional' measures - such as his own version, the Germany bond. The minister said such a low-interest offering, which would not be liable for the 25 per cent withholding tax on investment income which takes effect next January, could attract back to the 'homeland' some of the capital which had been 'parked' outside Germany in recent months. The government, forced to tax investment income by a constitutional court ruling, introduced the new levy despite fears of capital fleeing into Luxembourg and other relative tax-havens as the year's end approaches. Mr Waigel said money raised by such an issue could be used to pay off eastern Germany's old debts. His reference to the 'homeland' suggests an appeal for a patriotic response from investors and taxpayers. German riots, Page 2</p>

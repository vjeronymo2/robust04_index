			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Books: Dirty dealings in high places SPIDER'S WEB: BUSH, SADDAM, THATCHER AND THE DECADE OF DECEIT by Alan Friedman Faber Pounds 17.50, 455 pages Although it is not immediately obvious, this is a book about foreign policy at the end of the Cold War. True, Spiders's Web has nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with communism, and nothing to do with superpower conflict; but it has everything to do with the persistence of a certain kind of Cold War decision-making, and a certain set of Cold War assumptions, into the present era. The story told by Alan Friedman is the now familiar tale of massive, high-tech, covert British and American arms sales to Iraq in the years leading up to the Gulf War. The arms sales began in the early 1980s, when Iraq was at war with Iran, Ronald Reagan was president, and covert operations were not only acceptable but fashionable in Washington. This was an era when patriotic secret agents were still expected to lay down their lives for the American president or Her Majesty's Government, and any foreign policy tool was acceptable if it furthered the cause of Western democracy. Within that context, strategic support for Iraq made sense; America was justifiably worried about Iran's influence in the Gulf, and the use of secret arms sales to check Iran was neither better nor worse than the use of secret arms sales to support UNITA in Angola, the contras in Nicaragua, or any one of a dozen other causes of various degrees of merit around the world. Friedman believes that the policy was more dangerous than this, but that is because he is able to see the arms sales in the light of the Gulf War, because he knows how hard the American government had tried to hide the truth about them since the Gulf War, and because he knows how carelessly those pursuing the arms sales in the Bush administration ultimately became. Relying on a select and highly secretive group of advisors, shockingly ignorant of technical details President Bush, James Baker, his Secretary of State, and several British government officials pursued the policy of support for Iraq, including what amounted to support for the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme, far longer than normal security considerations would seem to dictate. But why did they do it? partly out of a wholly legitimate desire for influence in the Gulf; and partly out of a desire to increase trading contacts between America and Iraq, and to thereby 'embrace Saddam in a cocoon of moderation'; British and Italian officials who became involved did so out of a desire to help their national arms industries. In Friedman's account, it also sounds almost as if President Bush pursued the arming of Iraq out of sheer arrogance, love of conspiracy, and a desire to play important, secret games in the manner of his predecessors. On the ground, the 'foot soldiers' had more mixed motives, and they are wonderfully sketched. There is Fred Habosh, the washing machine salesman who got hooked on arms sales and received a gold watch with a portrait of Saddam Hussein in exchange; Frank Machon, the British security service's very own lorry driver; Christopher Drogoul, who arranged loans for the Iraqis via the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and wound up in prison for his efforts on behalf of American policy; and of course the men from Matrix Churchill, who appear in this book as a small part of a much wider conspiracy. Some of these agents sought to perpetuate arms sales and loans for the sake of financial gain. Most, however, carried out their duties out of patriotism - the sort of patriotism that had kept such people motivated throughout the Cold War. To Frank Machon, for example, the son of a British military intelligence officer, the shift from driving politically dangerous cargo through Eastern Europe to driving weapons to Iraq was confusing, providing 'none of the clear policy markers' he was used to; nevertheless, he kept it up out of faith in the British government's wisdom. it was only later, when that government betrayed, threatened and harassed him that he went to the press with a story about clandestine arms sales to Iraq. Indeed, most of the sources for this book appear to be disgruntled former intelligence agents, people who would have been happy to do the government's bidding and keep silent, but who would not do so for the sake of arms sales to a Middle Eastern dictator, or for the sake of governments which refused to stand by them when trouble came. This is an impeccably researched book, one which manages to tell several interlocking stories at once. Friedman never loses the main thread of his argument, and the expose is complete: It will be impossible, in the wake of this book, to argue that the American and British governments did not condone arms sales to Iraq, did not lend money to Iraq, did not create the 'Frankenstein' of Saddam Hussein whom they eventually had to destroy. Friedman's achievement is especially remarkable given that he suffered from some of the same sort of harassment as other bit-players in this drama. Yet in the end, the whole episode looks not so much like a scandal, but rather like an extremely costly and wasteful mistake. It was a policy which had a purpose in one era but was pursued for too long into another, with the help of arrogant officials who refused to take responsibility for their actions. In the end, those in error preferred to deny the truth, control the damage, and ruin the lives of those who had assisted them.</p>

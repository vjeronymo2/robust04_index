			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Ignorance outstrips knowledge - Alternative science is all very well but there is a limit SEVEN EXPERIMENTS THAT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD by Rupert Sheldrake Fourth Estate Pounds 15.99, 269 pages Open-mindedness is an intellectual virtue. History is cluttered with the wrecks of grand theories which died of dogmatism. Unless we remain alert to the possibility that our beliefs are false, however well they seem to work, we might miss opportunities to learn; for the world is stranger than we think, and our ignorance far outstrips our knowledge. Such reflections prompt people like Rupert Sheldrake to venture what might be called 'alternative science'. This consists in devising unorthodox solutions to problems which orthodox science cannot solve. It also includes taking seriously the beliefs of children, mystics and stone-age people, on the grounds that modern science has forced us to shed much wisdom by its reductively piecemeal approach. Sheldrake offers us alternative science as thus conceived. He suggests experiments on the psychic faculties of pets, the homing ability of pigeons, and the organisation of termite colonies, to test whether his favourite notion, that of a 'field', will explain their behaviour. Sheldrake hypothesises that everything is surrounded by fields which transmit influences and information, and which link creatures to others of their kind and their homes. The experiments he proposes are intended to test whether such fields exist. Sheldrake offers the same solution to other puzzles, like 'phantom limbs' as sensed by amputees, and the experience of feeling that one is being watched. He claims that both can be elucidated by postulating that our minds are fields 'reaching out through the senses, projecting far beyond the surface of the body.' But Sheldrake does not confine himself to suggesting explanations for puzzles. He also mounts an attack on orthodox science for not taking alternative suggestions seriously. Scientists, he says, are 'the servants of military and commercial interests'. Their objectivity as enquirers is an illusion; some falsify their results to get fame. Their minds are closed against anything unusual because orthodoxy blinds them. They define the speed of light and gravitational attraction as constant values, whereas these values in fact fluctuate, showing that chaos or at least radical changefulness is more truly characteristic of the universe. Such are Sheldrake's views; and they amount to a farrago of shallowly and sloppily argued nonsense. The key notion of a 'field' is left unexplained, usefully for Sheldrake because the vaguer a notion is, the more it explains; the most we are told is that fields 'resemble elastic bands'. His account of perception, as quoted, is that mind 'reaches out through the senses', which, he approvingly notes, is what uneducated folk like children and cavemen believe. He quotes bizarre anecdotes as evidence; the field explanation of phantom limbs is demonstrated by the case of a man who kept his amputated finger in a jar in the basement, and found that when his phantom finger felt chilly it was because the basement was cold. Such stuff speaks for itself. The best example of Sheldrake's logic is his claim that the speed of light varies, based on the fact that investigations have yielded varying values. Naively assuming that each measurement was accurate, he takes this to prove his point. It seems to have escaped him that different measuring techniques, equipment, mistakes or other factors might explain the differences. Attacks on scientific scepticism are standard among alternative theorists. They fail to recognise this as one of science's strengths. They take its disdain of their hypothesisings as proof of a conspiracy to conceal the truth. Books like Sheldrake's, therefore, demonstrate why scientific scepticism is absolutely necessary.</p>

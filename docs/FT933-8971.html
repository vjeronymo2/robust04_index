			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sibelco raises stake in Watts Blake to 45.7% SIBELCO, the private Belgian company embroiled in a hostile bid for Watts Blake Bearne, yesterday purchased 14.8 per cent of its target's shares from concert party partner Quarzwerke of Germany. The purchase leaves Sibelco with control over 45.7 per cent of the world's largest ball clay producer, following the 0.6 per cent acceptances announced last week. Sibelco has offered shareholders 420p a share or the option of taking loan notes instead of cash. Quarzwerke had backed the bid from inception and had already agreed to sell its shares at 420p to Sibelco before the end of 1994. The German company will take a deferred consideration, similar to the loan note offer, payable on September 30 1994. Sibelco's bid was triggered by the decision of Ceramics Holdings, a third concert party partner, to sell its 15.6 per cent stake. The three, who between them held 45 per cent of WBB, had agreed that if one party wanted to sell and the others failed to buy, the whole stake would be put up for sale. When buyers failed to come forward after several months, Sibelco decided to add Ceramics' stake to its own 14.8 per cent holding, triggering a mandatory bid under the Takeover Code.</p>

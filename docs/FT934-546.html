			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Lord Gowrie to take over from Lord Palumbo Lord Gowrie in Trafalgar Square, London, yesterday after the announcement that he is to take over from Lord Palumbo in April as Arts Council chairman, Antony Thorncroft writes. Lord Gowrie was arts minister from 1983 to 1985 but resigned from the government saying he could not afford to live in London on a ministerial salary of Pounds 33,000 a year. In 1987 he became chairman of auction house Sotheby's Europe. He is to resign this post on December 31 but will continue as a director. The Arts Council chairman is unpaid but has the use of a car. It is believed that Lord Gowrie was the first choice of Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary. Apart from his time in government he has spent most of his career in the arts, as an art dealer, poet and critic. His particular interests are music, the visual arts, and cinema. During his chairmanship the council will take over responsibility for distributing National Lottery revenue to the arts.</p>

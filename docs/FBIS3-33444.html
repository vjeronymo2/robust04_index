			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments through 22 February:    According to a poll conducted by the Central Statistics and  Data Processing Office, OCEI, 17.4 percent of the active young  population is unemployed, which equals 340,677 youths.  Statistically, Venezuela still has a high proportion of youths,  with persons between the ages of 15-24 making up 48.7 percent of  the population. The overall unemployment rate is 6.6 percent.  (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p 12)    There has been a drastic and unprecedented drop of two and  one- half points in the foreign debt bonds since midday on 14  February. They now stand at 67.50 points, which translates to  losses of approximately $2 billion. Traders say this is  basically due to three factors: Standard and Poor's  announcement that Venezuela has been reclassified as a country  of great investment risk; the U.S. inflation rate announcement,  which affects U.S. 30-year bonds, which in turn affects  Venezuelan collateral bonds; and a domino effect in various  banks following the weekend news on financial system  destabilization. (Caracas EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 15  Feb 94 p 15)    The administration of outgoing President Ramon J. Velasquez  reports that during 1993 capital and investment expenditures  amounted to 212.049 billion bolivares, equivalent to 19.3  percent of total expenditures. During the same period, 33.1144  billion was authorized for debt repayment, which represents 3  percent of total expenditures. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish  15 Sep p e-12)    The OCEI reports that the value of imports dropped 13.3  percent to $10.986 billion in 1993, compared to $12.672 billion  in 1992. Imports for December dropped 17.7 percent compared to  November and 28.3 percent compared to December 1992. (Madrid  EFE in Spanish 0001 GMT 17 Feb 94)    Banco Union President S. Henry Benacerraf has denied reports  from Colombia that Banco Union in Venezuela, as well as its  branches abroad, are experiencing problems and facing an  intervention process. Benacerraf said "the institution is  experiencing its best times ever." The bank president added  that Banco Union is "third in productivity." Benacerraf said  that in 1993 the Union Bank recorded a 1.753-percent increase  compared to figures for 1992. Benacerraf believes that the mix  up occurred last week after an intervention in the Union Federal  Bank in the United States was announced. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA  ECONOMIA in Spanish 17 Feb 94 p 11)    The OCEI reports that nontraditional exports reached $222  million in January, which represents a 19-percent increase over  January 1993 exports. On the other hand, the December 1993  export figures were 26.7 percent higher than the January 1994  figures. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 18 Feb 94 p  16)</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: A conservative view from the north side  -Andrew Jack suggests Coopers &amp; Lybrand's new chairman will seek organic rather than radical change Two expensive arch-roofed, high-technology structures stand facing each other in central London. Both sit on the River Thames, on opposite banks. Both span railway tracks. The similarities do not end there. On the south side is the temporary terminal for the long-postponed Channel Tunnel, trial runs of which began this month. On the north side is Embankment Place, British headquarters of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, which acquired a new boss at the start of this month. Judging by the views of Mr Peter Smith, Coopers' newly-appointed chairman, his organisation is as likely to experience lengthy delays to plans for change as is its neighbour. Sitting last week in his office overlooking the Thames and reflecting on his first few days, Mr Smith lists themes familiar to his firm and those of his competitors, rather than providing any hint of radical change in the coming months. 'You won't suddenly have people here with pink-spotted ties,' he says. Smith was elected late last year to a five-year term (which he hopes will be renewed) in Coopers' first contested battle for the top job in the firm. He joined in 1967 after gaining a degree in economics from Southampton University, became a partner in 1975 and rose to become head of the London office in 1989. He is politically active, holding several jobs with the Beaconsfield Constituency Conservative Association and is lead partner for the firm's work as auditor and adviser to Conservative Central Office. Internally, he puts forward three objectives for Coopers during his time in office: being the best; remaining a full service firm rather than concentrating on niches; and bringing together multi-disciplinary teams organised around business sectors so that 'it is the client who is supreme'. He says he will not have been judged to have done his job unless the firm expands at a greater pace than the forecast rate of growth in the UK economy of 2 to 3 per cent a year. He also aims to 'grow profits'. Smith's approach sounds very similar to that of many of his rivals. The question is whether he can achieve it in an enormous, and some say unwieldy, organisation of 700 partners, which last year reported fee income down 4.2 per cent to Pounds 553m. The stronger international networks are epitomised by Arthur Andersen's single worldwide organisation, and echoed in recent restructurings by Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young. The 'industry-facing' groups have already been most prominently adopted by KPMG Peat Marwick. There are some distinguishing characteristics. Smith suggests that Coopers will have 'priority markets' where it believes there will be greatest growth, including telecoms, insurance, retailing and the regulated industries. He also highlights (like the Andersen organisation) what he calls 'human resource advisory services', providing actuarial and personal tax advice, and other management services related to the installation of new systems and corporate restructuring. 'There was a period when there was an element of jumping on the bandwagon - that if you don't do this you may lose your position,' he says. 'Now we are looking for growth in key markets. The 1990s is going to be distinctly different.' The success of Coopers' strategy will partly depend on Smith himself, who highlighted the results of a personality test he had taken in a manifesto circulated to his partners during last year's election contest. The test classified him as 'introverted sensing with thinking', characterised among other things as like people who are: 'Serious, quiet, matter-of-fact, logical, realistic and dependable. Make up their own minds as to what should be accomplished and work toward it steadily regardless of protests and distractions'. In the manifesto, which he described as a 'Maoist style self-criticism', he said he had worked to improve his listening skills since the test, but warned he could be 'tough and decisive when the need arises'. Smith argues that there will be growing differentiation between the large accountancy firms, as they gravitate into markets where the competition comes from non-accountants. This will make fee income tables comparing the firms meaningless. 'The old measuring points are beginning to be a bit redundant. They are a bit of a pig's breakfast at the moment. I don't see that it makes sense to aggregate high level intellectually-based consultancy services with hangers of people running computers,' he says. Internally, he is fostering more work to develop non-financial indicators to assess performance. 'Financial numbers have become totems. I am anxious to avoid the feeling that people are driven by the need to sell services. Otherwise they get very close to being double-glazing salesmen.' One transformation he emphasises is the growing dominance of technology within Coopers. 'The service firms poured millions of pounds into technology but it's very unclear whether they gained advantage in internal management. The secretarial resource level is as it was.' He says Coopers has signed agreements for the development of customised software to support its work in areas such as tax and auditing. He wants to see all working papers put on computer. Smith sees no return to the 'profligate' 1980s when people were collected by the firms, but he expects recruitment of students more closely tied to the firm's objectives to begin rising gently again, coupled with a commitment to greater training. Organisationally, he says there are no plans for a change in the number of offices around the UK, but he predicts that each will become less a fiefdom in its own right with most services provided regionally. On two of the firm's more notorious episodes in recent years, Smith is defensive. Last month Coopers was issued with writs by the administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation in connection with its audits of the company for 1987 and 1989. 'We have done our reviews. We are content with the work that was done,' he says. 'The joint monitoring unit (the audit regulators) has reviewed certain parts of our business and concluded that nothing requires rectification. They probably found the odd thing but have not cast any doubt on our underlying procedures. I have no problem with the quality of the Coopers audit.' Two Coopers partners were also reprimanded by their professional body for accepting the administration of Polly Peck International when the firm was already working for the company and Mr Asil Nadir, its former chairman. 'Our conflict of interest procedures at the time of the merger (with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells) didn't give us the information that was necessary,' he says. 'We are in compliance to the full now. I don't think it impinges in any way on the firm's integrity.' That leaves Smith with two more public campaigns. The first is his support for the big firm's call to limit their liability in audit negligence lawsuits. The second is his desire to restore judgment to a profession being driven by an increasing number of rules, notably in accounting standards - two issues that will be welcomed by his accounting competitors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Excerpt] The Papua New Guinea [PNG] Army has sent  reinforcements onto the main island of Bougainville where 17  people were massacred in a rebel ambush on Wednesday [23 March].  Among those killed was a six-year-old girl. Richard Pilferman  earlier today spoke to PNG correspondent Sean Dorney, who is in  Madang with the business delegation:    [Begin recording] [Pilferman] According to reports that have  come out of Buin in southern Bougainville, there were two  truckloads of people with military escorts and the resistance  fighter escorts heading down from the Tabago Care Center, which  is basically a refugee camp, to the coast to pick up food  supplies, and they were ambushed as they passed through a  village on the road. According to these reports, they were fired  on from all sides and most of the dead -- there are 13 people  who've been fighting against the BRA [Bougainville Revolutionary  Army] -- 12 of those members of the resistance forces and one  Papua New Guinea soldier. Now the media can't get into  Bougainville, knowing the danger of traveling the country with  the Queensland investment delegation, and I believe that last  night the Papua New Guinea police minister told the delegates  the Bougainville crisis was all but over. It would appear that  that's not quite true.    [Dorney] The government has been trying to believe that it  is all but over and that's what they've been telling everyone  for the last few months. In fact, Mr. Wingti on his trip to  Australia gave a similar story to Bob Hawke. Six months ago,  the government did have the Bougainville rebels pretty well  contained in a central Bougainville area in the mountains there.  But the pressure's been let off and in recent weeks we've seen  a real upsurge in rebel activity on our part of the mainland, in  fact, the main road down the east coast now is not safe from  Buka right through to (Lomahi,) which is where military  headquarters are. For the situation has tumbled well out of  control in recent weeks, and the government is going to have to  take it very seriously now because there is trouble blowing up  in areas that previously were considered quite safe.

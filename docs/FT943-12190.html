			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs crank up pressure on UN Bosnian Serb forces appeared yesterday to be ratcheting up their war of nerves with the United Nations, in an ominous hint of how much more trouble they could cause if they are punished for rejecting a peace plan. UN officials said one civilian was killed and another wounded by Serb gunfire in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a so-called total exclusion zone where heavy weapons are potentially subject to Nato air strikes. The UN also blamed the Serbs for the anti-aircraft fire at Sarajevo airport last week which has forced the suspension of relief flights. The Serbs have denied that they were responsible. In a third challenge to the UN, the Serbs refused to allow the evacuation of 35 sick people from Gorazde unless all Serb prisoners held by the Moslem-led Bosnian government were released. Negotiators from the five-nation contact group which has devised a partition arrangement for Bosnia conferred in Moscow yesterday over how to respond to the Serbs' ambiguous reply to the proposal. A statement by the group said they discussed 'additional measures aimed at removing the objections from all sides in the conflict'. The group's members - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - were united in pressing for acceptance of the peace deal but they appear divided over how to cope with the plan's apparent failure. No firm decisions are expected until the group's foreign ministers meet in Geneva at the weekend. Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian first deputy foreign minister who chaired the meeting, said before it began that the group would continue to strive for acceptance of the latest peace plan - accepted by the Croat-Moslem alliance but effectively rejected by leaders of the Bosnian Serbs. 'We believe we have a plan that is balanced and realistic and reflects the interests of all sides,' Mr Ivanov said. 'It would hardly be expedient to abandon it.' General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, will arrive in former Yugoslavia today, where he is expected to meet Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and possibly the Bosnian Serbs as well. Gen Grachev has often been in direct communication with General Ratko Mladic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, and the Russian minister may be one of the few people who can exercise any influence over the Serb commander. Diplomats believe the Russians would welcome some show of flexibility from the Serb side, whose intransigence could threaten the broader relation between Russia and the west. But any unilateral moves against the Serbs could arouse an angry reaction in Moscow. Yesterday, Russia announced a wide-ranging defence co-operation agreement with Greece calling for joint exercises, possible co-production of weapons and the exchange of information on defence matters. Greece is the only European Union member which shares Russia's traditional sympathy for the Serbs. Mr Gerasimos Arsenis, the Greek defence minister, said that the positions of Athens and Moscow about the situation in Bosnia were close.</p>

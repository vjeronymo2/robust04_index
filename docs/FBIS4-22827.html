Bardin; UDC 621.789:669.14.018.298]    [Abstract] A study examined the mechanical and  technological properties of construction steels subjected to  thermomechanical treatment to the point of transformation to a  perlite structure. Ingots weighing 35 kg were smelted in an  induction furnace and and forged into 35-mm-thick flatbars that  were then subjected to thermomechanical treatment to the point  where a perlite structure was produced. The flatbars were rolled  in six passes to a thickness of 12 mm with a total relative  reduction of about 66 percent. The flatbars were subjected to  thermomechanical treatment in one of two versions. In the first  version the flatbars were heated to 1,200C and held in the  furnace, deformed in rolling cages until they had reached a  temperature of 780C, and then annealed in a heat-treating  furnace to a temperature of 600C (duration, 1.5 hours). In  the second regimen the flatbars were heated to 1,000C,  deformed in rolling cages until they had reached a temperature  of 650C, and annealed in a heat-treating furnace at  650C for 2 hours. In both cases the flatbars developed a  perlite microstructure with globular carbides that possessed  increased ductility. The structure of the globular carbides  produced is optimum for steels subjected to cold deformation  during the manufacturing process; however, its machineability is  not as good as that achieved by other methods. The flatbars  produced by the second regimen were more ductile than those  produced by the first regimen. The second regimen resulted in  steels with an evenly distributed granular perlite, whereas the  first regimen resulted in perlite that had only been 80-90  percent spheroidized (thus resulting in free ferrite in the  steel's microstructure). Further studies were conducted to  clarify the effect that the microstructure formed during the  thermomechanical treatment to the perlite stage has on the  mechanical properties of steel after additional hardening heat  treatment (hardening with high-temperature tempering). Specimens  of 38KhGNM and 40KhN2MA steel were subjected to thermomechanical  treatment in the perlite range followed by hardening heat  treatment under commercial conditions (halting rolling at  800C, after which the billets were cooled down in air to  650C before being put into the furnace for the perlite  transformation). The specimens subjected to preliminary  thermomechanical treatment in the perlite range proved more  resistant to impact bending failure in both hardened and  tempered states.

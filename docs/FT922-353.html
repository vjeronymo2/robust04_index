			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: War of terror against Trans Dnestr dissidents THE bullet-ridden buildings and bloody streets of Bendery in the separatist Trans Dnestr region of Moldova testify to the violence that claimed 300 lives there last weekend. But terrified locals amid the fertile fields and whitewashed cottages north west of the strategic border town speak of a quiet war of terror which is exacting a less visible toll. On the eve of a United Nations fact-finding mission to Trans Dnestr, local people have recounted tales of Trans Dnestr forces killing political opponents or intimidating them into silence or exile. Victims say the violence is orchestrated by the leadership of the Trans Dnestr region with the co-operation of hardline forces in Moscow. Moldova wants to unite with Romania; Trans Dnestr is dominated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians who are fighting this move and are backed by hardliners in Moscow. Members of the Trans Dnestr military forces have admitted that they have acted to 'silence' and 'isolate' local dissenters. The Trans Dnestr government acknowledges the existence of rogue elements in the breakaway region's many military groups but has denied complicity in an orchestrated campaign of intimidation. 'We isolated those who spoke openly against us,' said Mr Misha Russkiy, an ethnic Russian tractor driver, who now serves in the newly-formed militia of the Grigoriopol region, an enclave of ethnic Moldovans in Trans Dnestr. 'As long as they do not speak out openly no one touches them,' Mr Russkiy said, surrounded by a group of comrades casually clutching their Kalashnikovs. An ethnic Moldovan community leader from the area, who last year spoke out for a united Moldova, described how that silence has been secured. Last January he began to receive nocturnal visits from members of the Trans Dnestr Republican Guard, who demanded at gunpoint that he should leave the region. One morning in the middle of March a dozen Republican Guards stormed his office and took him to a basement cell, where his kidneys were beaten with the butt of a Kalashnikov, and his jaw, which is still swollen, was struck by a 2lb machine-gun magazine. He believes he survived only because his loyal employees took to the town's central square demanding his release. With their support he has managed to stay on in the terrorised region. By contrast Mr Anatoly Danilov, a slim, blue-eyed, ethnic-Russian newspaper editor from the town of Grigoriopol, was forced to flee because he supported a united Moldova. After months of menacing telephone calls and an evening visit and beating administered by seven Republican Guards, Mr Danilov said that on March 13 he was warned by telephone that he was on a list of people to be 'neutralised' and must leave immediately. He did, and from the safety of Kishinev he spoke of 15-20 other locals who have disappeared, including one, Mr Anatoly Dikusar, whose body, when discovered in a field on April 20, 'looked like it had been through a meat grinder'.</p>

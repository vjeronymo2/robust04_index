			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Observer: See Naples, feel grumpy Such a pity that Silvio Berlusconi, Helmut Kohl, John Major, Francois Mitterrand, Felipe Gonzalez et al rushed back home from Corfu. Due in Naples next week for the G7 summit, they could have saved time - and taxpayers' cash - by taking a comfortable yacht direct from Corfu. They might even have patched up their differences over a gin and tonic en route. Presumably tact, for once, intervened. After all, those left behind in Corfu  -the smaller European Union fry - might have smarted at not being invited aboard. And the happy yachtsmen would also have perhaps offended some outsiders joining the party at Naples: Jean Chretien, Bill Clinton and the prime minister of Japan, whoever that might turn out to be. Those three may be forgiven twinges of relief at the Corfu summit fiasco. At least they will not arrive in Naples to find themselves surrounded by a phalanx of European leaders in relaxed mutual harmony on everything - including who should get the secretary-generalships of the OECD and the new World Trade Organisation. Those other jobs are now far from stitched up, as Italian television inadvertently indicated on Monday evening, when it staged a mock summit. It was chaired by a genial Renato Ruggiero, seasoned Eurocrat and former Italian foreign trade minister. His good humour was no doubt inspired by increased hopes of getting EU support for his WTO candidature, in return for Berlusconi's flexibility on the EU presidency. Another participant on the programme - former British chancellor Nigel Lawson - was more than usually glum. Lawson must sense that John Major's celebrated Corfu veto did him few favours. It has unquestionably scuppered Lawson's hopes of getting EU backing in his quest for the OECD job. Heads I win, tails you lose.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Woolworths to drop vinyl singles Woolworths, the high street retailer, is to stop selling vinyl single records. All 7-inch and 12-inch singles are being cleared from the shelves and no new stocks will be bought after Monday. The 788-shop chain stopped selling vinyl LPs last year. The company said: 'The single isn't commercially viable because not enough people are buying it for us to continue sales. Vinyl is in the past and is dying out. This may well be its death in retail terms but in the customer sense it had already died. 'People are more geared up towards CD and tape singles.' In 1990 vinyl made up 95 per cent of the stores' singles sales but in the past four years it has fallen to just 16 per cent. HMV, with 94 shops, said demand was dwindling for vinyl except in the dance music market. The CD format was its biggest seller with 65 per cent of album and half of singles sales. Vinyl LP's had less than 5 per cent of the market while vinyl singles still had a respectable 23 per cent. The company said: 'Vinyl singles and albums are being phased out because more companies are bringing them out on tape and CD only. You can't sell what doesn't exist.' Virgin said that it planned to sell vinyl in its 24 shops as long as it was produced. Kingfisher AGM, Page 23</p>

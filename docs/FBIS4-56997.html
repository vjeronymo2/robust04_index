			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said last night  after returning from Costa Rica it is a pity the cease-fire  cannot be sooner, because from the humane point of view, one  minute, one hour, or one day sooner it could save a human life.  In addition, it could prevent additional tears, orphans, and  widows. Thus, from the humane point of view, it is regrettable.    We all would like for it to be right away, immediately; that  is why the defense minister made those proposals, because the  people in general yearn for it, ask for it, and demand it, de  Leon added.    Nevertheless, if conditions according to them are not right  yet and we have to delay this schedule, which has been signed  and must be respected, so be it, because we cannot do anything  about it, he concluded.</p>

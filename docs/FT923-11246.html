			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Diggers locate secrets of Xerxes' lost canal: Tales from the earth XERXES was the king of ancient Persia who took the long road to Greece in 480 BC to punish the Greeks for supporting rebels and, when he got there, lost the battles of Salamis and Plataea. Rather more recently, there have been full houses for a superlative production of Handel's opera Xerxes at the London Coliseum. Played poignantly as an arrogant and capricious despot, we find him infatuated with a tree as the curtain goes up. Then he has the mad idea of linking Asia and Europe by a bridge over the Hellespont (Dardanelles), but a storm puts paid to this icon of folie de grandeur. Nor does he get the girl he fancies. It is an old story of futile pride. But a state-of-the-art archaeological project in Greece this past autumn shows it is not just a story. Xerxes really was a man who did things on the grand scale. Sub-soil radar has found the great canal he dug across Mt Athos to bring his navy down safely to southern Greece. Long buried and forgotten, Dr BJ Isserlin and an Anglo-Greek team of scientists have located it again with the radar, which looks into the ground from a sledge. It emits radio waves, like conventional radar, and measures those that bounce back when they hit an interruption - a hard task, as all there is to detect underground is the change between the fill and the sides of Xerxes's canal. The lack of buried structures stretched the new technique to its limits. But it found the line in 3-D beneath 7-8 metres of hill slide, and has plotted it for 2,200 metres without the expense of digging. Its length is exactly what the Greek historian Herodotus gives: 12 stades (or furlongs). Handel's picture follows Herodotus, who paints Xerxes as a wayward tyrant with whom brave little Greece battled (and beat) despite overwhelming odds. But even Greeks thought his monuments in Persia staggering. If you go to Iran, do not miss the palaces of Xerxes and his father, Darius, at Persepolis. Huge columned halls stand on a great podium. The sculptures show 28 subject nations from the Ionians (the Greeks on the Aegean coast of Turkey) in the West to the Indians in the East carrying tribute in procession to the king. When Darius died in 486 BC, Xerxes inherited Persepolis - and problems in the empire. The Ionians had revolted in 499 and Athens supported them. Darius went to punish them but lost the battle of Marathon in 490. He had to be avenged. Preparations for Xerxes Greek campaign of 480 were stupendous. The army was so vast that it could drink a river dry, Herodotus says, and Xerxes numbered it by corralling 10,000 men into a tight pen, releasing them, and then marching the rest into the pen in turn. That gave a total of 1.7m troops, an exaggeration probably by nine or 10 times. Even so, it was a huge number. The Hellespont is a mile wide and flows fast as the Black Sea joins the Aegean. Although nothing survives, and Byron did not bump into any bits when he swam across, the bridge was a superb idea. But Xerxes could not control the weather (Handel gives full vent to the storm) and the first bridge broke. He was so angry that he ordered his men to give the Hellespont 300 strokes of the lash, saying: 'O bitter water, our master lays this punishment on you as you have wronged him though he has never done you wrong.' The engineers were executed. The new ones tied two lines of ships together, stretched cables between them, and laid a road on top. Xerxes sat on a marble throne to watch the army cross. It took two days. The Athos peninsula was the next obstacle. Earlier, the Persians had lost ships sailing round it. So, Xerxes ordered the canal through its narrow isthmus and put men to dig it under the lash, in the style of the river Kwai railway. The Greeks thought the scheme odd, as they were used to island-hopping across the Aegean. But the Persians liked to keep their land and sea armies in touch in alien territories, for security and flexibility. Although Herodotus described this marvel of ancient engineering in detail, there was no archaeological exploration until Isserlin came. 'Up to now, the search has been better than my wildest dreams,' he says, certain that there is a big ditch underneath and not a haulage-way for ships as at ancient Corinth. Eventually, he hopes to dig trenches to see how it was constructed, but with the accumulated debris and soft ground there is a risk the sides may cave in. He might, however, be able to solve his final problem: who were the surveyors? Greeks coerced to work for the king? If he finds that the canal's dimensions fit Greek measuring systems, the likely answer is 'yes'. After Athos, Xerxes marched on down Greece, forced his way at Thermpoylae (where 300 brave Spartans resisted to the last man) and destroyed the temples on the Athens Acropolis and in the country around, while the Greeks prepared to hold the isthmus of Corinth. But he lost his navy at Salamis, and the army lost at Plataea the following year. Greece triumphed. In 464, Xerxes was murdered in a palace intrigue. If Herodotus came back today, he would be delighted that his account of the canal stands up so well to modern science - and that Handel saw Xerxes the same way he did.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Personal View: Future must be settled from within An ignorant world supposes that we Serbs are triumphant. It is true that we have won a difficult victory. We have survived and have not been beaten. But there have been no prizes. Today we need a settlement as much as the Moslems and the Croats. Zagreb gloats as the Serbian nation rots under economic sanctions which Germany would never allow to apply to Croatia whatever murders were done in its name. When will Washington, London and Paris concede that this disastrous war stems from a false and fatal consent by the US and the EC to German ideas about Yugoslavia? Who imposed Bosnia's catastrophic 'sovereignty'? A committee decided to partition Yugoslavia, a committee of politicians which miscalls itself the European Council and which is responsible to no parliament. It consisted of peop]e wholly ignorant about Yugoslavia. Yet this is a political detail. The effective demand for the partition of Yugoslavia came from Germany alone when it was the first EC country to recognise a separate Croatia in December 1991, unchecked by its reluctant European partners. Who suffers most today? The Bosnian Moslems lured into their grab for supremacy; the Bosnian Serbs pushed into a war they wanted to avoid; the entire Serbian nation condemned to poverty for the crime of a minimal solidarity with their brothers in Bosnia; the Macedonians whose economy is smashed; the Greeks, Bulgars, and Romanians whose economies are hammered by the loss of trade through sanctions on Serbia. Bosnia is not 'Europe's backyard' - to employ the favourite expression of the interventionists. A backyard is something intimately familiar. But no European politician - I mean those on the Brussels circuit - and few EC journalists can speak about Bosnia for two minutes without making ludicrous errors of fact. The proposition 'Bosnia is Europe's backyard' is more than stupid; it stinks of neo-imperialist arrogance, resembling the most preposterous claims of the imperialists of 100 years ago. What then is Bosnia? We can only start from its pre-war status. It was part of Yugoslavia. The world does not want to understand Serbian motives in Bosnia. But we must explain them until the world starts to listen. The Serbs are a nation whose desire for unity was and is as strong as that of any people in Europe. Yet we once consented to be divided, within Yugoslavia, provided that a degree of Serbian solidarity remained available to us. We never lived in a state called Bosnia, we lived in Yugoslav Bosnia. To take away Yugoslavia was to take away all the compromises which held Bosnia together. Even today we do not insist on being in Serbia, but we will always insist on being with Serbia. Well-meaning foreigners must not suppose this is fanaticism just because it is inconvenient. We in Bosnia have never considered ourselves other than Serbs, Croats and Moslems. There is no Bosnian patriotism. There is no Bosnian nation. There is just a common home for three peoples. We know the Moslems and the Croats of Bosnia far better than the foreign journalists. We ask the Moslems and the Croats these questions: do you think we Serbs have no right to distrust you with your record during the second world war? Do you think we will accept the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the division of the Serbian nation without setting up our own state to live in safety? Why not start talking to us now? The Moslems ask today whether they are expected to live as virtual prisoners on tiny reservations? The Serbian answer is no, not at all. But when did the Moslems negotiate directly with the Serbs about a division of territory? Did we refuse to examine the question of eastern Bosnia with them? No Serb can deny that the Moslems need a secure home in Bosnia; no thoughtful Serb imagines that there can be peace without them. Not everything has been destroyed by this latest hurricane of history that has swept through Bosnia. There is goodwill on our side, as I am sure there is goodwill among the Moslems. Moslems are our Slav brothers. They did well in Yugoslavia and suffered terribly once their leaders told them they had a better future outside. They now require not only peace, but also institutional safeguards and guarantees. The old Yugoslavia has gone. Bosnia, or most of it, could still be recreated, perhaps as a confederation, and joined at some stage to the remainder of Yugoslavia. Whatever the future, it cannot be settled from the outside, and it should not be shaped by the force of arms. The future must be negotiated among ourselves, and the time to do it is now.

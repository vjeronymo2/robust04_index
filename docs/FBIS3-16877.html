			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yakolev; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A meeting of defense force commanders of the Baltic  countries has concluded with the signing of an agreement on the  structure of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. Its formation  is planned to be finished by the end of next year. They took as  an example a relevant sub-unit of the Scandinavian countries.  It is likely that the main base of the battalion will be the  Lithuanian military unit in Alytus. Lithuanian, Latvian, and  Estonian lawyers will have to prepare and agree upon legislative  acts that will ensure the normal function of the battalion.    The Baltic servicemen also agreed that it is necessary to  have joint control over air space. Lithuania, Latvia, and  Estonia consider participation in the Partnership for Peace  program as a step toward integration with Western Europe and as  a bridge that will help them to be closer to NATO. One cannot  ignore, however, the fact that it is possible that Russia will  join the program to blow up this bridge. This opinion was also  expressed by the servicemen at a news conference. It is  difficult as yet to calculate how much it will cost taxpayers to  participate in the partnership. However, the Baltic politicians  and servicemen underline that when one talks about security  there is no room for bargaining.</p>

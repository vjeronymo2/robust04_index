			<p>BFN     [Text] Public security and order is well under control in  Medan, North Sumatera. Here is RRI [Radio Republik Indonesia]  correspondent Suyono reporting from Medan on the Medan protests:    [Begin recording] [Suyono] As of this evening, public  security and order in Medan is 90 percent under control  following protests by factory workers that are believed to have  been masterminded by irresponsible people. Major General A.  Pranowo, commander of the Bukit Barisan First Military Region  Command, told reporters in Medan that 14 suspects believed to  have masterminded the protests are still under investigation.  About 14 company-level units mobilized by the Northern Sumatera  Regional Agency for Maintenance of Stability remain on alert at  sensitive places.    [Pranowo] The latest developments show that the protests led  to destructive acts. A field observation in Tanjung Merawa  showed that workers in the majority of factories there were not  involved in protests and had no intention of becoming so, but  certain outsiders came and tried to force them to join the  protests. Because they refused, destructive acts such as  destroying offices took place. It is also apparent that the  protests led to destructive acts, intimidation, and terror  against workers and factories. We are concerned with this  development. As a matter of fact, the security forces have  coordinated their response to the situation to prevent it from  spreading and to eliminate excesses. Certain groups appear to be  exploiting the protests for their own interests. This must be  overcome immediately.    [Suyono] A joint team organized by the Northern Sumatera  Regional Agency for Maintenance of Stability said the protests  -- which led to intimidation and terror -- bore a resemblance to  communist tactics, as noted yesterday by the chief of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia.  The commander said that field observation showed this was  partly true. Accordingly, the joint team is continuing  investigations to find out who really masterminded the protests.  The commander warned everyone in the region not to be provoked  by rumors and anonymous phone calls that are aimed at  heightening tension in the region. This will ensure public  security and order in North Sumatera. This is correspondent  Suyono reporting from Medan. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the Central Executive Council of the All  Indonesian Trade Union [SPSI] has rejected any protests that  harm public order, let alone that lead to destructive acts or  ethnic, religious, racial, or communal riots. Imam Sudarwo,  general chairman of the SPSI Central Executive Council, said  SPSI condemns acts that justify the use of any means to achieve  an objective, thus inflicting moral and material losses. In a  press release today, Imam Sudarwo supported the government's  action against those who violated laws and rules. He urged the  SPSI rank and file and all sides to conduct a self-examination  in the wake of the Medan protests. In this respect, he urged  all sides to handle the manpower issue seriously by strictly  adhering to the Pancasila labor relations system, which has  become a national consensus. The SPSI Central Executive Council  also urged all Indonesian workers to maintain unity and cohesion  to enable the Indonesian people to enjoy political and economic  stability.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Focus on UK rates THERE was speculation about a near term cut in UK base rates in the sterling cash market yesterday morning, as short-dated money rates came down to very low levels for the second day running, writes James Blitz. The UK government has given strong indications in recent weeks that another base rate cut is not due for some time. But a number of factors yesterday encouraged dealers to think this was a possibility. One reason was a sharp increase in cash supply in the market, which helped to push the overnight rate as low as 4 per cent. As on every day this week, the Bank of England forecast a small shortage. Yesterday's morning forecast was for Pounds 800m, which was later revised up to Pounds 850m. There was mild excitement, too, that the Bank of England offered a repurchase agreement of Pounds 550m at the established rate of 6 15/16 per cent in the early round. A repo offer can sometimes be used to underline the downward movement of market rates. However, one dealer suggested that the Bank may have been accommodating for purely technical reasons, possibly because today's shortage is expected to be very high. There was a strong impact on cash and futures markets. Three-month money was again very soft, closing around the base rate figure of 7 per cent as it did on Wednesday night. The March short sterling contract closed 8 basis points up at 93.42, a level which prices in more than 40 basis points off three-month money in the next two months. Continuing speculation that Germany will ease monetary policy may also have compounded the positive mood in the sterling market. Conciliatory comments earlier this week from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, helped the March Euromark contract to rise 8 basis points to end at 92.18. However, French franc futures hit record lows, with the March contract finishing 27 basis points down at 92.10. Denmark's growing political difficulties have weakened the Danish krone, arousing new concern about the franc. There were rumours yesterday that if three-month French francs do not come below 11 1/2 per cent within the next few days, French commercial banks may be forced to pass the cost of high money market rates on to the consumer.</p>

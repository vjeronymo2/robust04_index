			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Observer: Cha-cha-cha Dirty deeds in the office of Ramon Escovar Salom, Venezuela's minister of the interior. He recently discovered bugging devices, planted there by hands unknown. Suspicion lies against anonymous disgruntled former security officers. Not too surprising; in his role as prosecutor general, Escovar last year laid corruption charges against president Carlos Andres Perez, ultimately dislodging him from office. Around that time Escovar started playing loud classical music in his office, raising the volume when engaged in sensitive conversations. He says the music 'helps to maintain my spiritual peace'. Plenty of Wagner - that should scare them off.</p>

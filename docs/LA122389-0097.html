			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> NBA drug counselor Dr. David Lewis said that the league has no immediate plans  to reinstate suspended Dallas Maverick forward Roy Tarpley.  </P> <P> Tarpley was suspended without pay by the league on Nov. 16 after he was  arrested on a Dallas freeway on charges of driving while intoxicated and  resisting arrest. A January court date has been set on those charges, although  a plea bargain is likely.  </P> <P> It had been reported last week that Tarpley might be reinstated for Friday  night's game against the Clippers.  </P></p>

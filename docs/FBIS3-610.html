			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] president, said yesterday that if unfounded accusations  against his party continue, he will be forced to reveal  undisclosed incidents between his movement and the Mozambican  Government prior to the signing of the General Peace Accord. "I  can could get angry and disclose some things," he said.    The Renamo leader said this at his residence shortly after  introducing to the public the 30 Renamo advisers chosen to work  with the provincial governors as of next week.    Afonso Dhlakama is particularly concerned about continuing  accusations by the government that Renamo's bases are harboring  a Malawi Young Pioneers battalion.    "I have already said that that they are welcome to  investigate the matter on the ground or to fetch at least one of  those men so he can be shown to the public," the Renamo leader  said.    "UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello has helicopters  and trucks that he can use. There are UN observers here, and  they can go to the bases to see if it is true," he added.    He thinks the government and the press are acting in bad  faith and making serious accusations when they say Renamo  received support from Malawi and its leaders traveled in  Malawian aircraft and were seen in the company of Malawian  policemen or Malawian religious figures.    "Today, it appears to be a novelty to the government that we  used Malawi as a stopover, a place where meetings took place to  get the peace process moving," he said, adding that "President  Chissano and I agreed to use Malawian territory for secret  meetings among our men." He also noted that "many people do not  know that Chissano sent Minister Pascoal Mocumbi to Malawi to  meet Jose de Castro before the signing of the General Peace  Accord. President Chissano and I authorized that meeting. Many  people are not aware that I flew on several occasions to Malawi  during the war to meet [Italian peace broker] Mario Rafaelli,  Herman Cohen, and with religious leaders. I met Zimbabwean  President Robert Mugabe in Malawi. The government knows that we  used aircraft and cars to go there and that we were accompanied  by Malawian policemen. How can they now come forward disclosing  things which they are well aware of?"    Dhlakama insisted on the need for the government and the  press to show good faith. He says that there is no journalist,  researcher, or historian trying to get the truth from Renamo.  About Kenya, for instance, he says that he only got to know  Nairobi after Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi had come to  Maputo and had been asked by Chissano to become involved in the  Mozambican peace process.    "I had gone to Nairobi to meet the bishops when Chissano  convinced Moi to allow his territory to be used for such  encounters. It was there that I received the first message  saying `let us talk about an end to the war.' Then, Kenya and  Malawi became stopovers on our way to Rome from Gorongosa or  Maringue," the Renamo leader explained.    Afonso Dhlakama noted that his party "has many  responsibilities in this country," adding that that is why "we  avoid responsing to such accusations with facts and disclosures  which could compromise the government."    Dhlakama says he has disclosures to make in good time or not  at all. "We are only too well aware that the government might  become seriously unsettled over certain disclosures about things  we used to do together in those times." The Renamo leader added  that "we should not be taking part in dishonest politics."    However, Afonso Dhlakama sees two findings as rather  reassuring: "Chissano is a serious man who wants peace" and the  government resorts to "petty behavior" in relation to Renamo  because it knows full well that "it is a strong party, a great  opponent." And he added, ironically: "If we were a small party,  they would have given us five vehicles, some houses here and  there, and that would have been enough. We might even have been  friends."</p>

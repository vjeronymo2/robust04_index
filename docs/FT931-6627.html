			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Italians ponder Craxi immunity THE Italian parliament this week confronts the sensitive issue of whether to waive parliamentary immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi, who was forced to step down from Socialist party leadership because of his alleged involvement in the Milan corruption scandal. Although more than 50 deputies and senators are caught up in a series of corruption scandals, Mr Craxi is the most senior member of the politial establishment to be wanted for questioning. The debate, scheduled for tomorrow, will reveal the extent to which parliament has the will to act quickly and tackle the increasingly complex issues raised by the nationwide investigations into political corruption. Mr Craxi is expected to use the occasion to underline the difficulties and dangers of putting the political system on trial. The outcome is likely to have an impact on moves to find a legislative solution to limit the scope of the corruption investigations and prevent matters getting out of hand. Already the scandals have reached deep into Italy's business and political elite and more developments are expected this week. The current areas of investigation centre on commissions paid to political parties for contracts in the power industry; reorganisation of the chemical industry in the 80s; the role of ENI, the state oil concern; the state road-building authority, Anas; EC funds for professional training improperly used; and spending for the 1990 world cup football competition In documents submitted to parliament, Milan magistrates have listed 40 incidents of alleged corruption and receiving illicit finance for the Socialist Party worth L36bn (Pounds 15.7m). Mr Craxi, who quit the leadership on February 16, has consistently denied wrong-doing and has claimed the magistrates are conducting a vendetta against him and the political establishment. His main defence rests on the argument that he ran the political/policy side of the party, with administration and finance left to others. But even if Mr Craxi convinces parliament on this point, deputies face the awkward question of the degree of responsibility a party leader has for what goes on in his party - and whether this is sufficient grounds to waive immunity. The pressure on Mr Craxi has mounted since Ms Enza Tomaselli, his private secretary, was arrested on February 17 and held under preventive detention. The tactic, used by magistrates to make people talk, has been much criticised. The first senior Socialist to have immunity waived was Mr Gianni de Michelis, former foreign minister. On Friday he was questioned for the first time by magistrates regarding alleged illicit party finance over a Venice public works contract. When he left the justice building, Mr de Michelis was chased by a hostile crowd.</p>

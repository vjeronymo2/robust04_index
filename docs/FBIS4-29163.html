			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Australia is looking to dramatically expand trade  and investment links with its nearest Asian neighbor, Indonesia.  Later this month, Prime Minister Paul Keating will be making  his third trip to Jakarta in just two years to promote  Australian business. He is preceded by Foreign Minister Gareth  Evans, who was in the Indonesian capital last night to launch  the biggest trade promotion Australia has yet staged in Asia.  Michael Marr was there.    [Begin recording] [Marr] The Australia Today promotion got  off to a musical start in Jakarta last night where jazz  musicians played at the opening of this three-week business and  cultural exposition. The two nations, which have had their fair  share of disagreements over the past few decades, got enough  beat to get into a program and as Foreign Minister Gareth Evans  put it, a good and needed ballast to the relationship. And in  this case, its ballast is a commercial kind. Some 500 companies  are expected to take part in the $12 million Australia Today  promotion despite the problems of red tape and the importance of  good political connections. Senator Evans argues there are  several opportunities for Australian business in this country of  190 million people.    [Evans] When you've got a country of 190 million people,  almost, the fourth biggest in the world, with a rapidly  developing economy as this one has, right on our doorstep, maybe  it's simply crazy not to recognize the scale and the opportunity  that it represents.    [Marr] Has enough been done in the past to expand the  commercial ties between Australia and Indonesia?    [Evans] Well, there have been a lot of Australian businesses  with their feet on the ground now for a very long time and I  think their credibility has been important in building the base  on which we're now erecting and further extending. I think the  government has worked very hard at developing the kind of  climate within which business can flourish and that's happened  particularly of course over the last four or five years.  Generally speaking however, it's important that Australian  businesses themselves get out and put the groundwork [words  indistinct]. Governments can only do so much. At the end of the  day it's the entrepreneurial instinct that's going to win the  reward.    [Marr] Now, $12 million has been spent on this promotion and  it's bound, of course, to promoting Australian business here.  Some people have suggested that it would be far better to adopt  a direct, high profile, more targeted strategy. Is this going  to work?    [Evans] What this is all about is changing basic innovative  perception. There's still the perception up here that we are a  land of mines and tourist beaches and agriculture -- another  socially developed high-tech, value-added, capable kind of a  society; and that matters when people at the decision-making  level, not only in government but in business, are determining  whether or not to trade with [words indistinct] or accept an  investment or engage in a joint venture. You've got to have a  background perception that work for a truly sophisticated  advanced country. We know from surveys that that perception is  not quite spread about at the moment and this whole promotion is  about changing just that perception.    [Marr] The organizers of Australia Today say they'd be  scrupulous in following up their efforts. Such big time  promotions elsewhere in Asia have produced variable results in  the past. If that's so, Indonesia need to show some tangible  outcome if it's to justify a $12 million budget. [end recording]</p>

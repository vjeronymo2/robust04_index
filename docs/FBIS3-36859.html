			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 09, BNS -- The Estonian defense forces  will be armed mostly with Israeli-made weapons of the NATO  standards and the Defense League is to get weapons of Soviet  origin, the country's Chief of Staff Ants Laaneots said in a  press conference today.    Laaneots said the Army will mainly get 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm  guns. The 7.62-mm PKT standard machine guns, received from  Israel as a gift, will be used on armored vehicles. The same  shipment's 23 mm anti-aircraft cannons will add strength to the  Army's anti-aircraft weaponry.    The only weapons in the consignment that fail to correspond  to NATO standards are 23 mm cannons. NATO uses the 20 mm  version.    The Defense Union paramilitary's arms list will comprise  7.62  mm Soviet-made guns, as well as RPD machine guns of the same  caliber received in gift from Israel.    Laaneots said the Defense League will also get anti-tank  bomb  throwers, which will make the volunteer league a "notable  military force" in 1994.    The police will have 9 mm guns, mainly Mini-Uzis. An  emergency task force will get 5.45 mm Soviet-made machine guns.    Part of the Israeli weapons will go to the border forces.  The Chief of Staff said border guard forces had also received  light anti-tank weapons.    Laaneots said the division of the weapons as made now was of  temporary character, adding that the system was needed to ensure  proper servicing and right ammunition supplies.    He also assured that the country was facing no problems in  obtaining ammunition for the guns purchased from Israel, as  cartridges for the respective sizes are manufactured in most of  Europe's industrially developed countries.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Observer: Dog days Anyone want a diary? Each of the 567 members of the European parliament gets a free leather-bound diary and desk set. So why are more than 20,000 extra diaries produced? Also going spare are 1,500 leather pocket diaries, 18,000 plastic pocket diaries and 1,200 matching blotter sets. Look to Italy for an answer, where a Pounds 190,000 bulk purchase - including 1,200 large desk diaries in blue calf leather, with the 12 gold stars symbolising the EU embossed on the cover - has just been made. In other words, national taxpayers are subsidising MEPs' gifts to friends and relatives. Every dog has his day.</p>

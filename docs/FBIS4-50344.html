			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)] </F>   [Excerpt] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- China's reform which  is being carried out across the country and its omnidirectional  opening to the outside world have enabled its foreign contacts  to enjoy extensive development. In recent years, the All-China  Journalists Association [ACJA] also paid close attention to  bringing into play its own strong points as a mass organization;  opened up various channels; promoted mutual understanding and  exchanges and expanded friendship as well as cooperation between  Chinese and foreign press circles; studied the experiences in  journalist work gained by every other country and used them as a  reference; and made great progress.    According to a briefing, the ACJA has received a total of  148  delegations of foreign journalists from about 40 countries in  the past three years. Meanwhile, it sent 43 press delegations  to visit nearly 30 countries. In having their contacts with  foreign counterparts closely revolve around two themes, peace  and development, these delegations helped all the people of  every other country in the world understand China and improved  Chinese press circles' understanding of their counterparts in  every other country through exchanges between press circles.    After China resumed diplomatic ties with Indonesia and  normalized its relations with Vietnam, the ACJA organized in a  timely manner mutual visits between Chinese journalists and  their Indonesian and Vietnamese counterparts. In its capacity  as a mass organization, the ACJA carried out numerous contacts  with Korean press circles before China established diplomatic  relations with the ROK. Chinese and Korean journalists  associations sent formal delegations to visit each other in  1993. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the  drastic changes in East Europe, Chinese press circles  established ties or carried out contacts with their counterparts  in Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Albania. It also increased contacts with the U.S.  press circles over the past three years. In 1991, it received a  delegation of the U.S. press industry association which visited  China at its own expense. In 1992 and 1993, China organized  four [press] delegations to visit the United States.    In compliance with the guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  instruction -- "In our opening up, we not only must develop  international contacts but also must assimilate international  experiences," Chinese press delegations paid attention to  conducting a survey of the state of foreign press media as well  as their experiences to use them as a reference. After they  returned home, they wrote summary and brief reports which can be  used as valuable reference materials in addition to publishing  many articles on what they had seen and heard.    As regards the contacts with the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and  Macao  regions, which have a blood relationship with the mainland,  press circles on both sides closely follow the issue with  interest. After the ACJA was entrusted to do so by the party  Central Committee and the State Council in 1985 and 1987,  respectively, it received Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  journalists who visited the mainland. Under the guidance of the  principles "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two  systems," it established extensive contacts with press circles  in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao and promoted two-way exchanges.    The ACJA received a total of more than 1,400 well-known  journalists and figures from Taiwan press circles and more than  1,700 well-known journalists and figures from Hong Kong and  Macao press circles over the past three years. With the  assistance of the ACJA and with its coordination, Taiwan, Hong  Kong, and Macao journalists traveled all over the motherland and  participated in the report on the sessions of the National  People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, and the 14th  National CPC Congress and on other important activities, thereby  enabling the people in the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao regions  to have a better understanding of the motherland's reform,  opening up, and investment environment as well as of China's  5,000-year-old history and culture.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Relief for higher-rate taxpayers to be cut - Married Couple's Allowance This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE chancellor proposes to introduce legislation in the 1994 Finance Bill to restrict relief for the married couple's allowance, and the other allowances linked to it, to the lower rate of 20 per cent from 6 April 1994; raise the married couple's allowance for couples aged 65 and over by Pounds 200; and increase the width of the lower rate band by another Pounds 500. The chancellor's intention in restricting the married couple's allowance is to raise revenue and to make the allowance worth the same amount to taxpayers at all levels of income. The married couple's allowance, like the other income tax allowances, currently reduces a taxpayer's liability at his or her marginal rate of tax. For example, the current allowance of Pounds 1,720 for someone aged under 65 reduces their annual tax bill by Pounds 688 (40 per cent of Pounds 1,720) if they are a higher rate taxpayer, but by half that amount (Pounds 344 or 20 per cent of Pounds 1,720) if they pay tax only at the 20 per cent lower rate. The change proposed will mean that the allowance will reduce the tax bills of all taxpayers entitled to it by the same amount, ie 20 per cent of the allowance. So at the 1993-94 level the allowance for those aged under 65 would be worth Pounds 344 regardless of the taxpayer's marginal rate. The restriction will also apply to the allowances which are set at the same level as the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65. For example: the additional personal allowance (mainly for single parents); the widow's bereavement allowance (paid to a widow in the year of her husband's death and the following year); and the relief for maintenance payments to a divorced or separated spouse. The widening of the lower rate band will be worth a further Pounds 25 a year to all basic and higher rate taxpayers, married or single. The net effect of both measures on a married man aged under 65, paying tax at the basic rate, and assuming no other changes in allowances, would be a tax increase of Pounds 1.17 a week. A higher rate taxpayer aged under 65 would pay Pounds 6.13 a week more. Taxpayers with income of less than about Pounds 6,500 would not be affected. The higher amounts of the MCA for taxpayers aged 65 and over will also be restricted to 20 per cent, but these allowances will be increased at the same time so that the maximum loss to a basic rate taxpayer aged 65 or over will be no greater than the loss to a basic rate taxpayer aged under 65. The increase in the higher amounts of MCA will mean that about 130,000 taxpayers on low incomes will gain up to 75 pence a week, including 30,000 who will be taken out of tax altogether. The restriction of the value of the married couple's allowance and linked allowances will be implemented for employees by making a reduction in their PAYE tax codes. The amount of the reduction will depend on their marginal rate of tax and hence on an estimate of their total income. This will be corrected if it proves to be wrong at the end of the year. Codes including these restrictions will be issued early in 1994. For taxpayers not covered by PAYE, the restriction in relief will be made in assessments or in calculating repayments. The restriction of the married couple's allowance will raise about Pounds 900m in 1994-95 (Pounds 1.2bn in a full year), of which Pounds 320m in 1994-95 will be spent on increasing the lower rate band to Pounds 3,000.</p>

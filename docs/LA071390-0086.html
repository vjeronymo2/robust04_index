			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLAIRE SAYS GIBSON ISSUED TRADE DEMAND  </P> <P> Dodger Vice President Fred Claire confirmed Thursday that outfielder Kirk  Gibson has demanded a trade, hoping to join a team closer to his family in  Detroit.  </P> <P> "In our meeting Sunday, Kirk demanded a trade," Claire said, referring to the  shouting match Sunday between him and Gibson in Manager Tom Lasorda's office.  </P> <P> However, Claire said this does not mean he will trade Gibson before the  outfielder leaves the Dodgers as a free agent after the season.  </P> <P> "I can't trade a player just because he wants to be traded," Claire said. "And  I can't release him. I have to do what is in the best interest of the club, and  get the best thing in return. Right now, Kirk is a member of this ballclub, and  I cannot forecast the future."  </P> <P> Claire was responding to published reports Thursday in which Gibson said, "I  officially demanded to get out of here during Sunday's meeting."  </P> <P> Gibson refused to comment on those reports Thursday before the Dodgers played  the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> "If you read a quote, take it as it is," he said. "I'm not going to go over and  over this thing. I'm not going to beleaguer (sic) a point."  </P> <P> Claire also confirmed earlier reports that Gibson, through a representative,  presented Claire with the idea of a trade several weeks ago.  </P> <P> "On June 19, Kirk's agent, Doug Baldwin, called and said that he had talked to  Kirk and that Kirk wanted me to know he would be better off closer to home, and  better off in the American league," Claire said. "Doug placed no demands on me  but said Kirk wanted to be closer to home because of personal reasons."  </P> <P> Claire said the published report of Baldwin's request caused Gibson distress.  This may have helped lead to Sunday's shouting match, during which Claire  reportedly accused Gibson of having a bad attitude. Gibson reportedly accused  the Dodgers of not appreciating that he is playing out of position in center  field.  </P> <P> "That was a troubling story, it brought everything to the forefront," Claire  said. "Kirk felt the ballclub was somehow responsible for the story, and to my  knowledge, we were not responsible."  </P> <P> About Sunday's argument with Gibson, Claire said: "Tempers flared and,  unfortunately, I can't change that. I shook hands with Kirk at the end of that  meeting, and I accept responsibility for what happened in that meeting."  </P> <P> Gibson is batting .250 in 25 games, with three home runs and 17 runs batted in,  since returning from knee surgery last August. He is best known for helping  lead the Dodgers to the World Series title in 1988, the year he was named the  National League's most valuable player. He won Game 1 of the 1988 World Series  against the Oakland Athletics with a ninth-inning, two-run pinch home run.  </P> <P> Gibson, 33, can be an imposing figure on the field. But at least one veteran  Dodger said Thursday that an unhappy player can also be a detriment.  </P> <P> "In general, how can you expect a guy who doesn't want to be here to be able to  do the little-bitty things that winning teams have to have?" catcher Rick  Dempsey said. "If a guy's heart is not in it, how can you expect him to do  everything it takes to win?  </P> <P> "If anybody's heart is not with this team, go ahead and get that person out of  here, and let's go on and play some baseball again."  </P> <P> With Gibson's demand made public, it will be difficult for the Dodgers to fill  their biggest need, a fifth starting pitcher, by trading him. Claire may have  to wait until August, when pennant-contending teams are as desperate to acquire  a left-handed power hitter as the Dodgers are to get rid of one.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- U.S. Undersecretary of  Commerce for International Trade, Jeffrey Garten, urged industry  deregulations during talks with a Japanese business leader on  his visit to Japan on Tuesday.    Garten told Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), that the United States would  like to know how it can help Japan's deregulation.    He noted that numerous proposals are being made in Japan's  industry, but that it is doubtful that they will actually be put  into action.    In response Toyoda expressed enthusiasm for deregulatory  measures, saying, "We must go forth with deregulation even if it  hurts." He said he hoped the U.S. Government would let it be  widely known that deregulation will lead to more business  opportunities.    Toyoda also said that he is pressing the government to set  up  a surveillance body to oversee deregulation.    On the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Garten said he  expects it will take some time before the discussions make  progress.    The U.S. official implied that the Japanese Government  should  continue making income tax cuts, pointing out that fiscal  measures taken so far are insufficient to encourage domestic  demand.  07 JUN 0446</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Employer demand for graduates shows signs of upturn DEMAND from employers for this year's crop of college leavers has suddenly increased after a slow start in the autumn, according to recruiters and graduate careers services. The Central Services Unit, the body which collects statistics from college careers offices, said it had seen 'a small but discernible upturn being notified' over the past six weeks. There had also been a number of late bookings by employers for the round of summer recruitment fairs, it said. Figures on demand are due to be released at the end of the month. The Association of Graduate Recruiters, representing recruiting employers, echoed the CSU's findings. Ms Kate Tyzack, AGR chairman and recruitment manager for Marks and Spencer, said the situation was 'very fast-moving and positive' for graduates seeking jobs. M&amp;S has decided to take on an extra 100 graduates this year, after originally calculating that it would only need a total of 150. In 1991 the company froze graduate appointments after having already offered jobs to 100 candidates - 70 went on to join the company the following year. Ms Tyzack said this year's graduate intake had been increased because of the difficulty of recruiting A-level entrants. More sixth-formers were going on to higher education, rather than seeking jobs, she said. As a result of reorganisation, M&amp;S also wanted to increase the number of middle managers in stores. Abbey National, the bank, said it was increasing its graduate recruitment to 100 places, from 75-80 in previous years. This was mainly because it was moving into new business areas, such as insurance, and because of the upturn in the housing market. Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse, accounting and consultancy firms which have traditionally been large recruiters of graduates, said intake was 'stable' this year. Arthur Andersen plans to take on 330 graduates and said it was feeling 'generally more bullish' about taking on staff. Price Waterhouse is recruiting about 420 graduates this year - about the same number as in the past two years.</p>

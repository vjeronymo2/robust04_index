			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHAMINADE TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CHAMINADE STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS BY SIMI VALLEY  </P> <P> Chaminade High paved an easy road for itself to the championship semifinals of  its own tournament.  </P> <P> But once there, the Eagles ran head-on into Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Chaminade, which had only to beat undermanned Camp Kilpatrick to reach the  semifinals, were jolted back to reality Friday night in an 87-53 loss.  </P> <P> Simi Valley (8-4) meets Fairfax, a 39-28 winner over Santa Monica, tonight at  7:30 p.m. for the tournament championship. Chaminade (5-5) plays Santa Monica  at 6 p.m. for third place.  </P> <P> The Eagles, who drew a first-round bye before thumping Camp Kilpatrick by 45  points, hung in against Simi Valley for a quarter. Chaminade fell behind, 7-0,  but rallied to tie the score, 9-9. Steve Carnes hit a three-point basket while  falling out of bounds to give Simi Valley a 12-9 lead after one period.  </P> <P> "I thought we played a great first quarter," Chaminade Coach Mike Lynn said.  "After that, they just had too many horses."  </P> <P> Chaminade was down, 18-16, early in the second period when Simi Valley went on  a 16-3 run to close the half. Carnes, the only player remaining from Simi  Valley's 1987-88 Southern Section 4-A Division championship team, had seven  points, including a three-point basket, to key the blitz.  </P> <P> "We got fatigued in the second quarter and they scored a whole bunch of points.  That just took us out of it," Lynn said. "We probably should have been much  more deliberate.  </P> <P> "They had kids coming off the bench who were very good athletes. There was no  drop-off when they came in."  </P> <P> Carnes, suffering from the flu, led all scorers with 22 points and had seven  rebounds. Mike Wawryk (16 points and eight rebounds), Kenny Hood (15 points and  10 rebounds) and Tim Joqua (13 points) also scored in double figures.  </P> <P> The Pioneers outrebounded Chaminade, 46-31, and held the Eagles to 30%  field-goal shooting -- 22% in the first half.  </P> <P> Simi Valley shot 58% from the field.  </P> <P> "It's about time," Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw said. "We're a team with  high expectations, but we've been disappointed with ourselves until the last  couple of ball games. It's weird. we could never pinpoint what was wrong."  </P> <P> Mark Mirkovich led Chaminade with 16 points and seven rebounds, and Colin  Havert added 15 points.  </P> <P> In another tournament game:  </P> <P> Granada Hills 65, Crossroads 48 -- Osiris Nalls scored 19 points to lead  Granada Hills (7-6) into the consolation final today at 4:30 p.m. against  Marshall, a 77-30 winner over Camp Kilpatrick.  </P> <P> Granada Hills led, 23-22, at halftime, but opened a nine-point margin after  three periods before blowing out Crossroads with a 27-point fourth quarter.  Adrian Sellers (12 points), Sagy Koren (11) and Aaron Lattimore (10) also  scored in double figures.  </P></p>

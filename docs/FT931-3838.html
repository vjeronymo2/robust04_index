			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pibs - price up, yields down which are building society shares issued to raise capital for the society - have been steadily falling as their prices rise. In our last table, which showed prices at midday January 21, the gross yield on Britannia Pibs, for example, was 11.35 per cent; that had fallen to 10.86 per cent by midday on Thursday. The price rose from 114.50p to 119.75p over the same period. The fall in interest rates has been favourable to Pibs prices and although yields have fallen, they are still high compared with returns from equities or deposit accounts. This helps account for the increasing popularity of Pibs with private investors looking for income, but it is also a reflection of the risk they carry. Pibs pay a fixed income twice a year net of basic rate tax. Any gains on the sale of the shares are exempt from capital gains tax. They are deeply subordinated - which means that were the society to collapse, Pibs holders would be behind all other creditors in the queue for repayment. If there is another cut in interest rates, prices can be expected to increase further but once interest rates turn upwards, prices will fall. Since Pibs are irredeemable shares the building society is under no obligation to repay the principal, so the original investment can only be regained by selling the shares. Falls in price therefore threaten the Pibs holder's capital although the income remains fixed in perpetuity, subject to the society's ability to maintain payments.</p>

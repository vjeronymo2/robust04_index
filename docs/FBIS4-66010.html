			<p>BFN     [Text] As we have already reported, Foreign Minister Alois  Mock had to undergo hospital treatment yesterday. The official  reason is a herniation of a vertebral disk. He is in an  Innsbruck hospital. One of his closest aides told ORF  Morgenjournal this morning that Mock is in good condition,  considering the circumstances. Tests are going to be carried  out, and the foreign minister will probably have to stay in  hospital until next Wednesday [1 June].</p>

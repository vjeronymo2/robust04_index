			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: 'HEIDI' HEADS FOR L.A. -- BUT EXPECT A WAIT; LYMAN TO CLOSE DOORS  OF DIRECTORS' THEATRE  </P> <P> "Heidi" is coming to Hollywood.  </P> <P> But don't hold your breath waiting for the national tour of "The Heidi  Chronicles," last year's multi-award-winning comedy by Wendy Wasserstein. Its  producer Jim Walsh reports that it has been tentatively penciled in for a  12-week run at the Doolittle Theatre, beginning on April 1 or 2, 1991, as part  of the next Center Theatre Group/Ahmanson season. No casting has been set.  </P> <P> ADT FOLDS: "I'm looking for Producers Anonymous at this point," said Dorothy  Lyman.  </P> <P> She was talking about her decision to close A Directors' Theatre, an  organization she founded, ran and subsidized. The group has staged 12  productions and 35 readings at the Lex Theatre in Hollywood during the last  three years.  </P> <P> There were "a lot of reasons" for her decision, many of them related to the  concurrent end of "Mama's Family," the syndicated TV series on which she played  Naomi.  </P> <P> "In a 50-seat theater, there is always a deficit, which I could pick up because  I was overpaid for my TV work," said Lyman. She ended up spending 50% of her  salary on the theater. "I thought if I seeded it for three years, enough other  people would take the responsibility to make sure it stuck around."  </P> <P> But the other people failed to materialize in sufficient numbers. The theater  attracted only 168 subscribers at last count, "and most of them never showed  up."  </P> <P> "I am a terrible fund-raiser," acknowledged Lyman, "and I never found a proper  managing director (to run the business side of the theater)." She also was  "disappointed with my directors about 80% of the time," discouraged by the lack  of press attention devoted to the theater's recent young playwrights contest,  and disheartened by the battles that flared in Actors' Equity over new rules in  smaller theaters. That controversy prompted Lyman to resign from the stage  actors' union.  </P> <P> Finally, she concluded that "there are a lot of other people who can produce  smaller theater well. We just didn't distinguish ourselves."  </P> <P> Lyman will direct ADT's last show, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," opening Feb.  14, and also will direct a new play for the New Place Theatre Co. in Rolling  Hills Estates next fall, but generally she hopes to concentrate on her acting  career. "I need a new job," she said.  </P> <P> SLOW DELIVERY: The first performance of "Love Letters" at Pasadena Playhouse  has been postponed from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25. It had been scheduled for the  mainstage; later performances would transfer to the smaller Balcony Theatre.  But artistic director Susan Dietz decided the mainstage was too big for the  play and shifted the entire "Love Letters" run to the Balcony, which wasn't  available until the later date . . . The opening of "Wooman, Lovely Wooman" at  the Tiffany has been postponed from Feb. 8 to Feb. 16, with previews now  starting on Feb. 9. "Production elements are taking a lot longer than we  thought they would," said L.A. Theatre Works producer Susan Loewenberg.  </P> <P> FREE AT THE TAPER: Kenneth Branagh and members of his Renaissance Theatre  Company will discuss their productions of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "King  Lear" on March 2 at 3 p.m. in the Mark Taper Forum. Reservations are required;  call (213) 972-0775.  </P> <P> "Other Voices," the Mark Taper Forum's workshop for writers with physical or  sensory disabilities, will present free public performances of four scenes  Monday at 7:30 p.m. at the Music Center Annex, 601 W. Temple St. Another four  scenes will be presented Feb. 12. Information: (213) 597-6511.  </P></p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: Daniel for lion's den Daniel Goeudevert, last heard slamming Volkswagen's back door a year ago after being booted off the group board, has popped up at the side of would-be German chancellor Rudolf Scharping. The 52-year-old Frenchman yesterday became the Social Democrat leader's personal adviser on Franco-German affairs, part of a series of changes designed to inject some verve into the diffident Scharping's election campaign. A thoughtful, literary type who fell foul of VW boss Ferdinand Piech, Goeudevert has in the interim been convalescing quietly on a DM4m 'consultancy fee' from the company. He has been padding out what he describes as 'this vacuum, this emptiness' as vice-president of the International Green Cross, an environmentalist group based in Geneva. Reputed for his impeccable intellectual honesty - he earnestly promoted sound ecological and ethical business practices before most of his former motor industry colleagues had even heard of them - Goeudevert is a handsome embellishment to Scharping's team. But he will have to look right and left as Gerhard Schroder, the power-hungry prime minister of Lower Saxony who becomes the new 'super' shadow minister, sets about trying to help the SPD get elected. For Goeudevert and Schroder were last seen hurtling down the Autobahn in opposite directions. The man most likely to oust Scharping if he fluffs it, Schroder is also the spokesman for Lower Saxony's controlling minority stake in VW. From his perch on the car-maker's supervisory board, he provided indispensable support for Piech's campaign to send Goeudevert into the wilderness.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV NOW IN UNCHARTED WATERS, SEES NO TURNING BACK;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: LEADER HAS TRANSFORMED CHALLENGES INTO BREAKTHROUGHS. BUT THE  CIVIL WAR IN THE SOUTH IS ONE CRISIS HE APPEARED TO BE UNPREPARED FOR.  </P> <P> Crises are not new to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and he moves from one to  the next with a determination that nothing will halt his plans to reform the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In the past year, the Soviet leader has dealt with the dramatic upheaval in  Eastern Europe, with an unprecedented wave of potentially paralyzing strikes at  home, with ethnic riots and nationalist protests in most of the country's  constituent republics, with resistance from conservatives to his reforms and  with rising social discontent that brought increased crime and threatened bread  riots.  </P> <P> Most of these crises he turned to his own advantage, transforming challenges  into opportunities for bold political and economic breakthroughs, often taking  apparent vulnerabilities and creating new strength from them.  </P> <P> But the virtual civil war that erupted this week in the south, between Armenia  and Azerbaijan, is one crisis for which Gorbachev appears to have been  unprepared, one that will not be dealt with quickly or easily -- and one that  seems to hold very little prospect for such a magical transformation.  </P> <P> Not only is the enmity between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis centuries old  and deep-seated, but it is now burning with an increasing intensity.  </P> <P> There are fears in political circles here that the burden on Gorbachev has  become too large, that with each new crisis he approaches the limits of the  room in which he has to maneuver and that his "new political thinking" is more  difficult to apply to domestic problems than it was to international issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nation Has No Choice  </P> <P> Gorbachev, defending his reforms Thursday at a Kremlin conference of workers,  farmers and technical personnel, insisted that the nation has no choice but to  proceed, even more boldly than before, with perestroika, his reform program.  </P> <P> "We simply cannot continue to live as we have done," he said, responding to  widespread conservative sentiment that the country's problems would be eased if  it returned to the old methods. "Yes, we need perestroika as we need air. We  need it to reveal the potential of our system. . . . (Results) are in progress.  This too must be seen so as not to get into a flap, saying everything is going  to pieces. What is falling apart are the old ways."  </P> <P> The crisis in Armenia and Azerbaijan is too far from the central questions  facing Gorbachev -- how to restructure the Soviet economy so that the country  emerges from its prolonged stagnation, how to share political power and avoid  drifting without direction, how to recover the nation's moral strength -- to  determine the success or failure of perestroika or his tenure as the Soviet  leader.  </P> <P> But that conflict, and its growth, reflects many of the problems facing  Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The crisis had been building for many months. Nearly two years ago, 32 people  were killed in anti-Armenian riots in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and  tension had remained high, particularly around the disputed region of  Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of Christian Armenians in predominantly Muslim  Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, true to his belief that political solutions can be found even for  the toughest problems, had doggedly pursued a compromise that not only would  satisfy the Armenians and Azerbaijanis but, according to senior Communist Party  officials, also would contribute to his search for a new federal structure that  will balance the differing interests of the Soviet Union's many ethnic groups.  </P> <P> To Gorbachev, according to party officials who know his thinking, the process  of negotiation is nearly as important as the result, for he sees it playing an  essential role in creating the new political system he wants for the country  and in making that system work in the future.  </P> <P> But those long talks led nowhere, and a top party official involved in them  told the newspaper Literary Gazette, "The time for productive interference has  been lost, and the situation is beyond control now."  </P> <P> The present crisis became all but inevitable at the end of November when the  central government, frustrated by the lack of agreement, reaffirmed  Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan and decided to end its administration of  the region. Armenia reacted by moving to annex the territory, and Azerbaijan  responded with its own countermeasures.  </P> <P> The anti-Armenian attacks last weekend, in which scores of people died,  resulted directly from the frustrations of the tens of thousands of  Azerbaijanis who had fled their homes in Armenia over the last two years but  who were still living as refugees, without proper housing or jobs, in Baku.  </P> <P> "We should have been prepared for the Armenian and Azerbaijani reactions, and  we weren't," a political commentator remarked. "Whatever hope there might have  been was lost at that point. Tensions, which had remained high, built up and  exploded, simply exploded. And now we have a Beirut."  </P> <P> Questions are now being asked why the government moved so slowly, why only now  it is deploying troops to restore order. Speakers who took the floor after  Gorbachev at the Kremlin declared again and again that, as one worker put it,  "our country must be led."  </P> <P> Thousands of letters to the editors are arriving daily at the country's major  newspapers with comments on the situation in Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the  prevailing sentiment is for much firmer action.  </P> <P> "You read these letters and you realize how conservative a nation we are, how  we yearn for stern rulers, and how little changed we are," an editor at a  weekly journal remarked. "These people do not say they want a return to the old  days, but they do expect the law to be upheld and transgressors to be punished.  . . . The political resolution of disputes is good, they feel, but if it fails,  they ask, 'Where is the Red Army?' "  </P> <P> Even a commentator writing for the government newspaper Izvestia noted this  week, in supporting the decision to use troops to restore order in Azerbaijan:  "No one can rebuke the leadership for showing a lack of restraint. To the  contrary, it was satisfied for too long with using only political means."  </P> <P> The leadership did move slowly in sending more peacekeeping troops to the  region, and deliberately so, several well-informed sources said after a  briefing at party headquarters this week.  </P> <P> "It's the Tbilisi syndrome," a political commentator said, referring to the  decision last April to use troops to break up a demonstration in the Georgian  capital of Tbilisi. At least 20 people were killed there, mostly women and the  elderly, when the soldiers beat them with shovels and clubs and used gas to  clear the square outside the government offices.  </P> <P> "If you use the army," the commentator went on, "you risk serious violence with  unpredictable results. This leadership will think very long and very hard about  using the army unless the situation is truly out of hand."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conservative Threat  </P> <P> Gorbachev may also have hesitated to send troops into the region for fear of  giving comfort to his conservative critics, with whom he is now battling over  the new party platform and his desire to accelerate and broaden the country's  political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> A further factor, cited by Western diplomats here, might have been a fear of  alienating the country's numerous and increasingly militant Muslims. Totaling  more than 50 million, they are the majority in six of the Soviet Union's 15  constituent republics. Iran, which borders Azerbaijan and shares religious and  cultural links with it, warned Moscow this week against suppressing the Muslims  there.  </P> <P> But a major factor in determining Gorbachev's response to the conflict appears  to have been his preoccupation with half a dozen other pressing issues.  </P> <P> As the crisis broke with a wave of anti-Armenian violence last weekend that  left more than 40 people dead in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, Gorbachev had  just returned from his trip to Lithuania, where he attempted to persuade the  leaders of that Baltic republic to remain within a liberalized Soviet  federation.  </P> <P> He had other problems, too -- the new Communist Party platform to be adopted  later this month and already the focus of sharp contention; the emergency  program for an economy that seems only to get worse; slowness in enacting the  legislation needed to underpin his whole reform program.  </P> <P> "Armenia and Azerbaijan had long become a chronic problem, and it was always on  our horizon, but not in the middle, not up front," a senior party official said  this week. "We will restore order there, and we will get through this crisis.  We will look for an equitable settlement there -- but we might not find one  soon.  </P> <P> "But we will not allow ourselves to distracted from our overall goals, and we  will not be deterred from pursuing perestroika and democratization. On that,  Mikhail Gorbachev is very firm."  </P></p>

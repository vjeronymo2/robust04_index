			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in NatWest HEAVY turnover in National Westminster Bank saw the shares jump 24p in early trading following the bank's well-received results, which included a near 80 per cent drop in profits and provisions for bad debts of Pounds 1.9bn. The bad news was nearly all expected, and the more positive aspects - including a maintained dividend - removed any worries over the need for a rights issue. The stock's rise was eroded by profit-taking, leaving a net gain of 5 at 308p after turnover of 17m. Traders said the sellers of the stock were those who had bought at around the 264p level in mid-January; the buyers, even at yesterday's high of 327p, were institutional investors as the stock remains a long-term buy on most analysts' lists. Nomura analyst Mr Mike Fesemeyer has moved to a short-term hold. He said: 'The results were a mixed bag. On the one hand, the bank is starting to get costs under control, but it is still not getting the returns on equity it should.' Goldman Sachs also moved to a short-term hold, shaving its pre-tax forecasts but seeing the bank as 'now moving in the right direction'. Panmure Gordon remains a buyer, arguing that 'NatWest's potential for recovery is enormous', and that the worst in terms of provisions is behind it. The broker is looking for Pounds 755m of pre-tax profits this year, and Pounds 1.26bn in 1993, while Goldman Sachs is on Pounds 630m and Pounds 1.175bn respectively and Nomura on Pounds 527m and Pounds 1.1bn. SmithKline volatile Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham saw a volatile performance after announcing profits and a full-year dividend in line with expectations and a proposal to split its 'A' shares and Units. The shares drifted in the morning but were marked up as traders responded to a headline 17 per cent rise in 1991 profits to Pounds 1bn. However, the gains were eroded by a weak early Wall Street showing and reversed by an uneasy reaction to the company's meeting with analysts. At the meeting, the company pointed out that underlying sales for pharmaceuticals, which constitute around half of its turnover, had only risen by 1 per cent. There was also concern that overall growth for this year would be less than the 15 per cent previously expected. Analysts left to review their forecasts and the 'A' fell to close a net 13 down at 915p, the low for the day, with 3.3m traded. There was also a feeling that investors may mow begin to switch from the 'A' shares into the Units, which represent five shares but ultimately will be brought into line with the 'A' by the split. The Units gained 25 to 4190p. Unilever setback Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever finished 30 lower at 938p on disappointment with the year's results, particularly by US investors. Unilever fell in early trading as profits of Pounds 1.792bn, against Pounds 1.782bn last year, came in at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. But Mr Carl Short at Nomura suggested the performance was better than it looked if a negative currency impact and exceptional items were stripped out. After a final dividend of 13.91p the total payout rose 4.3 per cent to 18.94p. The shares rallied as chairman Sir Michael Angus remained cautious about the outlook for 1992 but described the latest figures as a good solid performance. A later slide in the share price followed Wall Street's decline and also reflected a US move out of defensive stocks, such as Unilever, and into cyclicals. Leading property shares were depressed as a large seller of Land Securities moved into the weak market. Land fell 11 to 440p, Hammerson Ordinary 9 to 468p, MEPC 9 to 348p and British Land 5 to 242p. International shares were hit by the weak early Wall Street performance. Glaxo was the most heavily traded stock on the New York exchange during the first few hours of dealing and fell 20 to 793p, Reuters Holdings lost 9 to 1155p and Rothmans International 'B' shed 6 to 1085p. However, Hanson continued to receive support from a number of analysts' buy recommendations and held a gain of 2 1/4 at 215p. BAT Industries was helped by the announcement that it had signed a letter of intent to negotiate a joint venture with three cigarette factories in the Ukraine. The shares were firm at 656p. Turnover in BP was high at 24m shares, with the price firming a penny to 259p. French oil company Elf-Aquitaine announced it had bought BP's refining and marketing operations in West Africa and Tunisia for an undisclosed sum. The deal involves 650 service stations in 12 countries. Shell eased 3 to 442p. Engineering and quarrying business Starmin was the most heavily traded stock in the London market as a number of large blocks of shares were dealt. A spokesman for the company said several long-term shareholders no longer linked with Starmin had decided to off-load their stakes and these were sold through the market to institutions at 11p a share. A total of 30m shares went through the Seaq electronic ticker and the price of the stock closed unchanged at 13 1/2 p. ECC gained 7 to 528p after it said it expected improved 1991 profits and an increased final dividend. Tiphook forged ahead 19 to 364p as County NatWest and SG Warburg reiterated their positive stances on the stock. Turnover reached 1.7m shares. Rolls-Royce ended 2 better at 143p as the market continued to expect the announcement later this week of an engine offer from Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline. Bargain hunters and a reiteration by Kleinwort Benson of its positive stance on Siebe left the shares 7 up at 577p. Press reports that Ford is to create a chain of fast-fit garages as a rival to Kwik Fit weakened the latter's shares by 12 to 188p on 3m turnover. Electronics group Unitech advanced 7 to 208p after an announcement by its largest shareholder, Electrowatt, of Switzerland. Electrowatt said it was considering its position after failing to agree terms for a joint takeover of Unitech with another large shareholder. Turnover reached 1.1m shares as the market speculated on which interested parties might enter the fray. Early strength in ICI was eroded by the market's afternoon fall. The shares climbed 18 initially with the help of a buy note from County NatWest but closed a net 3 off at 1314p. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi continued to attract attention, the shares slipping 1/2 to 16 3/4 p on heavy turnover of more than 22m shares. US investment groups FMR Corp and Fidelity International announced that they had between them taken a 3.05 per cent stake (47.8m shares) in the company. The renewed interest in advertising companies benefited Gold Greenlees Trott, which picked up 6 to 220p. Publisher Pearson was 3 firmer at 795p after touching 800p. Marketing services group Holmes &amp; Marchant slumped 35 to 25p on announcing that, as a result of difficult trading conditions, it is unlikely to pay a final dividend. In a mainly depressed stores sector, Sears put on 2 to 103p on turnover of 4.6m shares. Boots fell 8 to 459p as US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its ratings on the company's debt. Northern-based supermarket group Wm Morrison firmed 2 to 299p, with BZW predicting that the company 'should easily achieve the fastest profits growth out of any superstore major'. J. Sainsbury continued to benefit from Monday's recommendation by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, gaining 1 1/2 to 391 1/2 p. Bass was a firm feature in a generally weak brewing sector. The company's US exposure pulled the shares down from the day's high, but they still ended 3 ahead at 560p, supported by a joint venture between Bass's subsidiary Coral Racing and the Tote to promote off-racecourse pool betting. Grand Metropolitan reversed an early rise to end a penny off at 947p, following profits downgradings after the annual meeting. Earlier the shares touched 961p on news of a proposed two-for-one share split. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (90).

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEY FINDS AMBIVALENCE ON WORKERS' SATISFACTION  </P> <P> Nearly 90% of working adults express some degree of satisfaction with their  jobs but barely one in four feel completely satisfied and 40% work strictly for  the money, according to a new Gallup survey.  </P> <P> The poll of 797 workers, conducted from July 18 to 21 among a random sampling  of adults in the continental United States, indicated that members of the  post-World War II generations who entered the work force since the 1960s are  significantly less satisfied with their jobs than are older Americans.  </P> <P> Only 24% of workers between the ages of 18 and 49 are completely satisfied with  their jobs. Among older workers, the rate is nearly double -- 43%.  </P> <P> Past surveys found that workers became less likely to complain about their jobs  as they entered their 30s and 40s, but today a surprising number of workers in  those age groups retain their youthful dissatisfaction, the poll said.  </P> <P> Only 28% of those surveyed overall are completely satisfied with their general  working life. Thirty percent are completely satisfied with their company, 40%  are completely satisfied with their boss and 41% are completely satisfied with  the kind of work they do.  </P> <P> Yet when asked whether they could find any satisfaction at all in their job,  89% of those surveyed answered affirmatively. Experts familiar with research on  worker attitudes said the high level of general satisfaction underscores a  longstanding dichotomy between day-to-day job frustrations and the human need  to feel some fulfillment in one's job.  </P> <P> Sar Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy at George Washington  University and the author of "Second Thoughts on Work," said polls on job  satisfaction have traditionally drawn superficial responses.  </P> <P> Every poll since the late 1950s has found job-satisfaction levels between 81%  and 92% despite simultaneous responses indicating that only about one-third of  all workers are satisfied with issues like job autonomy or the assistance they  receive from supervisors.  </P> <P> "The most important factor is that people don't want to feel badly about  themselves," Levitan said. "It's the general psychology of people. . . . We do  what we do and then we are satisfied with it, because what else can we do?"  </P> <P> "You have to rationalize your life," explained Andrew Kohut, a Gallup staff  member who worked on the poll.  </P> <P> Richard Belous, a senior economist and human-resource specialist with the  National Planning Assn., a research group sponsored by business, labor and  agriculture, said he believes that high levels of uncertainty in today's  workplace make workers less reluctant to complain.  </P> <P> While unemployment remains low, many companies -- even those that are  financially healthy -- are laying off workers through restructuring plans. That  trend is expected to continue as a hedge against a potential economic downturn.  In addition, salaries are being held in check by low inflation and employers  are increasingly requiring workers to pay for a greater share of their health  benefits.  </P> <P> "We have been in a long economic expansion, but the benefits of this expansion  have not hit a lot of people," Belous said. "For a lot of people in the work  force, if they still have that core job with a good company, they're not going  to complain. They know those jobs are much harder to come by now.  </P> <P> "It's really in good times when people start complaining, when you hear people  talking about things like job enrichment."  </P> <P> Karen Nussbaum, executive director of 9-to-5, a national organization of  working women that focuses on clerical employees, said, "What we usually find  is that people like their jobs but they don't like their treatment. Either they  don't like the people they work for or the place they hold in the system or  they're not compensated or not given an opportunity to really invest themselves  in the job. That's the reality for the most part for the people we're working  with.  </P> <P> "The structure of most jobs prevents you from getting what you go to work for,  and then you're left saying, 'I only do it for the money,' " Nussbaum said.  </P> <P> The Gallup Poll found that while few workers say they are completely satisfied,  56% are happy with most or all aspects of their jobs.  </P> <P> Between 87% and 95% like the security of their jobs, the importance of the work  they do and the amount of contact they have with other people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 75% Like Their Salary  </P> <P> Seventy-one percent like their chances for promotion. Seventy-five percent like  their salary. (Only 16% are completely satisfied with their pay.) And 67% like  their health insurance and benefits.  </P> <P> Other findings of the Gallup survey:  </P> <P> * The poll found no significant difference in job satisfaction between men and  women, although it did find that women put in shorter workweeks than men,  travel less often and tend to have jobs located closer to home.  </P> <P> * Asked if they would continue to work even if they did not need the money, 70%  of those surveyed said yes, but more than half said the work would not be their  current job.  </P> <P> * Long hours are common. About 39% of all workers log 45 hours or more in a  typical week. One in seven say they work 60 hours or more.  </P> <P> * Thirty-eight percent are regularly scheduled to work evenings or weekends or  report they have no set work schedule.  </P></p>

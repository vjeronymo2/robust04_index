			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Soft European markets push Amdahl into deficit AMDAHL, the IBM-compatible mainframe computer company, has, as expected, incurred a fourth-quarter net loss. The company had projected a loss, citing increasing softness in the European market which accounts for about one third of the company's sales, writes Louise Kehoe. The loss totalled Dollars 12.7m, or 11 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 389.9m. It included a tax credit of 6 cents a share for the previous year's losses in certain foreign subsidiaries. In the 1990 fourth quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 61.3m, or 55 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 644.4m . The company said fourth-quarter earnings were also adversely affected by pricing pressures and high start-up costs associated with the introduction of new products. A manufacturing problem, now corrected, also made it necessary to suspend sales of some disk drives for some time. Net income for all 1991 was down sharply to Dollars 10.6m, or 10 cents a share, from Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66, in 1990. Revenues totalled Dollars 1.7bn, down from Dollars 2.2bn.</p>

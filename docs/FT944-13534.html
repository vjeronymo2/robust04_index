			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Occasion to celebrate - Recital Joanna MacGregor devised a beautifully balanced recital programme for the Wigmore International Piano Season on Saturday and somehow charmed the hall's notoriously lusty Steinway into gentle manners. Sceptics might say she did not venture anything new, right down to the Thelonious Monk encore, Round Midnight, on which she lavished as much colour as on Ravel's Miroirs before the interval. Still, perhaps this occasion was something to celebrate rather than an opportunity to experiment. She began with Bach's French Suite Number Five in G major - a fluent performance with lots of light and shade, and abundant, effortless ornaments in the opening Allemande. Each movement sang, though she took the Courante very fast. The Loure, with its rhythmic intricacies, slithered along naturally, and the final Gigue raced at a speed which was exciting because it was so neatly controlled. In the first of Ravel's Miroirs - Noctuelles - she enjoyed caressing the most velvety sonorities, and in the second - Oiseaux tristes - she captured a vivid sense of tropical torpor. Une barque sur l'ocean and Alborada del Gracioso brought out her sense of elan and flamboyance before the quiescent, dusky tolling of the final piece, la vallee des cloches. MacGregor is never precious, and even though Schumann once said he had put on his 'frilly dress' to compose Kinderszenen, she took a straightforward approach to the cycle. That was all to the good - after all, Schumann told his pianist wife Clara she must forget she was a performer when playing the pieces - but if the title of Gluckes genug implies no extremes of feeling, MacGregor left it seeming rather ordinary. On the other hand, her freedom with the pulse in Kind im Einschlummern made the process of dropping true to life, but unnecessarily elaborate. Seven of Chick Corea's Children's Songs made a nice sequel, as well as a contrast. Number Four, with its pliant, melancholy tune over rocking triplets, seemed tailored to suit MacGregor's sleek and limpid style, while the tangy harmonies and propulsive rhythms of Number Twenty sounded closer to Corea's jazz-rock music. Which led neatly to MacGregor's more demanding final choice, the imposing Sonata which Bartok wrote in 1926. The rugged fistfuls of notes and stamping rhythms in the first movement recall the mean, but not so lean, First Piano Concerto of the same vintage. The slow middle movement is spare and grim, while the finale becomes a frenzied dervish dance. It is possible to imagine performances which would have shaped the music's angular features more acutely than MacGregor's, but still, it had plenty of zest and probably enough harshness for most people.</p>

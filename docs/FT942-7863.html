			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Blair to set out his policy approach Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the succession to the Labour leadership, will today set out some of the central planks of his political philosophy in his first significant speech since the death of John Smith, the former leader. In an address to a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think-tank, Mr Blair is expected to spell out the case of Labour's modernisers for a new relationship between the individual and the community. Mr Blair's friends insisted last night that the speech - addressing the links between crime and family breakdown - had been planned since last November and did not mark the opening shot in his leadership campaign. The shadow cabinet decided last week that none of the contenders should stake their claims until after the European elections on June 9. But the shadow home secretary is expected to develop some of the main themes that have distinguished his approach to Labour's policymaking from that of the traditionalists on the left of the party. Mr Blair will stress that Labour's call for much greater social cohesion does not imply a drive to re-impose uniform state controls. Instead, restoring the country's social fabric would be the route to individual self-improvement. He is likely to emphasise also that his party's commitment to extending the rights of individuals is accompanied by a clear appreciation of individual responsibility.</p>

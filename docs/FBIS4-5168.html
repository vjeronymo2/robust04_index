			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The ordinance "on the  endorsement of `the law on the preservation of cultural relics  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea'" was adopted at  the second-day sitting of the Seventh Session of the Ninth  Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] held here today.    The law was adopted as a decision of the SPA Standing  Committee on March 24, 1994.    It consists of six chapters and 52 articles.    The law shall be conducive to establishing strict system and  order in the preservation and management of cultural relics and  keeping them in their original state to properly inherit and  develop the cultural legacies of the nation and exalt the  national pride of the people.    According to the law, the cultural relics include primitive  relics, castles, ruins of beacons, buildings, ruins of  buildings, graves, towers, tombstones, pottery kiln sites,  smithy sites and other historical relics and production tools,  daily necessities, weapons, plastic art works, old books,  ancient documents, human fossils, remains of dead persons and  other historical remains. They are owned by the state only.  The inherited historical relics, however, can be owned by  individual citizens.    The state does not admit the transfer of the ownership of  historical remains which have illegally been carried abroad but  claims their return.    The excavation of cultural relics shall be done only by the  cultural relics preservation institutions and competent  professional organs. Upon discovering cultural relics, an  office, an enterprise, an organisation or a citizen should  report the cultural relics to a preservation guidance  institution or a competent organ.    Cultural relics shall be preserved and managed by the  cultural relics preservation institutions and the offices,  enterprises, organisations and citizens that have the historical  relics.    The state shall designate historical relics reserves in  order  to preserve them.    Historical relics cannot be sold or bought, nor can they be  taken to a foreign country.    The institution that wants to take historical relics to a  foreign country for the purpose of exhibition should obtain the  approval of the Administration Council.    The unified guidance over the cultural relics preservation  shall be given by the central guidance institution for the  preservation of cultural relics.    If anyone digs out cultural relics by stealth, sells or buys  historical relics, takes them to a foreign country or does not  present discovered historical relics, the relevant relics shall  be confiscated.</p>

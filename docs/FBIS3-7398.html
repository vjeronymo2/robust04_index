Security Council to issue a statement rather  than adopt a resolution on North Korea's nuclear problem, saying  it could be more effective.    On his way to Beijing to join President Kim Yong-sam on a  China visit, Han said China cannot but go along with a future  U.N. resolution if North Korea does not come forward even after  the council statement.    "I believe it's advisable to start with a council  president's  statement so that a resolution can be adopted unanimously," Han  said at an airport press conference.    "Even to induce North Korea to negotiations, it would be  more  effective to start low, like a president's statement, than to  start high with sanctions," he said.    China's opposition to a resolution is pulling back what has  been a swift movement at the Security Council to deal with North  Korea who earlier this month refused access to suspected nuclear  facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections.    "China's stance is to emphasize dialogue a little more  before  adopting a resolution," Han said.    The foreign minister heads to Beijing to join the president  who is to arrive in Beijing later in the afternoon for a state  visit. He then goes on a separate trip to the United States from  March 29 to fly between Washington and the United Nations to  coordinate future measures on North Korean nuclear issue.    He stops by Tokyo on March 3-4 before returning to Seoul.</p>

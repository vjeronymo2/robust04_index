			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Transfer ban I am working abroad and sent recently for further details of a new investment trust advertised in the FT. I received a brief reply saying it was 'not permissible to despatch offer documentation outside the UK.' It suggested that, if I was a British national I could make arrangements through a UK financial adviser. I did not have this problem when investing in unit trusts from overseas a few years ago. Your problem is a comprehensive ban on the sponsoring company, or the newly-launched company itself, inviting people outside the UK to subscribe to a new offer unless it is approved by the non-UK country. You could make arrangements to buy the investment trust shares through a UK financial adviser as it, and not you, would then be making the offer to purchase units.

All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

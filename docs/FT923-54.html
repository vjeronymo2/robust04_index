			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biggest nickel supplier searches for cost savings INCO, THE western world's largest nickel supplier with about 25 per cent of the market, is in talks with trade union representatives about the action it must take to stem losses caused by extremely low prices. The unions have been asked to put forward suggestions after hearing graphic descriptions of the company's plight at meetings in Ontario and Manitoba. Mr Bob Allen, Inco's vice president of public affairs, said that union responses were still awaited but there would probably be an announcement at the end of this week. 'We have a number of options, including production shutdowns or shorter work weeks.' However, he dismissed metal market rumours that Inco, which produces about 113,000 tonnes of nickel a year, might cut production for six months as 'absurd'. Nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange rallied from a two and a half-year low yesterday as conviction grew that Inco and Falconbridge, another Canadian nickel producer, would announce output cuts soon. Nickel for delivery in three months, which fell by Dollars 172.50 a tonne on Monday, closed up Dollars 5 last night at Dollars 6,787 a tonne or Dollars 3.08 a lb. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said: 'They have to do something soon if we are not to drown in a sea of nickel'. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said: 'Rumour has it that Inco and Falconbridge are preparing to make cuts, but only when nickel falls below Dollars 6,610 a tonne or Dollars 3 a lb. But why wait until then? If it's so inevitable, why not head it off? Prospects of a demand-led recovery are receding and an improvement in the price can only be brought about by further producer cutbacks'. Nickel demand is suffering both from a fall in stainless steel production - stainless accounts for 60 per cent of nickel consumption - down by 3 per cent in the first half of this year. This resulted in a similar drop in nickel demand. Prices have also been depressed by a substantial increase in Russian exports to the west. Through most of the 1980s communist countries' net exports to the west amounted to about 35,000 tonnes a year. Russian exports reached 120,000 tonnes in 1990 and 1991 and this year are expected to be about that level again. Mr Roger Chaplin, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'With western economies recovering more slowly than expected at the start of 1992, the outlook for nickel markets in the medium term appears grim.' He expected the nickel price to average Dollars 3.50 a lb this year and said it would be doing well to reach Dollars 4 next year. Mr Chaplin suggested that Inco's all-in production costs were about Dollars 3.25 a lb so it was suffering losses in the second half of 1992 and, 'unless there is a substantial rise in the nickel price, it will make losses again next year'.</p>

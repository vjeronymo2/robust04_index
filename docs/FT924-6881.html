			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / How the education authorities compare Until today, comparative results have been the private preserve of local authorities, which, with certain notable and praiseworthy exceptions, seemed to believe that parents cannot be trusted to understand or use the figures wisely.  This attitude is now permanently consigned to the dustbin of educational history. John Patten, education secretary This measure is yet another of Mr Patten's diversionary tactics - pretending he is doing something while, in reality, failing to address the key issue in schools today - underfunding.  And when it comes to the future of British education, John Patten comes bottom of my league every time. Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman The arrangements were devised to fit the requirements of computers and are not a sophisticated analysis to reflect the achievements of pupils or schools. Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, representing leading public schools There is nothing misleading about it, it is putting information which parents have a right to know into the public domain. Baroness Blatch education minister Just as there is more to life than exam results, so there is more to schools than raw exam grades.  What about music, art, sport and giving children a broad-based education for life? Gillian Wood, assistant general secretary of the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association The government might well reflect upon the fortunes of football where the league table mentality reigns supreme.  The few clubs at the top attract all the best players and the money, but what has happened to overall standards and skills, not to mention behaviour?

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> REGIS PHILBIN TO BE 'PREGNANT'  </P> <P> Talk show host Regis Philbin, who has ribbed pregnant co-host Kathie Lee  Gifford about her burgeoning belly over the past few months, will get the  tables turned on him.  </P> <P> In what's being billed as a Day-In-The-Life of a Pregnant Man, Philbin on  Monday will strap on a 35-pound "Empathy Belly," a device designed specifically  for men to experience the severe discomforts of pregnancy -- including fetal  kicks and pressure on the kidneys.  </P> <P> According to a spokesman for the "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," Philbin will  wear his belly all day, not just during the taping. A camera crew will follow  Philbin around New York as he attends business meetings, a power lunch with his  agent at a prominent Manhattan restaurant and an afternoon piano lesson before  going home. The footage will air Tuesday.  </P> <P> It will be the first child for Kathie Lee, wife of ABC sportscaster Frank  Gifford.  </P></p>

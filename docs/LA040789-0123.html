			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Truth in Pasta: Traditional Italian pasta will get a special quality-control  mark from the Italian government under a measure aimed at helping consumers  distinguish it from cheaper imported mixed-wheat pasta. The measure, approved  by the nation's Cabinet and expected to take effect this year, will force  foreign pasta makers to list their ingredients on packages they want to sell in  Italy. Even diners in restaurants will have to be notified of the type of pasta  they are eating. In July, the European Community Court of Justice overturned an  Italian law that barred the sale of pasta not made entirely with durum wheat.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REFERENDUM IS URGED FOR ALIEN POLICY;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN FAVORS ADVISORY MEASURE ON COSTA MESA ISSUE  </P> <P> A Costa Mesa city councilman has proposed that the city's controversial policy  of withholding money from groups aiding illegal aliens be placed on the ballot  as an advisory referendum, but other council members say that such a vote isn't  needed.  </P> <P> Councilman Ed Glasgow, who voted for the policy along with Mayor Peter F. Buffa  and Councilman Orville Amburgey, said that he is concerned because of vocal  opposition that has surfaced since the Aug. 8 vote.  </P> <P> "That's contrary to what my constituents tell me," he said. "The input I get is  that it's supported by 80% of the people. I'd like to know if my input is  accurate or not."  </P> <P> The City Council voted 3-2 earlier this month to withhold funds from any  organization -- except those providing medical aid -- that assists illegal  aliens. Those opposed to the policy have said it would be a costly,  bureaucratic burden and lead to discrimination against Latinos.  </P> <P> Two council members who voted against the policy weren't enthusiastic about a  referendum.  </P> <P> "I generally like to get the public's input, but it seems like we've already  had a tremendous amount of input on this," said Councilwoman Sandra Genis. "It  seems like there's a whole bunch of other stuff we could put on the ballot.  It's an interesting idea, but at the same time, I think we could have a 20-page  ballot."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle, who also voted against the policy, said an  advisory referendum would be a waste of money, even though she said her calls  have run 90% against the policy.  </P> <P> "If we're not out in the community enough to know what the community wants, I  don't think we're doing our job," she said. "This seems like we would be  weaseling out of making our own decision."  </P> <P> Amburgey said that an advisory referendum might be needed if support for the  policy was split about 50-50, but his indications are of strong support.  </P> <P> "It's not even close," he said. "With that kind of support, I see no need for  an advisory election."  </P> <P> An advisory referendum would cost $15,000, said City Manager Allan L. Roeder,  and it is too late for the issue to appear on the November ballot. Instead, the  city would have to wait for the next general election, in June, he said. An  option would be holding a special election at a cost of $46,000, Roeder said.  </P> <P> Although they are opposed to a referendum, Amburgey and Genis said they would  be willing to discuss it at a council meeting. Hornbuckle said such a  discussion would be a waste of time. Buffa could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Besides getting letters and phone calls from residents, council members have  received a petition bearing signatures of 120 residents in favor of the policy.  They were gathered by Costa Mesa resident Patricia Schuda. At a meeting earlier  in the month, she brought a petition with 44 signatures.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some disagreement has arisen among council members on how the policy  would apply to Share Our Selves, which provides medical and dental care and  food and clothing for the needy.  </P> <P> Amburgey said that only SOS' medical and dental care should be exempt from the  policy. But Buffa says the exemption should cover all of SOS' services. He said  he would consider changing his stance if SOS wasn't entirely excluded.  </P> <P> The city is waiting for word from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development, which is reviewing the policy to see if it conflicts with  guidelines barring discrimination on the basis of national origin.  </P></p>

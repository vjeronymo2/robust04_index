			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Bakovsky: "The First Czech Fighter Plane </F> Will Satisfy NATO Standards"]    [Text] Aero Vodochody is preparing production of the first  military aircraft with armaments completely compatible with  those of the NATO. The aircraft in question is the multipurpose  light fighter aircraft L-159. A prototype should finished by  1996. According to the military experts, this will contribute  to increasing the combat readiness of the Czech Army, and the  financial savings are not negligible.    The subsonic L-159 aircraft, based on the L-59 type, should  be part of our army within four years. It should carry  substantially more weaponry in seven holders under the wings.  If attacked, it is capable of aerial combat, and it will be  equipped with a stronger engine, the U.S. F-124, and other  modern systems. The new Czech combat aircraft will be deployed  at the tactical air bases in Caslav and Namest nad Oslavou.    The need for new aircraft results from the transformation of  our Air Force, which will lead to 250 pilots leaving the force  and a reduction of military aircraft by more than 30 percent.  Of the total of 138 aircraft, 77 combat aircraft are being  eliminated. They are mostly older machines, the elimination of  which should limit types of aircraft, including the modern  MiG-29 aircraft, that are not compatible with the NATO  equipment. Moreover, according to Pavel Strubl, the Air Force  inspector, operation is very uneconomical because of the small  numbers involved.    Additional purchases are not planned, and therefore until  the  reequipment, the Czech Air Force will keep its MiG-21's and  MiG-23's, while the void in the fighter force will be filled by  the SU-22 and SU-25 fighter bombers. The lifespan of most of  these aircraft will expire in the coming years but the Air Force  intends to keep them in operation until they are replaced. An  acquisition of modern supersonic aircraft is expected after the  year 2000.</p>

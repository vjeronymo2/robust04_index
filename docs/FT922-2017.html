			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Pressure likely for Courts Charter THE LORD Chancellor's Department is expected to come under pressure today at the prime minister's six-monthly seminar on the Citizen's Charter to explain its failure to produce a final draft of the Courts Charter for consideration by ministers. The department, which is responsible for drawing up a charter to guarantee standards of service for court users in England and Wales, is one of only two government departments that has yet to publish charter material. The delay in publication of a final draft is believed to be largely due to difficulties in setting meaningful standards for court proceedings which will meet the conflicting interests of all court users. Contrary to recent speculation, the Courts Charter for England and Wales will not be based on the Scottish justice charter, which covers standards of service in the police and the prison service as well as the Scottish courts. The English charter will cover four main areas: improvements in court procedures, building on initiatives resulting from the review of civil justice; improvements in facilities in court buildings, adding to the standards already set for the court building programme; customer care; and business standards, which will set out how court proceedings should run. Improvements to facilities in court buildings will include such things as separate waiting rooms for witnesses and defendants, facilities for children, improved access for the disabled and changes to the layout of courtrooms to make them more friendly without reducing security. Customer care will cover such matters as complaints procedures, the wearing of name badges by court staff, and keeping court facilities clean. Standards are causing difficulties for the department because the interests of defendants, prosecutors, witnesses, jurors, judges and court staff often conflict. A defendant on bail pending trial may want as long a delay as possible before the case comes to court, while the prosecution may want to move to trial quickly. The charter is expected to be ready for publication by August but is not expected to be published until after the summer parliamentary recess.</p>

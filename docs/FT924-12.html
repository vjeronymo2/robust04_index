			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Belgian cyclicals wait for economic recovery - Currency strength has helped Brussels produce a respectable performance in 1992 Analysts of the Belgian stock market have been prophesying the end of the downturn for a long time, and forecasting that when the European economy lifts itself out of the doldrums the Brussels bourse, with its heavy emphasis on cyclical, industrial stocks, will be one of the main beneficiaries. Certainly, the cyclicals have suffered over the past three years. A recent study from the National Bank of Belgium indicated that profits at the largest Belgian companies slumped in 1991 to their lowest level since 1987. Industrial manufacturing has been the worst-hit sector over the last two years. Under the circumstances, the Belgian stock market has not performed badly during 1992. The Bel-20 weighted index of the 20 largest stocks began the year at 1,092.72 amid hopes of German interest rate cuts and of a slow revival of industrial profitability. Neither hope was realised and the market registered a 1992 low of 1,046.07 at the beginning of September. But the Bel-20 has surprised the pessimists. By last night it was marginally up on January at 1,127.02. In absolute terms, and by comparison with other small European stock markets, that is pretty respectable. Brokers say that investors have gone for the defensive attractions of the Belgian market during 1992. Since September, Brussels has benefited from the stability of the Belgian franc, while other European currencies have lost their way in the exchange rate mechanism, or dropped out altogether. In addition, once the prospect of widespread cuts in interest rates evaporated, buyers have sought out the stocks which benefit from continued tight monetary policy, such as Electrabel, the high-yielding Belgian utility which is one of the country's largest companies, and the three big banks. In the first quarter, the market's three main retailers - GIB Group, Colruyt and Delhaize 'Le Lion' - also had their attractions. The stocks were spurred on by optimistic company announcements and the potential, particularly in GIB's case, for further modernisation of its chain of supermarkets. Since then, gloom has set in, especially at Delhaize which has been at the receiving end of a particularly vociferous campaign by unions in the US, prompted by allegations that the group's Food Lion subsidiary conducts an 'anti-union' policy. Some analysts believe that investors have overdone the caution - cutting the price of Delhaize shares from BFr1,940 in April to BFr1,288 yesterday - but the slide in one of the bourse's most heavily traded stocks has taken the shine off the market's performance. The other principal disappointment of 1992 has been Petrofina, the oil and gas company, which seemed impervious to criticism until recently. This year, however, the Petrofina 'sacred cow' was slaughtered when the group announced poor figures. Earlier this month, for example, Petrofina forecast poor full-year figures and a halving of its dividend, the first cut for more than 20 years. In addition, uncertainty about the future of the Norwegian Ekofisk field, in which the group has a 30 per cent stake, has cast a cloud over the shares. They have dropped from a peak of BFr11,750 in May to today's level of BFr,7,510 Next year, the full effect of 1992 will be seen in Belgian company results over the first six months. In addition, Ms Alison Kirk, Belgian equities analyst with Williams de Broe in London, points out that the economic and corporate forecasts from Germany, on which Belgium relies increasingly for both trade and interest-rate policy, are almost uniformly gloomy; that is bound to be reflected in Belgium. As if predicting another year of retrenchment, the exchange has just reshuffled the components of the Bel-20 index for the first time since its launch in March 1991. The intention is partly to prepare for the introduction of Bel-20 derivatives on Belfox, the fledgling futures and options market, in the New Year, but the result is to give the index a more defensive feel. For example, in come two of the big banks, Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Kredietbank, and out go two chemicals stocks, Recticel and Tessenderlo. But although caution looks like being the watchword of the Brussels bourse in 1993, some analysts believe that the most prudent industrial companies, which have taken advantage of the downturn to restructure, may be poised for a small recovery. "We'll certainly suffer from the weakness of the German economy. But if you look to the Brussels stock exchange we also have a few industrial companies which are well-linked to the dollar and could benefit from a recovery next year,' says Mr Marc Janssens of Petercam, the Brussels broker. Barco, the electronics group, Union Miniere, the metals company, Delhaize and Bekaert, the steel wire producer, are all possible beneficiaries of a transatlantic upturn. As for the exchange itself, the bourse authorities and its members are preparing for a further shake-up following the 1990 reforms. They intend to bring in a British-style market-making system by 1996, in line with EC securities legislation. That may help some of the volume and liquidity problems which have dogged the bourse, but, as one analyst puts it: '(Brussels) is always going to be small and illiquid, because it's a small country with very few multinationals. To me, it's a question of trying to make the best of what it's got.'</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan bets the bank There must be a sneaking admiration for any country which can announce Pounds 40bn-odd of extra government spending seemingly at the drop of a hat. Investors, however, must consider whether the package of measures announced yesterday will cure Japan's ills. The stock market seems to think so - it has risen 25 per cent in the last 10 days. But there are strong technical reasons for the rise: short-covering and ministry of finance encouragement not to sell among them. Unfortunately, although the measures will boost the Japanese economy by around 2.5 per cent next year, the first effects will not be felt in the economy for months. With the earnings outlook for many Japanese companies still extremely poor, shares look expensive at these higher levels. That said, the proposals are heartening because they show that the government finally accepts there is a problem. But there is a nagging worry that the authorities are shooting at the wrong target. The real Japanese basket case is the financial system, not the economy. True, economic growth will boost bank profits, and support measures for the stock market will raise the value of their share portfolios; lower interest rates will also raise bank margins. But these measures are only of indirect help: the central question of the banks' bad loans has still not been adequately addressed. These bad debts are vast - one estimate puts core non-performing loans around Y10,000bn - some Pounds 40bn; doubtful loans could be 10 times that amount. With a black hole of that size a government lifeboat will be needed, so taxpayers and the banks will end up sharing the losses. Until the bank rescue is ready, investors can be excused for remaining cautious. Arm-twisting may only keep the stock market up until the half year ends on September 30. It is to be hoped the lifeboat is ready by then.</p>

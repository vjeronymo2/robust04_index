			<p>BFN     [Text] The day after the elections is more important for  the political parties. The results, which contradicted all  preelection polls, have political party officials thinking  seriously. Despite the euphoria of the smaller parties whose  power was increased significantly, their officials are also  examining the results seriously.    The final results were announced just a short while ago:  PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] received 37.64 percent  of the vote and 10 seats; New Democracy received 32.66 percent  and nine seats; Political Spring received 8.65 percent and two  seats; KKE [Greek Communist Party] received 6.29 percent and two  seats; and the Coalition of the Left and Progress received 6.25  percent and two seats. DIANA [Democratic Renewal], which  received 2.79 percent of the vote, did not manage to elect a  deputy to the European Parliament.</p>

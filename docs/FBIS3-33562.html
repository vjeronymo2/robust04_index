			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Casasola; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] During the 100 marches organized by the Party of the  Democratic Revolution [PRD], the authorities have not reported  any major incident, except for traffic jams that are affecting  thousands of drivers. The streets most affected by these  demonstrations are La Reforma, Juarez, Higaldo, Insurgentes,  Puente de Alvarado, (?Tlalpan), Fray Cervando, and the entire  first block [cuadro], among other major areas. The General  Safety and Roads Secretariat as well as the Federal District  Attorney General's Office have reported despite the large number  of people participating in the demonstrations, there have been  no incidents so far.    The Neighborhood Assemblies comprised the largest group seen  on Thursday. The demonstrators tried to reach Los Pino's  official residence but only got to (?Chivatito) Plaza.  Presidential residence officials met with a delegation of this  group. Despite the intense heat, demonstrators at one point  marched on the sidewalks but then took to the streets,  congesting traffic, mainly in the historic midtown area.  Demonstrators are gathering there after concluding their  marches. The situation has grown worse, because most of the  people who came from Toluca, Mexico State, and had been  gathering at the Guadalupe Basilica since yesterday have begun  to return to their homes by buses, bicycles, or on foot. Some  people are walking on the sidewalks, while others are walking on  the asphalt roads; that is, on avenues and streets. The Relief  and Medical Emergency Squad and the Red Cross have reported  during the course of these demonstrations they cared for 37  people who succumbed to insolation or fatigue. None of them had  to be hospitalized and were simply cared for on the spot.  Bearing placards and shouting, the demonstrators have demanded  housing and, by the same token, better wages and a better  administration of justice or respect for human rights; others  marched to support peace via dialogue in Chiapas. Private and  public offices closed their doors to keep demonstrators out.  The same thing happened in certain political offices in the  Federal District Department, Chamber of Deputies, and the Mexico  City Attorney General's Office. I repeat: There have been no  major incidents, according to the information provided by the  Federal District authorities. That is what we have so far, but  we will continue to follow the situation, because several groups  are moving toward Zocalo, causing serious problems and traffic  chaos, primarily in Mexico City's first block. Although the  General Safety and Roads Secretariat deployed 3,000 agents, I  would describe the situation as chaotic. I would say it is  impossible to control the traffic chaos, which, I repeat, is  mainly taking place in the historic area.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas] </F>   [Text] Even though Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz  said on 26 February that the so-called "Option Zero" -- which  envisages the total eradication of surplus coca plantations --  is only a proposal and that its implementation depends on the  international community providing the necessary economic aid,  peasant leaders assert that it is already under way.    Soliz stated: "`Option Zero' is just a proposal. We must  study it. This will take some time. No definite decision has  been taken. It is a proposal by certain echelons of the  government that we must assess. We must see what funds are  available to implement it in the Chapare region."    In the view of several peasant leaders who spoke to this  daily on the evening of 26 February, the violent action  yesterday by FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force] personnel in  Chapare proves that the "proposal" to eradicate surplus  plantations is already underway. Minister of Government German  Quiroga denied such an outrage.    Soliz stated that until the proposal is made official, the  U.S. Embassy in Bolivia cautiously awaits an outcome while  monitoring further developments in the problem with coca growers.    He said: "They are waiting to make a more thorough  assessment  and to see how much money can be collected for this project.  This must be supported by nations and international  organizations with which we have friendly ties and which can  give us the necessary funding."    This cautious U.S. stance was maintained by George A.  Auflick, the DEA chief in Bolivia who, during a brief encounter  with the press yesterday, declined to comment.    Soliz denied that opposition by the peasants to eradication  will lead to clashes with Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco)  officials who -- supported by FELCN troops -- have already  eradicated some surplus plantations.    The tense atmosphere in Chapare robs Soliz's optimistic  words  of any credibility.    "The peasants are well aware that we are acting within the  law. Moreover, the volume of plantations eradicated so far is  negligible," he stated, emphasizing that the eradication of "a  few hectares of illegal plantations" was done near where  maceration pits had been discovered by the FELCN and that were  used exclusively for the production of cocaine paste.    Given the desire to fully eradicate surplus plantations, the  five coca growers federations from Chapare demand what they call  "Option One" -- the expulsion of all DEA agents.    During a interview with PRESENCIA last week, Soliz conceded  that the proposal should be given careful consideration although  he stated he did not know the reasons for this demand.    He said: "We cannot decide yet on something that we still do  not know about ("Option One"), but we will certainly assess the  role the DEA is playing in our country."    He added: "We must see how it can be beneficial for the  country and how not. I believe we must investigate and  seriously analyze what is right for us and what should be  definitely discarded because it does not suit us."    On 14 February, coca growers from Chapare alleged that FELCN  personnel, in coordination with DEA agents and Direco officials,  compulsorily eradicated coca plantations.    This action is considered by peasants as the start of the  total eradication of their plantations under the so-called  "Option Zero." Even though this was denied by Soliz, he  acknowledged that "there is concern in Chapare over what has  been done (the eradication of illegal coca plantations) in  keeping with the law."    This assessment sharply contrasts with that of coca growers,  who noted that "they will not allow their plantations to be  eradicated."    During a rally of coca growers last 18 February, Felix  Santos, a peasants' leader, expressed this feeling by openly  challenging the country's drug enforcement agencies. He stated:  "If enforcement agencies kick us, we will club them; if they  destroy our plantations, we will cut off their hands."    In light of the determination of the government, the  peasants  are demanding that "Option One" be implemented. Their leaders  explained that this option entails the expulsion of all DEA  agents, which could be analyzed by the government although there  is a very remote possibility of this happening because U.S.  economic aid to our country foresees the eradication of  plantations. Let us hope this does not bring serious  consequences in its wake.</p>

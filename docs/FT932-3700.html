			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Hair today - and rich tomorrow: One man has made a fortune from hair growth lotion. Another has cornered the action in watch straps. Both are typical of China's flourishing breed of entrepreneurs BEIJING: We are driving across the city's vast, central Tiananmen square in Mr Zhao's Mercedes 280 SEL with its dark, tinted windows and car telephone. Known widely throughout China as the 'hair lotion king,' he is in an expansive mood. 'Call your friends anywhere in the world . . . call your mother, call your wife,' he says, offering me the 'phone. I call my wife at home in Beijing to tell her I will be late for an appointment. The ebullient Mr Zhao is reminiscing now as we pass on the right the Gate of Heavenly Peace, with its outsize portrait of Mao, and on the left the Great Hall of the People, seat of China's parliament. Mr Zhao was elevated to parliament recently for his money-making abilities. 'Getting selected for parliament only ever appeared in my dreams from time to time,' he says, reflectively. 'You know what they call me now? The Red Fat Cat.' Mr Zhao is perhaps the best-known member of China's newest class ' the entrepeneur or ge ti hu. He has certainly become one of the richest since he began producing and marketing a hair-growth tonic that, he insists, has achieved spectacular results. Not so long ago, Mr Zhao's entrepreneurial activities would have been scorned and his material success held as a black mark against him. Indeed, the word ge ti hu was not even in common use before paramount leader Deng Xiaoping began, late in the 1970s, to prise open China to the outside world and declared that 'to get rich is glorious.' Since those first, faltering steps towards a market economy with Chinese characteristics, millions like Mr Zhao have taken the entrepeneurial, if not capitalist, road. According to China's taxation bureau, 15.3m private businesses had sprouted by the end of 1992 and the total is expected to reach 30m by the year 2000. Mr Zhao comes from a remote part of China that has itself become a symbol of rampant commercialism. It is in places like the small, damp, coastal city of Wenzhou, 300 kilometres south of Shanghai, that the quite awesome, almost manic, energies being applied to making money and getting ahead are seen best. Wenzhou had no airport until recently and there is no railway, although one is being built. Roads are rutted and, in spite of a rash of new buildings, the place appears dilapidated: yet Wenzhou, population 1m, has far outstripped most of the nation in per capita income and other indices of improved living standards. Local officials attribute Wenzhou's remarkable progress to the innate liveliness of coastal dwellers - and to hardship. As Cai Yanjong, head of the local economic commission, noted: 'We have been forced to be like this. In the past, Wenzhou was very poor. To improve living standards, we had to do whatever was necessary.' Doing whatever was necessary may well have involved bending official rules. Wenzhou, for instance, established its own 'trust' banks - rather like building society co-operatives ' long before the authorities allowed much flexibility at all in the banking area. Mr Zhao, a sprightly individual with a thick brush of dark hair, is a perfect example of a Wenzhou rags-to-riches story. Born in 1943 to a poor family that farmed medicinal herbs, he was destined to spend his life as a lowly-paid accountant in a production brigade. But that was before he discovered his true vocation preparing skin care potions and, later, the hair tonic. The story of how he got started has an Alice-in-Wonderland quality typical of China where fact and fantasy often are inter-twined. In 1968, he sold his wife's jewellery and his house in Wenzhou for around Pounds 110 to raise the money needed to buy the herbs for his preparations. He began with what he claims is a successful acne treatment and the first patient for his hair tonic - which he calls Formula 101 - was an attractive young girl who, tragically, had lost her hair. Not only that - her wig had fallen into a river and been swept away. Enter gallant Mr Zhao. 'You provide the head, and I'll provide my herbs,' he told her parents, before getting to work on finding the right formula. This, he says, took him six years; and when, eventually, he found a mixture that worked, he named it '101' because he had tried at least that many combinations. Today, the formula is guarded as jealously as that for Coca Cola, but Mr Zhao does reveal it is based on 20 herbal ingredients, some gathered as far afield as Tibet and Mongolia, which work by warming the scalp and improving blood circulation. Mr Zhao, whose hobbies include playing the lute and reading books on China's 5,000-old tradition of herbal cures, claims also to have developed an elixir that removes greyness from hair. Many Chinese, including members of the ageing leadership, will do almost anything to avoid going grey - to the extent of using unsightly dyes that produce an effect like boot black. If Mr Zhao has produced an oral medicine that makes hair dyes redundant, he should be onto another winner. Mr Zhao is perplexed by apparent western resistance to herbal cures. 'Outsiders don't understand Chinese medicine,' he says. 'People who understand appreciate it. Western medicine is based on analysis and work in laboratories. Chinese medicine depends on practice and experimentation.' Some may describe Mr Zhao as a 'quack' - a term that seems genuinely to hurt him. But he certainly is laughing all the way to the bank. He expects to produce about 3m containers of Formula 101 this year, 40 per cent of which will be exported. Profits should exceed Pounds 4.5m. Joint ventures with foreign businessmen are in the wind, and the American Food and Drug Administration is evaluating his product. FDA approval would add enormous value to Formula 101, which is being imported into the US as a cosmetic, not a drug. Not bad for someone who might have spent his life copying figures into a dusty ledger. Mr Zhao's chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up outside an arched shop front on Beijing's busy Xidan street, one of its main shopping thoroughfares. It is one of his clinics and white-coated female attendants are clearing up for the day, but one 'patient' remains to be seen. For a balding worker visiting Beijing from a provincial town, this is his lucky day. Mr Fan is about to be treated by the master. Mr Zhao dons a white coat and begins massaging his Formula 101 into Mr Fan's scalp. A treatment costs about Pounds 9 - equivalent to a week's wages for the average worker - but Mr Fan says this is a small price to pay. 'I've been going bald for seven years and look older than I am,' he says. 'I heard that 101 was magical. Everybody's talking about beauty now ' beautifying life. People are paying more attention to appearance.' Mr Zhao, who employs 1,200 people at factories and clinics throughout China, exhibits no reserve about his good fortune although he is careful to credit China's communist leadership, past and present, with creating conditions for people like him to prosper. He reveals, for example, that long ago he re-purchased the old family house in Wenzhou. And he announces, proudly, that he has built a 1,000 square metre mansion near his home town for his retirement. He keeps a penthouse flat in Beijing in one of the city's more exclusive addresses, and is planning to buy a newer Mercedes. 'This car's quite old,' he says, apologetically. If Mr Zhao's story is remarkable, so also is the story of Qiaotou, a small town about an hour's drive inland from Wenzhou. There, entrepreneur traders and manufacturers have virtually cornered China's button market, and also are producing a fairly big percentage of the country's metal watch bands. Tang Runong, a local party official, describes Qiaotou (population 60,000) as the 'paradigm of a socialist market economy' with annual revenues of around Pounds 35m. The per capita income works out at around four times the national average, although the many stern signs around the town warning against tax evasion suggest that material success has not made people any more willing to share their spoils with the state. 'You won't find this small town on the map of China, but everybody has heard about us,' he says, with satisfaction. Before the open-door policy, the town had one small inn and one restaurant: now, it boasts 60 restaurants and 60 hotels. Just how Qiaotou achieved its great leap to prosperity is the stuff of legend. According to local lore, some impoverished peasant farmers were visiting Nanjing, on the Yangtze, where they discovered a batch of imperfect buttons discarded on a rubbish tip. They carried the buttons back to Qiaotou and found, to their delight, that they were tradeable items. So began a business in one of life's most basic commodities that has led to Qiaotou itself making half of China's buttons as well as being the wholesaling centre for about 80 per cent of the country's requirements. With China's garment-producing industry growing very rapidly, Qiaotou's future seems assured. Along the way, a fairly significant number of people there have become rich beyond their wildest dreams. Xian Guo Xing, the watch band 'king' of Qiaotou, has a problem: he cannot fit a lift in his six-storey house to transport him to his various floors. These boast a bar stocked with cognac, a 27-inch colour television, a roof garden with commanding views, and a personalised Karaoke bar with its oversized loudspeakers. By any standards, Xian has made it. He has a simple solution for his lift problem - he is giving the house to his son and daughters and moving down the road to a larger, new dwelling - complete with an elevator. All this is not bad for someone who was labouring in the fields as a peasant until seven years ago. But while Xian is happy to admit that things have moved fast for him, he insists that others have got rich more quickly and have bigger houses with lifts. Indeed, a lift appears to be the ultimate status symbol in Qiaotou. 'Look over there,' he says, gesturing from his roof garden. 'There is a much bigger house than mine - with a lift in it.' Madam Jiang, Xian's talkative wife, still cannot quite believe their good fortune. She recalls that when they were married in 1957, they lived without running water and had to burn straw in their stove for heating and cooking. They owned neither radio nor sewing machine and she carried water from the river in buckets. Now, their house has three kitchens and three bathrooms, two washing machines, four colour television sets (hooked up to a cable service), a microwave, and other labor-saving devices she did not know existed when she married. 'We lived on sweet potatoes,' she says. 'I never expected this. My biggest wish was simply to live a better life. The difference between then and now is like heaven and earth.' Xian has a fairly crude philosophy about making money and the widening gap between rich and poor. 'You can't make everyone equal,' he says. 'Equality cannot develop the country. You have to have someone who gets rich first. 'If the boss gets rich, everyone from the village gets rich with him.' At a nearby factory, Mr Zhang, one of Qiaotou's 'button kings,' would agree. Business is tough, he says, noting that he works more than 10 hours a day, seven days a week. 'Wealth never simply drops down from heaven into your pocket,' he adds. Back at the Qiaotou button market itself, a series of large structures on the main street, buyers and wholesalers haggle over prices and quality. But all seem to have one idea: to make money. Typical is young Miss Jin Jian Feng, who presides over mounds of buttons made by her family. She aims to travel widely. She also wants a car. What sort? 'A big car - and an imported one,' she says, emphatically.</p>

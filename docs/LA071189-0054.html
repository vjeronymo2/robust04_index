			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Fifteen South Pacific nations alarmed at the depletion of tuna stocks by  drift-net fishing asked help to force Japan and Taiwan to end the practice. The  Pacific leaders, meeting in Tarawa, Kiribati, for their two-day annual South  Pacific forum, are alarmed that the practice -- also called gill-net fishing --  threatens the Pacific's economic future, said Cook Islands Prime Minister  Geoffrey Henry. The technique uses nets up to 30 miles long and has been  likened to strip mining the ocean.  </P></p>

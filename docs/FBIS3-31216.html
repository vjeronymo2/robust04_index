The delegation intended to observe what has  happened to the Albanians returned from Austria, Scandinavian  countries and Germany.    Concerning the refusal of the Serbian authorities to go to  Kosova, Ms. Christine von Kohl told BBC: "This time we received  no answer." She explained how she had personally talked with  the official in charge of so-called Yugoslav Embassy in Vienna.    Ms. von Kohl said one of the reasons for refusing the visas  might be the fact that the Belgrade's authorities want to show  they do not observe the CSCE norms as it recently happened with  the Amnesty International.</p>

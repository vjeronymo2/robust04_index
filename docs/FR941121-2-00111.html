			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 8. The DOT reserves the right to require that additional data be collected and made available to allow the DOT to make comparative analyses with similar functions or features associated with other national operational tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all tests, an independent and comprehensive test evaluation must be undertaken. The offer should indicate how the independent evaluation will be accomplished and include an estimate of the evaluation cost. Once the operational test project is underway, the independent evaluator should be brought into the process just before or, at the latest, during the development of the detailed evaluation work plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Partnership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An ITS operational test will typically involve a carefully crafted partnership that is negotiated among Federal, State, local, private, and other institutions. A partner is an entity that participates directly in the preparation of the operational test offer and plays a substantial role in defining the scope of the operational test, technologies included, and financial participation. Management of the operational tests, including funding, technical and administrative responsibilities, is shared among the partners in the operational test. Although an independent evaluator is not considered a formal member of the partnership, the offer can identify a proposed independent evaluator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential private sector partners in ITS operational tests are encouraged, when appropriate, to work with appropriate State and local transportation agencies or other public sector organizations in the preparation of proposed cooperative ventures. Partners are also strongly encouraged to seek participation from certified Minority Business Enterprise firms, Women Business Enterprise firms, Disadvantaged Business Enterprise firms, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other minority colleges. Offerors are also encouraged to seek opportunities that provide for the use of existing defense and space technologies for ITS applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with &sect;6058 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2194, the maximum share of an operational test funded from Federal funds, including ITS funds, cannot exceed 80 percent. The remaining 20 percent must be from non-federally derived funding sources and must consist of either cash, substantial equipment contributions which are wholly utilized as an integral part of the project, or personnel services dedicated full-time to operational test purposes for a substantial period, as long as these staff are not otherwise supported with Federal funds. The non-federally derived funding may come from State, local government, or private sector partners. In an ITS partnership, as with other DOT cost-share contracts, it is inappropriate for a fee or profit to be included in the proposed budget. This prohibition on the inclusion of a fee or profit applies to all partners to the proposed operational test. This does not prohibit appropriate fee or profit payments to vendors or others which may provide goods or services to the partnership. For example, equipment vendors, software providers, and entities retained for comprehensive operational test evaluation purposes would not be subject to this prohibition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOT, the Comptroller General of the U.S., and, if appropriate, the States have the right to access all documents pertaining to the use of Federal ITS funds and non-Federal contributions. Non-Federal partners must submit sufficient documentation during final negotiations and on a regular basis during the life of the operational test to substantiate these costs. This includes items such as direct labor, fringe benefits, material costs, consultant costs, subcontractor costs, and travel costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to maximize available Federal ITS dollars and be consistent with agency policy, prospective partners are encouraged to increase their cost share to 50 percent. Additional funds provided over the required 20 percent minimum may come from a variety of funding sources and may include the value of federally-supported projects directly associated with the ITS operational test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

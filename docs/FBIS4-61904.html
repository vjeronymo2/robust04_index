			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Abkhazia expressed a protest  to Georgia over violations of its airspace by Georgian planes  and warned it will shoot them down.    A statement by the Defence Ministry carried by the press  service of the Abkhazian parliament expressed determination of  Abkhazia "to destroy all flying craft which violate the border".    Russian experts fear that the situation in Abkhazia may  aggravate in case any of the conflicting sides resorts to  provocations. Tensions may spiral up, they believe, because both  Georgia and Abkhazia occupy tough positions at the current talks  in Moscow and often ignore reached agreements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Makarov] </F>   [Text] Sytyvkar June 3 TASS -- Chairman of the Executive  Committee of Russia's Communist Party Gennadiy Zyuganov told a  press-conference on Thursday that he was satisfied with the  results of his just-concluded four-day trip in the Komi  republic. Zyuganov, a State Duma member, held many meetings  with workers in Sytykvar, Vorkuta, and Ukhta. Everywhere he  went, he said, he was met with warmth and attention.    Zyuganov said that he had noticed "a shift to the left" in  the Komi republic and Russia as a whole, which is attributable  to the harsh realities of life today. He said he had expected a  cold reception by the miners in Vorkuta, who have been famous  for their support for Boris Yeltsin. However, his apprehensions  proved to be unfounded, and he was also met "kindly" there.    Answering an ITAR-TASS question, the communist leader said  he  felt that his party had good potential for growth in the polar  town, which has so far given rise to only 100 members of the  Communist Party. There are about 1100 official communists in  the whole republic of Komi.    Zyuganov considered the most important reason for the shift  in the attitude of the Vorkuta workers to be their current  living conditions, which he said determine one's consciousness.  "The miners understood that they had been deceived and deceived  badly. In every respect, miners today are in a worse position  than they were earlier. Zyuganov mentioned noticing a shift to  the left in the attitude of Vorkuta residents as well.    At all his meetings, Zyuganov appealed for a wide coalition  of "state-patriotic forces" and for accord in the name of  Russia. After the union of all the patriotic forces, the  opposition "can and should change the power and the state system  in the country in a constitutional way", he said. Possibilities  for such action are appearing, since society in general is being  "enlightened, although, unfortunately, slower than the country  is being destroyed", the communist leader declared.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Turnout high for Ukraine election Ukrainians turned out in large numbers yesterday for their first post-independence presidential election. Preliminary results early this morning suggested the vote would go to a second round between the incumbent, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, in two weeks' time. Early reports from several polling stations throughout Ukraine indicated that Mr Kuchma had made a strong showing in the more Russified eastern regions of the country and Crimea but this had been offset by Mr Kravchuk's popularity in the centre and the west. Mr Oleksandr Moroz, the hardline socialist chairman of parliament, was running a weak third. Turnout was reported to be 68 per cent of the 38m voters. Results were expected later today. Opinion polls on the eve of the elections suggested Mr Kravchuk had undergone a transformation, from the man who destroyed Ukraine's economy, to the only leader who could guarantee the country's stability. Manipulating state television with considerable skill, he seemed in recent weeks to have successfully reshaped the national debate. Now, instead of being about repairing the economy, it is about maintaining national independence.</p>

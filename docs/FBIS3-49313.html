			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 9 Jan (TANJUG)--At a ceremonial session of  the Srpska republic assembly in Pale today, marking the Srpska  republic's statehood day, the Srpska republic president Radovan  Karadzic gave an introductory speech on the two-year long  liberation war and the just struggle of the Serb people for  peace and national interests.    In his address to the assembly deputies, representatives of  the state authorities, and guests, Karadzic first pointed at the  historical dimension of the centuries-long struggle by the Serb  people to resist suffering and slavery, as well as the efforts  to overcome all cracks and divisions in Serb national unity.    Emphasizing that the Serbs have spent this century under  constant supervision, whose objective was to prevent any  integration among the Serbs, Karadzic added that "the claims  made by Catholic and Islamic international circles that the war  in the former Yugoslavia is not a religious war are untrue. The  wars in 1914 and 1941 were religious, and the war in 1991 was  and is a religious war aimed at exterminating the Orthodox  world."    "A large number of Muslims were nationally unaware, and  there  were even unaware Muslims who in ethnic terms declared  themselves as Serbs, although they also took part in the  genocide of Serbs because they were driven solely by religious  motives," Karadzic said.    As far as political violence against the Serbian people is  concerned, the president of the Srpska republic noted that the  most pressing aim of Croatia's "democracy" was to exclude the  Serbs from its constitution in the process of secession, while  the first task of the Muslim leadership of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina  was to cancel the constitutional rights of the Serbian people.  This political violence turned into the jihad warriors' battle  cries, Karadzic said. He added that all the masks of fake  Yugoslav values, fake communism, fake Europeanism, and of  everything the Muslims had faked and worn as a mask since the  departure of Turks from these lands had been dropped at the  moment.    It is precisely Turkey's attempt to return to the Serbian  lands as an empire that encouraged the local Muslims to attempt  to oppress the Serbians again. This time, however, there were  new Serbians, unknown to the Islamic east and Catholic west.  This time their attempt at dividing and stifling the Serbians  by Serbians was foiled. Apart from a few shameful exceptions,  traitors and degenerates who could not be cured of their servile  obedience and subservience, the Serbians as a whole united and  reconciled as never before. They stood up and defended  themselves, Karadzic said, stressing that their return to  tradition and religion swept away the decades of rusty lies and  delusions.    "Our political reply to their violence was, first, the  separation of our deputies to the Assembly of  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by our proclamation of the  Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and later of the Serb  Republic. This took place exactly two years ago on Scepan Day  1992. We replied by to their political violence with political  moves and measures. We reacted to their dismantling of a state  by building our state," Karadzic said.    President Karadzic then recalled, in his reminiscence of  past  events, that in the first 45 days of the war the people led by  the Serb Democratic Party--as the main political power of the  Serb people outside Serbia--stood up against the enemy. The  armed Serb people became the Serb army in the best sense of the  word, in the spirit of the best heroic Serb military tradition.  A number of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers  recognized in themselves the oath of their forefathers and  volunteered to lead the units of the newly formed Srpska  republic army.    "Despite all the lies and slander of international  propaganda, the Srpska army has preserved its spirit of chivalry  and its military honor, as befits it. All lies about the crimes  committed by this army, having been used for the purpose of  exerting pressure on Serbia and the Serbs, have already been  forgotten, even by those who had launched them. Brilliant  victories of the people's army, its military conduct, bravery,  and heroism, have secured the existence of the Srpska republic  and the Serb people and have made even the enemy and hostile  international circles acknowledge and even admire Serb soldiers."    Deputies of this assembly, regardless of their party  allegiance, with all their political struggle and other work,  promptly joined the action of forming the army and even directly  took part in the armed struggle, in which two of them--Goran  Zekic and Milovan Bjelosevic--lost their lives. Milutin  Najdanovic, our prominent federal deputy, was killed in a  beastly manner in Sarajevo, Karadzic said.    Exceptional heroism has been demonstrated by the doctors and  medical staff who in time organized the war hospitals that have  saved the lives of a large number of our fighters, the president  of the Srpska republic said.    Many of our heroes will not be mentioned in this limited  speech, but they will be held in the Serbian people's memory,  Karadzic pointed out.    Our generation's self-confidence and its trust in historic  endeavor would not have been possible without the sense of unity  in our people east and west of the Srpska republic, Karadzic  stressed. The republic of Serb Krajina, which conceived the idea  and national ideology of the Serb Democratic Party, is always in  our mind as an example of courage as well as an obligation.    We must never forget, although we rather unjustifiably  seldom  mention it, the help of the people and leadership of Montenegro  and the support of most political parties there.    Without Serbia's transformation, its rise from the ashes and  the completion of its integrity and the resolve of the people  and leadership of Serbia, we would not have an indispensable  support and have no hope in success, Karadzic stressed.    Serbia is our beginning and our goal, our inspiration and  hope, our cradle. All the calculations of our enemies have  collapsed because Serbia--its people, leadership and political  parties--have not been acting as they were expected to act. They  did not let us down.    Our aim is to unite with Serbia. We are not going to conceal  this. This is our right, which is identical to the right of a  bird to fly or of a flower to boast of its smell and colors.    We have this right. For centuries we deserved a Serbia, and  now we have finally secured it. Serbia deserves us too. Long  live the Serbian people and all its friends. Long live all the  Serbian lands that are called--in a word--Serbia, President  Karadzic said in the conclusion to his address to the deputies  of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic and the numerous  guests at the ceremonial session marking its second anniversary.</p>

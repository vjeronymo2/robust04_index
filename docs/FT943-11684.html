			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Bank seizes Tapie's furniture Credit Lyonnais yesterday seized most of Mr Bernard Tapie's valuable 18th century furniture and pictures from his Paris mansion in order to sell them as part repayment of the FFr1.2bn (Pounds 144m) which the businessman-politician owes the bank. Mr Tapie denounced the seizure as 'illegal and politically motivated'. In March Credit Lyonnais agreed to spread repayment of Mr Tapie's debts over four years, but it claims Mr Tapie has since failed to honour provisions relating to his mortgaged furniture. Mr Tapie claims the bank breached the March debt accord, an argument which his lawyers will put to a court hearing in late October, at which Credit Lyonnais is separately seeking to recover FFr237m of its loans. Mr Tapie claimed yesterday that he had enough assets to cover his debts.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to shortening the time for initiating certain cases, it is expected that this test program also will encourage prompt settlement of proposed civil penalties in these cases. The program will not eliminate an individual's opportunity to request a hearing or otherwise contest a proposed civil penalty. This SFAR will be effective for two years, unless sooner canceled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulatory changes initially will be tested in certain civil penalty assessment actions resulting from violations occurring in two FAA regions (Great Lakes and Southwest) at three airports (Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport, O'Hare International Airport, and Indianapolis International Airport). The program may be extended to violations at other airports or regions during the duration of the test program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the test program will apply only to alleged violations by individuals presenting dangerous or deadly weapons for screening at airports or in checked baggage, for which a civil penalty less than $5,000 is proposed. While the FAA considers these violations to be serious, the initial evaluation and processing of these cases tends to be uncomplicated. Violations of weapons prohibitions, on the other hand, for which a penalty of $5,000 or more is sought ordinarily are more factually complex and involve evidence of several aggravating factors. As a result, these cases tend to be more difficult to process, and, therefore, would not be appropriate for handling under the test program. The FAA does not intend to apply this program to complex civil penalty actions, including factually complicated cases under $5,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the program is successful in streamlining the civil penalty enforcement process for the cases described above, the FAA will consider amending this rule to extend the program to include other relatively simple violations warranting civil penalty action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures and Delegations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The test program will involve several changes to current enforcement practice. The test program dispenses with the FAA's current practice of ordinarily issuing to the alleged violator a letter of investigation seeking information about the alleged violation. Experience has indicated that in the majority of factually clear, uncomplicated cases, the respondent often does not provide additional relevant information that is not already known to the FAA. The information received by the FAA from local law enforcement offices regarding weapons violations at airport screening checkpoints tends to be complete and beyond serious dispute. A respondent, however, will continue to have an opportunity to make any statements and submit any evidence regarding the alleged violation following notification of the alleged violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security Division Managers and Deputy Division Managers, instead of FAA attorneys, will initiate a legal enforcement action by issuing a notice of violation (NOV) to the respondent. The NOV will cite the relevant facts and circumstances pertaining to the alleged infraction and will include a proposed civil penalty amount. The authority to issue NOVs will not be delegated below the division level. By delegating to the Office of Civil Aviation Security the authority to send the initial notification to a respondent of an alleged violation, the FAA believes that it can reduce significantly the time currently expended before a respondent is given this notification. The name and phone number of a security agent involved in the investigation will be included in the NOV in case the respondent has any questions about the action being proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NOV will serve the same purpose that the notice of proposed civil penalty now serves under current procedures. The NOV, however, will include the following specific information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A description of the alleged violation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed amount of civil penalty; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An offer of settlement of the case, if appropriate, as described below; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

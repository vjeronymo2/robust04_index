			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY CONTRACTS  </P> <P> I was angered and amazed upon reading about the severe problems afflicting the  county's contracting-out program ("Delays in Repairs of County Vehicles May  Cost Contractor," Metro, Feb. 17). Angry, because the problems so often  associated with contracting public services to private companies were predicted  and could have been avoided. My amazement stems from the new heights of  arrogance that have apparently infected the private sector.  </P> <P> When Proposition A (the passage of which allowed the county to contract with  private vendors for services provided by county employees) was being debated in  1978, the public was inundated with claims of increased efficiency and  million-dollar tax savings that would result from contracting-out. Conservative  supervisors and their ideological friends assured us that the private sector,  by definition, was superior to the public sphere at providing goods and  services.  </P> <P> The County Federation of Labor argued against contracting-out based on  practical experience, not abstract theory. Time and time again contractors have  lined their pockets at public expense while providing inferior service. In the  current case of county vehicle maintenance, the contractor, Holmes and Narver  Services Inc., has given a whole new definition to the term "corporate  arrogance." When faced with a backlog of unrepaired buses caused by their own  incompetence, they responded by asking the county to purchase newer, easier to  maintain vehicles.  </P> <P> The drive to contract-out public services has never really been based on  economic decisions. Numerous independent studies have demolished the  exaggerated claims of contractor cost savings. The decision to contract-out is  and has always been a political decision -- a right-wing loyalty to an outdated  ideology and a mean-spirited attack on the public domain.  </P> <P> We need to preserve the noble ideas of public service and community in this  country. The only virtue of this fiasco is that people will begin to realize  that the work of community preservation will not be done by the likes of Holmes  and Narver Inc. The public will come to know what those of us in organized  labor learned long ago through confrontation with hard reality. It is easy to  call forth the gods of profit to create a kinder and gentler nation. It is much  more difficult to make them do our bidding.  </P> <P> WILLIAM R.

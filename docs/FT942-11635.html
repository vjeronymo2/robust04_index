			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / ANC farm policy stresses market pricing strategies The African National Congress yesterday launched an agricultural policy paper combining market-driven pricing strategies, a competitive exchange rate to encourage exports, and a big increase in support for small farmers. 'We firmly believe market principles should determine prices,' Mr Derek Hanekom, ANC agriculture spokesman, said, explaining the farming ideas the ANC expects will form the basis of future government policy. But the paper maintains a cautious approach to the sensitive issue of land redistribution. The 60-page document says these and other policies 'will be implemented in the context of a programme of land reform and rural development designed to redistribute land to alleviate landlessness, land hunger and apartheid dispossession'. The land reform programme will involve both the 'restitution of land to the victims of forced removals since 1913 through a Land Claims Court, and a process of land redistribution to assist those with limited means denied access to land under apartheid laws.' But the paper does not depart from the principles set out in the ANC's main economic policy document, The Reconstruction and Development Programme. This calls on the government to provide 'substantial funds' for land redistribution, but within the framework of the new constitution which allows for expropriation but stipulates there shall be fair compensation. South Africa's 50,000 commercial farmers, almost all white, are the main users of the country's agricultural support services, the paper notes. About 30 per cent of them are responsible for 80 per cent of the country's farm output. Small-scale farming has been neglected or undermined, and one of the key elements of ANC agricultural policy is the creation of a more diversified farming community by supporting this sector, in part by 'modifying' agricultural credit policies and reviewing the role of the Land Bank. 'Credit subsidies and bail-out to help commercial farmers must stop,' the paper warns. 'Public-finance institutions should rapidly begin to redirect grants and lending to poor farmers in consultation with local communities.' High price incentives, input subsidies and protective import barriers cost the consumer and taxpayer about Rand 2bn (Pounds 377m) a year, the paper calculates. While world food prices remain depressed, the case for reducing levels of protection as part of a broad food policy remains strong, it adds. But the report also says 'additional food subsidies should be considered', singling out maize and bread as the most important foodstuffs. The ANC intends to 'remove most of the remaining statutory powers of agricultural control boards', it goes on. Uniform national pricing will disappear, while 'a greater emphasis will be placed on market forces, bringing domestic producer prices more in line with international markets'. For the 'more strategic commodities such as maize', a state-supported marketing agency will be required to serve the buyer of last resort through operation of a floor price system. The floor price would be pitched at a low level, only slightly above export parity. Agricultural exports incentives, 'limited to a specific time period and related to performance', will be used to increase export earnings. 'Macro-economic policy will also be important to avoid sustained currency over-valuation and promote the competitiveness of South African agriculture.'</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRUMP MOVES FROM BOARD ROOMS TO A BOARD GAME  </P> <P> Billionaire businessman Donald Trump today extended the art of the deal from  board rooms to board games by teaming with Milton Bradley Co. to announce Trump  The Game, whose object is to make the most money.  </P> <P> The game, which will retail for about $25 when it hits stores this spring, is  played with Trump money -- in denominations of no less than $10 million -- that  bears the deal-maker's likeness.  </P> <P> Trump said he would keep no profits from sales of the board game.  </P> <P> "From the Trump standpoint, all of the profits we make will go toward  charities," said Trump, standing in front of a 10-foot tall replica of a Trump  The Game box during a news conference in the pink marble atrium of Trump Tower  in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Milton Bradley executives and Trump declined to detail fee or royalty  agreements associated with the deal.  </P> <P> "I am acting as an agent for charities," said Trump, who listed organizations  for multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, AIDS and the homeless as among those  that would receive his share of profits from the game.  </P> <P> Milton Bradley, a division of Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro Inc., is promoting  the game with a 30-second TV commercial featuring Trump and believes the  product "will be the game of the '90s," said George Ditomassi, president of  Milton Bradley.  </P></p>

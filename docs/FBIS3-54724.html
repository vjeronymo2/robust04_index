The 10th session of the committee was held in Moscow  between December 16 and 29.    The Russian side, led by deputy chairman of the State  Committee for Fishing Aleksandr Rodin and the director of  Dalryba company Yuriy Moskaltsev were dissatisfied with fishing  in Japan's zone because in the outgoing year Russia failed to  catch the assigned quota. Among the causes of low efficiency  they named the small size of areas given to Russia and the  absence of steady fish resources there.    The two sides also exchanged information on the observation  of fishing rules in 1993. Russian representatives said that the  number of violations in the Russian 200 mile zone by Japanese  fishing boats remains considerable: 59 in 1992 and 77 in the  first 11 months of 1993.    The Japanese side promised to take tough measures to prevent  the violation of fishing rules.    The two sides agreed to hold the next session of the  commission in Japan in November 1994.</p>

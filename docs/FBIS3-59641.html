			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Guetierrez: "CHESF Considers Russian </F> Technology for Increasing Power by Adding Cables"]    [Text] Recife--The Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Company  (CHESF) is considering the adoption of a new transmission line  technology that will enable it to increase power without having  to replace substation equipment.    The system was developed in Russia and is being transferred  to the Eletrobras system under an agreement signed in 1992  between that Brazilian government-owned firm and the Leningrad  Polytechnic Institute. The cost of this new method is limited to  the salary of Russian Prof. Georgiy Podporkin, who has been in  Brazil since January to pass on the technical know-how concerned.    The new technology, known as High Natural Power Line (LPNE),  is available to all the firms in the Eletrobras system. So far,  only Furnas and the CHESF are thinking of introducing the new  system. In the West, only Cuba uses this technology, according  to Eng. Oswaldo Regis, Jr., of the CHESF Engineering and  Construction Department.    LPNE makes it possible to increase the power of a  transmission line (which in Brazil uses the three-phase system)  by adding more cables in asymmetrical positions to each of those  phases. The positions are determined by computer calculations.  The asymmetrical system makes it possible to double the natural  power on the line by adding a second cable for each phase or to  triple the power with a third cable. For example, the power of a  230-kilovolt (kV) line can be increased from 130 megawatts (MW)  of natural power to 260 MW (with two conductors per phase) or to  360 MW with three conductors.    Under the traditional system, which is the one currently  used  by the national electricity grid, power is also increased by  adding more cables, but in symmetrical positions. Increasing the  number of cables in symmetrical positions does not result in a  significant increase in power. On a 230-kV line, for example,  adding one more cable increases the natural power from 130 MW to  170 MW, or 30 percent, according to Regis.    "In symmetrical distribution, one conductor always has a  higher electric field than another, while in asymmetrical  distribution, the conductors have an equalized electric field,  resulting in a larger power gain," Regis explains.    He admits that the technology is simple--"a real Columbus'  egg"--and that the mathematical computations can be made with a  small computer. The CHESF's only concern in adopting the new  system on a commercial scale has to do with the possible  mechanical effects on the pylons and with the fittings for  holding the conductors.    To study those effects, the CHESF will energize a 1.6-km  experimental line in Aldeia in the Recife metropolitan area  within the next 30 days. The line is currently used for training  purposes. "We intend to test the tripling of power on a 230-kV  line," the CHESF engineer explains. The firm plans to install  the LPNE system on a section of 230-kV commercial transmission  line by 1994. That experiment will have the support of  electrical equipment firms, which are to furnish the equipment.  The cable will be supplied by the CHESF from inventory. "It is a  way of reducing the cost of the experiment," says Regis.    Besides a greater increase in power, the LPNE system  eliminates the need to invest in new equipment or substations.  "The intention is to eliminate or postpone investments in new  lines with higher voltages," Engineer Regis points out.  "Increasing the voltage level by replacing equipment carries a  higher cost." The cost of installing a 230-kV substation  currently comes to around $7 million, while a 500-kV substation  costs approximately $15 million."</p>

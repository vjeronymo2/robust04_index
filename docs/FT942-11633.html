			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Yemen coalition debates crisis Rocket, artillery and tank battles raged in several areas of Yemen early today and a spokesman from the North said loyal troops were under siege in Aden, capital of the former Marxist South Yemen, Reuter reports from Sanaa. Political sources in Sanaa, the capital, said the country's three-party coalition government was meeting last night to consider offering its resignation to pave the way for a new administration in the face of the deepening crisis. Fighting flared first yesterday in the northern town of Dhamar, 100km south of Sanaa. Unconfirmed reports said fighting had also spread to the northern oil-producing region of Marib and Yarim. South and North Yemen merged in 1990 in a 50-50 power-sharing accord between Aden's YSP and Sanaa's General Peoples Congress but the two sides had failed to merge their armies.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Howard raises prospect of compulsory ID cards Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday raised the prospect that British citizens might be forced to carry identity cards for the first time since the wartime requirement was abolished in 1952. Seeking to mollify Conservative representatives demanding tougher action against crime, Mr Howard told the party conference in Bournemouth that proposals for ID cards would be set out in a green paper in the spring. He promised 'full consultation' on a range of options, including compulsory cards and a voluntary system limited to drivers and social security claimants, which would cover three-quarters of the population. In his conference speech, Mr Howard focused on a voluntary card. But asked later whether compulsory cards would be considered, he said nothing was ruled out. He said ID cards could also be used as a bank card, driving licence, social security card and kidney donor card. 'In time carrying your ID card would seem as natural as carrying a credit card is at the moment,' he said. However, Mr Howard's efforts to explain how a voluntary system might work were interrupted by booing and heckling from rank and file Tories, demonstrating the pressures on the government to move quickly to compulsory cards. Mr Howard, whose standing within the cabinet has been undermined by rising public concern over crime, won a two minute standing ovation after telling the conference: 'I hear your message loud and clear.' Replying to widespread calls for more police and longer prison sentences, he said the fight against crime would be boosted by tougher powers for the courts to confiscate criminals' assets and fine the parents of juvenile offenders. But friends said his cautious proposals for ID cards reflected concerns that the issue could prompt a serious split in the cabinet, which is divided on practical and philosophic grounds. Mr John Major strongly supports the use of ID cards, which he believes would help cut crime. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, is also believed to favour a comprehensive system. But there is opposition from ministers on both wings of the party. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is opposed on libertarian grounds. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, thinks that compulsory cards are out of tune with the party's commitment to individual freedom but is moving towards accepting a voluntary system.

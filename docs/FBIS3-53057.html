He said that  there are certain quarters inside and outside Jordan that like  to spread rumors on the dinar's rate of exchange for various  reasons. He recalled that the 1989 devaluation should be viewed  as an isolated incident in over 40 years.    Speaking to AL-DUSTUR yesterday through the "Face the Press"  rubric, Dr. al-Nabulsi said the increase in the U.S. dollar's  exchange rate against the Jordanian dinar over the past three  months was caused by the large increase in the dollar's rate of  exchange against the other major currencies in the world. He  denied that there is a policy to gradually devalue the dinar  against the U.S. dollar. [passage omitted]    On the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement that was  signed on Friday, and its provisions on the reopening of the  banks that were closed in the occupied Palestinian cities, Dr.  al-Nabulsi said that the CBJ has asked the concerned banks to  submit new applications to the CBJ for reopening their branches  there. He emphasized that the CBJ is now waiting for the green  light from the council of ministers to start implementing this  provision of the agreement and to make the necessary  arrangements for this. He said that the Israeli side promised  to facilitate the tasks of the inspectors and controllers from  the CBJ who will be charged with supervising the branches of the  Jordanian banks there.    Dr. al-Nabulsi explained that the Jordanian-Israeli economic  agreement stipulates the opening of bank branches in two stages;  the first, for the banks that had branches there and were closed  in June 1967, and the second for the banks that will open new  branches there. At the present time, the Jordanian-Palestinian  agreement covers only those banks that had branches there  before. He added: However, all these things will be discussed  and followed up through the joint committee that the agreement  created. He said that the reopening of the previously closed  bank branches will take place gradually. He said that the first  thing to do is to discuss how many branches each bank will be  allowed to open. He said eight Jordanian banks had 31 branches  in the Palestinian cities. He said that Jordan, the  Palestinians, and Israel should approve the reopening of any  branch.    On the Kingdom's currency reserves, Dr. al-Nabulsi said that  they are constantly increasing. These reserves dropped  momentarily last year when Jordan recovered a large part of its  foreign debt. He said: We paid the price of $400 million to  purchase foreign debts worth more than $1.5 billion. [passage  omitted]</p>

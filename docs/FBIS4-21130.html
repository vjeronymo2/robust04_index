The document was signed at the Cuban Foreign  Ministry by Alberto Lestelle, Argentine programming and  coordination secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and for  the antinarcotics struggle, and Cuban Minister of Justice Carlos  Amat.    In exclusive statements to journalist Josefa Bussi, the  justice minister talked about the U.S. State Department document  that acknowledged Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against  drug traffic.    [Begin Amat recording] Well, we read the statements. We have  assessed this as something positive, because it does recognize  the effort our country has been making--and is continuing to  make, despite the existing difficulties in turning into concrete  action all these things that, actually, have to do with the  political will to fight drug trafficking, thinking not only of  our own people but also about all mankind. We think that,  indeed, this recognition could constitute the possibility of  continuing to enter deeper into [continuar profundizando] the  relations that, in an unofficial way, are being established at  certain moments with that country's authorities. And, in the  last analysis, it is indeed everyone's duty to continue working  in that direction. [end recording]    According to the specialists, Cuba's cooperation in this  struggle extends to intercepting planes and ships in its air and  maritime space, as well as in supplying information to the U.S.  services in charge of confronting that problem.</p>

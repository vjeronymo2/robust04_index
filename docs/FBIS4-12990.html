			<p>BFN     [Text] A few moments ago the residents of Qiryat Shemona  were ordered into shelters. After a barrage of katyusha rockets  on the Galilee this morning, the head of Northern Command has  put the blame on the Hizballah organization. At the same time  General Yitzhaq Mordekhay made it clear the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] would not let Hizballah escalate the situation in  southern Lebanon. According to Gen. Mordekhay, there may have  been a connection between the katyusha attack and the SLA's  [South Lebanese Army] bombardment of Sidon.</p>

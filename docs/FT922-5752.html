			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Danes wonder if it's time to get off the Eurowagon: Many voters are having second thoughts about EC unity FOR MANY Danes, Europe appears to be rolling in the wrong direction. A majority of them may be about to stop the unity bandwagon just long enough for their country to jump off. Next Tuesday Danish voters decide in a binding referendum whether to accept or reject the Maastricht treaty agreed last December. The vote represents the first direct test of public opinion on the European union treaty in any of the 12 EC member states. It poll will be followed by a referendum in Ireland on June 18, and, possibly, by one in France later in the summer. The Danes - traditional Euro-sceptics - are showing strong signs of post-Maastricht irritation. In the first three weeks of May, opinion surveys consistently showed small majorities against the treaty. A May 26 Gallup poll, however, indicated 41 per cent in favour, 39 per cent against. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, and Denmark's most enthusiastic and tireless pro-Maastricht campaigner, dismisses as irrelevant speculation of a negative vote. 'None of it matters, for there will be a Yes. The Danish people have got too much sense to say No,' he declares. Even if Mr Ellemann is right, the pro-Europe vote seems almost certain to be much smaller than on the two previous occasions when Danes were consulted about European policies. In the 1972 referendum on EC membership, 63 per cent of votes were in favour of joining the Community. In 1986, in the poll on the Single European Act, 56 per cent of voters said Yes. There are many reasons for anti-Maastricht feeling. They range from complaints about the European Commission's strictures on sales of over-curvaceous cucumbers to fears that, in a federal Europe, Denmark will be dominated by 80m Germans. Critics of Maastricht advance arguments on policies which will not be directly implemented by the treaty. These include establishing a European army and proceeding to economic and monetary union (which Denmark would join only after yet another referendum). Above all, opposition focuses on worries about loss of sovereignty and self-determination, and general antipathy to the Brussels bureaucracy. Opinion polls indicate a striking gulf between the people and the political and corporate establishment. The Folketing (parliament) voted by a comfortable 130 votes to 25 to ratify the treaty. The trade unions, all the main business organisations and almost every newspaper of any consequence are urging the electorate to vote in favour. The voters appear unimpressed. The campaign against Maastricht is headed by the two parties which voted against in the Folketing. These are the populist right-wing Progress Party, which wants to keep the Community as it is, and the left-wing, erstwhile Marxist, Socialist People's Party. The opposition Social Democratic Party and the unions are in a particular dilemma. They support Maastricht, but two thirds or more of their normal supporters are against. The Confederation of Danish Trade Unions was even forced to cancel a pro-Maastricht demonstration in Copenhagen on May 22. It feared a repeat of events on May Day, when its chairman, Mr Finn Thorgrimson, had to break off his speech because of a barrage of catcalls and rotten fruit. If Denmark votes No on June 2, what would be the effect on the rest of Europe? As a first step, on June 3 the Irish government would be expected to ask the other members to reaffirm their commitment to the treaty. Although this would require a new treaty excluding Denmark, the signals are that the other 11 members of the Community will implement European union whatever the outcome of the Danish vote. Denmark might then have to accept an associate membership agreement along the lines of the European Economic Area deal with the Efta countries, according to Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish EC commissioner. Legally as well as practically, a two-tier European union would create enormous problems. Denmark as a signatory to the Rome Treaty would be represented in some EC bodies but not others. Mr Niels Ersboll, the Danish secretary-general to the European Commission, argues that such an outcome would be unsustainable. Denmark would then, he says, be detached from the Rome Treaty institutions as well. Supporters of the treaty such as Mr Christophersen and Mr Ersboll ceaselessly deploy the argument that Denmark cannot afford to be left out on the Maastricht road. One obstacle may, however, be particularly difficult to surmount: far more women are against the treaty than in favour. Perhaps, quips Mr Ellemann-Jensen, because virtually all the people telling them to say Yes are men.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALTIC LANDS GET SOVIET WARNING;  </P> <P> PARTY LEADERS HINT AT CRACKDOWN OVER CAMPAIGNS FOR INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> The Soviet leadership, in a warning that hinted at a crackdown in the Baltic  republics, said Saturday that activists pressing for independence are leading  the region into an abyss that could endanger its survival.  </P> <P> The Central Committee declaration, read at the start of the main evening news  broadcast on Soviet television, also lashed out at local party leadership in  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, saying that some officials had fostered links  with extremists calling for a break from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> It was the clearest signal yet that the Communist Party leadership has decided  to reverse its policy of permitting creeping freedoms in the Baltics and is now  ready to set limits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy of Tolerance  </P> <P> Moscow's policy of tolerance toward the Baltic states, backed by President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, included allowing the region virtual economic  independence and responding cautiously even in the face of declarations from  the republics' parliaments that Soviet law is secondary to local law.  </P> <P> The gambit, risky from the start, was intended to dissuade Balts from seeking  to leave the union.  </P> <P> But the tactic increasingly appears to be failing. Rhetoric has become more  radical from the Baltic activists, who have called for an outright break with  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> More than 2 million people in the Baltics have signed petitions demanding  independence for their republics.  </P> <P> The party declaration would not divert Baltic activists from the drive for  independence, according to Ulo Kaevats of the Estonian People's Front.  </P> <P> The message "won't have any particular effect because it doesn't include any  concrete steps," the Associated Press quoted Kaevats as saying. "I see it as an  expression of weakness and of a policy that is not very rational."  </P> <P> Ethnic Russians living in the Baltics, complaining of discrimination, have  responded to the independence drive with strikes and counter-movements.  </P> <P> "Things have gone far. The fate of the Baltic peoples is in serious danger,"  the Central Committee said. "People should know into what abyss they are being  pushed by their nationalist leaders.  </P> <P> "The consequences could be disastrous for the people if the nationalists manage  to attain their goals," the toughly worded statement continued. "The very  viability of the Baltic nations could be called into question."  </P> <P> The declaration, which called on all Balts "to realize the full extent and  reality of the impending disaster," came just three days after up to 2 million  people joined hands in a giant human chain across the Baltics.  </P> <P> The joint demonstration was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of  a Soviet-German nonaggression pact which led to the occupation of the  then-independent Baltic states by Soviet Army troops. The republics were  subsequently annexed by the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Although Soviet police did not interfere with the demonstrators, the Central  Committee statement held out the possibility that in the future, protesters  would meet a harsher response, particularly those seeking a break with the  union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Mass Street Clashes'  </P> <P> It warned that a threat had arisen of "civil conflict and mass street clashes"  that would "involve grave consequences."  </P> <P> The statement clearly sought to isolate the nationalist leaders, saying:  "Soviet people across the country watched and read with astonishment and  bitterness about things that in no way agreed with what they knew of Latvian,  Lithuanian and Estonian national traditions and would appear insulting to the  national character of a people known for their honesty, sober-mindedness and  respect for standards of civilized human relationship."  </P> <P> It said the positions espoused by nationalist leaders have become "more and  more openly extremist and separatist" and criticized "the anti-socialist,  anti-Soviet nature of their schemes."  </P> <P> The nationalist leaders, the declaration said, attempted on the anniversary of  the Soviet-German pact to "fan emotions to a point of actual nationalist  hysteria. Slogans foisted upon thousands of people were full of animosity  toward the Soviet system, Russian people, the Communist Party of the Soviet  Union and the Soviet Army."  </P> <P> Slogans on signs posted in the capitals of the Baltic republics last week  included: "Down with Communism" and "Red Army Go Home." Nationalist groups sold  buttons showing the Nazi swastika on the Soviet flag.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Negative Tendencies'  </P> <P> The Central Committee statement also singled out Communist Party leaders in the  republics, saying they had "failed to stem the negative tendencies, to redress  the situation, to uphold principled positions. . . . Some even began to play up  to nationalist sentiments."  </P> <P> The Communist Party leadership in the Baltics, in fact, has become increasingly  independent from Moscow. In Lithuania, for example, a party commission  investigating the controversial Soviet-German pact of 1939 went further than a  Soviet Parliament commission in denouncing the pact and argued that the  situation in the Baltics should be returned to its 1939 conditions -- in other  words, independence should be restored to the republics.  </P></p>

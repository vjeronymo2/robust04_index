			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOUNCING BACK;  </P> <P> WILANDER HOPES TO SALVAGE A MISERABLE 1989 SEASON WITH A MEMORABLE U.S. OPEN  </P> <P> On a gray, breezy Monday afternoon, Mats Wilander returned to the scene of his  greatest triumph, the U.S. Open, which oddly enough doesn't seem particularly  glad to have him back.  </P> <P> Unlike last year, the sun may not have shone on Wilander this time in his  first-round match against Horst Skoff, but it didn't matter. Wilander defeated  the Austrian clay-court specialist, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1, in 1 hour 25 minutes.  </P> <P> Wilander is rated no better than an 8-1 choice to win the Open, but after what  has happened to him since the last time he played here, when he was King for a  day in Queens, those aren't bad odds.  </P> <P> He said he wouldn't really have preferred a tougher match.  </P> <P> "I think I'd rather win," Wilander said.  </P> <P> Wilander is fifth-seeded, the worst seeding for a defending champion in 13  years, since Manuel Orantes was sixth-seeded. And even though this is where  Wilander beat Ivan Lendl in a five-set final to claim the No. 1 ranking, this  is also where Wilander began sliding.  </P> <P> In the past year, Wilander has won only one tournament, a minor Nabisco Grand  Prix event in Palermo, Italy, last October.  </P> <P> Wilander is 0-for-1989, as far as winning tournaments. He made it to only one  final and lost to Andres Gomez at Boston. Losing matches cost Wilander the No.  1 ranking, which he held about four months.  </P> <P> There is not much difference between the Wilander of this Open and the last, he  said, except for one critical area: "Mentally, I don't have the same kind of  confidence because I haven't won tournaments."  </P> <P> Against Skoff, Wilander seemed to establish himself as a challenger to those  favored to take his title -- Ivan Lendl, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, John  McEnroe. Wilander won 81% of the points on his first serve and won 19 points on  21 approaches to the net.  </P> <P> "I get a little confidence when I play on that court and I think that is from  playing well last year."  </P> <P> His performances elsewhere this year are a different story. Wilander's match  record is 27-15 and he has gotten no further than the quarterfinals in the  three previous Grand Slam events. Last year, Wilander won three Grand Slams.  </P> <P> "I don't think I really struggled, I really didn't feel like playing," Wilander  said. "I just wanted to enjoy the fact that I became No. 1. Then I lost a few  matches, maybe one too many, and my confidence was down.  </P> <P> "I was No. 1 for such a short time that I really didn't feel any pressure. In a  way, I've proved my point. Right now, I would love to be No. 1, but I think I  enjoyed my three or four months more than some players enjoy it even though  they are No. 1 their whole life."  </P> <P> Wilander said playing well in the Open is the one way he can salvage an  otherwise disappointing year.  </P> <P> "Basically, if you win it, then 1989 was not such a bad year after all," he  said. "On the other hand, you can get to the final and play a great match and  lose a tough match and that would make it a pretty good year as well.  </P> <P> "I'm not obsessed at all."  </P></p>

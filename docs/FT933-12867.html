			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / National Trust moves to promote organic farming THE NATIONAL Trust, the largest private landowner in England and Wales, is to promote organic farming among its 1,200 tenant farmers. Responding to demand from some of its 2m members, the trust yesterday said it would launch an appeal in September to raise up to Pounds 250,000 for an organic farming development fund to encourage farmers to reduce their use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. The fund will assist farmers who wish to convert to organic methods and help develop markets for their produce. Mr John Young, the trust's rural affairs adviser, said: 'We're constantly looking at methods of farming that are likely to be sustainable and have less potential for damaging the environment.' He added: 'Organic farming has the potential for moving out of its rather cranky image to being a serious part of farming. If the trust can assist people to see where organic farming has a future and where it hasn't, that will be helpful.' The trust owns 580,000 acres, of which 45 per cent is tenant-farmed. Half-a-dozen of the trust's farms already use organic methods and others have expressed interest, but Mr Young conceded that conventional farmers may need convincing before they convert, given the risks and costs involved. He saw the main potential for change in hill-farming, which accounts for more than half the trust's farmland and already uses traditional methods. The organic movement accounts for only 0.1 per cent of all farmland, while organic produce has just 0.4 per cent of the food market, according to the Soil Association, its main promoter. Further help for the organic movement is expected from the government this autumn with the launch of a Pounds 1m organic aid scheme.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, our regulations at 42 CFR 421.200, Carrier functions, require that the contract between HCFA and a part B carrier specify the functions the carrier is to perform. In addition to any items specified by us unique to that carrier, the regulations require that all part B carriers perform activities relating to Medicare coverage, payment on a cost basis, payment on a charge basis, fiscal management, provider audits, utilization patterns and hearings to part B beneficiaries. In addition, the regulations require that all carriers furnish information and reports, maintain and make available records, and comply with any other terms and conditions included in their contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For both intermediaries and carriers, our regulations at 42 CFR 421.5, General provisions, state that HCFA has the authority not to renew a part A agreement or a part B Contract when it expires. Our regulations at 42 CFR 421.126, Termination of agreements, provide the Secretary with the authority to terminate fiscal intermediary agreements in certain circumstances, while the regulations at 42 CFR 421.205, Termination by the Secretary, give the Secretary similar authority to terminate carrier contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Changes to the Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, our regulations at &sect;421.100 for intermediaries and &sect;421.200 for carriers specify a list of functions that must, at a minimum, be included in all intermediary agreements and carrier contracts. These requirements far exceed those of the statute. Section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act requires only that an intermediary agreement provide for determination of the amount of payments to be made to providers and for the making of such payments. Section 1816(a) permits, but does not require, an intermediary agreement to include provisions for the intermediary to provide consultative services to providers to enable them to establish and maintain fiscal records or to otherwise qualify as providers and, for those providers to which it makes payments, to serve as a channel of communications between us and the providers, to make audits of the records of the providers, and to perform such other functions as are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that section 1816(a) mandates only that an intermediary agreement include the functions currently required by &sect;421.100 paragraph (a) (Coverage) and paragraph (b) (Fiscal management) of the regulations. We believe that the other functions (&sect;421.100 paragraphs (c) through (i)) that the regulations currently require to be included in all intermediary agreements are not required by statute and the mandatory inclusion of them in all agreements limits our ability to efficiently and effectively administer the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of section 1842 of the Act, which pertains to carrier contracts, requires that the contracts must provide for some or all of the functions listed in that paragraph, but does not specify any functions which must be included in a carrier contract. As in the case of intermediary agreements, our experience has been that mandatory inclusion of a long list of functions in all contracts restricts our ability to administer the carrier contracts with optimum efficiency and effectiveness. We believe that the requirements of the regulations for both intermediaries and carriers should be brought into conformity with the statutory requirements. Moreover, we believe that such action would substantially enhance the efficient and effective administration of the Medicare program by giving both HCFA and the contractor community more flexibility in their approaches to the performance of intermediary and carrier functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We further believe that intermediaries and carriers would benefit from the ability to enter voluntarily into regional arrangements for the performance of some functions. Intermediaries and carriers have shown interest in entering into agreements with other contractors in their regions to shift the performance of a given function to a single intermediary or carrier that is able to perform the function with the greatest efficiency or at the least cost, while another function might in turn be shifted to a second contractor. For example, one intermediary in a region might perform medical review for the entire region, while another would assume the audit function. Under the existing requirement that all intermediaries and carriers perform all functions, such arrangements are not permitted, except through subcontracts, which must be awarded through the competitive procurement process and which leave the final responsibility for the performance of the function with the original contractor. The proposed change in the regulations would provide the intermediaries and carriers with the ability to enter into arrangements to transfer formally the entire responsibility for performance of a function to other intermediaries and carriers, subject to our approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

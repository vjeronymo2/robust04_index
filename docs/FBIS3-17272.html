			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 22, BNS -- The litas reliability law  that was adopted last Thursday [17 March] caused quite a stir  on the Lithuanian hard currency market.    The law provides for pegging the Lithuanian litas to one  specific hard currency. According to the new law, which comes  into effect April 1, all lits released into circulation will be  fully backed by hard currency and gold reserves of the central  bank.    On Monday, Lithuanian commercial banks virtually stopped  selling hard currency and only some banks sold the U.S. dollar  for 4.10 lits instead of the earlier 3.93. The exchange rate of  other hard currencies went up by 0.02-0.05 litas. The official  U.S. dollar rate did not change so sharply. It edged up by  0.01 litas on Monday and by another 0.05 litas on Tuesday.    Trading became more active at the Lithuanian Interbank  Currency Exchange. The volume of trade last week ran at 1-1.5  million U.S. dollars but increased to nearly 5 million on Monday  and topped 2.5 million on Tuesday.    Julius Niedvaras, president of the Lithuanian Commercial  Banks Association, told Lithuanian TV that commercial banks are  waiting and do not quite know how to act. In Niedvaras'  opinion, if the litas rate against a chosen hard currency will  be set in Lithuania, it is possible that the exchange rate will  be around 4 lits to the U.S. dollar, but if the decision is  made in Washington, for example, the rate may set at 3.5 lits to  the dollar.</p>

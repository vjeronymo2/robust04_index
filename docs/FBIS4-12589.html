			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior military source is quoted by the ITIM news  agency as confirming that the Israeli Army is preparing for the  possibility that the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  organization will follow through on its threat to launch missile  attacks against Israeli targets. Hamas has threatened that  among the attacks it intends to carry out in advance of  Independence Day will be missile launchings against targets that  include Israeli settlements in the territories. The military  source told ITIM that there is little doubt that Hamas has the  ability to use missiles, primarily LAW antitank missiles that  are easy to carry and that are widely used by the Israeli Army.</p>

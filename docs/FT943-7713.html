			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Political donations 'might not be accepted' Donations from companies attracted by the moderate tone of the new Labour leadership might not be accepted, the party suggested yesterday. 'We don't want to see a system of big donations from individual companies to political parties,' said Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor. 'We think that in a democracy, the vast bulk of money must come from individuals.' Mr Brown's comments follow suggestions that Marks and Spencer, the retail chain, was considering donating to the party. The reports were played down by the company. Labour is believed to be working on plans to regulate political funding through laws giving shareholders more control over donations.</p>

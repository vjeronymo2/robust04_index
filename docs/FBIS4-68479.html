			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Okhotin: "Architects of Catastrophes: </F> Scenario of Russia's Involvement in the `New World Order'"]    [Text]  <H5>  Mondialism and Its Pressure </H5>   It is no secret today that the degree of interference in the  domestic political life of our country on the part of foreign  governments and extragovernmental organizations is enormous. On  the whole this phenomenon is characteristic not only of Russia  but the world, and it is being imposed by "mondialism," that is,  the aspiration of certain powerful financial and political  forces to control the world ("mondialism" comes from the French  word "monde," that is, "world"). This project is otherwise known  as the plan for "world government").    Specific organizations that are the most highly involved in  the realization of mondialist plans are primarily the Bilderberg  Club and the Trilateral Commission. It is these structures that  formerly "proposed and realized" ("imposed") perestroyka in the  USSR; it is they that via the United States, the IMF, and the  World Bank and also via the "public" institutions and  foundations that are dependent on them are attempting (and not  unsuccessfully) to control domestic policy processes in  present-day Russia.    There is no doubt that the activity of such "mondialist  structures" does not receive extensive coverage but they are not  strictly secret and they periodically reveal certain aspects of  their activity via their publications--such as TRIALOGUE, THE  FEDERALIST, AUSSENPOLITIK, THE WORLD TODAY, and so forth.    In recent years these mondialist journals have devoted the  largest number of their articles to Russia and the former Soviet  republics. This points to the immense significance the  architects of "world government" attach to events in our  country. Russian readers would be interested to learn what these  architects think of our situation since, most regrettably, with  the present government their theoretical plans become almost  instantaneously our social reality.  <H5>  Regional Triad </H5>   Mondialists see the world as being divided into three main  regions: American (with the domination of the United States),  European, and Pacific (with the domination of Japan). It is for  this reason that the main mondialist organization, the  Trilateral Commission, is called trilateral: Its principal  participants are the representatives of these three "developed,  market regions."    These regions, in the mondialists' thinking, should in the  future become the three columns of a single world state. But at  the present stage they are assigned the role of the expansive  absorption into themselves of the expanses that are  "undeveloped" or "insufficiently developed." Russia, naturally,  falls into the category of such "insufficiently developed"  states from the market viewpoint.  <H5>  Plans for Russia </H5>   The mondialist authorities have two fundamental scenarios  for  Russia in the sense of its integration in the world market (and  it is this that is the Mondialists' aim). The first plan  anticipated a change in the economic structure of the former  USSR and the transition to a market economy with the  preservation of the political control of the former Soviet  leadership and within the framework of a unified state. In this  outlook a "democratized" USSR was to have blended into the  regional European bloc. This was what Gorbachev was talking  about when uttering words about the "common European home." But  Gorbachev's fall forced the mondialists to abandon this version  of the USSR's socioeconomic integration.    The second version was the disarticulation of the USSR and,  subsequently, of the Russian Federation for the entry of the  intraregional expanses into the various "market blocs"--both  European and Pacific and even a direct "pro-American" bloc (of  the colonies or protectorate type--this model was intended for  the Baltic republics, Kazakhstan, and a number of oblasts of  Russia). Gorbachev's incapacity for realizing the first plan  forced the mondialists to concentrate on the second, which  became the main strategic line of Yeltsin's policy. But there  was a certain breakdown here also.  <H5>  Communism, Democracy, and Nationalism </H5>   The mondialist journal THE WORLD TODAY analyzed the  stymieing  of the second plan for the "mondialization" of Russia in its  January 1994 issue. From the experts' viewpoint, the main  obstacle to Russia's entry into the market is "collectivism," a  quality that is not compatible with market individualist  ideology and mentality. And this collectivism has been  manifested at three levels, what is more.    There is historically in residual but strong form in  Russians  "communist-type collectivism" (first level). When on this  instinctive collectivism the policy of "democracy" (second  level), that is, another "collectivist" political form, was  superimposed, a new type of collectivism--"nationalism" (third  level)--was manifested. This occurred, what is more, not only in  the Russian milieu but also among other peoples that were left  in an uncertain state following the disintegration of the USSR.  Consequently, new obstacles to subsequent mondialist integration  in market regions arose in this version of fragmentation of the  single political space also.    It was as a forced abandonment of democracy under such  conditions (inasmuch as it indirectly contributes to the  appearance of a new and very dangerous, anti-mondialist, form of  "collectivism"--"nationalism") that the mondialists perceived  the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet and the abrogation of the  current constitution. The authors of THE WORLD TODAY and THE  FEDERALIST make no secret of the fact that this was an  antidemocratic measure, necessary, however, for combating  "collectivism."  <H5>  Crisis of Mondialism in Russia </H5>   But even this extraordinary measure involving the shooting  up  of the parliament did not do much to improve the situation  concerning Russia's membership of the "new world order."  Nationalism has not been conquered (the results of the December  elections are a striking example of this); the communist  opposition has not surrendered; and democracy has not renounced  its political embodiment (the critical position of certain  democratic publications in respect to the liberal terrorism in  October 1994 [as published] is an example of this). It was after  December that a majority of mondialist voices began to talk  about the "return of Gorbachev," that is, about the need to  bring to power in Russia a force, obedient to the West, of a  "social democratic" persuasion with the possible reconstitution  of a "common space on the territory of the former USSR." Thus  Gorbachev himself snatched from the opposition "Eurasian"  slogans, which were also usurped by certain  Yeltsinites--Shakhray, Stankevich, and so forth.    However that may be, the mondialists today believe that the  second version of integration has failed hopelessly and that it  is necessary to return to the first version or its new  modernized form.  <H5>  Patriotic Plan </H5>   Patriots today do not have the right to ignore the plans of  the mondialists since their strength both in the foreign policy  and the domestic life of the country is immense. It is the  mondialists who initiated the changes in Russia, which the  people and the opposition resisted merely passively, constantly  several moves behind. Today the mondialists are in crisis and  they frankly acknowledge this in their semiclassified  publications. The opposition must not miss its opportunity on  this occasion. It is required not only to end the processes of  the disintegration of the motherland for its inclusion bit by  bit in a regional triad but also to prevent the "return of  Gorbachev" or a "collective Gorbachev" in the shape of  "centrists" and repainted "reformers" in the service of  mondialism.    Russia's patriots must formulate their own plan of the  country's future. But it should be remembered that the simple  isolationism that existed up to perestroyka is hardly possible  today.    The mondialists are strong and powerful. They would never  permit this. The patriotic plan should, therefore, be, in my  opinion, in a sense "international" and totally anti-mondialist  since only the mutual solidarity of all the world's  anti-mondialist forces--left, right, center, and so forth--can  alter the fatal course of contemporary geopolitical  transformations. Only the solidarity of various peoples and  states of the planet united by a common desire and a common will  to themselves determine their historical destiny and the  particular features of their internal arrangement can be the  alternative to "world government."</p>

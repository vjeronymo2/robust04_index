			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: De Beers earnings slip 5% to Dollars 460m at six-month stage De Beers, the South African company that dominates the world diamond industry, recorded a 5 per cent drop in earnings to Dollars 460m for the first six months of 1994, down from Dollars 482m a year ago. However, in rand terms earnings rose slightly to R1.61bn (Dollars 449m) from R1.54bn due to the decline in the rand/dollar exchange rate. Income before tax, at Dollars 447m, was almost identical to last year's figure of Dollars 444m, but higher taxes of Dollars 101m, up from Dollars 86m, pushed the results down. The dividend was maintained at 25.4 US cents a share. The company's balance sheet was slightly stronger. Diamond stocks fell to Dollars 4.03bn from Dollars 4.12bn reflecting an improvement in sales. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, warned that, like last year, sales for the second half will be substantially below those for the first half, although he declined to estimate what the final sales figure would be. He also noted that the Central Selling Organisation, the company's marketing arm, would be reducing its level of recent and current sights (sales to the trade). However, he added that jewellery sales were continuing at the improved levels of 1993 and the overall picture should continue to improve now that the global recession had ended. Although Japanese sales were down 11 per cent in yen terms, the drop was mainly at the cheap end of the market and had been partly offset by a 10 per cent rise in sales in the rest of east Asia. In spite of the improved outlook, Mr Ogilvie Thompson noted that there had been a deterioration in confidence in the cutting centres. This was largely because of concerns over profitability, a problem which had been exacerbated by the continued large quantities of Russian rough diamonds being sold on to the market outside the CSO. On the question of the company's negotiations with the Russian government on sales from its diamond stockpile, Mr Ogilvie Thompson said the talks were progressing on a 'sound footing'.

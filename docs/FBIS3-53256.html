In a statement to KUNA here today, Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah  said:  Our commitment to the defense-bolstering budget stems from the  public interest.    On his part, 'Abbas Munawir, chairman of the interior and  defense committee, said that the joint committee had approved  the defense-bolstering budget.    He indicated that the final decision regarding this matter  lay with the National Assembly after the finance committee  discusses the issue. Munawir revealed that the Defense Ministry  had spent around 1.6 billion dinars out of the total budget,  which amounts to 3.5 billion dinars.    Munawir said that four deputies had voted for the budget  while three voted against it, and one abstained; the overall  result was, therefore, approval.    In another development, Munawir said that the committee had  agreed to take into consideration the voluntary period served by  those who joined the army during the treacherous Iraqi  occupation and considered it as a part of the service.    He added that the committee had discussed the possibility of  promoting military personnel who are holders of a general  certificate of secondary education or higher; Munawir indicated  that the head of the military judiciary body had said that that  system had been in force for a long time.</p>

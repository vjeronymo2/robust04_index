			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Night flights threaten to stall BAe airport plan The application by British Aerospace for a commercial airport at Filton, Bristol, is being recommended for rejection unless BAe abandons proposals for night-time flying, Roland Adburgham writes. BAe's plans are due to be considered by councillors at the local planning authority, Northavon, tomorrow. The company wants to have scheduled services for up to 350,000 passengers a year from its existing airfield at Filton and up to 20 freight movements a night. But there is vociferous opposition from local residents. Northavon planning officers, after a year's consideration of BAe's application, say the councillors should tomorrow defer a decision to allow BAe to consider dropping night-time flying. They say night flights are unacceptable because of the large number of houses which would be affected by noise. The officers also want more negotiations with BAe on other restrictions and would like to consider a joint meeting with Bristol city council and Avon county council, which both want a public inquiry. BAe wants to make more use of its Filton runway to help to safeguard the future of its Filton works, where it employs 5,000 people. It said yesterday Northavon's consultants had calculated that 1,300 houses could be affected by night-time noise, whereas its own consultants put the figure at 130. The company said it believed its figures could be validated. It said Northavon's consultants had based the noise contour on Gatwick airport statistics where, because of a longer runway, aircraft could have a heavier take-off weight which increased noise.</p>

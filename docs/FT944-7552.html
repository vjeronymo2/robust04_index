			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A direct flight to the travelling public - USAir's unusual method of explaining its safety record to passengers There is probably no subject more sensitive to airlines and their passengers than safety. Usually it is the last thing airlines want to discuss in advertisements: however good their safety records, most carriers have suffered fatal crashes, and the few that have not are reluctant to boast about the achievement for fear of tempting fate. How, then, to explain the advertising campaign launched this week by USAir, the loss-making US carrier in which British Airways owns a 24.6 per cent stake? In newspapers across the US, and some overseas,the airline has addressed the subject directly, taking full-page advertisements to assure the travelling public that safety is its first consideration. The danger of such an unusual campaign is that it immediately prompts travellers to ask why it has become necessary. In USAir's case, the answer is clear: the airline has experienced a spate of five fatal air crashes over the last five years, two of them in the last six months. Already bedevilled by acute financial problems, it is now losing business because of deeper customer fears. USAir's advertisement, framed as an open letter to travellers from Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive, seeks to reassure passengers by announcing two moves. The airline says it has appointed Gen Robert Oaks, formerly commander in chief of the US Air Forces in Europe, to oversee the safety of all the airline's operations, and says a US consultancy called PRC Aviation has been commissioned to carry out an independent safety audit. 'In closing,' Schofield's letter ends, 'let me say that we will not rest until each and every member of the flying public shares in the certainty of our commitment to be the safest of airlines.' Richard Weintraub, USAir's senior director of public affairs, acknowledges that the advertising campaign is unconventional, but says the airline is not in a conventional situation. Referring to USAir's fatal accidents in July and September of this year, he says: 'There really is very little, if any, precedent for two accidents of this nature occurring in such proximity.' Arguably, the spate of accidents is coincidental. USAir points out that there is no obvious link between the five crashes that have happened since 1989. The Federal Aviation Administration, the US government body responsible for aviation policy, has had USAir under extra scrutiny since 1992 because of earlier accidents and because of the airline's financial difficulties, but says USAir continues to meet the highest standards of safety consistent with the FAA's safety regulations. In terms of raw statistics, it is true that USAir tops the league table of big US carriers for accidents per 1m flight hours over the last five years. But those figures weigh particularly heavily against USAir because most air crashes happen during take-off or landing, and USAir has more short-haul flights than any other US carrier. In terms of accidents per departure over the last five years, the airline ranks behind Continental and United. Logic aside, however, it is hardly surprising to find that USAir's business has suffered. Last month, the airline said it reckoned the crashes had cost it Dollars 40m (Pounds 24.3m) in revenues in the quarter to September, contri- buting to net losses of Dollars 180.1m. Weintraub says the airline's latest figures show that year-on-year bookings were up 12.6 per cent in the 10 months to October, but were up only 2.5 per cent in the month of October alone. Weintraub says USAir has little to lose by running the advertisements because media coverage of the accidents has left few people unaware of them. On the other hand, he says, market research and anecdotal evidence suggest that the barrage of adverse publicity has introduced doubts about safety into the minds of even its most loyal customers, and the advertisements could do some good if they counter that. 'It is extraordinarily important that we reach out and share our con- viction about what we know to be a certainty, which is that we run a safe airline,' Weintraub says.</p>

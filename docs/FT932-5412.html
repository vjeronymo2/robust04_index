			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Dialling new international numbers / Analysis of the marriage of BT and MCI BT has been dating MCI for nearly three years, so news that they are going up the aisle does not come out of the blue. Yet the link-up marks a significant departure in international telecommunications. A telling tribute came from the new partnership's arch-competitor: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US carrier. 'We're pro-competition and there's a good competitor shaping up out there,' said Mr John Foster, AT&amp;T's European communications services director. The partnership comprises two inter-related deals: the establishment of a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) joint venture company, 75 per cent owned by BT, to pioneer global services and pool technical and marketing resources; and the purchase of 20 per cent of MCI by BT for Dollars 4.3bn, slightly offset by the acquisition of BT's fledgling North American business for Dollars 125m. For BT, the joint venture marks a further stage in the privatised UK carrier's battle with AT&amp;T to become the leading supplier of international voice and data services to the world's 2,500 multinationals. The stake in MCI creates a safe - and, it hopes, profitable - haven for a fair part of BT's growing cash mountain, putting it beyond the grasp of the UK regulator and shareholders calling for larger dividends. MCI gains international clout from the alliance - much needed in its own battle with AT&amp;T. BT's Dollars 4.3bn cash injection also gives it investment opportunities. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's chief executive, refused to say what they might be, but noted the increased competition in the US local telecoms market with the expansion of cable services. How does the City view the alliance? With the last tranche of BT shares about to reach the market, telecoms analysts suggested yesterday that it was likely to strengthen the company's appeal to overseas investors, but could weaken it at home. BT is not getting its chunk of MCI cheap. In the past 18 months MCI's share price has risen from Dollars 30 to Dollars 52, and BT is offering Dollars 64. 'There is a feeling that the stake is nothing more than a massive portfolio investment,' said one City analyst. 'MCI's share performance since early 1992 is incredible. BT could be paying over the odds; on the other hand, it can't any longer be accused of lacking an international strategy.' Much depends upon the viability of BT's global strategy. Targetting the 'outsourcing' needs of multinationals is the fashion of the day, and could yield large dividends as demand for high-technology international value-added services grows. However, the number of multinationals is small and servicing them can only be one part of an international strategy. Furthermore, BT's investment record in North America is not unblemished. Last year it sold its stake in Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications manufacturer, at a loss; it has made little money out of McCaw, the US mobile phone group, which it is about to sell to AT&amp;T; and Syncordia, its US-based global outsourcing subsidiary, has still to make an impact. Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, brushed such qualms aside yesterday, pointing to MCI's proven record in capturing market share in the US. The BT alliance is a staging post in MCI's remarkable ascent. Starting life in the 1960s as Microwave Communications (filing licences to build a network of microwave towers which connected 17 US cities), in the 1980s it became David taking on the AT&amp;T Goliath. Led by the late Mr Bill McGowan, the upstart turned to the courts, using legal manoeuvres to pry away at the AT&amp;T monopoly. Its opportunity came in 1984 - coincidentally the year of BT's privatisation - when 'Ma Bell' was broken up, leaving AT&amp;T to run the long distance phone service and the seven 'Baby Bells' to handle local phone services. MCI quickly seized around 10 per cent of the long distance market. The going was tough. At the beginning of the decade, AT&amp;T regained part of its lost market share, and in 1990 MCI's shares plunged from a peak of Dollars 45 to Dollars 18.5. But MCI retaliated with a highly successful 'Friends and Family' campaign, offering 20 per cent discounts to groups of customers calling each other frequently, and regained its edge. The alliance comes a week after AT&amp;T launched Worldsource, its strongest bid yet for global telecoms leadership. Although their goals are the same, AT&amp;T and BT/MCI are adopting different approaches. The BT/MCI venture is an exclusive club: 'We are not seeking a European partner for this deal at the moment,' said Mr Vallance. By contrast, AT&amp;T is working through non-exclusive partnerships, and is anxiously seeking a European partner for its Worldsource launch on the continent next year. Many of the details of the BT/MCI joint venture - including its name - have still to be agreed. MCI will hold a 24.9 per cent stake and expects to handle the marketing of the jointly branded products in the Americas and the Caribbean. BT, the majority partner, will cover Europe and Asia. Explaining how this might work in practice, Mr Roberts said that a client like JP Morgan, the US investment bank which recently awarded MCI an Dollars 80m 'global services' contract, would in future be sold services under the joint venture umbrella. However, the account would still be handled by an MCI team, with the use of additional 'remote' accounting personnel. While BT has been courting American partners, Cable and Wireless, BT's UK competitor, has concentrated its energies on less glamorous ventures, notably on taking stakes and fulfilling franchise contracts in countries with under-developed telecoms systems. It remains to be seen which strategy yields the larger return. But there can be no doubt, as Mr Vallance put it, that the BT/MCI venture 'sets a new pattern to global telecommunications'.

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKS SAYS HE'S RECOVERED, ASKS CHARGERS TO TAKE HIM BACK  </P> <P> Looking fit and striking a penitent tone, linebacker Chip Banks appeared at his  first news conference since twice pleading guilty this year to drug-related  charges and asked that the San Diego Chargers take him back.  </P> <P> "My problems were mine," Banks said. "I took the necessary arrangements to take  of care of all my legal problems and everything else necessary for my personal  recovery. . . . I would love to be a Charger again."  </P> <P> Banks, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, has not played since 1987. He sat out  the 1988 season after failing to reach a contract agreement. At about the same  time, his troubles with the law accelerated in his off-season residence of  Atlanta.  </P> <P> Banks has twice pleaded guilty this year to marijuana and cocaine possession  charges in Atlanta. He received five years' probation in each case. He recently  completed a 90-day inpatient program at a private drug treatment center and is  now living at a recovery home in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Banks said his return hinged on the approval of owner Alex Spanos, who has said  Banks would not play for the Chargers again. Banks said that he hoped the  Chargers would trade him by Tuesday's deadline if they do not want him.  </P> <P> Banks, 30 said he first used drugs when he was at USC, where he was an  All-American in 1981.  </P> <P> He said he was not a heavy drug user, that he did not use drugs during the NFL  season and that he had never tested positive for drugs as a player. Banks said  he has not used drugs since last April.  </P></p>

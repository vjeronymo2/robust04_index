			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Three Belgian ministers quit amid bribery allegations Belgium's biggest political scandal yesterday claimed its first three ministerial victims, including the country's deputy prime minister, who resigned his post under mounting political and media pressure. Mr Guy Coeme, who also held the communications portfolio, announced his resignation minutes before attending a parliamentary committee to reject allegations of forgery and illegal acts connected with the award of a government helicopter contract in 1988. His announcement was quickly followed by the resignations of two other leading French-speaking socialists, Mr Guy Spitaels, head of the regional government of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon interior minister. Mrs Veronique Ancia, a Liege magistrate, wants to interview the trio about allegations that bribes were promised to their party in return for awarding the BFr8bn (Pounds 150m) helicopter contract to Agusta, the Italian aircraft maker. All three have denied any wrongdoing, but the affair had begun to undermine confidence in the government and take its toll on the Belgian currency and bonds. Analysts said yesterday that Mr Coeme's resignation was positive for the government in the short term. However, the national coalition of French- and Dutch-speaking Socialists and Christian Democrats will come under renewed pressure if the francophone Socialist party is weakened by further allegations. In his resignation statement, Mr Coeme said he was 'disgusted' by the way in which he had been 'hounded' by the opposition and by the media, which had 'fed on rumours, lies and slanders' and prevented him carrying out his ministerial duties. 'I'm clear-headed enough not to want the government to suffer from this,' he said, adding that his conscience was clear and his innocence would be proved. Both Mr Spitaels and Mr Mathot reaffirmed their innocence yesterday, and said they regretted that the affair had become politically charged. The opposition Flemish Liberals in particular have been calling for resignations. A special parliamentary committee last week lifted the immunity of Mr Spitaels, party leader until early 1992, and Mr Mathot. Mrs Ancia is likely to interview them next month. A separate committee yesterday began questioning Mr Coeme, who was defence minister at the time the contract was awarded. It has to decide whether to send him before Belgium's supreme court to explain his role in the affair. It was not clear yesterday how his resignation as a minister would affect the procedure. Belgium's government faces two tests of electoral support this year at the European elections in June and in municipal elections in October. Mrs Ancia's investigation centres on the Socialist stronghold of Liege in Wallonia, which stood to benefit most from the Agusta contract. Agusta itself has always denied involvement in illegal financial dealings. Speaking yesterday before the resignations were announced, Mr Michel Daerden, president of the Liege regional Socialist party, conceded that only a clear outcome to Mrs Ancia's inquiries would end the suspicions of the public about party financing. But he added that he was afraid such clarity would not be achieved before the local elections.</p>

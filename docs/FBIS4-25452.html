			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Arm the Whole Army With the Theory of Building Socialism </F> With Chinese Characteristics--Impressions of Leading Comrades  From Some Major Military Units After Studying Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"]    [Text] Editor's Note: The serious study of Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping [Selected  Works] and using the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to arm the whole Army is a strategic  task which the Central Military Commission has put forward for  the officers and men of the whole Army. In implementing this  strategic task, the key lies in leading the cadres, especially  the high-level cadres, to link up with reality and lead the way  in studying and utilizing the texts properly, so that the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics truly enters  the ideology and imbues our work. Today and tomorrow we will be  publishing articles by leading comrades from six major military  units on what they learned from participating in the Third  Theoretical Discussion Class for Senior Leading Cadres at the  Provincial and Ministry Levels. These reflect the results from  one angle and are worth reading. [end editor's note]  <H5>  "Strengthening the Consciousness of Strategy, Raising the </H5> Level of Leadership" by Song Qingwei [1345 3237 3262]    Paying close attention to questions of strategy has been a  consistent ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping. In the  Selected Works this issue is discussed in dozens of  places. Comrade Jiang Zemin has strongly stressed that  high-level leading comrades must raise their strategic  consciousness and decisionmaking level, put efforts into  studying Comrade Xiaoping's rich experience in handling party,  state, and military affairs and his excellent leadership skills,  and continually raise their capacity to guide the building of  the forces and master complex situations. This explains, in a  deep way, the basic contents, methods, and requirements for  leading cadres in strengthening their consciousness of strategy.    1. The characteristics of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic  theoretical system of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a complete, scientific, and theoretical  system and also a rigorous and meticulous strategic system. As  a theoretical system, it is contemporary Chinese Marxism. As a  strategic system, it is an overall and long-term program for our  country's reform and modernization. This strategic system has  many fresh elements. It is practical--it is based on China's  national situation, takes its own road and, through practice,  has formulated and perfected national development strategies.  This is the scientific basis on which Comrade Deng Xiaoping  planned national development strategies. It has a mass  nature--in every element it respects and relies on the people,  taking the "three benefits" as its basic standard for assessing  whether something is right or wrong. This is the source of  knowledge on which Comrade Deng Xiaoping has planned national  development strategies. It is contemporary--it is in accord  with the needs of the times and useful for grasping historical  opportunities, for implementing strategic guidance without  losing opportunities, and for accelerating the development of  the economy. This is an important characteristic and condition  for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's planning of national development  strategies. It is creative--it unifies the liberating of  thought and seeking truth from facts, studies new situations,  and resolves new problems. This fully manifests the great  boldness and courage of the national development strategies  planned by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.    2. The importance of having leading cadres strengthen their  consciousness of strategy. Having leading cadres study and  master the strategic ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and  continually strengthen their consciousness of strategy, is a way  of engaging in basic construction. This is not only very  necessary but an extremely pressing task.    First, the strategic decisions of the party central  committee  need to be implemented through the various levels of leading  cadres like us. Only by strengthening our consciousness of  strategy will we be able to always maintain a high degree of  unity with the central authorities and realize the strategic  intent of the party central committee. At present, if we are to  correctly master the overall work situation of the whole party  and the whole people, and properly handle the relationships  between reform, development, and stability, leading cadres must  have a high degree of strategic consciousness, must consciously  master the work of their own departments and own units, bring it  into line with the overall situation of party and state work,  truly subordinate themselves to this work, and safeguard the  overall situation. Over the last few years, local protectionism  and the phenomenon whereby "when the upper levels put forward a  policy, the lower levels devise a countermeasure" have appeared.  I am afraid that this is linked with some leaders lacking a  consciousness of strategy.    Second, correctly formulating development strategies and  implementing strategic guidance is a basic responsibility of  leading cadres at all levels, especially senior leading cadres.  Experience has proven that whether the consciousness of  strategy is strong or not will directly affect whether or not  policies are correct. Why is it that over the last few years,  we have seen great differences between areas which have similar  conditions and between units with similar conditions, in the  quality of work and very great differences in their speeds of  development? This also is closely linked to whether or not the  leaders have a consciousness of strategy. Only with a  farsighted strategic mind is it possible to stand high, see far,  understand complex situations, grasp the essence of things, and  make correct strategic decisions.    Strengthening the consciousness of strategy is an  important element in raising the leadership level and work  efficiency. Under the new conditions of establishing a market  economy, if one's consciousness of strategy is not strong, one  will fall into a blind situation where one only considers the  partial, not the overall, and only the immediate without  thinking about the long-term. Thereby, one might be busy all  day and yet work results will only be average.    3. In the practice of leadership work, how are we to  strengthen the consciousness of strategy? In strengthening the  consciousness of strategy, we must first rely on study and,  second, we must rely on practice. Relying on study means that  we must study and research the strategic ideas and strategic  leadership skills of Comrade Xiaoping. In relying on practice,  we must use Comrade Xiaoping's strategic ideas and strategic  leadership skills in our own leadership work and strengthen our  leadership skills through practice. Seen from the current  situation, we must pay attention to at least the following  points.    First, we must pay attention to the circumstances and take  the overall situation into regard. It is necessary to pay full  attention to the development and changes in the domestic and  international situations, frequently pondering major questions  which affect the overall situation. This is the first link in  strengthening the consciousness of strategy. The party central  committee has decided that the overall task for this year is to  "grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up,  promote development, and maintain stability." In such a  situation, paying attention to circumstances, grasping the  overall situation, and subordinating ourselves to the overall  situation is now more important than ever. As Comrade Xiaoping  pointed out: "There are some things which appear impossible  when viewed from the partial situation but which become possible  when viewed from the overall situation. Thus, we must always  consider things from the overall situation."    Second, we must look at things from the long-term and plan  strategies from the macrolevel. Strategy is about managing the  future. A leader with a strong consciousness of strategy will  certainly have a long-term development view. If we speak in  terms of the armed forces, in accordance with the requirements  for modern high-level warfare, in doing well in reform and  development of the armed forces, in fostering and training  outstanding young cadres, and so on, we must take a longer view  and proceed from the long-term interests of the state and the  armed forces.    Third, we must master important matters and manage the  overall situation well. Whether or not high-level leading  cadres have a strong consciousness of strategy is manifested in  their work. That is, it is manifested in whether or not they  can master important matters and manage the overall situation.  In their practical work, high-level cadres must manage  "strategy," "battles," and "tactics." When daily work tasks are  complex and numerous, it is easy for such minor tasks to tie one  up. This requires that we strengthen our consciousness of  strategy, give more thought to the overall situation, frequently  discuss important matters, be good at planning, and put most of  our energy into thinking about the key positions and crucial  links in the overall situation. Thereby we will be able to  master the overall situation and guard against trying to handle  big and small matters at the same time.    Fourth, grasping the opportunity and seeking development.  The ancients said: "Soldiers vie in battle, generals vie in  strategy, overall commanders vie for opportunity." Grasping the  opportunity is intended for seeking development. A  consciousness of strategy is tightly linked with the  consciousness of opportunity and the consciousness of  development. If one wants to strengthen the consciousness of  strategy and raise the level of leadership, it is necessary to  be good at grasping opportunities and seeking development. When  the orientation is set, there should be brave exploration and  forging ahead and, while studying new situations and resolving  new problems, we should do well in our work creatively.  <H5>  "Correctly Master the Relationships Between Reform, </H5> Development and Stability" by Gu Hui [0942 6540]    Reform, development and stability are key elements in the  Selected Works. Seriously studying Comrade  Xiaoping's scientific conclusions on the relationships between  reform, development, and stability has very major significance  in deeply understanding and firmly mastering the overall task of  "grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, expand opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining stability" put forward by  the party Central Committee and in doing well in the overall  construction and reform of the armed forces.    Developing the economy and throwing off poverty and  backwardness as quickly as possible are basic requirements in  consolidating and developing socialism. As Comrade Xiaoping  noted in a major speech while inspecting the south:  "Development is the only real truth" and "If we do not uphold  socialism, do not engage in reform and opening up, do not  develop the economy, and do not improve the lives of the people,  we will only reach a dead end."    Reform is a basic motive force in liberating and developing  the productive forces. Without reform, there will be no future.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping holds that developing the economy is  inseparable from reform. He clearly pointed out: "I advocate  reform. If we do not reform, we have no future. The practice  over several decades has shown that the old ways cannot be  successful." Our country's original economic structure played a  positive role in history. However, following the development of  the economy, that unitary ownership structure and ossified  planning economy structure became increasingly unsuited to the  development of the social productive forces. Where lies the way  out? Comrade Deng Xiaoping firmly pointed out: "Upholding  reform and opening up are the things which will determine  China's future." "If at present we do not continue to implement  reform, our modernization and our socialist cause will be  ruined."    Reform is not a temporary task at a certain stage  but a long-term, deep revolution. Seen from the various deep  contradictions and problems in our country's economy at present,  we recognize that the scale of fixed asset investment is too  great, the economic structure is unbalanced, the economic  performance has declined, and so on. Basically, all of these  are the result of a situation wherein the defects of the old  system have not yet been overcome and the new system has not yet  been completely formed. The only way to resolve these  contradictions and problems is to continually reform and  establish, as quickly as possible, a socialist market economy  structure. In this sense, the problem of our country's  development is essentially a question of reform and only through  reform will it be possible to further consolidate and develop  the socialist system.    Stability is for guaranteeing the smooth development of  reform, opening up, and economic construction and for the  long-term peace and stability of the country. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping especially stressed: "Of China's problems, that which  surpasses all others is the need for stability. Without a  stable environment, it will be impossible to achieve anything  and the achievements already realized will be lost." A  political situation of unity and stability is a basic guarantee  for reform, opening up, and modernization. Whenever the  political situation and social environment of stability and  unity are destroyed, there will be no way to carry out economic  construction normally and the people's lives will be subject to  serious effects. Thus, Comrade Deng Xiaoping places very great  stress on stability in the political realm and in the social  environment. He has noted: "If there is instability and there  is political chaos, it will be impossible to engage in building  socialism and then it will be impossible to even talk about  anything else." In administering the country, this is "a major  principle, which governs minor principles. While these small  principles may still be principles, we cannot operate without  this major principle."    How are we to master the relationships between reform,  development, and stability? After studying the Selected  Works I believe that we should place stress on grasping  three aspects:    1. We must uphold the ideological method of dialectical  materialism. There exists between reform, development, and  stability, a relationship of dialectical unity. Reform is the  motive force, development is the goal, and stability is the  guarantee. Reform, development, and stability are mutual  conditions for each other and they complement each other. None  of these can be done without. Without reform, we cannot talk  about development and stability. Without stability, we cannot  talk about reform and development. Thus, in mastering the  relationship between reform, development, and stability, the key  lies in mastering and utilizing the ideological method of  dialectical materialism, to guard against situations where  taking care of one things results in losing sight of others, or  where the specific is considered as representative of the whole.    2. We must establish a concept of the overall task. Social  practice has repeatedly proven that, in whatever we do, if we do  not have a concept of the overall task, and energies are  dissipated in many areas, then what needs to be done will not be  done well. If everyone works with one heart and one mind, they  will be able to work toward development, base themselves on  reform, stress stability, and do well in all aspects of work.  As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "What is needed now  is for the party, government, military, and people throughout  the country to work with one heart and subordinate themselves  to, and concern themselves with, the overall task of building  the country." Only when there is a concept of the overall task  will it be possible to achieve a high-level unity of reform,  development, and stability. For example, in respect of the  question of readjustment of interests during the reforms, it is  necessary to guide people to establish a concept of the overall  task, so that they can fully understand the relationship between  the partial situation and the overall and between immediate and  long-term interests. Only by truly establishing a concept of  the overall task will it be possible, in a stable social  environment, to truly realize the anticipated goals of reform  and promote the development of socialist modernization.    3. It is necessary to uphold the principle that the people's  interests are above all else. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always  concerned himself with the interests and aspirations of the  broad masses of people, and always taken "whether or not the  people support it," "whether or not the people endorse it,"  "whether or not the people are happy," and "whether or not the  people respond" as the points of departure and points of return  when the line, principle, and policies are being formulated.  Thus, in correctly handling the relationships between reform,  development, and stability, it is necessary to uphold the  principle of putting the people's interests above all else. In  this way, there will be no unresolvable contradictions and no  unsolvable problems.    In reform, development and stability, the armed forces  shoulder an important historical responsibility and it is  necessary to put efforts into strengthening comprehensive  construction, to guarantee a high degree of stability and  centralized unity of the armed forces. As Comrade Jiang Zemin  has pointed out: "As far as the armed forces are concerned, it  is necessary for us to bring fully into play the enthusiasm and  creativity of the officers and men of the whole Army, so that  they realize achievements in the modernization of the armed  forces and make more contributions to the prosperity, strength,  and long-term stability of the state." The armed forces are an  important component part of the state's regime. The basic task  of the armed forces is to peacefully labor in defending the  motherland and safeguarding the people. The armed forces have a  special historical responsibility in upholding reform,  participating in development, and safeguarding stability.    In this respect, we must always bear in mind Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's idea on "stability being more important than anything  else," so that we can better take on the sacred missions of  safeguarding state security and unity and defending socialist  modernization. In accordance with Chairman Jiang Zemin's  general requirements of "political standards, military mastery,  fine work style, strict discipline, and powerful guarantees," we  must strengthen the building of the armed forces in an overall  way and guarantee high-level stability and centralized unity.  <H5>  "In the New Period, We Must Put Effort Into Improving the </H5> Performance of the Military Economy" by Liu Jingsong [1491 4737  2646]    We comrades who work in the armed forces must, through  studying the Selected Works, master in an overall way  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and strive to resolve the new problems  which have arisen in armed forces construction in the new  situation. An important aspect of this is that we must actively  accord with the requirements of a socialist market economy and  put great efforts into improving the performance of the military  economy, to truly achieve "powerful guarantees."    1. The establishment of a socialist market economy structure  has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges in  military economy work. The 14th CPC National Congress, in  accordance with the ideas of Comrade Xiaoping, set down that the  target of our country's economic structural reform is to  establish a socialist market economy structure. The military  economy is an important component part of the social economy and  it will inevitably face completely new environments, questions,  and demands. Our Army's military economy operational mechanism  was initially formed under planned economy conditions and has  played an important part in the building of the armed forces.  However, some problems existed such as the supply system being  irregular, planned distribution being irrational, guarantee  methods being inflexible, and widespread losses and waste. This  restricted the improvement of military economic results. The  establishment of a market economy structure is beneficial to:  The rational deployment of military economy resources;  developing the economy and the gradual alleviation of military  fund shortages; the improvement of supply guarantee efficiency  through diverse channels; liberating and developing national  defense productive forces; and beneficial to improving the  consumption structure of the military economy.    At the same time, in the process of making the transition to  a market economy, some complex contradictions and problems may  appear. For example, the resource deployment structure which  affects some of the military economy has increased the  difficulties of gathering and supplying some military materials.  This has increased the difficulties of logistics management.  Some new contradictions have appeared in the training and  retention of skilled personnel, while some new situations and  problems have appeared in production and operations by the armed  forces.    2. In improving the performance of the military economy  under market economy conditions, we must stress grasping the  basic principles. The military economy is a special part of the  national economic system, which is used to guarantee national  security. In a situation where our country's comprehensive  national strengths are not powerful, there cannot be a very  large increase in military spending and the supply-demand  contradiction is still the main contradiction in military  economy work. Thus, we must seriously implement Chairman Jiang  Zemin's important directive on "further improving the  performance of the logistics economy" and put the stress on  improving the performance of the military economy.  Specifically, we should grasp the following principles: A. We  must subordinate ourselves to the overall task of national  economic construction. B. We must implement the new-period  military strategy policy. C. We must respect the patterns of  the socialist market economy. D. We must use scientific  management methods. E. We must bring into play the outstanding  traditions of arduous struggle and building the army through  thrift and hard work.    3. In improving military economic performance at the present  stage, we should put efforts into resolving the major problems.  The current military economic management mechanism is far from  meeting the demands of a market economy, or the demands of  improving the quality of the forces, and the phenomena of  stressing planning and looking lightly on the market, and  stressing investment and ignoring output, still exist. Thus, it  is necessary to deepen reform and explore new measures for  resolving the problems in military economy work.    A. Transforming ideological concepts. The essence of  liberating thought and seeking truth from facts runs through the  Selected Works from cover to cover. It should be  said that since the implementation of the socialist market  economy operations mechanism, we have seen great changes on the  ideological and conceptual levels. However, these changes are  far from sufficient. The key issues in transforming ideological  concepts are: Seriously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and basic  knowledge about the socialist market economy; essentially  recognizing the characteristics and patterns of a socialist  market economy and its effects on military economic work; and  seriously establishing a market concept which involves prices  fluctuating in accordance with market conditions, a concept of  performance which has value as a yardstick, a concept of  time-efficiency involving improvement of material circulation  efficiency, a concept of mutual benefit in economic exchanges, a  concept of self-strengthening through participation in market  competition, a concept of skilled personnel, and so on.    B. Reforming guarantee systems. The focuses of the  reform of the military economic guarantee structure lie in  readjusting the structure, optimizing major factors, and putting  in order relationships between the inside and the outside.  First, we need to readjust guarantee structures within the  armed forces and build a unified logistics structure in which  unified and dispersed systems are combined. Second, we must  establish joint military-civilian guarantee systems, so that  some of the livelihood services for the armed forces are  gradually taken on by society. At the same time, we must open  up to society some of the surplus military economic functions  and, under the precondition of guaranteeing the completion of  military tasks, provide some compensated services to society.    C. Improving supply and management. Management brings  results and also guarantees capacity. In improving the  management of the military economy, the most important thing at  present is to grasp the following points well: First, establish  a standardized supply system; second, improve cost management;  third, improve the collection and storage of goods and  materials; and fourth, improve production and operations  management.    D. Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control.  First, we must strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control  over decisionmaking; second, we must strengthen regulation and  control over military industry production; third, we must  readjust the interests relationships well and properly handle  the relationships between immediate and long-term interests,  between partial and overall interests, and between individual  and collective interests.    E. We must do a good job of establishing laws and  regulations. For example, we need to formulate a basic law for  our country's national defense construction and, on this basis,  formulate as quickly as possible laws and regulations which  directly relate to military economic work. These will include,  for example: A "Law Governing the Ordering of Goods by the  Military," "Military Budget Law," "Wartime Mobilization Law,"  "Military Production Law," "National Defence Science and  Technology Research Law," "Reserve Strength Construction Law,"  and so on.    F. Improving the quality of personnel. We must put efforts  into training a contingent of skilled personnel who have a high  degree of political consciousness and are well-versed in  military economic work. This is a most crucial strategic task  for doing well in military economic work under market economy  conditions. While developing the market economy, we must  educate military economic work personnel to maintain sober  minds, establish a correct view on life and correct values, and  foster fine professional ethics. We also need to strengthen  professional training for personnel engaged in military economic  work, study local reform experiences, strengthen our capacity to  accord with the market, utilize the market, and handle matters  in accordance with the patterns of the market economy.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> THE BEST OF THE '70S LIVES WITH DRAMARAMA  </P> <P> "Drum solo!" announced Dramarama singer John Easdale during the middle of a  tune titled " '70s TV" Thursday at the Palladium. This is a proper post-punk  band, so of course the instrumental break was tongue in cheek, and the  sweat-soaked kids just kept doing the monster-mosh (proving the mocking dictum  of the opening act, the Dead Milkmen, that "you'll dance to anything").  </P> <P> "Just like the '70s!" Easdale added at solo's end.  </P> <P> Funny thing is, Dramarama is just like the '70s -- mostly in the best possible  ways. Like the Replacements, these guys grew up on the sensitive pre-punk  street-rock of Mott the Hoople; an upbeat version of Ian Hunter's tender ballad  "I Wish I Was Your Mother" was a tasteful complement to their own material,  which is increasingly reflective and less anthemic.  </P> <P> But it was only the rants, and not the reveries, that worked in concert.  Easdale, a fine songwriter and capable singer, lacked confidence in his  distracted frontman role, commanding the hall only when screaming the signature  tune "Anything, Anything." Likewise, the rest of the quintet brought nothing to  the uneventful live show that isn't already there and in far better shape on  the albums. Drum solo aside, of course. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

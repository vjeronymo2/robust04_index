No meeting has been held over the past three years and  this can be attributed to the failure of this joint committee.    According to the source, the idea to set up a new apparatus  to promote U.S.-Thai economic and trade cooperation was based on  a discussion between Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and President  Bill Clinton when they were attending the APEC [Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation] meeting in Seattle in November last year.  At that time, the Thai prime minister proposed the  establishment of an apparatus to coordinate cooperation between  the Thai and U.S. private sector. President Clinton expressed  interest in the idea and promised to study the Thai prime  minister's proposal.    The source says: "Shortly after that, David Lambertson, the  U.S. ambassador to Thailand, and John Finney, chief of the  Thai-Burmese section of the U.S. State Department, had a meeting  with Sarasin Wiraphon, director general of the America and South  Pacific Department. Sarasin was informed that the United States  agreed with the Thai prime minister's proposal on the  establishment of an apparatus for cooperation between the Thai  and U.S. private sector. The United States also proposed  meetings of officials from both countries to work out the  structure of the new apparatus. Both sides also agreed to hold  a meeting in March to discuss this project."    The Foreign Ministry has two options to propose concerning  the establishment of a mechanism to promote Thai-U.S. economic  and trade cooperation. First is the establishment of the  mechanism to coordinate Thai-U.S. cooperation. Second, based on  a proposal by Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, is  the establishment of a forum for discussion with the  participation of agencies from both countries such as the  foreign ministries, commerce ministries, and the USTR [U.S.  Trade Representative]. This will ensure the forum has a power  for decision making and implementing measures.    The source says: "The Foreign Ministry is speeding up work  on the format and structure of a mechanism to promote Thai-U.S.  economic and trade cooperation based on the two guidelines.  Moreover, it also is taking into consideration the existing  apparatus under bilateral agreements, such as the Joint  Commercial Commission, American Chamber of Commerce,  Thai-American Chamber of Commerce, U.S.-Thai Leadership Council,  and even the U.S.-ASEAN Council for Business and Technology.  The ministry wants to find the most appropriate proposal to  present at a meeting with U.S. officials in March."    At the seminar on U.S.-Thai Business Workshops held in New  York in October last year, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan  proposed the establishment of a council for economic cooperation  between the Thai and U.S. Government and business sectors. No  progress, however, has been made.</p>

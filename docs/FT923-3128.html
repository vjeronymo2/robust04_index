			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Pollsters fall silent as French vote nears: Referendum on Maastricht Treaty FRANCE'S referendum on European monetary and political union next Sunday is expected to remain a cliffhanger, although the events yesterday involving realignment of European currencies are thought likely to help the Yes vote, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Public opinion polls closed last Saturday at midnight, as they must do seven days before an election under French law, showing that the Yes camp has a slim majority, but that it has lost ground over the past week. The average of the five last polls before Saturday midnight gave a narrow 52.4 per cent in favour of the treaty  - of those who have made up their minds  - down from 54.2 per cent shown by a similar average the previous week, according to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Among the final batch, an extremely detailed BVA poll for the Liberation newspaper, gave a 50-50 split between those who have made up their minds. Paradoxically it indicated at the same time that 60 per cent of the electorate supported monetary union and 62 per cent supported external security co-operation, the main points in the treaty. Some 42 per cent said they saw the referendum as a chance to vote against the government. All this confirms the impression that French voting intentions are still clouded by domestic politics. 'The Yes campaigners are failing to give people strong personal reasons for voting for the treaty and have instead warned them of catastrophe if they vote against. The electorate could be getting tired of this message. The No campaign, by contrast, has focused on the specific personal worries inciting people to vote against,' said Mr Mercier. Better news for the Yes campaign came from a Sofres poll for TF1 on Saturday, which gave 52 per cent in favour of Maastricht and said that 73 per cent of those interviewed thought that the pro-treaty camp would win. According to Ifop, for Journal du Dimanche, the Yes camp had 53 per cent, two-and-a-half points up on an Ifop poll five days previously. Even the polling organisations agree that their results cannot be taken at face value. President Francois Mitterrand will be more familiar with the vagaries of polls than most; the pollsters did not foresee his 1981 presidential victory until the last minute. The small size of pollsters' samples, usually around 1,000 people, means that there is a margin of error of several percentage points when extrapolating the result to a national referendum. To complicate the outlook further, up to 29 per cent of the electorate does not know how it will vote. For another thing, French opinion polls are notoriously volatile. The French are so intensively quizzed on political matters  - the Journal de Dimanche has a political poll nearly every week  - that there is a temptation for people being polled to use the occasion to toy with opinions rather than express real views.</p>

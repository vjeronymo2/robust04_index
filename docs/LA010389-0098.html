			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> DUKAKIS WON'T SEEK 4TH TERM IN MASS.;  </P> <P> SAYS HE WILL ANNOUNCE HIS LONG-TERM PLANS LATER THIS WEEK  </P> <P> Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced today that he will not seek election in 1990  to another term in the Massachusetts Statehouse.  </P> <P> "This will be my last term as governor of Massachusetts," he said.  </P> <P> The three-term Democrat, the unsuccessful 1988 presidential candidate, gave no  immediate indication of his long-term plans, including whether he will drop out  of politics altogether or seek the presidency again in 1992. He said he will  announce further plans later this week.  </P> <P> He said he intends to spend the next two years fulfilling his responsibilities  and wrapping up his programs.  </P> <P> Dukakis said his loss in the presidential race had little impact on his  decision. Even if he had not run for President, he probably would have decided  not to seek a fourth four-year term, he said.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Dukakis had been urged by fellow Democrats to announce his  plans so they could begin making their political plans for the governorship.  </P> <P> "One has to make a decision; I've made that decision," he said. "It seemed to  me desirable to make the decision now, rather than later," he added.  </P> <P> Asked for a hint to his future plans, Dukakis would say only: "Public policy  and public service is what I'm all about; it's what I love."  </P> <P> At age 55, Dukakis is midway through his third four-year term as governor of  Massachusetts. If he completes his current term, he will have served longer as  the state's governor than any of his predecessors.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, speculation has mounted about Dukakis and his plans, with some  saying he would seek a rematch with Bush in 1992 or would run for governor  again or would drop out of politics for some sort of academic position.  </P> <P> In a recent poll, Dukakis appeared to enjoy a commanding 67% to 27% lead in  popularity statewide over such a likely Democratic challenger as Boston Mayor  Raymond Flynn.  </P></p>

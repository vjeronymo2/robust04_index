			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Italians watch their former rulers 'executed' on TV: Prosecutors act as the avengers in this armchair revolution Televised recordings of corruption trials have become a new genre of popular entertainment in Italy. On the small screen, the prosecutors have become the surrogate executioners in an arm-chair revolution. From the comfort of home, Italians are watching the humiliation of those who until recently ruled their lives. There is no better case in point than the trial in Milan of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant. Strictly speaking the trial is to decide whether Mr Cusani is guilty of corruption and of helping to falsify the accounts of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group by concealing illicit contributions to political parties. But since it started in late November, it has broadened into an indictment of a political system that involved a cynical exchange of favours with the world of business. The burly figure of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate, has acquired new fame in the black and gold tasselled robes of the public prosecutor. Mixing humour and homey metaphors with a sharp temper, he has prodded a string of witnesses into revealing the extraordinary degree of corruption and arrogance that reigned in Italy under the old political parties. Take the case of witness Lorenzo Panzavolta, former head of Calzestruzzi, Ferruzzi's cement/construction arm, who has already admitted to giving illicit funds to all the big political parties to win contracts. Mr Panzavolta: 'Cusani brought me a document case, the type airline pilots have.' Mr Di Pietro: 'What was inside?" 'I didn't look.' Mr Di Pietro throws up his hands. 'No? How's it possible one doesn't know when there's four billion (lire (Pounds 1.6m)) inside]' 'I didn't open it.' 'I didn't ask whether you had opened the case - I asked what was inside. It wasn't as if there were chocolates]' 'There was money.' The transfers of huge sums of money are talked about with breathtaking casualness and imprecision. Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing director of Ferruzzi-Montedison who married into the Ferruzzi family, was asked how much the group had given to Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, for the 1992 general elections. 'If memory serves me, Craxi got five to seven billion. You see for Enimont (the 1990 restructuring of the chemicals industry) it was decided to give Craxi seventy billion. But as this amount was all in treasury bills, these had to be cashed. The IOR (the Vatican bank) was contacted . . . and I know the operation cost quite a lot. Mr Di Pietro: 'How much?' Mr Sama: 'In the range of eight to ten billion.' Mr Di Pietro: 'This was a bank fee? . . . Couldn't you have gone to another bank?' Mr Sama: 'I don't know. I didn't follow the operation.' Mr Di Pietro: 'Let's get this clear. In 1992 you gave Craxi more, why?' Mr Sama: 'Because in 1991 he received less than agreed (because of the IOR cashing operation).' Mr Di Pietro: 'Was this your decision or was it (the extra money) requested?' Mr Sama: 'I don't know. Cusani said it was better to make it up.' Mr Craxi, when called as a witness, denied ever receiving such money. However, the former Socialist leader admitted he knew about the illicit financing of political parties. 'The whole system was corrupt . . . . Everyone knew the parties' balance sheets presented to parliament each year were a sham.' Mr Severino Citaristi, Christian Democrat treasurer from 1986 until forced to resign earlier this year, admitted normal contributions could not possibly cover the annual L70bn needed by the Christian Democrats (L90bn in an election year). He claimed his party boss, Mr Arnaldo Forlani, knew what was going on, and on occasions put him in touch with 'contributors'. In one of the most implausible appearances in court, Mr Forlani said he knew nothing about the party's finances. Unlike the majority of those involved in the corruption scandals, Mr Cusani refused to plea bargain when arrested last year and opted for an early trial. Mr Di Pietro has gradually built up a picture of Mr Cusani being a key adviser to the Ferruzzi family as well as being intimately connected both to Mr Craxi and to the Socialist party's finances. Last week, Mr Di Pietro secured the surrender of Mr Mauro Giallombardo, a former private secretary to Mr Craxi, and an official of the Socialist International, who had been wanted on an international warrant for nearly a year. This brings the case closer to tracing the fate of the L150bn bribe paid in the Enimont affair, a large part of which was allegedly handled by Mr Cusani. Mr Giallombardo admitted he had allowed Mr Cusani to transfer more than L3bn to one of his own accounts at a Luxembourg bank but denied the money was for the Socialists. It was for an Arab called Mohammed. Mr Di Pietro: 'Mohammed . . . are you sure?' Mr Giallombardo: 'I can't remember his first name. If I'm not mistaken he was Kuwaiti or Iraqi from Baghdad: he had two or three first names, all very complicated.' Mr Giallombardo then explained, amid much laughter in court, that L20bn in transfers to his Luxembourg account were for Mohammed. The Milan magistrates have already had the co-operation of the Luxembourg authorities to inspect this and other accounts relating to Mr Giallombardo and in the name of Mr Cusani's wife. Tracing the flows will determine whether the money syphoned out of the system through bribes and illicit political contributions went to the parties and whether a large chunk stuck to the hands of middlemen or was diverted for personal enrichment.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen It is hard to read the political signals coming from the meeting of Volkswagen's supervisory board last week. Advance leaks suggested that substantial cuts in the expensive German workforce were on the way, particularly at the main Wolfsburg plant. Yet there was only a modest reduction in VW's capital investment plans and a vague commitment to job cuts worldwide. The most plausible interpretation is that the hard-headed new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, ran into opposition from the unions and Lower Saxony government, both strongly represented on the board. The company still intends to invest an average of DM9bn a year in the main vehicles business for the next five years, while in 1993 and 1994 VW's cash inflow is unlikely to exceed DM6bn. Even VW's balance sheet will look less solid after such capital spending. And while work on the new Mosel plant is being slowed, that must be set against a possible contraction in the German car market of 20 per cent this year. Nor will job cuts in cheaper manufacturing locations offset the high price of German production. While the shares bounced after the meeting, Mr Piech's leadership will eventually be judged by his ability to cut Wolfsburg's costs, freeing up the cash flow needed for the ambitious international expansion plans. His determination is not in doubt. The will of his opponents has yet to be tested.</p>

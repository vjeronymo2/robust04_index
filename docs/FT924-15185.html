			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / People: Rankin goes; Hann arrives Lilley, the struggling Glasgow-based construction company which brought forward the announcement of its interim results to mid-September because its share price had plummeted, yesterday announced that its chief executive Robert Rankin has resigned. While chairman Sir Lewis Robertson said he hoped the results would 'dispel unfounded market concern about the group's position', the share price has hardly moved since then. Yesterday it stood at 6 1/2 p. While the company looks for a new chief executive, chairman Sir Lewis is bringing in James Hann (right) as deputy chairman, 'on a part-time but executive basis'. They will jointly assume responsibility for the executive management of Lilley until a replacement is found, Sir Lewis says. Rankin, 55, left Balfour Beatty for Lilley in 1988. Sir Lewis was not prepared to comment on whether Rankin's departure derived from pressure from Glasgow investment institutions. Hann, 59, is part-time chairman of Scottish Nuclear, and between 1972-1986 was chief executive of Seaforth Maritime. Sir Lewis describes him as 'a very distinguished and well-known figure in Scottish industry who happens to have some spare capacity at the moment'. Hann had been chief executive as well as chairman of Scottish Nuclear between July 1991 and April of this year.</p>

"Two close-circuit cameras have been installed and activated  in an engineering facility at Um al-Ma'arik (Mother of All  Battles), 20 minutes from Baghdad, with two film cameras as a  back-up," said Gary Dillon, a Briton, about the site that was  part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program.    "The work was carried out without a hitch and the Iraqis  were  cooperative," said Dillon about his seven-member IAEA team that  just completed a week-long mission in Iraq.    On Feb 4, IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said experts  from his agency would remove the last batch of Iraq's irradiated  fuel and start setting up cameras at former nuclear sites.    The team was to have arranged removal of the five kilograms  (11 pounds) of fuel believed to be left in Iraq. Some 35  kilograms (77 pounds) were removed on December 5.    "The IAEA team will be back within two months to continue  their work of installing surveillance cameras at maybe two or  three more sites, where up to 20 cameras may be set up in  total," Dillon said.    Another 11 chemical weapons experts, led by Horst Reeps from  Germany, accompanied Dillon's team on Friday. It completed a  10-day mission to identify and collect equipment Iraq had used  in producing chemical weapons.    "We completed our mission of identifying, tagging and filing  250 pieces of chemical production equipment of dual use nature.  Part of these were used during the Iran-Iraq war," Reeps said.    "Our main aim was to get more information on the planned use  of this equipment in the future. Iraq has said it intends to  make use of them for the production of pesticides,  pharmaceuticals and other chemicals," he said.    He said that some of the equipment was never used, some used  on a regular basis and some would be the subject of new  discussions with the Iraqis on their planned use.    In the hope of obtaining an end to a three-year embargo,  Iraqi authorities are cooperating with efforts to dismantle  programs for making weapons of mass destruction which are banned  under UN resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war.    The embargo was imposed four days after Iraq's forces  invaded  Kuwait in August 1990.</p>

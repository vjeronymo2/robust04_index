			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Carrington sees no progress on Bosnia: London Peace Talks PEACE TALKS on Bosnia-Hercegovina made no progress in London yesterday but negotiators will attempt to resume their efforts today. Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community-sponsored talks, said last night the only significant aspect of the negotiations on the first day was that leaders of the three ethnic groups turned up. He said some constitutional settlement would have to be agreed between the Moslem, Serb and Croat communities in Bosnia before any ceasefire could have any meaning. 'The best way to get a ceasefire is to come to a constitutional agreement which will render a ceasefire possible,' he said. Yesterday there appeared little prospect that all three sides would sit at the same table. After each had a separate meeting with Lord Carrington, leaders of the three groups held separate talks with Portugal's Jose Cutileiro, an EC mediator who chaired earlier Bosnian talks in Lisbon. The Bosnian government representative urged the EC to place all heavy weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovena under international supervision as a step towards stopping the fighting. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said ceasefires were meaningless unless steps were taken to disarm the Serbs. 'How can we continue this peace conference when thousands of people are being killed or deported, and regions are being ethnically cleansed by the Serbs?' asked Mr Silajdzic. He said the Bosnian government would reject the 'cantonisation' plan drawn up by the EC last March. The plan was supported by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats, because it would eventually lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia and leave the Moslems without a homeland. Mr Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs and the Serb irregular forces, called for a ceasefire and creation of a land corridor from the Adriatic port of Split in Croatia to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, which is still under siege by Serb irregulars. Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, left for a four-day tour of the Balkans. After talks in Paris with Mr Roland Dumas, his French counterpart, he was due to visit Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo (if conditions permit), Belgrade, Skopje and Tirana. Mr Hurd is anxious to use the British presidency of the EC to boost efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Books: Dying for some comfort HOW WE DIE by Sherwin Nuland Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 280 pages Nuland clearly does not give a damn about bestseller status; surely some marketing executive tried to dissuade him from such a comfortless title? But, as he writes, in his seventh decade he knows he has little energy or time to spare for mealy-mouthed euphemism. Praise be for both title and book: a painstaking examination of the half dozen commonest avenues leading towards life's only certainty - death. A consultant surgeon with 30 years of experience in US hospitals, Nuland has written a fine book about the process of dying and the lessons he has learned from trying to prevent death. The book is suffused with a robust, humane tone, with the flavour of Thomas Love Peacock's 'we are all of us born to disappointment; it is as well to be prospective'. Neither coldly stoic nor falsely sentimental, Nuland evinces a literary mind, one equally capable of dissecting a corpse as of placing death in a larger, philosophical and literary context. He has distilled the medical essences, the esoteric Latin names and complex anatomical details into a skilled literary journey towards the Styx. Here we see Alzheimer's, cancer, Aids and all the other major killers against which we are impotent. How they work; how we suffer; how our loved ones share the agonies. Nuland has few certainties apart from the clinical, but his most significant is that the greatest futility of medical research is its hunt for an elixir which will endlessly stave off death. We must die to make room for those that follow. Given that his text is as well graced by literary as medical references, it is therefore odd that he overlooks Swift's Struldbrugs, the immortal creatures in Gulliver's Travels who were condemned to agonies of perpetual boredom, regret and lassitude. Nuland understands these. But if there are few certainties there are useful sagacities. 'The dignity that we seek in dying must be found in the dignity with which we have lived our lives . . . The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die.' When he says towards the end that he will not 'allow a specialist to decide (for him) when to let go' because 'I will not die later than I should simply for the senseless reason that a highly skilled technological physician does not understand who I am', that feels a perfectly logical conclusion to a lifetime grappling with irrationalities. How We Die is not bleak, though its subject is awful for most of us. Nuland hopes his book shows relentless death can be rendered less mysterious, and thereby far less terrifying. Of the numerous personal stories he gently, almost lovingly recalls, there is one unifying thread - apart from death itself. It is that courage to face death squarely is perhaps the greatest comfort of all. His words ought to enjoy longevity.</p>

In this way, the LDP president warned the  government and ruling coalition parties against taking one-sided  actions. The LDP president made the statement taking into  account the history of enacting a package of political reform  bills in the Diet. At the gathering, Mr. Kono also stressed: "A  shift in policy and a decision on policy hinges on whether the  LDP agrees or not." In this way, he predicted that the LDP's  cooperation will be indispensable for the Hosokawa government to  accomplish its major policy tasks.    Recalling the past battle between the ruling and opposition  parties over the political reform, Mr. Kono said: "The  Hosokawa-style political reform and the LDP-style political  reform vied with each other, but our party's political reform  triumphed."</p>

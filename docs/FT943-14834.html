			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / N-site row intensifies Miners working on Germany's first proposed disposal site for long-term nuclear waste yesterday appealed for police protection, after demonstrators blocked access roads with makeshift huts, and dug tunnels to prevent the delivery of the first containers of highly-radioactive waste. Up to 1,000 anti-nuclear protesters have blocked the roads around Gorleben, in lower Saxony, where an interim storage facility has been built near the planned long-term disposal site. Police have been instructed by the state authorities, who oppose the disposal scheme, not to intervene, but the federal government says interim storage can go ahead, pending proper investigation of the mining site.</p>

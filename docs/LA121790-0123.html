			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GATT CHIEF CALLS NEW MEETING  </P> <P> GATT Director General Arthur Dunkel has called a meeting of Uruguay Round trade  negotiators for Jan. 15, his spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The four-year round to liberalize global commerce, which was to have been  concluded earlier this month at a ministerial meeting in Brussels, was instead  suspended to allow more time for differences to be resolved.  </P> <P> But there was no indication yet that positions had moved sufficiently,  especially on the key area of farm subsidies.  </P> <P> David Woods, spokesman for the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, said the ambassador-level meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee  would attempt to get the Uruguay Round moving again.  </P> <P> The TNC is the coordinating committee and is made up of all 107 nations taking  part in the Round, which has been negotiated under the auspices of GATT.  </P> <P> The Dec. 3-7 ministerial meeting in Brussels tried but failed to wrap up the  talks.  </P></p>

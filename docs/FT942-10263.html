			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Electrolux plans global share offering in Autoliv Electrolux, the world's leading maker of household appliances, yesterday stepped up its refocusing programme by launching a global offering of 25m shares in Autoliv, Europe's leading supplier of car safety equipment. The move could raise up to SKr4.5bn (Dollars 584m) and produce a capital gain of more than SKr3bn. Mr Lennart Ribohn, Electrolux senior executive vice-president, said the sale would improve the company's opportunities to expand core activities in east Asian, South American and east European markets. Proceeds will also help fund the group's just-finalised DM730m (Dollars 439.7m) purchase of Hausgerate, AEG's household appliance unit. Autoliv has 40 per cent of the European market in car safety equipment such as seatbelts, airbags and child restraint seats. Growth has been rapid, in spite of the car industry recession, due to rising demand for airbags and increased emphasis on safety. Last year, Autoliv's sales climbed to SKr5.33bn from SKr3.53bn, and operating income rose to SKr310m from SKr211m. Progress continued in the first quarter of 1994, with sales rising 69 per cent, to SKr2.0bn, and operating income more than doubling to SKr99m from SKr45m. The book value of the company, which Electrolux bought in 1980 as part of a larger purchase, is around SKr1.3bn. The issue will have three tranches. The biggest, 8.75m shares, will be allocated to Swedish institutional and retail investors. The balance will be split equally between the US and international markets. Enskilda Corporate, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Merrill Lynch International are the joint global co-ordinators of the issue. Shares are to be sold to institutions for between SKr160 and SKr180 each, following a book-building exercise. Swedish retail investors, who are expected to buy about 5 per cent of the company, will be offered a SKr9-per-share discount. Selling Autoliv enables Electrolux to fund the Hausgerate purchase without a rights issue.</p>

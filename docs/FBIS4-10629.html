			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mara Rivera; from a "Special Edition" of "RPC </F> Television News"]    [Text] Shortly before President Endara addressed the nation  via a national network on Thursday evening, the city was  virtually paralyzed.    In view of the fact employees of the private sector received  their biweekly salaries and 13th-month bonuses today, stores  should have remained open until after 2100. This was not the  case, however. By 1900, almost every store was closed, and the  few that remained open were empty. The uncertainty of the  situation harmed local business.    [Begin recording] [Ricardo Duran] There was even talk of  street violence, strikes and so forth, and this prompted some  businesses to release their employees a little earlier and to  close. After seeing what happened this evening, however, I  believe the country will return to normal tomorrow.    [Rivera] Did this situation in any way affect the country's  economic activity?    [Duran] I would imagine so. I hope no great harm was done,  and thank God it will not be permanent. [end recording]    According to Monsignor Brown, the president's announcement  did not cause any surprise.    [Begin recording] [Brown] I believe too great an expectation  was created for what, in fact, was said.    [Rivera] Do you believe this will have an effect on  politics?    [Brown] I do not know. It is difficult to say.    [Rivera] What is your opinion of what Endara said? Was  there any substance?    [Brown] In reality, he did not say much. [end recording]    It is most likely the country will return to normalcy, and  the electoral campaign will continue as it has until now.</p>

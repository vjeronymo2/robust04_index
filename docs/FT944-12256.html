			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: VSEL joins consortium bidding for Devonport Bernard Gray, Defence Correspondent VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker being fought over by GEC and BAe, has joined the DML consortium bidding for Devonport dockyard, which is due to be privatised next year. The enlarged consortium's initial bid for Devonport was submitted to the Ministry of Defence at noon on Monday, just before bidding closed. DML currently operates Devonport on a management contract. DML confirmed that VSEL had joined the group. DML has three shareholders - Weir, the pump-maker; BICC, the cable maker and Brown and Root, the US engineering company. It is understood that the four members of the new consortium will each have a 25 per cent stake in Devonport if the bid is successful. Both GEC and BAe are thought likely to maintain VSEL's place in the consortium. The tie-up between Devonport and VSEL comes because Devonport will refit all the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines from 1997. A full refit involves replacing most of the internal parts and has much in common with their initial construction. A link between the two yards allows them to shift key personnel and manufacturing between refits and new submarine construction, depending on the workload. Devonport has an annual turnover of about Pounds 260m with operating profits of about Pounds 12m. However, bids for the yard will take into account environmental liabilities at the site and the potential costs of further reductions in the workforce. These liabilities are thought to be larger than the value of the company's potential earnings. As a result, negotiations will have to continue with the MoD to determine what liabilities come with the dockyard. The amount of money raised for the government in the sale is likely to be very small. The DML bid is thought to be the only firm offer to have been made. GEC yesterday posted its offer document to VSEL's shareholders, recommending its Pounds 14 a share cash offer with a loan note alternative. GEC has also submitted evidence to the Office of Fair Trading arguing that its bid does not present competition difficulties. The OFT would normally rule on such a submission within 21 days. If the OFT clears GEC's bid, City observers think the electronics giant could have control of VSEL before the end of November. GEC's document says that the offer is at a 22.8 per cent premium to BAe's cash offer and a 14.4 per cent premium to its share offer. VSEL's board has voted to hold an extraordinary meeting to change its articles of association to allow the GEC bid on the November 24. A similar meeting to authorise the BAe bid will be held on November 9.</p>

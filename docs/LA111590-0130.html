			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR DEFENSE CHIEF SEES VICTORY IN EVENT OF  WAR  </P> <P> Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, commander of the North American Air Defense and the  United States Space Command, said Wednesday that in the event of a war with  Iraq, U.S. air forces will dominate the skies but refused to predict how  quickly.  </P> <P> "Nothing is assured, but we've got very capable forces," Kutyna said after  addressing the Pasadena Rotary Club.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't make a call on how soon . . . but I think our forces will prevail."  </P> <P> Kutyna also said that the rapprochement with the Soviet Union does not rule out  the need for greater defense capabilities in space, in particular the so-called  Star Wars system. The Soviets continue to build strategic weapons to maintain  their world power status, he said, and "you've got to keep a deterrent."  </P> <P> Other countries still hostile to the United States, such as Libya, are also  developing missiles that can reach the United States, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: EC research programmes far from 'failed' Sir, Your editorial, 'Innovation in Europe' (October 14), reflects the confusion and short-termism which might be about to panic some governments out of future funding for EC research and development programmes. You accuse the EC of having 'squandered' money on 'failed prestige projects such as . . . the Jessi microchip scheme'; yet you stress evidence on results of the programmes is 'far from conclusive'. Large programmes such as Esprit and Jessi and, in the past, the UK's Alvey, do not 'fail'. Jessi is alive and well, as a quick call to the Jessi office in Munich, or to the Department of Trade and Industry, would confirm. It has been restructured and is now producing world-class results, helping some big European companies to enter into equal-status ventures with US and Japanese companies at the forefront of microchip technology. Or why not look at Europe's success in telecommunications and systems, rather than concentrating on computers and microchips? In any case, success or failure in these programmes is, as an FT advert might remind us, 'not black and white'. The outputs of research and development filter down over a long period of time. The Alvey programme is scoring technological successes now, five years since its conclusion, that probably could not have been predicted while the programme was running, even by the scientists involved. Esprit will certainly be able to demonstrate similar benefits, the more so because the EC has put considerable thought into nurturing the take-up of its R&amp;D, for example through the Value and Essi programmes. In 1988 there were more than 3,000 scientists and engineers working on Esprit projects. How can we calculate the potential damage, five years later, of not having fostered and trained our technology workforce in this way? Esprit has cost the EC well over Ecu2bn in funding, bringing us on a par with the US in terms of percentage expenditure on R&amp;D. How can Europe hope to be taken seriously in information technology without showing such commitment? Of course, the individual programmes must be, and are being, continuously assessed and adjusted in focus and implementation. Things could be made much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises, for example; perhaps more money should be spent on running the programmes and less on individual projects within them. But the vote-losing potential of spending large amounts of money on our technological future is probably not a very helpful or enlightening parameter in the equation.

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: More guidance for 'Babies' - Theatre New plays by young and unknown authors seldom have the success enjoyed by Jonathan Harvey's Beautiful Thing, which told the love story of two teenage boys in a south-east London apartment block. New last year at the Bush, it was taken up by the West Yorkshire Playhouse, and enjoyed a successful season this spring at the Donmar Warehouse. Most of those who saw it loved it, I think, and most of us who loved it found it unusually touching, funny, and realistic. It had its faults - too sentimental an ending - but it was the kind of play we wanted our friends to see and enjoy too. Now the Royal Court is giving Harvey's latest play Babies - which was originally developed and presented at the Royal National Theatre Studio. It, too, is funny and touching and realistic; it, too, is set in south-east London and concerns the sexual problems of teenagers and the adults in their lives; and this time the sentimentality is less marked. But Babies is a mess. Several of its scenes and characters and lines have you roaring with laughter - and yet the play falls apart while you are watching it. Some of the blame here must go not to Harvey but to his director, Polly Teale. Beautiful Thing has the merit of an exceptionally truthful and realistic staging by Hettie Macdonald; the south-east London created at the Royal Court by Teale is rather obviously choreographed and safe and audience-conscious. As you walk in, the kids are up there onstage, as if in the school playground; and though it is just darling watching them - what age are all these young performers? - nothing quite rings true. And some of the blame must go to the Royal Court and/or the National Theatre Studio. I have rarely been so aware of a play's need of editorial guidance while I was watching it as here: especially in its second half. Joe, a 24-year-old teacher, is gay and has problems with his boyfriend Woody, who has problems with drugs. He is, however, a good teacher, and goes so far as to attend 14-year-old Tammy's birthday party. Not only does Tammy's 32-year-old widowed mother Viv set her cap at him, so does Viv's gay brother Kenny. Guess which one is disappointed. All of this has plenty of potential. Then, however, Kenny starts to rape Joe; and then a drag queen arrives, dressed as the Queen, as the surprise guest for Tammy's birthday; and then Viv gets into a massive fight with a neighbour; amid which Joe goes, only to find that Woody has stayed off drugs tonight, and so the two of them are happy and lovey-dovey. The rape scene is the most distasteful here, less because it is graphic than because it is set up as mere farce frolic. But the drag queen scene is just as awkward; like the rape, it sets up far more questions than Harvey seems to realise. After these two crises, Joe's happy-again homecoming is so safe as to be gruesomely escapist. These problems tend to wipe away the memories of the really uproarious comedy that Harvey does create in some scenes. The gay line 'You were so far back in the closet you were in f***ing Narnia' deserves to be a classic. The best touch in the play occurs, albeit too late, in the final scene, when David, a 14-year-old, is bullied for having wanted to have sex with Tammy. The ironies - he didn't, and so what anyway? especially after everything else we've seen - are splendid. And, as David, Ricci Harnett gives the most touching and convincing performance in the cast. Elsewhere, however, charm and realism are marred by audience-consciousness. At the Royal Court Theatre, SW1</p>

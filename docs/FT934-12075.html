			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Personal View: The multiple benefits of a single tier Take the annual sales of Sainsbury's superstores. Add those of Tesco, Safeway and Asda. It adds up to Pounds 25bn but it is barely a third of the amount spent every year by local government. This year local councils will spend Pounds 70bn; their spending on services alone will total Pounds 43bn. Town halls are in the front line of service delivery. Local government is in more frequent contact with most citizens and most businesses than the legendary Sir Humphreys of Whitehall departments. Concern about the cost effectiveness of that spending and the efficiency of service delivery led the government to question whether the traditional two-tier structure of local government in shire England was still the best model. As a result a year ago we set up the Local Government Commission under Sir John Banham to make recommendations on the future shape of local government. But because it was accepted that the review's programme was too long (the final tranche of counties would still be in the melting pot in 1997) and that the government's own preference was not explicit, the government has since changed the Commission's guidelines. This should now mean that the Commission's work will be finished by the end of next year. Many new local authorities will come into being in 1996, and the rest the year after. The government has also come down more emphatically in favour of all-purpose unitary councils to replace the two-tier system, without ruling out some two-tier structures. Why has the Government decided to press-ahead with reform? The pitfalls of trying to satisfy the views of local councillors (who form the hard core of party activists in all political parties), MPs, local government employees (2m of them) and getting all this through Parliament are all too obvious. The situation has not been made easier by the passionate frontier wars waged locally by councils armed with specially commissioned consultants reports asserting their claim to primacy or survival. But there are three good reasons for pushing ahead with reform: To rationalise the delivery of services. It makes no sense for social services and housing to be divided between county and district authorities respectively. Nor is it obvious, for example, that county control of highways planning and district control of planning for business or residential development makes for easy decision taking. The current system is confusing. There is no single door to knock on for service delivery or redress. The number of councillors who serve on both county and district is perhaps an indicator of the present unsatisfactory divide: accountability must be better served by all-purpose councils. The role of councils has changed fundamentally in recent years. Increasingly councils are the commissioners and procurers, rather than providers, of services. Compulsory competitive tendering is already established in blue-collar services such as refuse collection and is to be introduced in professional services such as architecture and legal work. The case for a single tier of such 'enabling' councils is strong. They will be powerful customers for business. Local government functions have become more managerial and supervisory and the range of functions itself has changed. The government has turned either to more executive methods - for instance, using urban development councils to fulfil tasks such as inner city regeneration - or to direct empowerment of local people, as in education where budget decisions have been devolved to the head teacher's study. This has been a revolution, but a revolution largely between central and local government itself with little debate outside the circle of those directly involved. The reform of local government structure is a logical response to this revolution. Of course it will pose problems of its own - how to achieve a unitary authority large enough to tackle strategic issues (planning, waste disposal, transport) without surrendering local identity and accountability (the answer may be in devolving some service delivery to existing town and parish councils). But at the end of the day it should deliver streamlined local government which provides a one-stop shop for citizens, and councils with which business can do business.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hocine Tafer: "Constantine: City on Its Last </F> Legs"--first paragraph is LE SOIR D'AlGERIE introduction]    [Text] From disaster to disaster, from ruin to more ruin.  Constantine is sinking deeper and deeper into a deathlike  torpor. The year just ended has left the old city of Rocher  tragically stricken, and there is nothing to indicate there is  hope of arresting continued decline.    Constantine--The recent landslide that caused the collapse  of  several buildings on Avenue Kitouni and Rue des Maquisards was  unfortunately only one very small entry in the catalog of  disasters that has struck this city that is now on its last legs.    Housing sites at CILOC [expansion not given] are also at  serious risk, and urgent appeals from inhabitants over the last  three years have not yet succeeded in moving the authorities  concerned. The road that gives access to Bardo, near the old  slaughterhouse, has been closed to traffic ever since a previous  ground subsidence long ago, and no one seems concerned about the  situation. In an entire section of Saint-Jean, Aouinet El-Foul,  and as far out as the El Menia plain, people live under the  threat of a catastrophe that could strike at any moment, and  everyone acts as if nothing were wrong. It probably serves  little purpose to point out that the alarm was first sounded 21  years ago. One has only to refer to the small book Memoirs  of an APC [People's Communal Assembly] President by the  last real mayor of Constantine, Mohamed Tahar Arhaoui, to find  these words: "The zone extending from the base of Coudiat to the  El Menia flatlands is disturbingly unstable. The 1972 landslide  is etched deeply in the memory of the 1,200 families that were  relocated into new housing only after many patient years spent  in so-called temporary housing."    In fact, ever since 1972 the old buildings on Rue des  Maquisards, Avenue Kitouni, Rue Charboneau, etc. had been  threatened with destruction by the continual land subsidence  that has also caused increased buckling of the road between El  Djebbas and the El Menia bridge. And what has been done to  remedy the situation? Nothing, except to become further  entrenched in an obstinate "ostrich policy."    How could anyone fail to be irritated by the sententious and  almost obscene speeches made by certain incorrigible "public  servants"? December 1993: Close to 60 families lost their homes.  Some of them, living on the sidewalks, are still exposed to the  rigors of a very harsh winter. With children, wives, and  oldsters exposed to all the attendant dangers. A dreadful  situation, which some try to ignore but that cannot be hidden.  What will become of them tomorrow?    Must we wait until the sky falls on our heads again? Alas!  This is almost certainly the outcome, because local  administrative authorities seem unable to come up with even the  rudiments of a plan. True, the country's economic crisis or even  the security situation might be used to justify the authorities'  inaction. But still.... All you need do to see the plight of the  people struggling to survive is turn your head in their  direction. We tried repeatedly to meet with the president of the  communal executive delegation, who serves also as head of the  daira of Constantine, but in vain. A large number of questions  thus remain unanswered.    How can the authorities' abdication of responsibility in the  face of a city's death agonies be explained? How do they react  to the sight of goats serenely grazing on...Ben Boulaid avenue?  Why do more and more huge holes appear with every passing day in  all the side streets of the city, and even in the principal  arteries? Go take a look at your Constantine, from El Kantar to  Bellevue, from Sidi Mabrouk to Bardo, from the Filali settlement  to CILOC and even downtown. Not one single street has been  spared. Day after day workers slave away, armed with scaling  hammers or simple pickaxes, cutting gashes into the city.    When evening comes, they put their tools down and leave. But  they do not come back. Not even the outlying districts, the  "express" suburbs, have been spared.    For more than a month, two strapping young workers have kept  the main highway virtually impassable. Add to that the  innumerable piles of refuse springing up almost everywhere.  Frankly the picture is grim. And all this is happening under the  noses of the impassive, silent authorities. Their attitude not  only greatly tarnishes the institutional credibility of  government but also encourages all sorts of abuses--and reminds  one of the stereotypical...banana republic.    So are we not justified in asking ourselves, in the last  analysis, whether all this could be part of a calculated plan?  Isn't it just one more effort to sap what little strength the  country still has? The idea is perhaps too fantastic, but so is  the quality of everyday life in a city that has become an  immense "gypsy" campground, where all sorts of crimes go  unpunished, where simple good citizenship is trampled underfoot.  As a matter of fact, isn't it the only city where the head of  the daira is also the president of the DEC [expansion not  given]? Who controls whom? Isn't it the only city in the world  where so-called intelligent humans designed a highway but  created no access roads? Isn't it the only city where paintings  of inestimable value were confiscated to gratify the whims of a  high-level official?    Examples of this sort of behavior are almost endless. But  what good would it do to compile a list? They have well and  truly decided to ruin this country, and nothing seems able to  shake them from their purpose. [sentence as published]</p>

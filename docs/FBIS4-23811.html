			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The HNP's [Reformed National Party] special  congress rewrote parts of its program of principles to expand on  previous ideas so that they fit into the current political  climate. However, not a single principle has been compromised or  watered down. The amendments were accepted unanimously.  [passage omitted]    Article 3, which deals with the party's objectives, says: As  a political national front of Afrikanerdom, the party encourages  the Afrikaner nation to uphold and adhere to -- in politics and  in other spheres of the nation's existence -- the following  principles in the Republic of South Africa.    On national identity, the right-wing again reaffirms its  view: "Since it pleased God to create different peoples and  nations:     -  The national identity of the Afrikaner nation and that of  the other nations in South Africa must be preserved;    -  The Afrikaner nation must be bound to its culture;    -  The general development of the nation's life must be along  Christian-national norms, and    -  The anti-Christian and antinational pursuit of cultural  uniformity, ethnic mixing, and the preparation of a world state  must at all times be opposed, so that the Creator will be  glorified by a variety of national cultures.        The article on population politics has been rewritten as  follows:     -  The HNP's foundation is nationalism. It is based on  preference for what is your own, a universal right of persons  and groups.    -  Society in South Africa is not one single community, but a  diversity of communities which differ in race, culture,  language, and religion. To try to integrate these communities  into a single nation by means of a general franchise under a  central authority is unacceptable in the light of the right to  continued existence and self-determination of the different  communities.        As condition for the upholding of a peaceful order of  organic  homogeneousness, and the success of a policy of peaceful  neighborliness, opposition to mixing and to the elimination of  national boundaries must be maintained through the upholding of  separate identities.    History -- including that of Africa since the 1960's -- is  full of failed attempts to accommodate divergent groups in one  parliamentary democracy. History has confirmed that a  parliamentary democracy has limited tolerance for racial and  religious differences. So, too, does the history of the Soviet  Union and the countries of Central Europe in the 90's indicate  that cultural, religious, and historical differences are  destructive in democratically integrated states.    Afrikaners and English speakers: Since the Afrikaner not  only makes up the oldest part of the white population, but is  also the only white nation born in this country, and since the  Afrikaner, due to his homogeneousness is not able to receive any  direct reinforcements from outside, the authorities must see to  it that the Afrikaans language, culture, and way of life are  upheld and promoted at all times, so that the national and  cultural identity of Afrikanerdom is preserved untarnished -- an  Afrikanerdom which also includes those English speakers and  other language groups who identify with the historical roots and  the history of the Afrikaner people.    Language: The party recognizes Afrikaans as an indigenous  language of Africa, as the name indicates, but also a cultural  language that distinguishes itself from other indigenous  languages. It is the language in which the struggle for freedom  against British domination was conducted, and in which great  political and economic development took place. It is also the  language that has stamped not only thousands of farms and  numerous towns and cities in the country, but also the fishes  and rivers, trees and mountains, birds and other animals of the  country. This gives the Afrikaans language an inalienable,  unique right in the country over other languages that are not  indigenous.    The party concedes that English is an international  language,  and also that it is the language of a considerable section of  South Africa's population, and is therefore regarded as a useful  communication medium.    The congress used words such as "race" where applicable in  its program of principles.    Agriculture was specifically singled out for a lot of  attention. The existence and welfare of the rural population has  to be seen as very important. The preservation and the increase  of independent and self-sufficient land owners must be promoted.  The stifling of the individual farmer by any person or interest  group who is in a position of power and influence by being in  control of big capital, must be fought.    The HNP's policy on the protection of white land ownership  and of the farmer's full control over marketing his own  products, as opposed to the capitalist interests which control  the "middleman," are also contained in the program. The HNP  also says there has to be a policy which positively encourages  the birthrate among whites. White births have in the past been  discouraged by the state.    Significant, too, is the policy to give spiritual and  physical aid to the needy. Where such help cannot be provided,  the state should intervene. The church must also play a big  role in community affairs, as the HNP acknowledges the state's  Christian commitments.</p>

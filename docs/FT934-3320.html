			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Delors and Major head for clash on EU growth Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, was heading last night for a bitter clash with Mr John Major, the prime minister, on the eve of this week's European summit which is billed as the launching pad for a drive towards higher growth and employment in Europe. A senior Downing Street aide accused Mr Delors of a 'cynical and transparent ploy' in delaying completion of his white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment until just before tomorrow's summit in Brussels. Other Whitehall officials described the bulk of the report as 'irrelevant' and attacked plans for substantial EU spending on roads, rail and telecommunications, to be funded partly through the floating of new 'Brussels bonds'. In a pained response last night, European Commission officials said the UK government had overlooked the white paper's shift in favour of labour market deregulation as a means of tackling mass unemployment in Europe, expected to rise to nearly 20m next year. At a news conference yesterday, Mr Delors called for lower employment costs, a scaling-back of minimum wage legislation for unskilled workers and a slowdown in Brussels-led social policy legislation. 'We have to see if the time is right to adopt a minimal rights approach again. If you set the minimum too low, we come to social dumping; but if you set it too high you price people out of work,' he said. Mr Delors said the need to restore competitiveness and growth was a top priority for creating new jobs. He ruled out fiscal incentives to promote worksharing, while not excluding them as a temporary measure among individual companies. Mr Delors's remarks appeared aimed at blunting criticism from deregulation-minded countries such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. The white paper is expected to be the centrepiece of the two-day European summit, but Mr Delors, more ebullient than usual, made clear that he intends to reopen other contentious issues about the pace of European integration. In remarks likely to alarm both the British and the Germans, he called for a stronger role for the European Monetary Institute in the co-ordination of monetary policies and the management of the exchange rate mechanism. Stage one of Emu - aimed at greater convergence among member states' economies - had been a 'failure', he said. Although British criticism of the white paper has largely been discounted in Brussels, Mr Delors' aides are concerned that other countries - notably Germany - may join the UK in opposing spending of up to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.2bn) a year on transnational networks in transport, telecoms, energy and the environment, most of which is already in the EU budget.

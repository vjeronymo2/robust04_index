			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / End of the road for the man from the Pru: Direct debits to replace cash on the doorstep The 'man from the Pru', foot-slogging the pavements of Britain's industrial heartlands collecting monthly cash payments, has yet to hang up his hat for good. But he will not be taking new business from next year. Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, closed a chapter in commercial history yesterday by announcing that from January 1 it will stop selling the cash collection life insurance and savings products with which it is almost synonymous. Mr Jim Sutcliffe, director of the group's home service division, said existing holders of such 'industrial branch' policies - so called because they were designed for the expanding industrial classes of the nineteenth century - would still get their monthly visits. But for others, direct-debit bank mandate and annual or half-yearly financial health checks will replace the smart chap from the Pru, who was always polite and unlike slicker financial advisers from the City. 'It is an emotional moment when you close the book,' said Mr Sutcliffe. The Prudential said its decision not only made commercial sense - in the first half of 1994 industrial branch business accounted for less than 2 per cent of the Pru's total UK sales - but was good for its clients. Collecting in person amounts that averaged just Pounds 8 every four weeks was expensive, eating into the return that investors eventually receive. More than 90 per cent of its cash collection customers have a bank account, the Prudential estimates. Research suggests that contact every six months is sufficient to maintain customer satisfaction. The Prudential said there would be no redundancies among its 8,000-strong sales and collection force, which will concentrate on selling other financial products. Under 1920s' legislation, agents selling industrial branch policies must visit at least every two months and initial in a premium book the amount paid - though these rules are under review by the government. From next year life insurance companies will have to give more information on costs and charges, a move expected to make customers more price sensitive. But other companies offering cash collection argued yesterday that industrial branch business still made economic sense. Mr Martin Fox, marketing manager of Pearl Assurance, said his company believed in 'regular contact, regularly looking after people and we are opposed to the idea of selling people something and then walking away from them'. Liverpool Victoria friendly society, which last year received 58 per cent of its premium income from industrial branch business, said it was 'committed to providing the type of business the ordinary working men and women want'.

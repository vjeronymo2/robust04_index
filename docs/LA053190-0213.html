			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW A FIRM LOST MONEY BY LOSING ITS FOCUS;  </P> <P> DIVERSIFICATION: GI INDUSTRIES WAS PROFITABLE IN TRASH HAULING BUT DECIDED TO  EXPAND INTO CAR RENTALS AND TRUCK DEALERSHIPS. AFTER LOSING MILLIONS, GI AGAIN  IS CONCENTRATING ON RUBBISH.  </P> <P> For years GI Industries, the major hauler of residential trash in Simi Valley,  Moorpark and Thousand Oaks, has been the rubbish king of eastern Ventura  County. But in 1987 GI decided its empire wasn't big enough.  </P> <P> GI, then controlled by the wealthy Asadurian family, began buying other  businesses. Having already diversified into leasing garbage trucks and related  equipment to other rubbish haulers, the company also bought Thrifty car-rental  franchises and three Mack truck dealerships.  </P> <P> GI had revenue of $10 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, 1988. The  deals to acquire Mack truck and Thrifty were to quadruple the company's size.  "The numbers were right," GI Chairman Manuel Asadurian Sr. recalled. "It would  make our stock go up."  </P> <P> But the company's optimism turned out to be, well, rubbish. The diversification  move was a flop, as GI's new subsidiaries hemorrhaged cash and sent the whole  company into the red. GI, with nearly 50,000 residential and commercial rubbish  customers, lost $1 million in fiscal 1988 and lost another $7.2 million in  fiscal 1989.  </P> <P> For a while, the mess delayed GI's completion of audited financial statements.  Without those statements, banks were reluctant to lend GI much-needed cash, and  at the end of fiscal 1989, GI's debts exceeded its assets by $2.6 million.  </P> <P> At one point the four main members of the Asadurian family -- Manuel Asadurian  Sr., 58; his brother Sam, 63; and their sons Manuel Jr., 33, and Carl, 38,  respectively -- each had to lend the company $1 million so it could keep  operating.  </P> <P> By early 1989, "we knew we needed to make some drastic moves," said Daniel M.  Van Rossen, GI's executive vice president and chief financial officer.  </P> <P> At first, GI considered selling out to Western Waste Industries, a  Gardena-based trash hauler, for an undisclosed sum. But talks between the  companies fell apart last fall.  </P> <P> So GI decided to pull back to the business that Sam and Manny Asadurian first  pursued 40 years ago -- hauling garbage. "It's just like starting all over  again," Manny Sr. said.  </P> <P> The company jettisoned its Thrifty car-leasing unit and Universal Mack Sales  &amp; Service, the subsidiary that ran the Mack truck dealerships. The two  businesses generated $27.5 million in revenue in fiscal 1989, but because of  accounting rules those sales were not included in GI's results for that year,  when reported total revenue was $11.8 million.  </P> <P> GI slashed its corporate staff to three positions from 14, and its overall work  force dropped to 80 from 212 because of employees who left when the businesses  were sold. The company also sold 40% of equipment lease payments due the  company, and some real estate. And it moved its headquarters from a leased  office to a building the company already owned. All told, the actions enabled  GI to cut its debt to about $20 million from $50 million a year ago.  </P> <P> Finally, a change in GI's top management left fewer Asadurians at the top,  although the family's influence remains strong.  </P> <P> Sam resigned as chief executive and chief financial officer, and in late 1989  he purchased Universal Mack from the company. Manny Jr. quit as president, and  his father added the posts of president and chief executive to his  chairmanship. Van Rossen became chief financial officer. Carl remains head of  GI's Conejo Enterprises rubbish-hauling division, and Michael Smith remains a  senior vice president.  </P> <P> GI officials said Sam's decision to leave was his own. It would be unfair to  say "there was pressure on Sam to step aside," Van Rossen said. "Sam left the  company to take care of a number of things, not to mention possibly being  semi-retired."  </P> <P> Sam Asadurian did not return phone calls requesting comment.  </P> <P> The Asadurians, who took GI public in 1987, also no longer control the  company's board of directors or its stock. The five-member board now has Manny  Sr., Carl and three non-Asadurians. The family's stock ownership fell to 44% of  the total from 52% in late 1989 when GI issued 500,000 new shares to Mack  Trucks Inc., the builder of Mack trucks, to help complete GI's sale of  Universal Mack to Sam Asadurian.  </P> <P> What stock the family still owns also has dropped sharply in value, to a recent  over-the-counter price of about $2-$2.50 a share from $7.50 a share in early  1988, giving the Asadurians' combined stake a current value of about $4 million  to $5 million.  </P> <P> Van Rossen said "frustration is an understatement" to describe the mood at GI's  headquarters in recent months. "I'm not an Asadurian," he said, "but I felt  personally as bad as they did when these problems surfaced."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kenneth C. Brill: "All's Well Between India and </F> U.S."]    [Text] Pick up a newspaper these days and it is hard to  avoid the impression that Indo-U.S. relations are at a low ebb.  In this age of instant communications, even minor events can be  blown out of proportion overnight, over-interpreted and  attributed far greater importance than they can possibly  deserve. But despite some of the recent headlines and  commentary, Indo-U.S. relations are on a sounder and more  substantial footing than they have been in decades. I believe  this reflects the new importance each country attaches to the  relationship.    The relations are broad and complex, running the gamut from  education, technology and trade to help to build a post-cold war  world that reflects our shared democratic values. Most of the  work in the context goes on quietly, away from the media  spotlight, carried out by men and women in government, the  private sector, voluntary and professional organisations and  educational institutions. Their daily activities weave the  fabric of the relationship and, in the process, linkages are  developed, common interests identified and problems (new and  old) are tackled.  <H5>  Bilateral Agenda </H5>   India and the United States have a more complicated and  ambitious bilateral agenda than ever before, a result of the  opportunity the changes in the post-cold war world provide for  our countries to expand and strengthen relations. This agenda  demands two things of us: the vision to recognise and build upon  those areas where our economic and political interests converge,  and the willingness to engage in the hard work of reducing the  differences in those areas where we disagree. From economic  reform to environmental protection, from non-proliferation to  peace-keeping, the United States and India have identified  areas of constructive engagement and have begun substantive  dialogue at a variety of official and unofficial levels.    To what, then, can one attribute the gap between the reality  of our relationship and the public perception? To a great  extent, I attribute it to the turbulent times in which we live.  Political change is occurring at a dizzying pace, and it is  forcing every nation--including, let me stress, the United  States--to reconsider long-held assumptions and re-examine old  relationships.    Always difficult, this process is further complicated when  it  involves the world's two largest democracies, with a shared  tradition of vigorous, unfettered public debate. Both our  political systems accommodate a wide range of views. Opposition  politicians criticise government policies freely; advocacy  groups, lobbyists and private voluntary organisations all work  strenuously to gain public support for their positions. These  are healthy manifestations of our democratic systems.  <H5>  Justifiably Proud </H5>   More often than not, this debate takes place in our media.  Both the United States and India are justifiably proud of a free  press, which serves a vital role informing public debate. But  the nature of the business is that conflict makes news. As a  result, most of us are more familiar with the well-publicised  differences--real or imagined--between our two nations than the  positive developments taking place away from the media spotlight.    Let me cite a few examples of positive developments in the  relationship: The United States is actively and materially  supporting India's economic-reform programme. Ours is the  largest market for India's exports: we buy 20 per cent of what  India sells abroad. We also are the largest foreign investor in  India. Last year, new U.S. investment represented over 42 per  cent of the more than $2 billion total approved by the  government of India. Every dollar of this investment is a vote  of confidence in India's future.    The Unites States is India's largest technology partner.  Thirty-six years ago, Indian and American scientists began  working together in areas such as medicine, agriculture and the  environment. Today, this programme is the largest of its kind in  the world, and has created a substantial body of scholarship and  a tradition of collaborative effort that many nations strive to  emulate. In addition, through licensing and joint-venture  arrangements, the United States is the largest source of foreign  commercial technology for Indian industry.    Indo-U.S. military co-operation has grown in recent years.  Our armed forces have worked together on U.N. peace-keeping  missions in Cambodia and Somalia. In addition, our military ties  have expanded to include joint steering groups, joint exercises,  training programmes and staff exchanges.    Our law-enforcement agencies work closely combating the  threat posed by international terrorism and narcotics  trafficking. At present, we are in the process of negotiating a  new Indo-U.S. extradition treaty that will enhance the judicial  process in both countries, enabling us to better confront these  threats to global security.  <H5>  Better Measure </H5>   Even in areas where we differ, we have been able to expand  our shared agenda. Despite differences on the nuclear  non-proliferation treaty, for example, we agree on other aspects  of non-proliferation--the comprehensive test-ban treaty, and the  fissile fuel cut-off. In addition, our two governments worked  closely in the final stages of the chemical weapons convention.    These developments are a better measure of the quality of  Indo-U.S. relations today and their promising future than the  headlines trumpeting our differences. Differences are inevitable  when nations engage each other seriously on complex issues.  Rather than be dismayed, we should be encouraged by the  evolution taking place from the carefully-circumscribed dialogue  of the past to the constructive engagement that characterises  our relationship at present.    No doubt, our open political systems will generate a certain  amount of surface turbulence between us. The challenge our two  countries face is to remain focused on what is important: the  steady advance towards more mature, productive and collaborative  relations. Both sides have made a good start in this direction,  and I can affirm the United States Government looks forward to  continuing to work in this spirit with the government and people  of India now and in the years ahead.</p>

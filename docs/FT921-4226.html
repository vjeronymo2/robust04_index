			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bulgaria in push to attract US investment BULGARIA'S prime minister, Mr Philip Dimitrov, today ends a 10-day campaign across the US to win American investment, Barbara Durr reports from Chicago. Bulgaria offers the advantage of an export platform to the republics of the former Soviet Union, he told business leaders at a meeting organised by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. 'Nowhere is there better knowledge and experience of their markets.' A liberal foreign investment law had been passed allowing repatriation of profits, and a privatisation law was being considered by the parliament. Telecommunications heads Mr Dimitrov's list of investment priorities. Bulgaria offered a special advantage for this industry, he added. Under the now-defunct Comecon, Bulgaria had been designated by Moscow as the country specialising in computer production and it has many electronics experts and computer programmers. Tourism and agribusiness investments are next on Bulgaria's list. The Bulgarian-American Enterprise Fund, based in Chicago, has been authorised to make available Dollars 55m (Pounds 31.2m) over three years.</p>

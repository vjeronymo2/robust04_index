The statement,  signed by DSU chairman Roman Koval, says, in particular:    "The results of the Crimean presidential elections were to  be  expected: The elected president, Yuriy Meshkov, is a resolute  and uncompromising advocate of Crimea's reunification with  Russia. His victory became possible not only through the  support of Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy, the Russian fifth column in  Crimea, but also because of the weak and indecisive policy of  official Kiev. The policy of balancing acts, compromises, and  wiles, stems not from the president's stately wisdom, but from  his personal human weakness and lack of patriotism. Kravchuk  neglected his main duty: The creation of a Ukrainian force that  could be relied on to solve important problems.    Responsibility for the developments in Crimea also rests  with  Ukrainian democrats, primarily with the pro-president parties  and congresses whose support enabled Kravchuk to pursue his  defeatist policy. The Ukrainian leadership is powerless and  inefficient. It is incapable of fighting for Ukrainian  interests, being accustomed to submitting to foreign will and  carrying out decisions taken in Moscow.    We call on all political forces to demand Kravchuk's  resignation. The Supreme Council must impeach the president even  before the March elections.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Marks and Spencer to cut 850 jobs MARKS and Spencer, the international retailing group, is to shed 850 jobs in the next few days in the face of the most severe retailing conditions in a decade. The decision follows a six-month review of the company's head office functions under the direction of Mr David Sieff, director for corporate affairs, and a separate reappraisal of its store management requirements. In total, M and S employs 62,000 staff in the UK and the company said no further job cuts were planned. Mr Sieff said the job cuts would 'create a more efficient and effective head office that does not burden the business with excessive costs' and would simplify decision making and provide greater job satisfaction for the staff. The job cuts fall into two areas. About 300 of the company's 4,750 head office staff are to be made compulsorily redundant and an additional 250 posts are also to be phased out by means of staff turnover, early retirement and voluntary redundancy. But 300 of the company's 1,100 junior managers will also be made redundant as a result of a low turnover of staff. The company explained: 'When you set targets for recruitment you assume a certain percentage will leave at some time during their training period. What has happened over the last 18 months is that staff turnover has dropped dramatically. We have far more people at this level than we expected.' The company said it would be making generous redundancy payments, based on length of service and seniority, which would be well above statutorily entitlements. The Baker Street head-quarters in London was gripped by gloom and confusion after M and S management decided they wanted to speak individually to all 300 employees who were being made compulsorily redundant. One employee said: 'They've got themselves confused as to whether they are a big company or a small company. They didn't want to do a mass mailing, so people are sitting around waiting to see if they will be getting the chop.' The redundancy programme will cost Pounds 16m, which will be treated as an exceptional cost when the company reports its annual results on May 14. Analysts expect the company to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 620m (before exceptional items), slightly ahead of last year's outcome of Pounds 604.2m. Harsh diet for M and S, Page 23</p>

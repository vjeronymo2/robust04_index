"About 200,000 tons of rice will be further imported this  month, and the supply is being steadily boosted," Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Minister Hata told a meeting of cabinet  ministers. He said there are fewer calls about rice from the  public on the emergency telephone lines set up within the  ministry and nationwide at the Food Agency's branch offices.  "At one time, all the lines were full, but we got only 29 calls  on Monday," Hata said.    Hata admitted to reporters after the cabinet meeting that  his  ministry's response to the rice shortage was inadequate. "We  should have told the public at an earlier stage about the  prospects of supply in the upcoming month," he said.    He also conceded that there were problems with the way the  ministry ordered the much-criticized blending of domestic rice  and imported rice. "We ought to respond with more flexibility  since changes in the economy and the trend among consumers are  proceeding at a rapid pace," he said.    Later in the day, the farm minister apologized to an  agricultural committee at the house of representatives for  having gone on with reducing rice production last year when the  harvest was hit by the bad weather.    He indicated, however, that the government will go on  cutting  down on the amount of land devoted to rice production in the  years ahead. "If we discontinue with rice reductions, there  will be an oversupply that would have an effect on rice prices  and on the incomes of farms," the minister said.    Asked about the issue of revising the food control law, Hata  said that its structure will be maintained, but that the  government will actively adopt the principle of competition.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Pension funds The reduction of pension funds' tax credit on UK dividends could hardly come at a worse time for the industry. The credit was sliced from 35 per cent to 25 per cent in the 1980s, but dividends were then growing faster than liabilities. Yesterday's cut to 20 per cent comes in a period of anaemic dividend growth. It may be the final blow for pension fund surpluses that are already shrinking. Domestic equities remain the best match for most pension liabilities. But actuaries rolling a reduced yield on equities forward through the life of a fund might conclude that uncovered liabilities have increased substantially. Perhaps Pounds 20bn may have to be found over time to make up for lost investment returns. Higher contributions from employers - and an early end to contribution holidays - are the obvious places to look. That will drain company profits once the gap shows up in pension funds valuations. Whether this is only the thin end of the wedge remains an open question. For the first time the chancellor has uncoupled the tax credit from the basic rate of tax, which remains at 25 per cent. The innocent interpretation is that he is simply looking forward to the day when the basic rate is set at 20 per cent. But with the fiscal position so tight, he may be tempted to come back for more. Taking the credit away altogether would yield a further Pounds 4bn a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia's  industrial production has doubled since an economic economic  reform programme was launched in late January. Industry, apart  from the power industry, had a growth index of 205 per cent in  the January-to-May period. The figures for May, for the first  time in three months, show a certain drop in the industrial  production growth -- 6.8 per cent below the figure for April --  but still a rise of 3.9 per cent. Central Bank Governor  Dragoslav Avramovic, architect of the economic recovery and  monetary reconstruction programme, describes the results as a  remarkable success. "We may be proud, all the more so because  this comes after last year's total monetary collapse and in  conditions of sanctions," says Avramovic. The U.N. Security  Council clamped strict economic sanctions on Yugoslavia on May  30, 1992. The industrial output dropped by 20 per cent in 1992  as against 1991 and by a further 37.3 per cent in 1993. "Credit  for the revival of production goes primarily to the banks, which  have been operating and giving loans in the worst of economic  conditions," says Avramovic. As a result, most banks are  grappling with the problem of insolvency, and the federal  government and the Cental Bank will soon be taking steps to  consolidate the banks' position, he explains.</p>

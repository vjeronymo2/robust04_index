			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Three-month COPPER prices, which were in retreat early, rallied above Dollars 2,300 a tonne in afternoon trading on the LME, aided by the trend in New York. But dealers said as the fundamental picture is negative - with economic activity sluggish and consumers unwilling to chase prices higher - the market could turn down again. GOLD was steady on the London bullion exchange as the dollar pulled back sharply on rumours that the US Fed was planning to cut rates. The metal was fixed at Dollars 350.50 a troy ounce in the afternoon, up 50 cents from its early setting. A rise in US equities and positive US retail sales figures buoyed PLATINUM, which recovered to just below resistance at Dollars 360 after fixing earlier at Dollars 356.80. But reports of a Japanese market awash with platinum and Tocom investors selling nearby positions weighed on sentiment. London COCOA ended near the day's lows following origin selling. News that the German grind for the third quarter was 12.9 per cent above last year appeared to have little effect on prices. 'The fact that the origins are selling means there's more cocoa in the market to offset the impact of the better usage,' one dealer said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

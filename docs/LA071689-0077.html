			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> About 30 East Germans have taken refuge in West Germany's embassy in Budapest,  Hungary, hoping to win admission to the West, the West German newspaper Bild am  Sonntag said. It quoted a Bonn official as saying many East Germans had been  drawn to Hungary after it began dismantling its border fence with Austria in  May, leading them to believe they could make their way to West Germany via  Hungary. But Hungarian border patrols were turning back East Germans, the paper  said. News of this had caused would-be emigrants to take refuge in the embassy  in the hope that it would find a way out for them.  </P></p>

Here is  General Germanos being interviewed by Frederique Barrere:    [Begin Germanos recording] The mission that we planned, and  which consisted of going inside Rwanda without using force, has  been conducted in good conditions. The mission allowed us to  get in touch with both the people who are governing Rwanda  today, and the Tutsi who are being detained in a certain number  of camps. At the moment, no French base has been established on  Rwandan territory. The aim is to reassure the population  without staying in this country. We have to point out, however,  that a certain number of [word indistinct] were reported to us  and that common graves have been discovered. They are few for  the moment. I stress this because we have not yet fully  assessed the situation, but we can now say they exist. [end  recording]</p>

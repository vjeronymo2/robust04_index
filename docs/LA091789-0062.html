			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ANGOLA FACING ANOTHER PERIL AS CUBAN DOCTORS LEAVE  </P> <P> Outside Lubango pediatric hospital in southern Angola, a young woman screams,  throws her dress over her head and flees down the street wailing. She has just  learned of her child's death.  </P> <P> Behind this small tragedy lies a little-publicized aspect of the Cuban troop  withdrawal from Angola. Pleading insecurity, Cuban doctors are also  withdrawing, leaving as abruptly as they arrived in 1975, and Soviet doctors  will soon follow.  </P> <P> "There are not enough experienced Angolan surgeons," a foreign medical worker  explained, "and they fear operating, especially on children. I stand with them  in the operating theater trying to give them confidence, but sometimes they  hesitate too long. This child died of acute appendicitis."  </P> <P> Cuban doctors and teachers have played a key role in Angola's civil  administration. Lubango's main public hospital, which serves four provinces and  has 200 beds, is typical.  </P> <P> Its staff previously consisted of 25 Cuban doctors, 15 Soviets and three  Angolans, two of whom were interns.  </P> <P> On July 25, all the Cubans left. And the Soviet doctors will not renew their  contracts when they run out at the end of November.  </P> <P> As a stopgap measure, the government has contracted two Bulgarian doctors and  14 Vietnamese, three of whom are acupuncturists, for Lubango. But hospital  staff still feel incapable of treating the vast medical problems of the region,  which include injuries from the new round of fighting between government troops  and rebels.  </P> <P> Twenty casualties have recently been admitted, principally with flesh injuries  from anti-personnel mines.  </P> <P> Dr. Constantina Furtado Machado, the clinical director of the hospital, said it  is already in crisis because of a shortage of drugs, specialists and equipment.  </P> <P> "We have one week's supply of antibiotics here," she said, "and our only  analgesics are aspirin."  </P> <P> The health problems of Lubango, stemming from the debilitating effects of a war  economy, arise from the lack of a clean water supply, malnutrition  (contributing to the wide incidence of cardiac congestion) and tropical  illnesses such as malaria and dysentery.  </P></p>

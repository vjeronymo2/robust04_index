			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ch'i Miao-miao (7871 3267 3267): "Mainland's 70 </F> Million `Bare Sticks'!"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In 1992 the population surveys  in some provinces and the fourth national census showed: On the  mainland the male-female sex ratio has already become  unbalanced. In the total population, males accounted for 51.45  percent and females 48.55 percent, and there were over 36.8  million more males than females; in the 25- to 49-year-old age  group, the number of single males was 15 times the number of  single females, accounting for 7.78 percent of the total  population of males in the same age group. In Jiangsu Province  more than 720,000 males of marriageable age have not yet  married, and for females the same figure is only 42,000; in  Ningwu County, Shanxi Province, the male-female sex ratio in the  rural population is 121:100, and in the 20-35 age group the  ratio is 150:100. What is noteworthy is: The younger the age,  the higher the proportion of males rises and the lower the  proportion of females falls. In Hunan Province, there are 2.5  million more males than females, and among children aged one to  nine there are 460,000 more males than females; in Jiangling  County, Hebei Province, before 1984 the ratio of male and female  births was 105:100, in 1989 this ratio rose to 127.45:100, and  by 1991 males accounted for 75 percent of the total number of  births in that year. The rapid increase in the proportion of  newly born male children constitutes a new, serious threat to  the balance between the two sexes in the mainland population.    The results of the census and the surveys showed the  mainland  population's birth rate was 19.68 percent and the male-female  birth ratio was 114:100; of the over 23 million persons born  every year, over 3.6 million more males were born than females.  Making calculations based on these figures, by the end of this  century the mainland will have over 30 million more males, and,  coupled with the present over 36 million, at that time there  will be the large contingent of 70 million "bare sticks"!  [passage omitted]    However, who is tolling the alarm bell?    China is a country that for several thousand years has had  the idea of regarding men as superior to women, and many people,  to this day, believe that "there are three major offenses  against filial piety, among which not producing an heir is the  gravest."    Following the implementation of the basic national policy of  family planning, the idea of "extensive cultivation" lost its  market. Therefore, people found a new path and wrote a  "composition" on the target of having only one baby. After the  "secret recipes" and "tricky moves" of quacks and herb doctors,  witches and sorcerors did not work, "B-Ultrasound," which sees  clearly into the human body, has become the "secret weapon" for  distinguishing the sex of a fetus.    For a time the "B-Ultrasound" room became the most popular  clinic in a hospital. Before daylight, outside a "B-Ultrasound"  room a long line would form, a line in which one young pregnant  married woman after another, accompanied by husband or family  member, waited for the "verdict" given by the "B-Ultrasound."    No matter whether you admit it or not, "B-Ultrasound" has  already entered the mistaken area of interfering with the  gradual increase in human births, and is now becoming, or has  already become, one of the latent factors in throttling the life  of female fetuses, ruining the health of pregnant women, and  causing an imbalance in the male-female sex ratio.    Perhaps more grevious is that science has succumbed to the  lure of money. Certain "B-Ultrasound" operators whose medical  ethics are on a slippery slope, at the least serious, do  relatives and friends a favor by giving them, without  authorization, the "answer" to a fetus' sex; at the most  serious, under the offensive of money, they lose their  principles and, with this as a condition, take bribes, break  rules, and reveal the results of "B-Ultrasound" fluoroscopy.  Isn't this a corruption of medical ethics and conscience?    Drowning, abandoning, as well as maltreating to death girl  babies are also important causes of the unbalanced male-female  sex ratio. To give birth to a male child who whill "continue the  family line" and also to not need to pay a large fine for  exceeding the birth quota, some familes who have already given  birth to a girl child have taken extremely cruel  countermeasures. At depots, docks, as well as by the side and  under the eaves of residences, one often sees abandoned baby  girls crying. In Xinhuang Dong Autonomous county, from 1987 to  1989 a total of 103 abandoned babies were discovered, 98 percent  of them girl babies; in the past year the Oujiangcha Agency of  Suiyang County took in and cared for 110 abandoned babies, all  of them female. [passage omitted]    In certain poor and backward mountain areas, the problem of  "bare sticks," caused by the serious imbalance in the sex  ration, has already become quite serious.    The effects caused by the unbalanced sex ratio--the loss and  harm--are difficult to predict and impossible to remedy; they  not only run counter to the principles of demographic biology,  but are also a factor that increases social instability. In poor  mountain areas, where there are many males and few females,  there are many fantastic anecdotes that cause people to not know  whether to laugh or cry; there are cases of losing morals and  ethics, of going against laws and regulations, and even of  causing inhuman tragedies. [passage omitted]    On a mountain range where the borders of Shanxi and Shaanxi  provinces meet, there is a six-member family: an old man nearly  70 years old and five young and vigorous sons. It is an  homogenous male world. The five brothers of the He [0149] family  are "bare sticks" who had experiences to the fullest the  bitterness of solitary life. One day Brother Five took a wife to  share his bed. The remaining four brothers were both envious and  jealous; physiological impules caused them to do some things in  front of their sister-in-law that were very unseemly and that at  time even made spectacles of them. The old man knew the reason  for all this very well, and he did a "job" on Brother Five,  saying: "A white steamed bun that one person has exclusive  possession of is not savory; let everybody share in eating a  little of it." Ignorant Brother Five unexpectedly agreed to this  unreasonable request made by his father. [passage omitted]    Hong Juan [4767 1227], a girl from west of the Huang He and  Xiang Yun [4382 7189], a boy from east of the Huang He, were  fellow students in a junior middle school. They studied and  played together; they had a quite harmonious relationship. Three  years after graduation Hong Juan gave her love to Xiang Yun.    Hong Juan's love for a boy from another place and another  clan was resolutely opposed by her family, clan members, and  fellow villagers. There was every reason for their opposition:  in this clan and village, the ratio of unmarried men to  unmarried women was nearly 2:1, i.e., out of every two men one  could not get a wife. To thoroughly block any opportunity for  Hong Juan and Xiang Yun to meet, they put Hong Juan under house  arrest and forced her to become betrothed to one Ren Lin [0088  2651] of this village.    On a pitch-black night, Xiang Yun led some men to make a  "suprise attack" on Hong Juan's house and snatch the girl away  to east of the Huang He. Seeing that his "quasi-bride" had been  snatched away, Ren Lin mustured a force of over 100 clansmen  from this village to wage a hot pursuit. East of the Huang He a  defense had early been prepared, and a force of close to 100 men  had been mustered. On the embankments east and west of the Huang  He the two sides engaged in a tense confrontation. Fortunately,  leaders of villages and towns and comrades of the public  security police substations rushed up in good time and  restrained the two sides from engaging in a vicious fight.

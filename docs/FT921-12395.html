			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / LSE director heads second consortium bidding for BTG AN Anglo-American consortium emerged at the weekend as a bidder for the British Technology Group, the state-owned enterprise destined for privatisation. The consortium is headed by Dr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, and includes the US organisation Research Corporation Technology and a group of City institutions. It is the second bidder to show its hand. Earlier this month BTG's management and staff made known that they had formed a consortium under Mr Ian Harvey, BTG chief executive. BTG is a technology-transfer organisation established to commercialise ideas and inventions originating in Britain's universities and research council establishments. Its profits come from selling rights to patents and licences. Last year pre-tax profits fell 32 per cent to Pounds 6.5m. It is expected to fetch about Pounds 50m. Universities and the Labour party have expressed concern that privatisation could damage the exploitation of UK technology and harm long-term academic interests. Bidding closed on January 6, and the government has told bidders they must seek approval before releasing any information about the negotiations. The sale is being managed by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, which says the reason for the secrecy is that it increases the pressure for a good bid. The government has said that no member of a bidding consortium can hold a stake of more than 15 per cent. Research Corporation Technology, the US member of the Ashworth consortium, is thought to want 30 per cent. RCT has a similar role among US universities. The government has said it will waive the 15 per cent rule in exceptional circumstances.</p>

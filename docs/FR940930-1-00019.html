Although GATT enabling legislation has not been passed, these proposed rule changes assume that it will be passed, and therefore changes to 37 CFR 1.131(a) similar to NAFTA would be required. See Article 27, paragraph 1, of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods, of the GATT. In the event that the GATT enabling legislation is not enacted when the final rules are published, the proposed rule changes relative to the GATT will be withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131(a), which is currently limited to facts showing a completion of the invention in the United States, to allow for a submission of facts in an affidavit or declaration that show completion of the invention in a NAFTA or a World Trade Organization (WTO) Member country. The WTO is established under the GATT agreement to resolve disputes between signatories to the agreement. The facts presented must demonstrate completion of the invention prior to the effective date of a reference thought to bar the grant of a patent or the patentability of a claim in a patent under reexamination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Office recognizes that there is a potential conflict between existing 37 CFR 1.131(a) and 37 CFR 1.602(a). Section 1.131(a) prohibits affidavits or declarations thereunder when the same patentable invention as defined in 37 CFR 1.601(n) (i.e., patentably indistinct inventions) is claimed. An interference under 35 U.S.C. 135, rather than antedating under &sect;1.131(a), is generally the available remedy. However, 37 CFR 1.602(a) provides that when the applications or the application and patent are owned by a single party, interferences are not declared or continued unless good cause is shown. This can result in a hardship where there is an issued patent that can no longer be amended as by filing a continuation-in-part application. Where there are two or more pending applications, the conflict can be avoided by filing a continuation-in-part application incorporating the conflicting inventions in a single application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131 to broaden its application to a single party where inventions of a pending application and a patent held by the party are patentably indistinct but not identical. Under the proposed additions to &sect;1.131, an affidavit or declaration could be filed by a party to avoid a 35 U.S.C. 103 rejection based on a 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (e) patent owned by that party, where the patent claimed an invention that was patentably indistinct, but not identical to an invention claimed in an application or patent undergoing reexamination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed addition to &sect;1.131 would not affect the use of the issued patent in a rejection based on double patenting. However, where patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are claimed, a double patenting rejection can be avoided by filing an appropriate terminal disclaimer. In addition, petitions under &sect;1.183 will be entertained for waiver of &sect;1.131 requirements in appropriate instances where two pending applications claiming patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are held by a single party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Specific Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.131(a), if amended to (a)(1) as proposed, would allow a &sect;1.131 affiant or declarant to rely upon facts occurring in a NAFTA or a WTO Member country to show completion of the invention. The term ``domestic'' would be changed to ``U.S.'' The section is proposed to be amended from a single sentence to three sentences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.131(a)(2), if added as proposed, would limit the availability of acts showing completion of the invention in a NAFTA or WTO Member country to those acts occurring subsequent to the effective date of the agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

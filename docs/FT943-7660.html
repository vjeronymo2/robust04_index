			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The empire that can't fight back: Russia's yen for influence in the former Soviet Union Russia yesterday commemorated the third anniversary of the 1991 attempted coup when hard-liners tried to stop the Soviet Union from falling apart. But those Muscovites who braved the rainy weather to join a small pro-democracy anniversary rally invoked little of the euphoria which intoxicated Moscow three years ago as Russians defied the plotters and rallied around President Boris Yeltsin. Instead of exultation, the dominant mood in the former Soviet Union is of nostalgia. Increasingly, Russians mourn the loss of their empire and non-Russians in newly independent states look back longingly to the days when their lives were constrained, but more economically secure. Thus, General Valentin Varennikov, the only coup leader to choose to go to trial, was triumphantly acquitted this month. With his call for the recreation of the Soviet Union, he has been transformed from villain to hero. Hard-line communists and other conservatives out-shouted the pro-democracy rallies yesterday. Similar sentiments provide the power base for the flamboyantly imperialist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But the spectre of a newly emboldened Russia which would seek to reconquer by force the territories lost almost by accident, has not materialised. While the pro-union rhetoric may be getting louder and finding a growing constituency throughout the former USSR, it is apparent that the old empire cannot easily be put back together again. Overtly imperial actions - such as Moscow's quiet backing for pro-Russian politicians in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan; or Russia's pressure on Georgia to abandon its stalwart independence - have been limited to the southern periphery, which Russia is not really sure it wants within its borders. As far as the Slav heartland is concerned, bit by bit the imperial scare has been replaced by a different perception, one assiduously promoted by Russia itself - that far from Russia pursuing expansionist purposes, most of the states of the former Soviet Union wish themselves to re-establish links with it. This view received great support from the victories, in the Ukrainian and Belarussian presidential elections in July, of Leonid Kuchma and Alexander Lukashenko - both running on tickets of closer union with Russia (in Mr Lukashenko's case, of total union). As these new men gained power, Russia's most distinguished living dissident and author, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, was winding his way through his country by train, bringing to Moscow his long-held belief that at least the Slav states of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus should unite once more. Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador to Russia, noted in a speech in the UK in July that Russians feel that 'Russia is primus inter pares (that is, among other former Soviet states) by virtue of geography, scale, tradition and some not clearly defined right'. Another 'right' claimed by Russians, Mr Pickering said, derived from the country's perceived obligation to protect the interests of cousins beyond its frontiers - the millions of ethnic Russians abroad. These two 'rights' are strongly felt and strongly asserted: they are a major and inhibiting factor in the politics of the surrounding states as much as they are a matter of often chauvinistic assertion in Russia. But, crucially, Mr Pickering added a third attribute of contemporary Russians: a 'profound scepticism about direct intervention in disputes beyond Russia's current borders'. The point about Russian imperialist rhetoric is that, at present it remains as rhetoric and is almost certainly designed to be so. The projection of Russian power has shrivelled dramatically. The scale of this can be seen in the fact that, only a year or two after it ceased to be a global superpower, Russia was absorbed in a debate (overdrawn, but real) about whether or not the country would survive in one part even though its boundaries were already more limited than any time since the 18th century. Russia no longer has the military, economic or political capacity to service any lust to reabsorb. Further - and as important - the development of nation states in those parts of the Soviet Union that have broken away is going on willy nilly. Nothing has illustrated this tendency more pointedly than recent events in Ukraine and Belarus. Both country's presidents, having been elected on pro-Russian platforms, have become committed defenders of their nations' independence. One factor in this metamorphosis is the personal ambition of the two leaders. As one voter reminded Mr Kuchma on the campaign trail, 'it is better to be president of independent Ukraine than the governor of Little Russia'. But there was also a paradox at the heart of the desire for reunion, as expressed during the election campaigns. Co-existing with nostalgia across the former Soviet Union for the Soviet past, when the republics were part of a single state in which central planning provided a stagnant but reliable standard of living, is another powerful impulse: the determination by the states' governments and many ordinary people to build modern, prosperous market economies. This second current is inevitably at odds with the first, primarily because Russia, far further along the reform trail than Ukraine or Belarus, is no longer willing to sacrifice its natural resources or to break its budget for the sake of close family ties with its neighbours. Market reform, which is naturally a decentralising process even in states which stick together, could not co-exist with immediate political and economic reunion. The December 1991 agreement between the Belarussian, Russian and Ukrainian presidents to form the Commonwealth of Independent States (and thus finally to destroy the Soviet Union) is excoriated by many former Soviet citizens - but they must live with its results. Differing rates of economic development; the establishment of independent foreign and defence policies; the growing expectation on the part of citizens that the national, rather than the former imperial, centre is the effective locus for politics; the vested interests of new national political and bureaucratic elites - all cut against the urge for reabsorption. They make it clear that it would be a vast, costly and probably bloody undertaking. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yabloko parliamentary faction in the Russian legislature and the most consistent proponent among democrats of a re-union of the former USSR, is a weathervane in this regard. While he still supports 'closer economic co-operation' he now believes that the political and defence union, which he once strongly advocated, is no longer necessary. For many countries, the independence of what had been part of them seemed incongruous at the time of separation: Ireland for the British, Finland for the Swedes, Slovakia for the Czechs. Often the larger country had a point: independence made little economic sense and left resentful national minorities within new borders. But it seems as if, once the national die is cast, the road back is blocked. If the former 'family of socialist peoples' is to meet again under a common roof, the members must spend the same time and energy as their west European neighbours in developing mechanisms and safeguards which ensure at least formal equality in their deliberations. The rhetoric of conservatives notwithstanding, the countries of the former Soviet Union seem as far away from political union as western Europe was after the second world war.</p>

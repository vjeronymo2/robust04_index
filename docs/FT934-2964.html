			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Sweden plans to expand foreign currency loans Sweden said yesterday it expected to borrow an additional SKr20bn-SKr30bn in foreign currency next year to meet its financing requirements. This means its foreign currency borrowing requirement during 1994 will amount to SKr85bn-SKr95bn, including refinancings of maturing debt. The country is one of the biggest borrowers in the international capital markets as its budget deficit has climbed to 15 per cent of gross domestic product, one of the highest levels in western Europe. The government said net currency borrowing of SKr20bn-SKr30bn next year meant the foreign currency element in the funding of state debt would fall slightly. According to the national debt office, Sweden's total debt in foreign currency at November 30 1993 amounted to SKr374bn, equal to 34 per cent of central government debt.</p>

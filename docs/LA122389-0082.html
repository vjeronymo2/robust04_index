			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEVER READ BUCHWALD STORY, MURPHY SAYS  </P> <P> Comedian Eddie Murphy, in a sworn deposition released Friday, said he never  read a story sold to Paramount Pictures by humorist Art Buchwald, but was  familiar with the idea and liked it.  </P> <P> Even so, Murphy says in the deposition that he and talk-show host Arsenio Hall  wrote the concept for the hit movie "Coming to America," countering Buchwald's  claims that the movie was based on his story treatment, "King for a Day."  </P> <P> "Coming to America" is about an African prince, played by Murphy, who comes to  New York to find a bride. Buchwald's story concept focused on a contemptuous  king from an oil-rich African nation who is stranded in Washington when he is  overthrown.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court trial in the $5-million breach-of-contract case  began last week, focusing on Buchwald's allegation that Paramount stole his  idea to make "Coming to America," which was the third-biggest hit of 1988,  grossing $300 million. Murphy has said he will not testify in the case. His  deposition was taken Oct. 12 by Buchwald's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell.  </P></p>

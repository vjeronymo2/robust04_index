			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The authorities in Guinea say several senior  military officers have been detained for allegedly plotting to  overthrow the government of Lansana Conte. The president  himself is out of the country, attending the OAU summit. From  Conakry, Foday Fofana telexed this report.    According to relatives and colleagues, Commander (Keida  Kourouma), head of the Parachutist Battalion and Commander  (Ouphara Oulare), deputy chief of staff of the Air Force, were  picked up on Thursday [9 June] and Friday last week,  respectively. Both men are now held in open detention at the  National Gendarmerie Headquarters in Conakry. Although an  officer there denied they were holding (Kouroma) and (Oulare), a  colleague and myself spotted (Kouroma) in civilian clothes  entering the room where he is being held.    Meanwhile, tension is believed to be mounting inside the  Alpha Yaya military base here following an attempted mutiny by  soldiers there yesterday. An eyewitness told me last night that  soldiers loyal to the detained officers had wanted to storm the  ammunition depot, arm themselves, and move on the Gendarmerie  Headquarters in the heart of the capital to free their  superiors, but the timely intervention of other senior military  officers succeeded in calming down the situation, the eyewitness  said.    The arrest coincides with the retirement of some 200 senior  officers ordered by President Conte last Saturday. Defense  Minister Colonel Abdourahmane Diallo was not available for  comment but his permanent secretary, Captain Camara, could only  say that the judicial arm of the Army is still investigating.    Despite reports that the detained officers were not being  tortured, Mr. Christian Sow of the Guinea Human Rights  Association has said the best guarantee is to have access to the  detainees in order to ascertain that they were not denied food  or medical treatment if need be.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Long View: Midsummer's dream The bland complacency of the Treasury's summer forecast for the UK economy this week clashed strikingly with the recent mood of puzzled alarm in the securities markets. It seems from the Treasury's document that chancellor Kenneth Clarke has nothing to worry about as the economy cruises steadily towards comfortable equilibrium - except perhaps about precisely how to time modest tax reductions for the best effect ahead of the next general election. Certainly, recent dives in equities and gilts do not fit into this rosy picture. It must be, the Treasury muses, that confused investors have become over-alarmed about a possible future rise in inflation. As usual the Treasury is completely out of touch. The Treasury's computer model is far from being the worst of its kind at tracking the economy, and indeed the results have been adjusted further in line with the consensus, but recent history has shown that such devices are hopeless at forecasting the future. The document only really tells us how the government would like the future to be. Financial markets, in contrast, reflect the actual effects of money flowing through the global economy. This year they have indicated that large shifts are taking place. No reliable economic forecast can be found here either; but at least there is no wishful thinking. Halfway through the year the financial damage is, briefly, as follows: the long-dated gilt-edged yield up from 6.4 to 8.7 per cent, the corresponding index-linked yield up from 2.9 to almost 4.0 per cent, and the All-Share Index down by 13 per cent. At the low point a week ago the Footsie index of 100 blue chips was showing a decline of 18 per cent from its February 2 peak. Six months ago I suggested that equities were overpriced and becoming dangerous, although the turning point might not be all that close (it was nearer than I thought). I also warned that trouble would ensue when the benign relationship between the US and Japanese capital markets, which had prevailed in bullish 1993, broke down. At under 3,000 on the Footsie the UK equity market has returned to a level offering reasonable long-term value. By this I mean that if you buy now you will not feel embarrassed about the decision in three or four years. The dividend yield is now back to 4 per cent on the market as a whole and, with dividends growing at a comparatively rapid rate of 6.4 per cent year-on-year, the income argument for holding shares has been reinstated. The market price-earnings ratio, based on prospective 1994 earnings, is rather less alluring at perhaps 15. Low dividend cover continues to be a problem, although it is surmountable if a couple of years of decent profits growth can be achieved. It is likely that shares will get cheaper. We are coming out of the part of the economic cycle when equities tend to be overvalued in relation to the long-term fundamentals and are entering the phase of possible undervaluation, because real interest rates are rising. The complication here is that real interest rates are not primarily set by what is going on locally in the UK but are heavily influenced by global developments. Last year the weaknesses in the Japanese and Continental European economies encouraged a fall in interest rates. But with Europe, at least, recovering, if not yet Japan, the balance has changed in 1994. A key external sign of the shift is the weakness of the dollar, down from 112 to 99 yen this year. The explanation is simply one of supply and demand; not only are the Americans running a current account deficit of Dollars 140bn a year but they are buying large amounts of foreign securities to diversify their portfolios. To offset these flows foreigners must make dollar deposits or buy dollar securities to the tune in aggregate of some Dollars 250bn-300bn. This year their appetite has run out. In particular the Japanese, the world's last big source of surplus savings, are staying at home. Their view of the outside world can be summed up by one of the statistics buried deep in the FT-Actuaries World Index matrix: the World ex Japan index, expressed in yen, has tumbled by 16 per cent in six months. There is evidently a bear market on, say investors in Tokyo. The bond markets look even worse. But the world's equity markets appear so differently from a viewpoint in the US. The World ex US index, in dollars, is 8 per cent higher. There is a bull market, Americans think, albeit a modest one - and focused almost entirely on Japan. What happens now? Most likely, the Americans will be forced at some stage to raise interest rates, perhaps quite sharply, in order to reverse the flows out of the dollar. The dollar-yen exchange rate may have to go to a silly level first. Eventually the Japanese, and others, will pile into dollar bonds. But the global economy will slow down, which could damage equities. This time last year, when the Footsie was close to where it is now, I suggested that share prices might be driven up in a liquidity-based surge, into which I would be a seller. We may now face the mirror image of that. Equities may be hit by the backlash from the necessary rebalancing of the dollar economy. Yet the second half of the year may be a time for exploiting opportunity, just as the first half has been a period for avoiding risk. Savers who were panicked out of low interest rate deposit accounts in the early weeks of 1994 did the wrong thing. They might eventually regret a reverse move this summer. If you feel worried, my advice would be to splash out Pounds 6 on the Treasury's summer forecast, sit in the warm sunshine and wallow in its purple passages (well, blue charts anyway). Sometimes there is no harm in dreaming.</p>

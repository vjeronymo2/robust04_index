			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / IBM alleges counterfeiting INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, has extended to Europe its battle against companies that it claims are counterfeiting vital components of its large computer systems. Yesterday it started proceedings against Phoenix International (Computers), the UK-based subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US. It alleges that Phoenix, a Surrey-based computer brokerage, sold memory cards - printed circuit boards bearing memory chips - as genuine IBM products, when they had, in fact, been reworked by a third party. The action against Phoenix in the UK follows similar moves over the past few months in the US against its parent and four other US companies. They are Comdisco, one of the world's largest computer leasing companies, and three engineering and broking companies - Datanon, Allen-Myland and BSM Corporation. IBM's claims against Phoenix allege trademark infringement and passing off reworked memory cards as genuine. It is seeking an injunction, compensation and costs. Neither the managing director nor the finance director of Phoenix was available for comment yesterday. The issue of 'altered memory' is contentious in the computer industry because of the large market for used IBM mainframe computers. This is worth about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in Europe alone. Machines with altered memory cards can have lower values than those with genuine IBM parts because of fears that substitute parts will be less reliable and that IBM will refuse to service the computer. IBM is offering, for a fee, to exchange other boards for guaranteed IBM components. The computer leasing industry, which depends on the ready availability of used machines, has claimed that IBM is using the issue of altered memories to control the second-hand market. Mr Nick Temple, IBM (UK) chief executive yesterday denied such suggestions. 'We do not want to profit from this business but to help people out of their difficulties,' he said.</p>

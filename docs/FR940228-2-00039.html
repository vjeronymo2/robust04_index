EPAct's IRP Reporting Requirements of DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) contains several requirements of DOE to report to the President and Congress on the status and likely impacts of electric and gas IRP development across the nation. These IRP-related reporting requirements can be found in EPAct, Title I_Energy Efficiency, Subtitle B_Utilities, Sections 111(e) and 115(e). The purpose of this notice is to obtain information relevant to the IRP evaluation and small business impact reporting requirements by soliciting the opinions of IRP stakeholders concerning the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, dependence on particular energy sources, and small businesses engaged in providing energy services. In the near-term, DOE must satisfy these EPAct requirements which call for DOE to prepare this report to the President and Congress within two years of EPAct's enactment. The report must contain, among other IRP-related items, an evaluation which determines:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> &bull;Whether and to what extent IRP (electric only) is likely to result in_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Higher or lower electricity costs to an electric utility's ultimate consumers or to classes or groups of such consumers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Enhanced or reduced reliability of electric service; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Increased or decreased dependence on particular energy resources; as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The competitive impact of implementation of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other DSM programs by utilities (electric and gas) on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of similar energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other DSM measures; and whether any unfair, deceptive, or predatory acts exist, or are likely to exist, from implementation of such programs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The DOE IRP Program will also use responses to this request for providing insight into the direction of the Program's longer-term research agenda related to assessing the national impacts of IRP. Responses to this request will be analyzed and reported by the staff of DOE's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program, which is under the auspices of the Office of Utility Technologies which is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This summary will characterize what various groups believe to be the likely impacts of electric IRP on the nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Purpose of Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The overall legislative intent of Subsection 111 of EPAct is to promote energy efficiency, in particular by encouraging utilities and States to adopt the planning principles of IRP. The legislative intent of the requirements to report the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, and dependence on particular energy resources is to assess the likely results of IRP implementation against the intended purpose and goals of EPAct's IRP-related provisions. It is also the intent of the provision to determine the competitive impacts of the energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other demand-side management programs of electric and gas utilities on small businesses to ensure that State regulatory commissions are considering the impact which expanded DSM programs may have on small businesses already engaged in similar activities, and are implementing measures to assure that utility actions will not provide utilities with an unfair competitive advantage over such small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE's IRP Program is responsible for this report. The program views the Federal role in IRP development as a collector of important data, a conduit of the lessons learned by experienced IRP practitioners to new IRP adopters, a developer of new tools and data bases and monitorer of the outcomes of IRP processes around the country. Among the priorities in this effort is the fulfillment of these EPAct reporting requirements concerning the likely impacts of IRP on the nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Submitting this report to the President and Congress will be a component of a continuing effort by DOE's IRP Program to monitor and evaluate the impact of IRP on the nation's States, utilities and consumers. The IRP Program views as part of its role to think critically about IRP and its expected benefits. Because DOE implements national energy policies that emphasize IRP as a potential solution to some of the problems affecting the nation's utility energy services, an assessment as to whether and to what extent IRP is providing overall benefit to the nation, as it is practiced, is a necessary and important DOE responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

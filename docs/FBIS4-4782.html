			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme People's  Assembly of North Korea will meet Wednesday [6 April] amid  rising tensions after the United Nations Security Council issued  a presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow further  inspection of its nuclear sites.    The seventh meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly,  a  two-day affair, is likely to express its position on the  council's presidential statement, South Korean Government  officials said Tuesday.    The North's chief constitutional organization will also  issue  statements on the country's nuclear and foreign policies, they  said.    "We expect the Supreme People's Assembly to stick to the  North Korean Government's hard-line policy of rejecting further  inspection of their nuclear sites rather than complying with the  Security Council's warning," said an official.    The prediction was based on a North Korean Foreign Ministry  statement issued Monday that Pyongyang would resume "peaceful  nuclear activities" if the international community continued to  apply pressure.    "It is not likely that Kim Il-song will take measures to  transfer power to his heir-apparent Kim Chong-il during the  upcoming assembly meeting," the official added.    As the top constitutional body of North Korea, the Supreme  People's Assembly has the authority to elect and impeach party  and government officials including the state president, craft  government policies and approve the state budget.</p>

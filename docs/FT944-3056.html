			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Portillo welcomes employment figures Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, yesterday welcomed signs that the figures measuring employment were moving in the right direction. Unemployment had been falling steadily since December 1992 but the figures for the workforce in employment, compiled from a survey of employers, had previously been showing declines. Yesterday's Department of Employment figures showed that employment rose by 146,000 in the third quarter, the largest quarterly increase since 1989. This brought the measure into line with the Labour Force Survey, which produces statistics on the basis of interviews with individuals, and which has been recording steady employment increases. The LFS, which is conducted on a slightly different timescale from the employers' survey, found an increase in employment of 64,000 between the spring and the summer. Mr Portillo said he felt the employers' survey followed the LFS with about a six-month lag, which mainly reflected the delays between the establishment of new businesses and the reporting, via the Inland Revenue, of job creation to the Department of Employment. The main increase in employment was a rise of 126,000 in the services sector, according to the employers' survey, while self-employment rose by 40,000. About 52,000 of the services increase came from the banking, insurance and financial services sector. Employment in the manufacturing sector rose by just 2,000 in the third quarter, but this gain was wiped out in October. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally adjusted 43,400 in November to 2,470,600, or 8.8 per cent of the workforce. This was the lowest total since September 1991; unemployment has now fallen by 501,000 since its peak in December 1992. Last month, unemployment fell among men and women in every region. Following a revised fall of 48,400 in October (the previous estimate was 45,800), the unemployment total has now dropped by an average of 31,800 over the last six months. However, the Department of Employment still estimates the trend is for a monthly decline of 25,000. Unadjusted, the number of unemployed people fell 32,031 to 2,423,013, or 8.6 per cent of the workforce. The LFS shows that growth in full-time employment outstripped that of part-time jobs between the spring and the summer. In many previous quarters part-time work has predominated. Meanwhile, the stock of unfilled vacancies at jobcentres rose by a seasonally adjusted 3,400 in November to 180,600, the highest level since June 1990.  ------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT  ------------------------------- October, seasonally adjusted  ------------------------------- Northern Island        12.5% North                  11.0% Yorks &amp; Humber          9.1% North-West              9.0% West Midlands           8.9% Wales                   8.8% Scotland                8.7% South-east              8.5% Greater London         10.3% East Midlands           8.3% South-west              7.8% East Anglia             6.7% UK                      8.8%  -------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  --------------------------------</p>

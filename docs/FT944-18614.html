			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: The market always wins Sir, Samuel Brittan, in 'Calling the bond market bluff' (Economic Viewpoint, September 29), is either not saying anything or he is saying something wrong. In judging whether anticipated levels of inflation require monetary tightening, it is of course always tempting for any individual - not just central bankers - to imagine that he or she has stumbled upon an indicator which knows better than the market as a whole. No sensible person denies that this is possible. The real question is: which do you find, on average, to be more trustworthy  -the combined judgment of thousands of such individuals, or that of one or a few who have got themselves installed by politicians in central banks? The Alan Greenspans of this world, who might actually see something on the horizon that the rest of us miss, will unfortunately always be rare birds; and nothing good can come of flattering central bankers that they share such vision. Mr Brittan should not need to be reminded that, on average, the daily plebiscite of expert opinion that is a market will always beat any one guess at what will happen next. The principal danger of central banking is not that one might begin to follow this opinion, 'as if it were the word of God' - it is rather the risk of becoming too sure of one's own predictive abilities, and attempting to play that mighty role oneself.

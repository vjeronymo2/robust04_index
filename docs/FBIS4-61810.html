			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Immediate release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs in Tallinn dated 6 May: "Estonian-Russian Talks Round  Ends in Stalemate; Russians Refuse To Put August 31 Date Back  Into Agreement, Continue Demands" -- received via Internet  E-LIST]    [Text] The 19th round of Estonian-Russian troop withdrawal  negotiations held on 5-6 May at Lohusalu near Tallinn ended in  another stalemate today with both sides sticking to their  positions. During this round the two sides did not discuss the  general agreement at all.    At the post-talks press conference in Tallinn, Russian  negotiator Vasiliy Svirin stated that no further troops will be  brought to Estonia, but refused to comment on press reports that  today in Moscow Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  threatened to do just that.    Although the general agreement has been ready for initialing  since March, the Russian side refuses to reinsert the clause  referring to the already agreed-upon final withdrawal date, 31  August 1994. Despite an international obligation to withdraw  "unconditionally," Russia continues to demand Estonian  compliance with substantial conditions. Specifically, Russia  has refused to initial the agreement until Estonia agrees 1) to  pay $23 million to the Government of Russia and 2) to initial an  agreement on pensioned military officers.    Although troop withdrawal cannot be linked to any other  issues, including social guarantees for demobilized Russian  military personnel, Estonia has continued negotiating in good  faith. Unfortunately, the Russian side has gone beyond demanding  Estonian residency for former Red Army troops. They state that  Estonia must give these individuals special treatment and  privileges over those enjoyed by Estonian citizens. Although  years served in the Soviet Armed Forces do not count as working  years for privatization purposes even for Estonian citizens, the  Russian side says that years spent in the Red Army must be  counted for their military pensioners. This demand is  particularly egregious as the Red Army was the basic instrument  for repression of civil liberties and human rights in Eastern  Europe.    In a further setback, the Russian side declared that the  defuelling of the nuclear reactors at Paldiski Training Center  cannot be started before a detailed agreement is signed  legalizing the presence of some 200 military personnel there  plus their families until the end of the century.    Some progress was made in the humanitarian and border issues  group. The next round will be in Moscow, but the Russian side  failed to name a date, proposing that the working groups meet in  between rounds.</p>

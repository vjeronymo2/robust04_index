			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS;  </P> <P> THE ACTING AWARDS -- TOUGH CHOICES;  </P> <P> AN ASSESSMENT OF SKILLS THAT WENT INTO CREATING 10 MEMORABLE ROLES  </P> <P> It's only fitting that Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy are both up for Academy  Awards for their roles in "Driving Miss Daisy" (adapted from his play by Alfred  Uhry), since they play off each other in a quiet pas de duex whose overriding  simplicity is built up through small, eloquent details. The setting is 1948  Atlanta and covers 20 years. Tandy's Miss Daisy is a feisty, prideful  72-year-old Jewish widow of some means. Freeman's Hoak is a widower 10 years  younger, hired -- initially against her will -- to chauffeur her around.  </P> <P> Tandy's brittle compendium of sharp, worrisome gazes, thin querulous voice, and  a mouth set in a perpetual series of reproachful judgments, tells us a great  deal about a woman who expects things to be Just So and is acutely sensitive to  the hierarchy of appearances in a Southern community. She's by no means a  racist (and in fact is a visible supporter of Martin Luther King Jr.). She's a  stubborn, intellectually principled woman whom the world has failed so  regularly that she's beyond didacticism. But never her standard. When Miss  Daisy suffers her first touch of Alzheimer's, Tandy takes on the appearance of  spectral alarm. The ghostly aureole of her disheveled hair and the panic in her  face shows us the terror of an exacting woman who's lost her sense of place.  </P> <P> Freeman's Hoak is stripped of all contemporary urban references in reaching  back to a specific time and place where to be black was to live in a spirit of  caution that seeped out of the marrow. Up to now, Freeman's performances have  been fires well-tended; here he gives us the feel of Southern weight, which is  always oppressive -- even in the weather. He walks as though his flat feet  ache. He affects an old black man's stiff hips and jocular self-effacement. He  laughs with sealed lips.  </P> <P> Still, this Hoak is not someone to be pushed around. He's expressive within a  circumspect frame. When Freeman says "Oh I jus' love the smell of a new car,  don't you, Miss Daisy?" he looks like someone who's awakened to a brilliant  morning. Outside her synagogue, after she's scolded him for bringing the car up  front with its suggestion of ostentation, he peers at her and says, "You needs  a chauffeur. I needs a job. Let's leave it at that." Wordlessly, something in  her relents to his sharpness. By the time they're ready for the drive to the  King fund-raiser in Mobile, they're fussing at each other like comfortable old  marrieds (later, his glance at an Alabama state trooper says everything about  primal black fear in the South). By story's end, he's the only one she'll admit  within the iron gates of her censure. He's become living proof of the efficacy  of kindness.  </P> <P> There's an infinitely more violent restraint at work in Daniel Day-Lewis's  portrayal on Christy Brown in "My Left Foot." Brown is the Irish author and  painter afflicted with cerebral palsy -- his left foot is the only thing he can  control -- and Day-Lewis vividly shows us what it means to have a lively and  precocious spirit held at the mercy of a body mostly paralyzed and perpetually  wracked by neurological firestorms.  </P> <P> Day-Lewis's performance is no Movie-of-the-Week sympathy card; the pain of  living underwater, as it were, where virtually no impulse has a direct  expression, is sometimes unbearable to watch. His Christy hasn't the time and  energy for the luxury of dissimulation -- in a restaurant scene in which a  woman he fancies announces her engagement to someone else, he throws a  frightful, drooling, red-faced tantrum of such fierce torment that you fear  he'll perish on the spot.  </P> <P> In nearly any setting, Day-Lewis' jaws grind in pained derision and his eyes  flash with anger and recrimination before they roll into fear and pain. He is a  true prisoner of the flesh. The beauty of this performance is in how many  quickly closing crevices Day-Lewis finds to express a fierce intelligence, a  pleasure at finding pleasure, a thirst for life (both literal and sexual), a  sidelong humor, and the hard-won truths about living which most of the rest of  us tend to forget.  </P> <P> Five years ago Robin Williams would have played the boys' private school  literature instructor John Keating in "Dead Poets Society" as a poetry-spewing  zany whose fatal collision-course with the administration leaves him a  sentimental object of pity. Here, not only are Williams' highs more restrained,  he successfully risks the quality that's almost always fatal to a performance  by playing foreknowledge. His clowning around here for once refers more to his  character than to his standup routine -- it's a way of getting the boys to  loosen up. At heart Keating wants to show them that one's compact with poetry  is a link with freedom and self-discovery, and what truths others have had to  say about experience.  </P> <P> A sad, circumspect element in Williams' performance suggests that Keating knows  well how transitory the impressionable openess and headiness of youth really  is. He's their champion because he understands them and can awaken in them the  notion that in literature everyone is contemporary with everyone else. He also  knows the odds. There's nothing he can say to the boy who passionately wants to  act but whose father forbids it; watching them drive away, his face grows drawn  and bitter. In the final scene, as the students stand on their desks in  recalcitrant tribute, he pauses on the way out to say "Thank you, boys," and  leave them with a smile full of prideful understanding and sympathetic pain.  </P> <P> Thick-waisted, jowly, snaggle-toothed and possessed of a small, ceramic British  voice, Pauline Collins in "Shirley Valentine" is this year's entry in the  Women's Picture sub-category. Last year it was Melanie Griffith's "Working  Girl" whose triumph was to make it into a small boxy office in a big  corporation while a billowing musical score sang improbably of arriving in the  new Jerusalem.  </P> <P> This year, Alan and Marilyn Bergman's insipid opener, "The Girl Who Used to Be  Me," suggest that we may be in for a case of the cutes. But Collins is a  genuinely likable woman with a sly wit. She plays a 42-year-old London  housewife whose lips are forever pursed in disdain towards those dreary  domestic encumbrances that leave her feeling dull and neglected, chief among  them a loutish husband who treats her like a salesclerk. Fortunately, Greece  beckons in the form of a friend with an extra tour ticket. There Shirley finds,  if not love, then a bout of good sex with the roguish Tom Conti, and an  unslakable thirst for freedom.  </P> <P> There are some crucial oversimplifications in "Shirley Valentine," but they're  hidden in Collins' adroit expression of quiet metamorphosis. Where once she was  dumpy, now she's lush; her sharp-eyed, brittle expression of unhappy  self-reproach has resolved into a more purposeful reflectiveness. Where once  she was a character you joked with in the kitchen, now she's someone you want  to hear from in a long talk. Shirley has keen memories of her rebellious  schoolgirl self, as well as considerable dismay over how that early fire gutted  out. If she's discovered a new resolve, we also see in Collins' solemn figure,  seated beachside at dusk, that she will never be without regret.  </P> <P> Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V" is a lithe, smallish, incandescant figure with a  carnivore's swollen jaw and eyes that don't miss a trick. In the early scenes  with his council, he generates the quiet assurance of resolution (and as an  actor, leaves himself with someplace to go). Clearly this Henry sees himself as  a creature of destiny not to be trifled with, but his face isn't abstracted in  the spooky otherworldliness of the zealot. It takes things in. Presence of mind  is a king's imperative (and it show our jaded post-Vietnam eyes why men will go  to war behind sufficiently clever and inspired leaders). Kranagh's lyrical  voice reminds us too that hearing Shakespeare well-spoken is a joy bordering on  the sensual -- this is language people once enjoyed as an ambient sixth sense,  before it was razed by the modern mass media.  </P> <P> When Henry comes to claim his French queen, Branagh underscores the coltish  uncertainty of a young man who hasn't spent much time around women. He's a  little in awe of her -- but never out of reach of his wits. When he says "You  have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of  them than in the tongues of the French council . . . " Branagh's open-faced,  exuberant charm demonstrates why Henry would be king even if he weren't  entitled. He's king because he's irresistible.  </P> <P> In "Born on the Fourth of July," Tom Cruise plays Ron Kovic, the paraplegic  Vietnam veteran who as a Long Island high school kid was an earnest subscriber  to the myths of the All-American Way before they soured with brutal experience  and he took up the cause of anti-war and veterans' rights activism. Cruise is  particularly effective in his early scenes where he captures a teen-ager's  dorky self-consciousness, and the veterans' hospital scenes are gruelling for  what we see him suffer. But as the story develops, his performance begins to  lose its continuity and tension. In interviews Cruise likes to talk about how  hard he works, but working should never be as obvious as it is here, where few  of his gestures and takes seem linked to something going on deep inside him.  </P> <P> Oliver Stone offers a number of telling observations on how fiercely we hold on  to our self-deception, and how -- aside from the PR euphemism -- the heated,  rancorous expletive has taken the place of political dialogue in America. But  his whiplash editing and Kovic's apparent inarticulateness aren't much help for  an actor of Cruise's limitations. He has a boy's voice that rises to an  androgynous whine when pressed, and his idea of passion is to high-beam his  sincerity. For all the bitter, shattering experience Kovic has endured, Cruise  gives us a soft-shelled man with a creamy center. If you recall Marlon Brando  in "The Men," you'll see what a light talent is at work here.  </P> <P> In "The Music Box," Jessica Lange plays a successful trial lawyer named Ann  Talbot who works for a tony Chicago firm and takes on the defense of her father  in a deportation suit after he's been accused of Nazi World War II crimes.  Given her literal circumstance, Lange would not have the histrionic  accoutrements available to someone who worked, say, as a samba instructor, and  she's harrowingly expert at conveying the implosive pressures at large in  someone who's wracked to her emotional core but can't enjoy the luxury of  letting go.  </P> <P> Early on her worn, slightly disheveled look says much about what it's like to  work day-to-day in the law, with its endless stops and starts, continuances and  delays. As the trial delivers its mounting challenges against her father, who,  it's clear, is fighting for his life, the horrific suffering of the testifying  war victims also takes effect. Lange moves us through every turn of Talbot's  struggle to maintain clarity and control. We see the stabbing anxiety at work  in her -- a catch in the voice, a tendon that involuntary leaps out of her neck  during a cross-examination, a breakdown in her car where she weeps from every  facial orifice.  </P> <P> The performance is both detailed and gradually built up. When she suffers a  crucial betrayal at the end, her voice sounds like that of a small animal whose  back has been broken. If the definition of a first-rate intelligence is the  ability to hold opposing ideas in mind and still function, the test of a  first-rate performance is the ability to play the opposing emotions of love and  hate and show how human tragedy is the expression of their closeness.  </P> <P> It's going to be a close call for the men this year, but Isabelle Adjani and  Michelle Pfeiffer have to figure in the long odds for Best Actress. Adjani, who  has an ethereal dewiness that often shows up in young French beauties (maybe  it's the vegetables) offers some piquant moments in "Camille Claudel," in which  she plays a promising sculptress undone by an affair with a feckless August  Rodin -- and she certainly gets this year's Susan Hayward Award for the  fall-down, bust-out Big Scene. But "Camille Claudel" is a dull French  picture-book movie that smothers everyone's energy with commemorative  dutifulness.  </P> <P> In "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Pfeiffer plays a laconic tough-talking lounge  singer to the dual cocktail piano team of Jeff and Beau Bridges. In concert  she's a throwback to those slinky Hollywood chanteuses of the '40s, but how she  came by her contemporary smarts is impossible to fathom, as is the background  for her crusty passivity. It's not Pfeiffer's fault that all she's been given  to play is a couple of attitudes. That she can parlay them into an Oscar  nomination is a tribute to her skill.  </P> <P> Who should win? For degree of difficulty, Jessica Lange and Kenneth Branagh.  </P> <P> Who will win? Jessica Tandy, because this is probably Hollywood's last chance  to honor a long career in which everything she did turned into music. Tom  Cruise, because right now America's Number One pinup boy can do no wrong. There  is, however, a lot of late action moving on Morgan Freeman, and on Daniel  Day-Lewis as well, for having done the impossible.  </P></p>

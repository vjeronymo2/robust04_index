			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK construction Persimmon's comments on August house sales provided some cheer for its shares yesterday, but they still ended 20p below the rights issue price in March. Since then hopes of a sustained recovery in the housing market have been dashed. The sharp rise in the cost of fixed-rate mortgages and talk of the need for higher short-term rates stopped the improvement in its tracks in June and July. Persimmon's report of a pick-up in August confirms comments from other housebuilders but even these tentative signs have not been mirrored in the overall housing transaction figures. While housebuilders with the right products are having little trouble making sales the problem with the second-hand market is the dearth of decent supply. This in turn seems to be driven by the lack of house price inflation which has removed any sense of urgency from the market. The low level of house moves partly explains the depressed repair, maintenance and improvement activity which was highlighted by the weak sales of bagged cement reported by Rugby yesterday. But there appears to be more to it than that. Stagnant prices may have made householders question the value of adding that extension. Such penny-pinching has prolonged the price war among the do-it-yourself sheds which has brought continued deflation for consumer building products. But with many of the sector's raw materials prices on the increase suppliers like Spring Ram are having to keep hacking away at costs just to stand still. Without an uptick in house prices the sector's recovery could soon run out of steam.</p>

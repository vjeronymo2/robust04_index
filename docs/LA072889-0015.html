			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIELD HAND FUDGES WITH INS FOR SAKE OF FAMILY, LANDS IN JAIL  </P> <P> Manuel Acosta Robles is a hard-working, religious field hand from Mexico who  was dedicated to improving the life of his wife and two children, according to  the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> "His family always came first," said Rudy S. Garcia, an INS special agent in  Calexico.  </P> <P> But, according to the INS, Acosta's fealty to his family has now landed the  34-year-old Imperial County resident in jail. Acosta is serving a 90-day jail  term at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego for a conviction  arising from his ill-fated attempt to gain legal entry for his family.  </P> <P> Once the sentence is completed, the INS says, Acosta and his family will  probably be returned to Mexico.  </P> <P> As happens so often, the Acosta family was divided by the often-traumatic  immigration process. He tried to mend the division, but the INS says he  violated the law.  </P> <P> The INS provided the following version of his case:  </P> <P> Acosta was admitted to the United States legally in late 1980, based on a  petition filed by one of his parents who was a legal U. S. resident. However,  Acosta told the INS at the time that he was single, and for a good reason: he  could not have been admitted under immigration laws if he had acknowledged  being married.  </P> <P> In fact, the INS says, Acosta was married in Mexico in 1978.  </P> <P> In January, 1988, the INS says, Acosta submitted an application to become a U.  S. citizen. As a citizen, he could legally bring his wife and children into the  United States within a year.  </P> <P> Acosta probably could have qualified for citizenship, the INS says, but he was  caught in a contradiction. As part of the application process, he submitted a  copy of his marriage certificate, demonstrating that he had actually been  married when he told the INS he was single.  </P> <P> Charged with making false statements to the INS, Acosta agreed to plead guilty  Monday to a single count of entering the United States illegally.  </P></p>

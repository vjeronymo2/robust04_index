			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Rover to cut Metro numbers ROVER GROUP is to end night-shift production of Metros at Longbridge to bring output more into line with demand in the UK's currently depressed market for new cars. It is also to reduce output of the Rover 200/400 range from 4,500 a week to 4,250, John Grifffiths writes. Both cuts will start when Longbridge's 15,000 employees return to work after the Christmas break. There will be no lay-offs and the 1,800 Metro night workers will be re-assigned to an expanded Metro day shift and other tasks. The net effect will be to reduce Metro output by about 15 per cent to 1,650 cars a week. Yesterday Rover said the lower output levels would be indefinite but under constant review. Rover's decision has been influenced by the continued depressed state of UK demand and the weakening of several continental markets. Rover's introduction of a 'lean' distribution system, in which the holding of large stocks by dealers has been discontinued, has also been a factor.</p>

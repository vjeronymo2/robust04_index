			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht debate curtailed OPPOSITION MPs and Tory Euro-sceptics claimed a tactical victory last night after ministers decided not to try to continue debate on the Maastricht bill into the early hours of this morning. Instead of arranging for the debate to run late in order to make progress on the legislation, the government ended the sixth day of detailed discussion of the bill at the usual time. This contrasted with Monday night when a marathon session of debate had run on well into Tuesday morning. While Labour wanted to ensure that the European social dimension is discussed at a sensible time today, the Euro-sceptics were content to have caused a delay. Earlier they pointed out there was no need to rush, since the final Commons stage would not be until after the second Danish referendum. Tory Euro-enthusiasts dismissed the rebels' success as a 'pyrrhic victory', but Mr Michael Spicer, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, said the government would have been defeated if it had tried to continue the debate. Mr George Robertson, Labour's European affairs spokesman, said the move was a good example of organised and constructive opposition. In the wake of last night's co-operation there was hope among some MPs that Labour and the Euro-sceptics might combine today over a Labour amendment to exclude the protocol on the social chapter, which contains the UK's opt-out. Labour put this forward because it objects to the opt-out but some Euro-sceptics argue that they should support the amendment because it would wreck the bill.</p>

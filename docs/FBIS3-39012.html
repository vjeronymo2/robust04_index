			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Schmitt: "More Problems for the </F> Bundesbank"]    [Text] Trade in foreign exchange is insecure. After the  United States increased interests, the dollar abruptly jumped up  three pfennigs. Since then, however, it has remained at 1.76  German marks [DM]. Once more, rumors are spreading that the  Bundesbank intervened in the market to slow down the rise of the  dollar. There was no indication of it in the past few days but  even the possibility seems to somewhat restrain the market.  <H5>  Further Upswing for Dollar Likely </H5>   The Bundesbank is probably happy with this reaction. The  protectors of our mark want to force short-term interests  further down, and a major devaluation of the German mark  vis-a-vis the most important currency in the world would not fit  into this concept. Nevertheless, the Central Bank Council will  probably have to put up with another revaluation of the dollar.  The U.S. economy is simply growing too vigorously at the  moment. Moreover, the chance for higher U.S. interests will  lure money from Germany across the Atlantic. Dollar rates of  DM1.80-1.85 this year have become more likely.    A strong dollar does not prevent a further loosening of  monetary policy in Germany, and thus in most countries in West  Europe. Yet it is certainly an obstacle. For the Bundesbank it  will become more difficult to find the right moment for the next  small step. The decisive factor will be how quickly the dollar  is now revalued. A rapid increase in leaps would be dangerous,  as this process might easily get out of hand. If, however, the  markets are prepared and the dollar moves within narrow margins,  then the next interest cut might be less dramatic.    Thus, it was a wise decision for the Bundesbank to advertise  the next securities repurchase agreement, again at a fixed  interest of 6 percent. This calms down the market, gives the  German mark some respite, and once more proves the Bundesbank's  commitment to stability. Since 2 December, the rate for money  market transactions has been constant, and the discount rate has  been stable since 21 October.    Since last Thursday there has been no news regarding the  third key rate; individual participants in the market speculated  with an interest tender. This procedure would have given banks  the chance to force down the pension rate through their tender  behavior. Yet, the Bundesbank obviously did not want to give a  signal for lower prime rates shortly after interests went up in  the United States.    The other side of this policy is that the longer the Central  Bank Council waits, the more pressure on it will increase -- at  home, in case the domestic economy does not rebound, and in  terms of foreign policy through the partner countries that want  to get out of the recession with cheap money. France, Belgium,  and Denmark in particular, tied their prime rates so quickly  again to the German level that they cannot do anything without  the Bundesbank. Solo actions like those of spring 1993 are not  possible this time. The members of the European Monetary System  [EMS] learned their lesson from last July's crisis, that the  markets punish a lack of stability awareness through devaluation.    Although the dilemma of the Bundesbank is understood, hope  in  neighboring countries for further interest cuts remains almost  undisturbed. The reason for it is invariably seen by market  participants in the poor economy and high unemployment in almost  all European Union [EU] countries. Evidence that the change in  U.S. interests is not applicable to Europe was supplied by two  EU members earlier this week. On Monday, Belgium defied the  turbulences on the financial markets and cut its monetary market  interests, albeit only by narrow margin.  <H5>  EMS Members Are Waiting for Action in Frankfurt </H5>   On Tuesday [8 February] the Bank of England followed with a  slight reduction of its basic lending rate. Politicians are  waiting, and the markets speculate with further steps by the  central banks -- in Britain as well as almost everywhere else in  West Europe. In the EMS, Italy, Spain, and Portugal may still  have some room to maneuver for an independent policy. Everybody  else must hope for action in Frankfurt.</p>

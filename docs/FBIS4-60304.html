			<p>BFN     [Text] The General Secretariat of the Liberation Front  Party has cabled Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and members of the council, the  speaker and members of the House of Representatives Speakership  Council, and the Cabinet, to denounce the secession declared by  the war criminal and traitor al-Bid and his clique. The message  dubbed the move a grievous crime and high treason as well as  being in clear violation of the popularly-endorsed constitution.  The secession was also described as a brazen deviation from the  aims and principles of the Yemeni revolution for which droves of  martyrs have fallen. This criminal action, the cable read, is  the latest in a series of acts of sabotage, intrigues, and  treason typical of the secessionist circle in the Socialist  Party.</p>

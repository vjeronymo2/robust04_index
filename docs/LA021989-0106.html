			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DILEMMA: WHICH WAY SHOULD AMERICA GO?  </P> <P> In my early marriage I had two miscarriages. In the first, at the first sign of  something wrong, my doctor rushed me to the hospital for a D &amp; C (dilation  and curettage), and afterward I never questioned him further.  </P> <P> The second time, at the first spotting, my doctor instructed me to go to bed,  raise the foot of the bed and stay there until the danger passed.  </P> <P> One night I had a bearing-down urge. I aborted my 3-month fetus.  </P> <P> I have read in your columns so many erroneous concepts of fetuses that I felt  this letter was overdue.  </P> <P> My 3-month-old fetus was very definitely a baby, with a large head and not  fully formed fingers and toes. It was unmistakably a male child.  </P> <P> When I finally had a successful pregnancy, between 4 and 4 1/2 months I could  feel the movement of my baby, and the doctor could hear his heartbeat. Within 2  weeks he was definitely kicking, and we could watch my stomach and follow his  head as he turned over within me.  </P> <P> So, how does one decide when it becomes murder to kill this baby?  </P> <P> LUCILLE GLASSMAN  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

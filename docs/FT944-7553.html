			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sold on self-regulation - The advertising code gets a new look in January Advertisers in Britain will be able to start the New Year by tearing up the old rule book which governs what they can and cannot say in their copy. A new version of the detailed codes which underpin non-broadcast advertising's system of self-regulation (television and radio have their own rules) will still require advertisements to be legal, decent, honest and truthful. But from January, the rules which flesh out these principles will be shorter, sharper, and more in tune with the current demands of the marketplace. This thorough overhaul of the advertising codes will be watched in other countries. Britain's Advertising Standards Authority is playing a leading part in arguing for the principle of self-regulation of advertising throughout the European Union, as well as advising eastern European countries on how to set up their own systems. The new combined British codes of advertising and sales promotion practice, which until now have been separate documents, will, for the first time, set out rules in two areas where there have been profound changes in public attitudes since the formation of the codes more than 30 years ago: motoring and the environment. The wording has yet to be approved, but it is likely that the code will outlaw car and fuel advertisements which encourage 'anti-social' behaviour or make speed or acceleration claims their main message. Advertisers will be prevented from depicting vehicles in dangerous situations or in a way which would encourage irresponsible driving. On the environment, terms such as 'environmentally friendly' and 'wholly biodegradable' will have to be qualified. Advertisers will need to make it clear if there is a division of scientific opinion, or if the evidence for an environmental claim is inconclusive. 'Extravagant' language and obscure scientific terms likely to mislead people will also be discouraged. A third, less material, addition will be the inclusion of a 'politically-correct' catch-all phrase. Advertisers will have to take care not to cause offence on the grounds of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or disability. The rest of the revision includes simplifying the language and sweeping away defunct clauses. Out, for example, goes a section in the code on 'height increase courses' which bans advertisements for the 'development of the physique' from suggesting that 'thereby, users will become taller'. These kinds of advertisement, like miraculous 'bust development' courses, are no longer the prominent feature of the advertising columns they once were. 'People were ploughing through quite a number of rules to get to the ones they wanted,' says Matti Alderson, ASA director-general explaining a general feeling that much of the code was no longer relevant. 'One of the objectives of the review was to emphasise those rules that were most important.' There is some risk that, in the process of simplification and wider definitions, the rules will become too lax in some areas, argues Stephen Locke, director of policy with Consumers' Association, one of the bodies consulted during the year-long examination of the codes. 'On motoring, for example, there's a reference to adverts for cars avoiding any practices that are anti-social. But it's not clear what they mean by anti-social - we'd like to see examples in this kind of area,' he says. CA put forward a number of suggestions for changes in the way the ASA operates, none of which has so far been accepted. Among them was a requirement that the ASA accept telephone complaints - at present these have to be written - and the introduction of tougher sanctions against repeated offenders. CA would like to see a system of fines available for use in extreme circumstances: at the moment the ASA relies chiefly on adverse publicity and help from publishers and the postal service to enforce the code. But overall, it is in consumers' interests that advertising is regulated by the industry, says Locke: 'It's widely seen as a success story. There's no doubt we get more out of self-regulation than we would out of statutory regulation, not least because it can be more flexible and give the benefit of the doubt to complainants - it doesn't have to be legalistic in its approach.' Advertisers are certainly keen to keep the legislators at bay. In a speech on advertising freedoms, due to be delivered at Leeds University tonight, Peter Mitchell, Guinness's strategic affairs director and president of the World Federation of Advertisers, argues that self-regulation 'has the ability to be speedy, cost-efficient, effective and available at no charge to the complainant'. Self-regulation must continue to work well, 'otherwise the public perception that advertising is legal, decent, honest and truthful begins to decline' and the pressure for intensified regulation would grow, says Mitchell. The ASA is convinced that Brussels recognises the value of self-regulation and will, in general, try to avoid imposing centralised, harmonising legislation on the industry. The Brussels-based European Advertising Standards Alliance, which co-ordinates 18 self-regulatory bodies across the EU, plus Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, has stressed to the European Commission that attempts to harmonise would be unwise. Instead, Oliver Gray, EASA director-general, sees 'over time a convergence of principles of self-regulation'. The self-regulation message is also spreading east. A joint EASA/ASA team has visited Prague to help set up a council for the self-regulation of advertising in the Czech Republic, and there have also been requests for help in setting up codes from Poland, Slovenia and Latvia, says Gray.</p>

Yeltsin"]    [Text] The text of the Constitution put to the referendum  on 12 December 1993 revives the authoritarian system in the  Russian Federation. Granting the president dictatorial powers,  the Constitution leaves Russia defenseless in the face of the  ill will or caprice of both its present and future rulers.    The most flagrant violations of the 1978 Constitution (Basic  Law) of the Russian Federation (with subsequent revisions) and  the 1990 Referendum Act were perpetrated at the time of the  referendum on the draft Constitution.    According to the 1978 Constitution, a referendum may be held  only in the procedure established by the Constitution and laws  of the Russian Federation (Article 5). The referendum on  adoption of the Constitution of 12 December 1993 was conducted  in the manner established by a subordinate edict of an official.    According to the Russian Federation Referendum Act, it is  essential for the adoption of a constitution or revisions to the  Constitution to obtain a majority vote of the total electorate.  The Constitution was "approved" by the votes of less than  one-third of those eligible to vote.    Serious violations were perpetrated also in the organization  of the referendum itself.    The election commissions formed by the executive, which  substituted for the legitimately elected authorities, spoke in  support of the Constitution and thereby called into question the  objectivity of the vote count.    In consideration of what has been said, we declare that:    The Constitution of 12 December 1993 cannot be deemed  legitimate or valid.    The Federal Assembly elected on the basis of Edict No. 1400  is operative, as specified by the president, until the adoption  of a new Constitution of Russia.    The Constitution should be elaborated and adopted by a  constituent assembly, a law on the elections for which should be  adopted by the Federal Assembly.    We see this as the sole possible way to the building of a  genuinely democratic and just constitutional system.    Signatories to the statement: V. Aksyuchits, M. Astafyev, S.  Baburin, V.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Apr (EFE) -- The Argentine  Telecommunications Commission (CNT) reported today that  Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, the four member  countries of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) are  seeking to coordinate the transmission power and frequencies of  television stations in border areas.    The CNT communique states that the rules and regulations  under study will be used to control the activities of 100 open  television channels that transmit on the borders of the four  countries.    During a technical meeting that was held at the beginning of  this week in Buenos Aires, delegates of the Mercosur member  countries evaluated the creation of procedures to "coordinate  the transmission of power and the high and medium frequencies."    The CNT reported that, according to Mercosur, the rules and  regulations must be drafted by 30 June 1994 although "the  technical details for the drafting of the final document that  will be signed by the four presidents in December 1994 have yet  to be approved."    The 18 April meeting was the fifth conference of Mercosur  members to implement a mechanism "so that each country will have  guidelines to establish, together with their neighbors, open and  coded television channels."</p>

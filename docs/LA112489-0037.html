"The food was mainly Moroccan and included a  wonderful couscous salad. I've spent quite a bit of time remembering,  recreating and retasting this light salad. Now that I've got it, I serve it as  part of a buffet or as a main dish with crusty bread and light beverage."  </P> <P> COUSCOUS SALAD  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups bulgur or couscous  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups boiling water  </P> <P> 1 cup diced peeled carrots  </P> <P> 1 green or red sweet pepper, diced  </P> <P> 1 cup frozen peas  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped red or green onions  </P> <P> 2/3 cup currants  </P> <P> 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted  </P> <P> 1/2 cup oil  </P> <P> 1/4 cup lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons orange juice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Place bulgur in large bowl and pour boiling water over it.

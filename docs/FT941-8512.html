			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Japan fights for right blend of foreign rice With the first bags of foreign rice hitting Japan's supermarket shelves, worries about the best way to serve it have overshadowed concern that the Japanese way of life and its cultural values might be threatened. Shoppers in Tokyo are being offered foreign rice for the first time because a shortage of domestic rice has prompted emergency imports. For Japan, the question of rice imports has created political problems at home and abroad. Local farmers have protested, and the determination to keep foreign rice out, at one stage, threatened the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. In the end, typhoons and a cold summer last year ruined the local rice harvest and forced the government into allowing imports. Officially, Japan has until next year before it opens the country's rice market to foreign imports. The emergency imports - a total of 2m tonnes - are from the US, China, Australia and Thailand. Imported rice will account for over 70 per cent of the rice marketed in the next three to four months. The government wants wholesalers and retailers to blend Japanese and foreign rice, rather than sell it on its own. Householders have been scrambling for advice on the ideal ratio of foreign to Japanese rice and the past few weeks have seen even the serious news channels airing taste tests on sushi made with Thai long grain rice and California Rose. Will it be Californian seven to Thai three ma'am, or Japanese three to Australian two and Chinese five? At the same time, consumers have also been confronted with reports of mouldy rice imported from California and packets of fungicides and pesticides marked with skull and cross bones, used to treat imported rice. 'The negative coverage in the newspapers and television makes me very scared,' says Mrs Sonoko Yoshimura, a 42-year-old housewife whose family of five consumes 11 pounds of rice every month. She adds that the older generation, including her 69-year-old mother, sensitive about how her daily rice tastes, will probably not take to foreign rice. However while farmers grind their teeth at the sight of Japanese purity mixed with imports, businesses have quickly adjusted, turning public concerns of poor quality and taste of foreign rice into a marketing opportunity. Food companies are now rushing to sell tablets which make foreign rice taste better when popped into the pot together, and special vinegars for sushi made with foreign rice. Matsushita Electric Industrial, the leading consumer electronics company and largest maker of electric rice cookers, has also been bombarded with calls on how to cook imported blends. It is advising consumers to wash and soak foreign rice longer than normal Japanese rice and hopes to develop a rice cooker for foreign rice once it finds which rice blend best suits the Japanese palate. But some consumers are willing to put xenophobia and prejudice aside for cheaper prices. Seiyu, a leading supermarket chain, was shocked to see 2.5 tonnes of California rice - priced at half of that of Japanese rice - disappear in a matter of hours. 'They were queueing up for it because it's just as good and half as expensive,' says Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador, stressing that US brands are easily accepted if there are no barriers.</p>

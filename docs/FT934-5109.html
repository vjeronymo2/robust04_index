			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Statutory audit ends for small companies - Audit exemptions Up to half a million companies will be exempted from the need for an annual statutory audit, under proposals unveiled by the Chancellor yesterday. Mr Kenneth Clarke announced in his Budget speech that all of the 300,000 companies with a turnover below Pounds 90,000 will no longer require any external verification of their accounts. He also said 'most' companies with a turnover of between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 350,000 - totalling a further 200,000 businesses - will in future only require an independent accountant's report to verify that the accounts correctly reflect its books. The new procedures will replace a mandatory audit by a regulated auditor of all of the more than 1m limited liability companies in the UK demanded by current legislation. The action follows substantial lobbying for reform by small business organisations and much of the accountancy profession itself. They argued that the audit was costly and nonsensical. But the exemption limits proposed by Mr Clarke are much higher than expected: Pounds 350,000 a year is the threshold for cash accounting under the VAT system. A consultation document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry in April suggested lifting the requirement for companies below the value added tax registration threshold, currently a turnover of Pounds 37,600 a year. The Inland Revenue previously opposed removal of the audit, but officials were persuaded under Treasury pressure that they did not place much greater reliance on audited accounts than the equivalent unaudited figures from unincorporated businesses of similar size. Mr Henry Gold, technical director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which called for abolition of the audit for companies with turnover below Pounds 350,000, said: 'We are delighted the government has gone all the way. This . . . brings us a bit closer in line with just about everyone else in the world.' The change will prove unpopular with credit-rating agencies and other users of financial information who have said that they rely on a full audit to verify company accounts. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which has many members acting as accountants to small companies, said last night: 'We are concerned that removal of the audit requirement will also remove accountability for some organisations. We believe that this may give rise to concerns with regard to the public interest.' The DTI is expected to issue further details of the proposals early next year. Its consultative document in the spring came after two attempts in the past few years to remove or relax the small company audit requirement.</p>

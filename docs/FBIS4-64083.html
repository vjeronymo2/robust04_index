			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The results of a public  opinion poll conducted by the "Mnenie" sociological service  showed that every second respondent considers the financial  status of his family to be not very good. A total of 17 per  cent of respondents said they can hardly make both ends meet,  while only three per cent are quite satisfied with their incomes  and 27 per cent admitted that their incomes are relatively not  bad.    The majority of these polled (65 per cent) said that five  years ago they lived much better. A total of 22 per cent said  that their incomes had grown, while 11 per cent believe that  their incomes remained at about the same level.    Almost half of respondents (47 per cent) resolutely declined  to make any forecasts about their future incomes. The number of  optimists hoping that in five years their life will change for  the better makes up about 27 per cent, with 6 per cent  cherishing hopes of getting rich. However, 13 per cent cherish  no such hopes and are preparing to tighten their belts.    Taking part in the poll were 3,535 respondents from 190  Russian settlements located in 30 regions of the Russian  Federation.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Guidelines may be set up for human genetics research THE government is considering establishing a national policy on human genetics - an area in which research is moving very quickly and raising important social, regulatory and industrial issues. The policy could include guidelines to cover controversial areas such as patenting human genes and preventing discrimination against potential carriers of genetic diseases. It could also lay down a strategy to enable industry, particularly drug companies, to benefit as much as possible from genetic research. Professor Bill Stewart, the government chief scientist, has held a preliminary meeting with the research directors of leading drug companies, medical charities and the government's Medical Research Council to exchange ideas on what might be done. The Office of Science and Technology has decided that genetics is an important area of science which could benefit from such a co-ordinated approach. The office was set up after the election with Mr William Waldegrave as minister in charge. If the move is successful, it could be a blueprint for similar action by the office in other fields. Researchers are discovering thousands of new human genes every year. Within 15 years they expect to have decoded all of the 100,000 genes which provide the blueprint for human development from the foetus to old age. They are developing tests to diagnose genetic defects that predispose people to illness - and are beginning to find ways to correct defects through 'gene therapy'. The issues covered by the Office of Science and Technology review are likely to include: Ethics: how to protect the rights of individuals and families who are carrying genes that predispose them to serious diseases such as cancer. Legislation may be needed to outlaw 'genetic discrimination' by employers and insurers. Ownership: the terms under which researchers can patent human genes and exploit them commercially. The Medical Research Council has followed the controversial lead of the US National Institutes of Health in applying for pre-emptive patents on thousands of genes whose function is not yet known. Research: how to co-ordinate programmes in the UK with similar efforts elsewhere. The country's leading genetic research centre is likely to be the Pounds 50m Sanger Centre, which the research council and Wellcome Trust are setting up near Cambridge. Dr Richard Sykes, research director of Glaxo, said that from the pharmaceutical industry's point of view, 'a key issue is how we can access and manipulate the tremendous amounts of information generated about human genes to fight disease'.</p>

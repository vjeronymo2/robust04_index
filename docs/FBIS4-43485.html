			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Improves Record on Adopting </F> European Union Laws"]    [Text] (ANSA) Luxembourg, June 6 -- Italy has greatly  improved its record of adopting European Union [EU] laws and  regulations and, with an adoption rate of 89.9 percent, now  ranks fourth among the Member States for turning European Union  into national law, according to the executive European  Commissioner for the Single Market, Italy's Raniero Vanni  d'Archirafi.    Denmark ranked first for adopting European Union law for  having made its own 96 percent of European legislature, followed  by Portugal with a 91 percent rate, the Netherlands at 90  percent and then Italy.    Observers pointed out how Denmark and Portugal, with  sixth-ranked Britain, were considered the greatest  "Euro-skeptics," while Germany, viewed as the locomotive for  European integration was third to last in adopting European  Union laws, at a rate of 83 percent, while France stood at 87  percent, fourth-to-last.    In an address to ministers responsible for European affairs,  for Italy Domenico Comino, Vanni d'Archirafi announced how the  European Commission had decided to "go on the warpath" to speed  up the transformation of European Union law into national law.  The EU executive, he said, was considering adopting, from now  on, penalties and sanctions for the delays, as provided for in  the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.</p>

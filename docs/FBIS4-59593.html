			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, Yemeni oil </F> minister and envoy of Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  to President al-Asad; date not given; from "Weekly File" program  -- recorded]    [Text] We as Yemenis, as well as the brother Syrians and  all Arabs, regret this event and these problems. The crisis  continued for more than nine months and it was possible to solve  it politically within the framework of the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee, especially after this committee succeeded in  drafting the pledge and accord document, which was considered  the document of national consensus. It was possible to begin  implementing this document and consequently resolve the crisis  and reactivate the work of various bodies. However,  regrettably, what happened was the opposite of what we expected.  At a time when the various Yemeni groups were signing the  agreement, the al-'Amaliqah forces began the battle against the  Abyan and Aden Governorates. Consequently, it was clear to us  that there were those who did not wish to implement the  agreement, particularly the military forces in northern Yemen.  The next step was the liquidation of units that moved from the  south to the north, beginning with the 5th Brigade of the Sufyan  Guards and then the 3d Armored Brigade in 'Imran. The battle  then spread on a large scale to Dhamar and raged on five axes in  the direction of Aden.    The war was imposed on the Socialist Party and, regrettably,  the nationalist Yemeni forces. However, the political  leadership in the Socialist Party, in coordination with the  Political Forces Dialogue Committee, continues to announce to  all Yemeni, Arab, and international public the need to stop the  war before anything else and return to dialogue. The language  of (?force) at the present international circumstances cannot  solve any problem; dialogue is the right way to solve political  problems. The battle is now taking place on five axes.  Yesterday, a new axis was opened at Bab el Mandeb. This is  detrimental both to Yemen and to international navigation. I  heard from news agencies that the People's Congress has forces  about 3 km from Aden. This is untrue and the northern and  southern forces are engaged in battles 100 km from Aden.</p>

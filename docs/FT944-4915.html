			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Big Indian companies expect rise in profits India's top 25 private sector companies are expected to report net profits rising by an average of 60 per cent in 1994-95, with infrastructure and construction concerns leading the way, Reuter reports from Bombay. Analysts also forecast net sales to rise by an average 32 per cent for the current year, according to a poll of 16 securities houses conducted by Reuter. 'India's liberalisation programme seems to be bearing fruit,' said Mr Asit Mehta of Nucleus Securities. 'The tiger is coming out of the cage.' The rise in sales is being triggered by the government's market-oriented reform programme, which has removed many barriers and obstacles to growth and raised manufacturing capacity. Economists expect India's industrial production in 1994-95 to more than double to 7 to 8 per cent and the economy to grow by around 5.5 per cent. Analysts say a rise in disposable income will lead to higher demand for consumer durables and cars. Falling interest rates and increased borrowing through domestic and Euro-issues has helped companies cut their financing costs. Over 50 companies have raised Dollars 4.8bn since the first Indian company tapped the overseas markets in mid-1992. Associated Cement Companies, India's largest cement producer, topped the poll with a projected 177 per cent rise in its net profit to Rs1.68bn (Dollars 53.5m) for the year ending March 1995. Analysts say that a boom in the infrastructure sector and construction activity has led to rapid growth in demand for cement.</p>

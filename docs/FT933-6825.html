			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Northam hit by mine production shortfalls FAILURE to achieve production targets was blamed for an accumulated loss of R47.1m (Dollars 14m) for the year ended June at Northam, the platinum mine in the Gold Fields group. Northam, which raised R350m through a rights issue last January, has been forced to seek further funding. The mine has so far cost R1.5bn to bring to production. Mr John Hopwood, chairman, blamed the mine's problems on the fact that it had been operating at milling rates of around 80,000 tonnes per month, against a target of 150,000 tonnes. He said the situation was improving. The milling rate rose to 100,000 tonnes in July, and another increase in August looked likely. He said target milling rates should be reached by the middle of this financial year.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILIES GET TIPS ON COPING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DURING HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> The elderly Hollywood man was talking about Thanksgiving at a recent workshop  on helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease during the holidays.  </P> <P> "The holidays are great," said the man, 80, who takes care of his  Alzheimer's-afflicted wife of 51 years. Thanksgiving is not only good for the  person with the disease, he said, "it's also good for the care-giver because it  gives them a chance to relax with other people."  </P> <P> The man smiled. And then he burst into tears.  </P> <P> The holidays are often hellish for families dealing with Alzheimer's and other  conditions that produce dementia or loss of cognitive abilities.  </P> <P> The Hollywood man, for instance, was uncertain whether he and his spouse would  be able to join their son in San Diego for Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> His wife has been suffering from a bladder infection recently, and her  progressive brain disorder is constantly producing new deficits and  complications. Since she became ill, the woman is anxious whenever she travels.  Her husband worried that the unfamiliar pounding of the wheels of the train  would unnerve her.  </P> <P> It is almost too much to bear, especially alone, the man made clear. When you  have Alzheimer's in the family, he said before his tears drove him from the  room in embarrassment, "everybody walks away."  </P> <P> At a recent workshop in Century City, the Los Angeles chapter of the  Alzheimer's Assn. and the Westside Consortium of Senior Services offered  Alzheimer's care-givers practical advice and the bitter solace of knowing that  others are suffering too.  </P> <P> "The holidays are often a very joyful time, but they can also be very, very  difficult," said Lynn Morishita, program director for the Center for Geriatric  Health at Century City Hospital.  </P> <P> The grown-up children of people with Alzheimer's routinely feel cheated, the  experts said. The children gather around the table, remembering when mom or dad  successfully stage-managed beloved holiday traditions, and they see only loss.  </P> <P> "Holidays carry a lot of emotional wallop," said Nina Luce, a Santa Monica  marriage and family counselor who specializes in geriatric issues. "We remember  how it was and, if we don't get it, we're crushed."  </P> <P> Holidays often precipitate a crisis among siblings, the speakers pointed out.  Family members who live elsewhere often come home for the holidays only to  discover that a parent or grandparent is much worse than they had realized from  long-distance phone calls. Brothers and sisters sometimes blame the sibling who  does most of the care-giving, who in turn typically feels overburdened.  </P> <P> The experts agreed that a good first step in dealing with Alzheimer's is to  have a family consultation with a caseworker or someone else with expertise in  dementia and the medical, emotional and legal problems it creates. The earlier  the family begins to think about these issues, the better, they said. For  example, Jewish Family Service, Santa Monica, is a nonprofit agency that  provides such services to anyone on a sliding fee scale.  </P> <P> The experts also recommended that the family arrange to have the affected  individual evaluated at a good geriatric health center. Some of the  deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's are treatable, they said. For example,  better diet may help a little. "A lot of older people are living on toast and  tea," Luce pointed out. A complete evaluation will not only reveal what's wrong  with the affected person, it will also help the family take full advantage of  those abilities that remain, Morishita said.  </P> <P> Two sisters at the workshop admitted that they dreaded the thought of  Thanksgiving. They planned to fly to Arizona, where they were to have a turkey  dinner with their father, then visit their mother, 66, who has been  institutionalized with Alzheimer's for almost a decade.  </P> <P> "It's real depressing," the younger sister said. "They have all these cards and  ads on TV, and they just make you feel worse."  </P> <P> Morishita said such sadness is normal. The person with dementia "is here, but  they are not the person they were." Their loved ones, she said, "are grieving  all the time."  </P> <P> One reason the holidays are so difficult is that they underscore the role  reversal that is one of the most painful aspects of dealing with dementia.  </P> <P> As Joyce Brunelle, who does public relations for the Westside consortium, said:  "Two things that life never prepares us for are parenting and parenting our own  parent." Unfortunately, she noted, the intense emotion that Alzheimer's  triggers in a family often complicates the coping process, which involves  making difficult decisions about everything from where the patient will live to  who will control his or her money.  </P> <P> "You have to be very practical at this stage," Brunelle said. "You have to be  very dispassionate about it."  </P> <P> The speakers urged care-givers to give themselves a break over the holidays.  Less is more, the experts said. Don't try to replicate the lavish holidays of  the past, but pick a few favorite traditions and concentrate on them.  Simplified holiday activities are also easier on the person with Alzheimer's,  who is often unsettled by changes in routine and unusual bustle and clutter.  </P> <P> Start to prepare the affected person for the upcoming holiday well in advance  by marking the calendar, having daily discussions of what the family will do,  playing holiday music and, when feasible, making holiday foods.  </P> <P> As Thanksgiving gives way to Hanukkah and Christmas, gifts become a problem.  </P> <P> People with dementia often enjoy videotapes of family members, the experts  said. And Brunelle noted that some people like to give a donation in the name  of the person with Alzheimer's to a charity that was especially important to  him or her before life changed forever.  </P> <P> </P> <P> At the Alzheimer's workshop, occupational therapist Laura Caron-Parker offered  these tips for holiday safety and stress reduction:  </P> <P> * Remember that a Hanukkah menorah and candles on a holiday table are potential  dangers to the person with Alzheimer's. Put all matches and lighters away after  using. If you can child-proof your house for the holidays, you can make it safe  for the person with dementia, Caron-Parker said.  </P> <P> * Use only unbreakable ornaments on the Christmas tree and hang them with  ribbon, not metal hooks. Remember that such traditional holiday plants as  poinsettia and mistletoe are poisonous if ingested.  </P> <P> * Avoid blinking holiday lights. They seem to increase the confusion and  agitation of people with dementia. Shiny, reflective wrapping paper that causes  visual distortions also seems to have this effect and should be avoided.  </P> <P> * Gifts should be kept out of sight until they are exchanged. Left under the  tree or elsewhere in the open, they increase visual clutter. The person with  Alzheimer's may also open gifts that are left out, no matter who they are meant  for.  </P> <P> * Limit the number of holiday visitors, prepare them for the changes they will  see in the affected person, and schedule their visits for morning and early  afternoon, when people with dementia are usually at their best.  </P></p>

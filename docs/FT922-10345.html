			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent subdued ahead of the May Day holiday Trading was subdued ahead of the closure of many bourses today for the May Day holiday. Amsterdam was closed yesterday for the Queen's Birthday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT failed to get a boost from better-than-expected inflation figures. The DAX index lost 1.88 to 1,734.03 for a 0.6 per cent fall on the week. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, was down 2.1 at 700.99, a decline of 1.4 per cent on the week.

Preussag closed down DM3.50 at DM405.50 after reporting little change in its first half 1991/92 group net profit and saying that it was confident of paying an unchanged dividend of DM10.

Hachette, Matra, MMB, and Publications Filipacchi were all suspended pending an announcement next Tuesday. Analysts said this was likely to refer to plans to restructure Hachette's capital after its heavy losses linked to La Cinq, the bankrupt television station. Details of previously released plans to merge Matra and Hachette were also expected. Paribas rose FFr2.80 to FFr431.8 following Wednesday's announcement of a reorganisation and the sale of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais. Shares in Ciments Francais remained suspended.

The Comit index eased 0.78 to 502.88, down 1.1 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's L96bn. Italcementi, Italmobiliare, and other shares in the group were briefly suspended because of their excessive falls. Italmobiliare eventually closed L4,800 or 8.9 per cent lower at L49,050 while Italcementi dropped L2,050 or 12.1 per cent to L14,850. Stet was unchanged at L2,021.

The SMI index closed up 6.0 at 1,880.2 for a 0.3 per cent gain on the week. Brown Boveri weakened as investors moved into Nestle.

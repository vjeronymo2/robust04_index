			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second and final part of interview with Forestry Minister </F> Lieutenant General Chit Swe by Yindee Lertcharoenchok in  Rangoon; date not given; question printed in boldface]    [Text]    Lertcharoenchok: How could you continue to have  nearly 50 percent forestry cover when you gave out many logging  concessions to Thai companies since late 1988 and only ended  them late last year. The figure you gave does not seem to  correspond to reality taking into account of the vast amount or  volume of wood that have been extracted from those concessioned  areas?    Chit Swe: The whole forest cover area involved in  the border concessions is only 2.6 percent of our total forest  area and besides, these forest have been more or less untouched  in the past. We gave concessions of 200,000 hoppus tons only.  We gave some concessions for four to five years to Thai  companies. Up to now a little more than 150,000 hoppus tons a  year were extracted during the peak years. When we started the  concession, the average extraction was 150,000 hoppus tons a  year along the whole stretch of the border. However since 1992  it was taken off, because all the concessions started to expire  and we did not renew them.    Now I have to see Thai friends everyday, at least one or  two.  They have got heavy commitments with foreign companies to get  the raw material in time. It is very important for them.    Lertcharoenchok: Now that these logging  concessions are gone, what are you going to do?    Chit Swe: I have never said that logging  concessions have gone. In concessioned areas we can do  something for mutual benefit. We can harvest from those areas  with our local people, but foreigners are not allowed to get  concessions.    That is why some people are asking if insurgents coming out  to legal fold, would they be entitled to the concessions. For  this, we need time to consider.    For the Burman it is not easy for them to stay in that area,  only the nationalities (ethnic minorities) stay there. To enter  into the forestry related businesses, all interested local  parties would have to deal with the central government or enter  into joint ventures with foreign partners: If the area is 100  percent secure and our forest people can go in to check every  tree, then we can consider which kind of business is suitable  for that area. We have to consider that on a case by case basis.    Lertcharoenchok: So it means that even though  foreign logging concessions have gone, the local people still  have the chance to obtain them?    Chit Swe: Yes. However, it is not easy to export  logs to other countries. Preference is given to value-added  industries. I cannot for certain say what kind of business is  good. But in general there is plenty of raw material there and  one can enter into whatever forestry-related business. In some  areas we can set up pulp and paper factories. Because of  certain tree species, some areas are good for veneer and plywood  industries.    Lertcharoenchok: Now that all logging concessions  to Thai companies have gone. [sentence as published] Would you  please say what experiences and problems you have learned from  giving out timber concessions to Thai companies?    Chit Swe: Before I gave out concessions, my  knowledge about forestry was like that of a primary student.  Now after five years experience, I can say I have a PhD. We  used to receive messages sent to us everyday from local  commanders saying they seized 3,000 (illegally felled) logs here  or 2,000 trees there, and some pointed to me saying: ``Since you  are the Forestry Minister, you are responsible for it. But I  said it came under the jurisdiction of the police and hence not  under my office.'' In Burmese we have a saying: ``If you make it  easier even for a very rich man, he still becomes a thief.'' It  is not easy to conduct checks because we are far away from the  forested areas. Because of this even a rich man can become a  poacher. That is why in some areas we give concessions to them  and at the same time put up border checkpoints. Anyhow they  still take logs from some other areas. So in many areas there  are many problems.    Lertcharoenchok: So the main problems you face  stem from illegal cuttings?    Chit Swe: Yes.    Lertcharoenchok: Even by concession companies?    Chit Swe: Some companies are very good. They do  their job systematically. But others however they have  sub-contracts and the sub-contractors further sub-contract them.  There are no checkpoints, no border police and no forest guards.    Lertcharoenchok: Roughly how many companies  received your concessions and how many are good companies?    Chit Swe: Only one third of the companies behave  well. We gave out about 42 concessions to 34 companies. Mostly  of them were not original timber business people and that is the  root cause of the problems. Of those, who tried to get  concessions, I think only 10 percent were real timber men. More  than 90 percent were not.    Lertcharoenchok: What are the real reasons for you  to stop border logging concessions? Is it because of illegal  logging or are you environmentally conscious?    Chit Swe: When we decided, it is not because of  illegal logging. It is secondary. The first is because of the  watershed. Our watershed is your watershed. For instance, the  Tenasserim Mountain is a large range and is also the watershed  of Thailand. There are also some other very high mountains in  the Tenasserim-Division. From our side it is not easy to  extract logs because of the high mountains. So if logs are cut  on our side there will be drought and flooding in your country  100. Also, people from developed countries are putting pressure.    Up to now there are no big problems with the environmental  people, but anyhow we must be very careful, because if the  population become bigger, forest cover will become lesser and  lesser.    The logging concessions are not only on the border areas but  also deeper inside the country too. Our concern is that foreign  partners would become richer and richer, but local partners  would have no change in status. Because of this we want to  encourage local people.    Lertcharoenchok: Thailand has plans to develop  several hydropower dams along the Thai-Burmese border such as  the over 6,000 Megawatt Salween Dam, and many envirommentalists  are concerned that those projects will have negative impacts on  your natural resources, mainly the forests. What is your  opinion?    Chit Swe: Now they are discussing natural gas to  Thailand through Kanchanaburi Province. The project does not  affect a big area--only a small area for the gas pipeline and  only some roads. I think there is no problem.    As for the Salween Dam, I think it is a very big project. It  has to go phase by phase. You should ask the Energy Minister.  He may be able give you some ideas.    Lertcharoenchok: Which country is the biggest  investor in your forestry industry and the biggest log buyer?    Chit Swe: I think Thai companies. When it is not  easy to get logs from the border, they come here. Thai people  have very good experience in the timber business. They buy from  our country, logs as well as other forestry products.    The Japanese are usually the highest bidders. They buy the  best quality teak and other hardwood. However, they usually  sell it later, especially hardwood, to the Taiwanese. There is  a case when a Japanese company bid highest in one tender for  some logs. We thought it was going to Japan, but it turned out  that the company sold the logs here to a Taiwanese company.  When I met the Taiwanese gentleman and asked him if he was  going to take the logs to Taiwan he said he was going to sell  the logs to China. So it is just changing hands causing the  value to go higher and higher. Because of this, we are trying  to sell directly to the real buyers.    Lertcharoenchok: Is China one of your biggest  timber buyers?    Chit Swe: No. It is Japan. The West also buys  quality teak. Fourth quality teak is bought mainly by the  Indians. They have got a very good market with the Middle East,  which we don't. Because of this we go through the Indians as  third party.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Banks warn BT to cut cost of card fraud checks BANKS and credit card companies have warned BT that they may use US telecommunications companies or Mercury, a competitor, to carry out electronic fraud checks on card purchases unless BT cuts charges substantially. The credit and debit card companies have also warned that, if they do not win lower prices for 'on-line' verification, they may install technology in shops to allow them to check for fraud without using telecommunications links. The warnings have been given in joint talks between the banks, credit card companies and BT over the price for the rapidly growing number of on-line fraud checks, which the banks believe may reach 1bn a year by 1996. BT emphasised yesterday that it intended to offer price reductions and wanted a deal that would allow the market to expand. Mr Peter Macleod, who is leading negotiations for BT, said the company was encouraging a deal based on lower prices and higher volume. He said: 'We see it as an attractive market.' Mr Macleod said BT realised that the authentication business could be offered to competitors if it did not reach a deal. Credit and debit card companies and the banks that process card transactions for retailers are worried at the growth of fraud, which cost the industry Pounds 165.6m in 1991, and an estimated 10 per cent more last year. However, fewer than one in five of last year's 1.2bn card transactions were checked for fraud via telecommunications lines, against an 85 per cent check rate in the US. Card companies blame that on the high cost of UK telecommunications. Mr Mervyn Gibson, who is leading talks for the banks and card companies, said there was 'no indication of any impasse' with BT. He said they were offering BT potential business volumes that deserved a 'substantial reduction'. Mr Gibson said the banks and card companies had 'made BT aware' of the options. These included negotiating fresh contracts with US telecommunications companies, and possibly offering some business to Mercury, BT's UK rival. BT agreed a deal with Barclays and National Westminster Bank last year that halved the cost of fraud checks via BT's network. Barclays estimates that each on-line check now costs a total of 4.5p in telecommunications charges. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays central retail services, said UK telecommunications costs were 'still very high' compared with the US, and unless they were cut, banks might opt for forms of fraud check that avoided them. He said card processing companies in France had opted for 'off-line' checks such as asking customers using cards to key in a personal identification number at the point of sale.

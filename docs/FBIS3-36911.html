Sergey Lomako, chief of the Tver radio and television  broadcasting center, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent: "Like our  colleagues in other Russian towns, we have also gone off the air  because we are not fully satisfied with the government decision  regarding our demands. To date, the television companies owe us  310 million rubles. Primarily they are Ostankino and the Second  Channel. We will be broadcasting Tver television programs  because the local company settles payments with us properly. We  await a clear decision from the government."    The communication workers of Kostroma warned of an imminent  strike yesterday. Although the information on talks at the  government brought some reassurance, broadcasts were cut.  Communication workers refused to give any interviews, saying  they were too busy.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the Belgorod radio  and television broadcasting center that the relaying of  television programs from Moscow had been halted because of  arrears for the work of radio and television transmitters. The  debt exceeds 200 million rubles.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bank move leads to Ciga shares being suspended TRADING in the shares of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels chain controlled by the Aga Khan, was suspended yesterday in a further twist to the group's long-running battle to remain afloat. The suspension, which included Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company which controls Ciga, resulted from a formal request by the subsidiary of an Italian bank following the expiry of Dollars 100m revolving credit to Fimpar. Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the public sector investment banking and credit institution has taken legal action to freeze Fimpar's assets - triggering the share suspensions by Italy's Consob companies and stockmarket watchdog. IMI's move followed the expiry earlier this month of the Dollars 100m three-year facility and failure so far to reach agreement on an extension. 'Fimpar was not aware of the initiative,' said Mr Claudio Miorelli, a Ciga official. 'We are now defining the terms of extending the facility,' he said. He played down the assets freeze as a 'formal procedural step' taken by IMI as lead manager of the syndicated credit facility.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Cross-border securities show a double appeal INCREASED globalisation of financial markets and extra demands on fund managers to squeeze out profits forced a doubling last year in cross-border securities investments in the industrialised world. According to the BIS annual report, total cross-border transfers of funds into investments such as equities and bonds last year totalled Dollars 388.7bn (Pounds 213.5bn) - roughly equivalent to Spain's GDP. This was more than double the relatively modest Dollars 159.1bn recorded in 1990, and well up on the Dollars 186bn which was the average for the years between 1985 and 1989. Last year's jump in investments, most of which were made by large banks and other financial groups, reflects an increased demand among fund managers to scout out the best opportunities for increasing profits on investments - a trend to which the poor state of the economy in many industrial countries last year may have contributed. It also reflects last year's problems in the banking sector which led to a large amount of funds being withdrawn from banks and placed in equities and bonds. The large increase in transfers may also have been assisted by last year's roller-coaster movement of the dollar against other leading currencies. The behaviour of the US currency - which appreciated heavily in the first six months of 1991 before falling back later on - may have encouraged a greater amount of switching in and out of dollar-denominated securities. Though the Japanese stock market last year performed relatively poorly, foreign investors placed a record Dollars 47bn in Japanese equities after being net sellers to the tune of Dollars 13bn the previous year. The US Federal Reserve and the German Bundesbank conducted an unusual swap arrangement last year under which the Fed sold Dollars 5.5bn-worth of D-Marks to the German central bank in an attempt to reduce the US's rapidly-growing foreign currency reserves. According to the BIS's annual report, the manoeuvre was behind a net Dollars 5.6bn fall last year in the US's reserves to Dollars 66.7bn. Last year, the Fed also arranged a similar deal with the Bank Of Japan under which it sold about Dollars 3bn-worth of yen in a further bid to cut its reserves. Taiwan's foreign currency reserves (up by Dollars 10bn to Dollars 82.4bn last year) have become the world's largest single stock of such assets. In second place are the foreign currency reserves of Japan (Dollars 72.0bn), the BIS says. Others in the top eight rank as follows: US (Dollars 66.7bn), Spain (Dollars 65.8bn), Germany (Dollars 63.0bn), Italy (Dollars 48.7bn), China (Dollars 43.7bn) and UK (Dollars 41.9bn).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CROSS-BORDER SECURITIES MOVEMENTS ININDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES (Dollars bn, annual averages)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1975-79   1980-84   1985-89     1990     1991*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL OUTFLOWS          12.4      41.8     176.8    151.6    277.6   US                     5.8       5.8       9.5     28.5     46.2   Japan                  2.6      13.8      89.9     39.7     74.3   European Community     3.8      18.9      62.6     79.8    144.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL INFLOWS           25.0      57.8     186.0    159.1    388.7   US                     4.6      16.7      59.2      2.9     52.3   Japan                  3.0      11.9      23.3     34.7    115.3   European Community     8.5      17.7      70.4     94.4    173.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Partly estimated.

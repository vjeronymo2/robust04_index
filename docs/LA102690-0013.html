			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE OVERCOMES PENALTIES IN 24-22 WIN  </P> <P> Irvine High School had to struggle with itself and visiting San Clemente before  emerging with a 24-22 penalty-plagued victory in front of a homecoming crowd of  3,500 in South Coast League play Thursday at Irvine High School.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros (6-2, 2-1 in the league) fell victim to 11 penalties for 111 yards  and trailed at halftime, 14-10, before junior quarterback Jason Minici took  charge in the second half and drove his team to a 24-14 fourth-quarter lead  over the Tritons (4-4, 0-3).  </P> <P> San Clemente jumped to a first-half lead behind the passing of quarterback Ken  Dolan.  </P> <P> The Tritons drove 69 yards with the opening kickoff to score on Dolan's  one-yard run, but Irvine's Tim Meehan returned the kickoff 50 yards to set up a  tying touchdown on Scott Seal's four-yard run. San Clemente scored with 14  seconds left in the half when Morgan Bannister held on to Dolan's 25-yard pass  in the end zone just long enough for the halftime lead.  </P> <P> Deron McCoy's fumble recovery set up Irvine's go-ahead touchdown with 1 minute  17 seconds left in the third quarter on Minici's 10-yard pass to Chris Perry.  </P> <P> Danny Kang's pass interception on the Triton 34 set up the final Irvine score,  a six-yard run by Seal with 1:14 remaining. San Clemente drove for a score on a  19-yard pass from Dolan to Bannister with 28 seconds left and added a two-point  conversion. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

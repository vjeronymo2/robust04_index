This excess amount would reflect the portion of the post-1994 growth in gasoline production over 1990 volumes that is attributed to conventional gasoline. The refiner or importer would comply with the production weighted average of the two resulting baseline emission figures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the commenters agreed that the increase in conventional gasoline production over this baseline volume should be subject to the statutory baseline. However, commenters disagreed as to whether the increase should be determined relative to actual production or relative to capacity. In addition to agreeing with the proposal, those favoring production as the basis cited the difficulty in determining gasoline refining capacity. Those favoring capacity as the basis commented that if baselines are applied on a production basis, conventional gasoline production could be limited below capacity and reduce the capability to supply conventional gasoline to some markets. Also, commenters claimed that factors such as the Persian Gulf war and the phaseout of JP&hyph;4 jet fuel made 1990 production unrepresentative of normal industry refining activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA agrees that 1990 production may have been unrepresentative of normal operations in some ways, it believes that some unusual circumstances occur every year and the limitation of individual baselines to 1990 production, as described above and in the RIA, is the better choice for minimizing emission increases and market distortions. Thus EPA is promulgating this requirement as proposed except that baseline volume shall be based on 1990 gasoline shipments rather than production. Gasoline shipments better reflect volumes actually in the market in 1990. For a refiner, its 1990 total volume would be its 1990 actual gasoline shipments, including adjustments to account for WIP or extenuating circumstances, and including oxygenate volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Baseline emissions determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Every refinery must develop a set of individual baseline parameters, volume and emissions. Prior to 1/1/98, compliance with baseline emissions must be determined using either the simple or complex model equations for exhaust benzene. In the case of the simple model, only fuel benzene and fuel aromatics are considered_VOC changes which may affect benzene emissions are not considered. Beginning 1/1/98, compliance with baseline emissions must be determined using the complex model for total exhaust toxics and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in Section IV, there are separate complex models from which to determine summer and winter emissions. As such, average baseline fuel parameters must be determined separately for summer and winter. Conventional gasoline baseline emissions (and sulfur, olefins and T90 values) will first be determined separately, on a summer and winter basis, using summer and winter fuel parameter values (except that average winter RVP will be 8.7 psi, as discussed in the RIA). The summer and winter emissions (and sulfur, olefins and T90 values) will then be weighted by the respective summer and winter baseline volumes to determine annual average baseline emissions (and sulfur, olefins and T90 values). Compliance is determined in a similar manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As also discussed in Section IV, there are two complex models_one for use prior to 2000 and one for use in 2000 and beyond. As such, every refinery will have two sets of baseline total exhaust toxics and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions_one set applicable prior to 2000, and one in 2000 and beyond. Note that baseline fuel parameter values and volume do not change, only the emissions determined from those parameters. In the case of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it is likely that every refinery will actually have four potential baseline NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions values, depending on whether a nonoxygenated or an oxygenated baseline is used to evaluate NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions (see discussion in paragraph 5.e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters were also concerned about the effect of future revisions to the complex model on 1990 baseline emissions and future compliance, particularly should additional fuel parameters be added to the model. In the event of revisions to the complex model, EPA will promulgate additional regulations which will consider the impact on conventional gasoline, including consideration of lead time, cost and other factors.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existence of these lists is noted here merely as an example of how CARB and industry foresee the future categorization of nonroad equipment. As CARB noted in its July 20, 1993 letter, EPA maintains its independent authority under section 209(e) to review each separate CARB nonroad authorization request and to determine, by examining data as explained in section II(K) of this preamble, whether such equipment is indeed farm or construction equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subcategorization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USDA commented that some of California's suggested categories might be too inclusive because they were not subcategorized as to professional or non-professional use, particularly chain saws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the NPRM, unless there is a very clear delineation of types of equipment within a category, all similar pieces of equipment could remain together in one group rather than being split into multiple sub-groups. Not every product may be susceptible to subcategorization because there may not be clear delineations defining types of equipment. However, in cases when subcategories of equipment can be identified they should be separately grouped and not subjected to state regulation. It would be inappropriate for California to regulate a subcategory of multiple-use equipment which is primarily used as farm or construction equipment. In preparing its use determination California should look carefully at whether there are subcategories of equipment that are primarily used on farms or construction sites. California should not aggregate a group of equipment that can be subcategorized that is primarily used as farm or construction equipment with subcategories that are not used as farm or construction equipment in order to extend its reach into federally preempted categories. When commenters bring to EPA's attention a product that is primarily used as farm or construction equipment but is also used in other applications, EPA will carefully review California's categorization determination as part of its authorization process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Data for use determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the NPRM provided that in determining primary use California would consider national sales data to demonstrate whether CARB's various equipment categories were or were not preempted. PPEMA, ITA and others commented that sales data do not correlate with actual use and that hours-of-use would be a better measure. EMI, CIMA and others were concerned with the year-to-year variability of sales, while OPEI and Caterpillar stated that accurate sales data were not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB suggested that, if a primary use test were used, it be permitted to apply the best data available in making its determination and requested that national sales data, mentioned in the NPRM, not be mandated. EPA agrees that California should employ the most relevant information and data at hand to make its determination of primary use. The classes of equipment in the Utility Engine Rule regulation and in any potential future California regulations that may employ a usage test are so varied and unique that EPA is not in a position to specify the type of data to be used. Therefore, EPA is not mandating CARB to use any specific type of data, e.g. national sales data; however, California should select the appropriate data base keeping in mind that EPA will review any use determination as part of an authorization request by California under the preponderance of the evidence standard of review. (See discussion in Section K below regarding this standard of proof.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Equipment versus engine line <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary use test described in the NPRM is based upon an assessment of whether multiple use equipment is primarily used as farm or construction equipment. Several commenters suggested that the preemption should be based instead on a primary use test of an engine manufacturer's engine line. (An engine line is all the engines produced by a manufacturer with many common characteristics such as number of cylinders, displacement, calibration, etc.) Two rules would be followed under their suggested system: (1) state regulation of all engines used in farm and construction equipment would be preempted, and (2) state regulation of all engines from an engine line  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which is primarily used in farm and construction equipment (no matter what else they are installed in) would be preempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Primary use would mean 51% under the engine line test also. Under this suggested system, in a situation in which 70 percent of an engine line went to farm and construction equipment and 30 percent went to other equipment, regulation of the entire engine line would be preempted. Thus state control of the 30 percent fraction of the engines would be preempted even though they would be installed in equipment that could not be considered farm or construction equipment and that Congress intended the state be allowed to regulate. If the fractions were reversed, state control of the 30 percent fraction would be preempted since it was used in farm and construction equipment while state regulation of the 70 percent fraction would not be preempted and would be subject to state requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters suggest that the engine-line test is preferable because engines are generally designed by engine-line, not by equipment. Under the equipment-based test, engine manufacturers would have to divide their engine lines based on the use of the engines in equipment. Thus, the exact same engines might have to be divided into two families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the equipment application method, if an engine manufacturer has an engine line where 70 percent of the engines go to farm and construction equipment (and their regulation would therefore be preempted) and 30 percent go to other equipment (and state regulation would not be preempted), the manufacturer must decide whether to split the engine line and manufacture the 30 percent portion of the engines to meet California's standards (and label them as such) or discontinue the production of those engines for California. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the example is reversed with 70 percent of the engines going into other equipment and 30 percent going into farm and construction, the manufacturer could decide to produce and certify its entire line to meet California's standards or to split its engine line into two separate engine types_one certified for sale in California and one not. Therefore, under the equipment-based test, equipment manufacturers would have to maintain an awareness of their California and non-California markets and specify the number of engines of each type they will need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This discussion presumes that California will actually promulgate regulations for the engine line in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, engine manufacturers may also have to divide their engine lines under their proposed engine-line approach. If 30 percent of an engine line is used in farm and construction equipment and the remainder is used in non-preempted equipment, then under the commenters' plan, the engine line would be split, because 30 percent of the engine line would be preempted but the remainder would be subject to state regulation. Therefore, the problem the commenters sought to avoid would not be avoided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, there are several advantages of an equipment-based determination. The only requirement of an equipment-based determination would be to develop two lists_one of farm and construction equipment and one of other equipment (non-farm and non-construction equipment). With these two lists the equipment manufacturer knows the type of engine it needs in each piece of equipment produced_either a preempted (farm or construction) engine or an engine that complies with California emission requirements if California has such requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 4 Apr (AKP) -- According to an assessment  by Takeo Province's Agricultural Service, the province -- which  is located 80 km south of Phnom Penh -- will need a supplement  of 7,675 additional tonnes of white rice in 1994 to meet the  demands of the population (666,905).    The rice shortage is due on the one hand to a demographic  increase of 60,000 in 1993, and on the other hand to natural  calamities that destroyed more than 6,710 of the 174,240  hectares [ha] of crops planted during the previous monsoon. As  for dry season crops, the province has transplanted some 39,240  ha of short-term rice. About 20 percent of this rice had been  harvested by the end of March, with an average yield of two  tonnes per hectare. According to estimates by the same service,  total rice production for both seasons will not exceed 293,575  tonnes.</p>

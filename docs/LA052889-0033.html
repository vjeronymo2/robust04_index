			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AST STRUGGLING BACK FOLLOWING FOUNDERS' RIFT;  </P> <P> PARTNER LEFT AFTER YEARS OF CONSENSUS MANAGEMENT  </P> <P> About a year ago, when AST Research's computer sales were sizzling and its  stock was soaring, the company's three young founders decided to treat  themselves. They all went out and bought fancy new cars.  </P> <P> Albert C. Wong and Thomas C. K. Yuen drove up to work in identical black  Ferrari Testarossas. Safi U. Qureshey, displaying more modest taste, showed up  in a top-of-the-line BMW.  </P> <P> Whether purchasing cars or plotting corporate strategy, AST's top executives  followed a "Three Musketeers"-type philosophy after forming their company in  1980. They named the company by using the initials of their first names and  chose their original job titles by literally picking them out of a hat. They  later shared the title of co-chairman, drew the same salaries and decorated  their offices almost identically. They were not just business partners but also  close friends.  </P> <P> New employees at the Irvine firm soon learned that important company decisions  weren't final until Albert, Safi and Tom -- as AST workers call them -- gave  their collective stamp of approval.  </P> <P> But somewhere along the line, something went wrong.  </P> <P> The first sign of trouble came in November when Wong, the company's technology  chief, abruptly resigned. "The reason I left was the partners," Wong said in a  recent interview. "We just didn't get along."  </P> <P> In eight years, AST's founders had gone from being three enthusiastic  entrepreneurs working 16-hour days in an 800-square-foot office in Irvine to  millionaire executives trying to run the daily operations of a big,  fast-growing enterprise. AST is now one of the nation's leading manufacturers  of IBM-compatible personal computers and it is expected to surpass $500 million  in sales in 1989.  </P> <P> But the AST story is also a case study of the strains that young entrepreneurs  endure when a company grows, prospers and then stumbles along the way to  becoming a major corporation. It also shows how idealistic visions, such as the  AST founders' egalitarian approach to management, sometimes don't work in the  business world.  </P> <P> "When you start a company, you are really doing it for yourselves," AST's  Qureshey said. "We have learned that we have to take a much more objective,  businesslike approach. It doesn't mean that our values are less important. But  we know we cannot treat the company as our personal property."  </P> <P> AST's founders say one thing that bound them together was their similar  backgrounds. All came to the United States to study engineering. Yuen and Wong  came from Hong Kong to Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, where they were  roommates. Qureshey, a Pakistani, studied engineering in Texas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refinanced Homes  </P> <P> Qureshey and Yuen met at Computer Automation, an Irvine computer maker. In  1980, the three decided to strike out on their own, using $50,000 they raised  by refinancing their homes.  </P> <P> "We all wanted to move up faster and sooner," said Yuen, AST's chief operating  officer.  </P> <P> After selecting the company's name over a meal at a Carl's Jr. restaurant, the  founders started a computer consulting firm specializing in the mid-range  computer business.  </P> <P> But in August, 1981, International Business Machines introduced its first  personal computer, prompting AST to enter a new field. By December, AST was out  with its first product, a printed circuit board that made it easier and cheaper  to boost the memory of IBM's PC.  </P> <P> "We sold our first board to a customer in Orange County," Qureshey recalled.  "They sent us a check for $82, and the check bounced. It was not a good  feeling."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revenue Soared  </P> <P> By 1986, AST had become the leading producer of add-on products designed to  increase the memory and capabilities of PCs. The add-on business began to slow  about that time, though, because newer PCs didn't require as much extra  equipment. So AST decided to build its own personal computers. Its first model,  the Premium/286, was a big success. Revenue soared to $412 million for the year  ended June 30, 1988, doubling the year-earlier revenue of $206 million.  </P> <P> From the start, AST's founders shared in managing the company and divided up  their responsibilities according to respective skills and interests. Yuen  focused on marketing and sales. Wong oversaw engineering and manufacturing. And  Qureshey divided his time among several areas.  </P> <P> The founders referred to each other as "partner" and never by their titles.  They made decisions as a group, discussing issues until they reached a  consensus. They took no votes on issues to avoid having any one of them come  out on the short end of a 2-1 vote.  </P> <P> But as AST continued to grow, the unusual power-sharing arrangement began to  show signs of strain. Those differences became more critical when AST's  earnings slipped in mid-1988, despite soaring sales.  </P> <P> Wong eventually departed, and two months later, AST had a stunning financial  setback. The company in late January reported its largest quarterly loss ever,  a whopping $8.9-million deficit. The second-quarter loss resulted in AST  cutting 6% of its worldwide work force, or 120 jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Falling Out Denied  </P> <P> Initially, Wong's departure appeared to be just another story of a  computer-whiz-turned-millionaire quitting to enjoy the good life. At the time  of his departure, the founders, including Wong himself, denied that there had  been a falling out. But Wong, who remains an AST director and major  shareholder, recently has been more forthcoming about why he left.  </P> <P> According to Wong's account, the tensions that led to his eventual departure  had been building for about two years. Increasingly, Wong was finding himself  in disagreement with Qureshey and Yuen on key decisions.  </P> <P> "When a company is doing fantastic, then a lot of problems can be shoved under  the table," said Wong, who after leaving AST formed a small real estate  company, DMK Development Corp., in Laguna Hills. But when AST began to stumble,  tensions arose.  </P> <P> The dispute that led to Wong's departure centered on a new PC the company  planned to introduce. According to Wong, Yuen wanted to ship the new machine to  customers before Wong, who headed up engineering, felt that the product was  ready.  </P> <P> Several AST vice presidents tried unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute between  Yuen and Wong. But, Wong said, "I didn't want to compromise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Longer Working  </P> <P> The underlying problem, the founders agree, was that their unusual arrangement  of sharing the decision-making authority as co-chairmen was no longer working.  </P> <P> "It got all of us frustrated," said Wong, who still owns a 16% stake in AST  worth about $13 million.  </P> <P> Qureshey and Yuen also acknowledge the problems with the founders'  relationship.  </P> <P> The founders "had a lot of respect for each other's opinions," Yuen said. "But  when the opinions diverged, the easiest way was to not argue and just back  away. We didn't want to create a personal confrontation."  </P> <P> As a result, Yuen added, decisions were sometimes delayed or not made at all  and "the company became lethargic."  </P> <P> The two remaining founders are careful to avoid direct criticism of Wong, but  they say the company has run more smoothly since his departure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Common Values'  </P> <P> "Safi and I have more common values and vision," Yuen said. "And that has made  it much easier for us to work together."  </P> <P> Since Wong's departure, Qureshey and Yuen say they have also attempted to  delegate more decision-making authority to an eight-member executive committee  made up of themselves and other top managers.  </P> <P> "We know where we're going now and it's very different now from six months  ago," Qureshey said.  </P> <P> In public comments after his departure that particularly irked Qureshey and  Yuen, Wong has suggested that the day-to-day operations might be better handled  by a professional manager.  </P> <P> "I feel Safi and Tom can bring the company around" from its recent financial  troubles, Wong said. "But I hope eventually they will bring on board some  capable people to run the business. The founder can't be worrying about whether  this screw is the right one to put in the computer, and we were doing that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Idea Scoffed At  </P> <P> But Yuen and Qureshey scoff at that idea. They say they have no plans to bring  in a new chief executive or chief operating officer.  </P> <P> "It is sometimes a disturbing feeling to have your partner feel you don't have  management experience," Yuen said. "Does it make any difference that we don't  have Harvard MBAs? I don't think so. We have a lot of hard-earned experience."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some Wall Street analysts say they are encouraged by the direction  AST has taken during the past six months. Although the company posted a net  loss of $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, it had a small operating  profit of $423,000, on sales of $113.8 million.  </P> <P> Analysts reacted positively to that news because the loss was smaller than  anticipated and a substantial improvement over the previous quarter's loss of  $8.9 million. Several have predicted that the company should make a net profit  in the fourth quarter ending June 30.  </P> <P> "I'm more encouraged than I was six months ago," said Jay Vleeschouwer, an  analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. "They have done a number of  things to improve their balance sheet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Tragedy  </P> <P> In the past two months, Yuen has been called on more than ever to lead the  company. Qureshey has spent a lot of time away from his office because of a  family tragedy involving his young daughter, who was critically injured in a  swimming pool accident. The daughter is recovering at an Orange County medical  clinic.  </P> <P> The three founders and longtime friends say the parting was difficult. But they  add that they have managed to keep their friendship, despite their differences.  </P> <P> Wong says he wishes AST well and believes the company will "prove itself" in  the long run. But he says he avoids driving his Ferrari past AST's current  offices or its new headquarters under construction in Irvine. He says the idea  that he is no longer part of the company is still too painful.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In response to a question on the present situation  surrounding the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula asked by a  Korean Central News Agency reporter, a DPRK Foreign Ministry  spokesman gave the following answer:    As everyone knows, on 31 January, we published a statement  clarifying our principled stand toward the great difficulties  laid in the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula by the unjustifiable act [pudanghan haengwi] of the  United States.    Contrary to the agreement between the DPRK and the United  States, the United States openly defended the Secretariat of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], which demands that we  accept an unjust inspection tantamount to full-scope inspection  [chonmyon sachal], and U.S. political figures went off into  undisguised war hysterics [nogol chogin chonjaeng kwangjung]  against us.    All this was a clear manifestation of the policy of crushing  [apsal] the Republic.    When the United States and the IAEA Secretariat were  resorting to base intrigues to crush [apsal] our Republic,  openly reversing the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement like  this, we could no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and,  accordingly, made a resolute decision to walk our own way  [chegalkillo nagalsupake optanun tanhohan kyolsimul naerige],  not bound to any promise.    This decision of ours was immediately conveyed to the U.S.  side through a relevant channel.    In this regard the U.S. side made clear that the inspection  by the IAEA should be one purely for the continuity of  safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksong pojangul wihan sachallo]  and officially notified our side that there was no change in its  position to continue DPRK-U.S. talks and that it was willing to  discuss the nuclear issue and the improvement of the relations  between the DPRK and the United States as a whole if the third  round of talks were held.    Timed to coincide with this, the IAEA Secretariat suggested  [sisa] that it would renounce its absurd former claim for full-  scope inspection and seek an inspection purely for the  continuity of safeguards.    It is a fortunate thing, if this position of the United  States and the IAEA Secretariat were true.    However, the pressure commotions against the Republic, which  the U.S. hard-line conservatives are continuously kicking up,  make us deeply doubt whether this position of the United States  is true or not.    The U.S. Senate reportedly passed a resolution on sanctions  against us some time ago, and the U.S. representative [taepyo]  in the United Nations reportedly convened a consultative meeting  of the permanent members of the UN Security Council and  discussed the feasibility of the sanctions.    The United States and the South Korean authorities are even  showing an undisguised movement to stage the Team Spirit joint  military exercises. The United States resorts to such pressure  commotions even before the end of the negotiations between the  DPRK and the IAEA Secretariat for defining the scope of  inspection for the continuity of safeguards. This obviously  contradicts [myongbaekhui mosundoenda] a position to continue  talks.    If the United States is truly willing to have a dialogue, it  must prove this by action and it must, first of all, stop the  present pressure commotions against the Republic.    Our position to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue  has not changed.    If the United States really wants to resolve the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula, it should no longer seek to  isolate and crush [korip apsal] us with double-dealing tactics  as now but clearly indicate its correct position toward the  talks first of all.    If the United States thinks it can get something by  frightening us with strength, regarding pressure as an almighty  solution, it is a mistake. The heavier the pressure on us, the  firmer our determination.    We will watch the future action of the United States with  concern [kwansimul kajigo].</p>

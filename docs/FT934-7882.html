			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / People: Bett heads quango When Michael Bett announced earlier in the year that he would fulfil his role as deputy chairman of BT in a non-executive capacity, he said that he wished to spend more time on community and social interests. His new appointment as chairman of the government's Social Security Advisory Committee from January 1 will fill around one day a week in his diary. The committee advises the secretary of state on social security matters other than industrial injuries, war pensions and occupational pensions. Most social security regulations must be submitted to the committee before they are made. Bett, who is also chairman of Cellnet, was previously managing director of BT and personnel director of the BBC. In January, Bett, 58, was pipped at the post for the chairmanship of Acas, the government conciliation service. He will be well-placed to pick up signals from social security claimants when things go wrong with benefits: since 1985 he has been Chairman of Bromley Citizen's Advice Bureaux. He recently became chairman of Save the Children Fund and president of the Institute of Personnel Management. Bett replaces Sir Peter Barclay who is retiring after nine years as chairman.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PRESSES FOR SOVIET SUPPORT OF U.N. ACTION  </P> <P> President Bush mounted a full-court press at the Paris summit Tuesday to win  Soviet support for a tough new United Nations resolution authorizing military  action against Iraq, but Administration officials said success still is not  within their immediate grasp.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III met late into the night with Soviet  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in an effort to forge agreement on a  new U.N. resolution. Even though Bush failed to win his way on gulf tactics, he  is apparently on the verge of gaining another important success in the field of  arms control. U.S. and Soviet officials announced that Bush and Gorbachev will  hold a summit meeting in Moscow early next year, at which they are expected to  sign a long-awaited treaty reducing strategic armaments.  </P> <P> In a brief session with reporters after their meeting, Baker and Shevardnadze  emphasized that the United States and the Soviet Union remain united in their  basic commitment to oppose Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and drive his forces  from Kuwait.  </P> <P> But while the Soviets said once more that they do not rule out the use of force  as a last resort, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in an interview  with French television that the solution to the Persian Gulf crisis "must be  political."  </P> <P> And, while denouncing the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in strong terms and saying  it is time for the U.N. Security Council to reassess the situation in the gulf,  Gorbachev made clear that he is not now prepared to come out for a resolution  authorizing a military offensive.  </P> <P> Bush had hoped to win a public endorsement for such a resolution from Gorbachev  during the three-day meeting of the 34-nation Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, which ends here today. The Administration sees such a  step, combined with its decision to dramatically increase the size of the U.S.  force in the gulf region, as a way of ratcheting up the pressure on Hussein.  </P> <P> The gap between Washington and Moscow on gulf tactics is not necessarily a  permanent one. Gorbachev's statement Tuesday suggested that the differences  with Bush may be primarily ones of timing.  </P> <P> "All political leaders aspire to avoid a military solution," the Soviet leader  declared in the interview with French television. "I have the feeling that's  the essence, but we cannot tolerate Saddam Hussein and his regime bringing the  world community to its knees. That is unacceptable, and I am persuaded that we  will reach a solution in the interest of all nations."  </P> <P> Bush has also insisted that he wants a peaceful settlement, but he considers  U.N. authorization of military action crucial to his campaign to intensify  pressure on Iraq and maintain the international alliance against it.  </P> <P> Bush leaves here today for Saudi Arabia, where he will spend Thanksgiving Day  visiting American military forces and conferring with King Fahd about military  strategy in the gulf standoff. The President will visit Cairo on Friday to see  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, one of the strongest allies in the  multinational military force confronting Iraq, before returning to Washington  later in the day.  </P> <P> The main purpose of Bush's visit to Saudi Arabia, White House Press Secretary  Marlin Fitzwater said, will be to visit U.S. commanders and their troops,  "seeing firsthand the deployment of our forces, the kinds of difficulties that  they face in the desert, offering them support and assurances that the American  people are behind them."  </P> <P> At the summit here, Bush also held an hourlong closed-door session with  President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, and Fitzwater later said the President "noted  that Turkey is showing real leadership in the international response to Iraq's  aggression against Kuwait and that the United States is committed to helping  Turkey to deal with the effects of that situation on Turkey."  </P> <P> After the session, Bush said: "Turkey and the United States are side by side in  this, and nobody has been more steadfast than the Turks and Mr. Ozal. So I have  no complaints, only gratitude. Glad we're together on this one."  </P> <P> The President also accepted an invitation to visit Turkey sometime early next  year, perhaps in conjunction with the Moscow summit trip.  </P> <P> Bush, clearly irritated by a reporter's question about whether he had any  complaints about lack of Soviet support for the proposed U.N. resolution,  declared, "Just be patient, and all will be well."  </P> <P> And a senior Administration official, requesting anonymity, insisted that Bush  is "very close" to persuading the Soviets to publicly endorse the proposed  resolution. "But we know from experience we had better not say too much about  an agreement with the Soviets until they are ready to have it announced," the  official said.  </P> <P> During another of several bilateral sessions here, Bush thanked Polish Prime  Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki for his country's support of the U.N. opposition to  Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and for sending a hospital ship and a rescue  ship to the area. They also discussed Poland's severe debt problem during their  20-minute session, and Bush pledged that the United States would "seriously"  address the matter.  </P> <P> The CSCE summit, hailed by leaders of all 34 nations in attendance as a  symbolic ending of the Cold War, included Monday's signing of a treaty  providing for a massive reduction of conventional arms. But the potentially  explosive Persian Gulf crisis -- with the United States lobbying for the U.N.  resolution and President Hussein announcing additional hostage releases and a  massive new buildup of Iraqi forces in Kuwait -- overshadowed all other  developments here.  </P> <P> Baker, after his meeting with Shevardnadze, was asked about Washington's  failure to win a Soviet endorsement of the proposed resolution. "We should not  jump to conclusions, because we might be wrong if we jump to conclusions," he  replied.  </P> <P> Asked whether he agreed with Baker, Shevardnadze said, "I wish to subscribe to  everything the secretary has just said. Indeed, that is our common approach,  and we took that approach from the very first day of the aggression. We shared  a common platform, we acted together, and we continue to act the same way in  the future."  </P> <P> However, at a press briefing, Fitzwater made it clear that the Americans and  Soviets had not only failed to agree on a timetable for a U.N. resolution  authorizing a military offensive, but the Soviets had not even agreed that such  a resolution would be useful.  </P> <P> "Is the discussion about whether or not to have the resolution, or is the  discussion about what the resolution is going to say?" Fitzwater was asked.  </P> <P> "Well, it's all of the above," he replied. "The discussion concerns the value  of a resolution, the need for it, what approach it might take, what its  usefulness would be, how it would strengthen the alliance, what its formulation  under the U.N. resolutions would be -- all of those aspects."  </P> <P> Fitzwater emphasized that in their negotiations for a tough new U.N.  resolution, U.S. officials are discussing several alternative approaches, but  he said he could not discuss any proposed language while the country-by-country  consultations are under way.  </P> <P> Administration officials have said that at least seven of the 15 members of the  U.N. Security Council have pledged support for a new resolution and that they  hope to line up near-unanimous support before requesting council approval.  Secretary of State Baker plans to visit three other members -- Yemen, Colombia  and Malaysia -- during the next three days.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said that, while the United States does not have a "hard and fast"  timetable to get U.N. approval of the resolution, it still hopes to win  approval before the end of this month, when the United States will relinquish  chairmanship of the Security Council to Yemen, a Persian Gulf state bordering  on Saudi Arabia that has sided with Iraq in the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> The People's Republic of China, as well as the Soviet Union, has been  counseling caution and patience in the gulf, but Fitzwater said Washington has  "a very satisfactory understanding with the Chinese." Baker spoke to China's  foreign minister Tuesday morning and said that "we feel very good about that  situation."  </P></p>

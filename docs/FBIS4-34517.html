			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The rumors spread during the past few days  referring to alleged negotiations between the MNR [Nationalist  Revolutionary Movement] and the MIR [Movement of the  Revolutionary Left] were denied by the two parties'  representatives, although with different arguments.    Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado, MIR Senator  Gonzalo Valda, and MIR Deputy Hugo Carvajal said the version of  the alleged agreement between the two parties, supposedly to  "tone down" the report on "narcolinks" in exchange for support  to sentence the Supreme Court justices, were mere rumors.    Carvajal believes the rumors spread by some MNR groups seek  to discredit Constitutional Committee Chairman Edil Sandoval to  force him and other deputies to act "aggressively" against the  MIR.    Carvajal added: "An effort is being made for the purpose of  demonstrating the existence of alleged negotiations, probably  due to disagreements among some MNR groups that seek to  discredit and disqualify the performance of Edil Sandoval,  probably to prevent him from continuing to behave as objectively  as he has done so far."    Carvajal said he believed that these rumors influence the  rest of the committee members to act against the MIR to avoid  speculation regarding the alleged negotiations.    The MIR deputy regretted the spreading of rumors on the  performance of MIR senators in the impeachment process who, he  asserted, "have conscientiously acknowledged the deputies'  decision."    According to Carvajal, the MIR senators will vote according  to their consciences "and nobody will be able to influence  them." [passage omitted]</p>

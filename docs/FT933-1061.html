			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Hints of cutting FRENCH FRANC interest rate futures rose sharply yesterday amid signs that the Bank of France might ease monetary policy next week, writes James Blitz. There was no formal statement or move by the Bank of France yesterday. But dealers noted that the central bank did little to obstruct a 20 basis point fall in the overnight rate of French francs, down to around 7.15 per cent. It is now some 40 basis points above the intervention rate at 6.75 per cent. One dealer said that the central bank had been gently adding liquidity to the market. UK clearing bank base lending rate 6 per cent from January 26, 1993 Another strong indication that Europe is in for another round of policy easing was Denmark's  1/2 percentage point cut in all its key interest rates. Its discount and key deposit rates came down to 8.25 per cent from 8.75 per cent. Are there any reasons for a Europe-wide easing in policy now ? The weakness of the D-Mark against the dollar has given some central banks plenty of opportunity to rebuild reserves. Some dealers also wondered yesterday whether France would come under pressure at this weekend's G7 meeting for not reducing rates, and speculated that a rate cut on Monday would help counter criticism. The better tone was felt across the board in French franc futures. The December contract, for example, rose 17 basis points to close at 93.78. German interest rate futures were somehat more subdued, possibly because of continuing pressure on the D-Mark because of the Russian crisis. The December contract was up 2 basis points on the day at 93.90. Call money was again very tight, despite an injection of Paragraph 17 funds by the Bundesbank. It was quoted around 6.95 per cent from a previous 6.85 per cent. Sterling interest rate futures were very buoyant, helped by Thursday night's report from the Confederation of British Industry showing that export orders for manufactured goods have slipped this month to their lowest level since April. This raised speculation of more rate cutting. The Decmeber short sterling contract was up 7 basis points on the day at 94.40. Three month sterling closed on a very narrow spread of 5 29/32 per cent to 5 27/32 per cent. There was a shortage of Pounds 900m, most of which was renoved in afternoon trading.</p>

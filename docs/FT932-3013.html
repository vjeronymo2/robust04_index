			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alpine part owned by Smith family ALPINE (Double Glazing), the UK windows company which ceased trading in May, is part-owned by the family of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur, Alpine directors told a packed meeting of angry creditors yesterday. It was also revealed that within weeks of buying Alpine's assets from administrators in 1992 for Pounds 1.1m, Finchfleet, an offshore company partly owned by Mr Smith's family, sold them to its own subsidiary for Pounds 3.1m. More than 150 people packed the Coasters Executive Club in Rayners Lane, London, yesterday. They fired a series of hostile questions at Mr Robert Pollock and Mr Robin Spiers, Alpine's chairman and chief executive respectively, who were flanked by security guards. Creditors demanded details of Mr Smith's involvement with Alpine and the links with Cellular Telecom, a mobile communications company of which Mr Pollock is also a director. Mr Pollock said Alpine had provided a letter of financial support about 12 months ago to Cellular Telecom for just under Pounds 300,000. Creditors questioned whether this was appropriate given Alpine's financial condition. Alpine directors said the company had been forced to cease trading in May because of bad debts and litigation. The formal statement of Alpine's affairs, drawn up by directors, showed creditors it had assets of Pounds 1.2m and debts of about Pounds 4m. In light of its financial condition, creditors appointed Mr Martin Iredale of Cork Gully and Mr Tony Thompson of KPMG Peat Marwick joint liquidators. It emerged at the meeting that Alpine is owned by Finchfleet, a Guernsey-based but British Virgin Islands-registered company. It in turn is jointly owned by Finchley Investments, the offshore vehicle for Mr Smith's family interests, and Le-an Holdings, another offshore company. Mr Pollock, questioned about whether Le-an was connected with his own family interests, refused to comment. Mr Pollock said Ibex, the company which bought Alpine in 1992, had been acting as the 'undisclosed agent' of Finchfleet at the time. Ibex - which later changed its name to Alpine - bought the assets of the old Alpine for Pounds 1.1m on behalf of Finchfleet. Finchfleet then sold those same assets to Ibex for about Pounds 3m, the meeting heard. Finchfleet, which is owed Pounds 1.8m by Alpine, has waived all claims on the windows company in the last few days. Mr Pollock said he received faxed instructions from Finchfleet from time to time, although he and Mr Spiers had been responsible for the day-to-day running of Alpine. In the last 15 months the company has not paid any money, such as PAYE, to the Inland Revenue. Mr Pollock said the company was owed money by various government agencies. 'Our view was if they wouldn't pay us, why pay them,' he said. Mr Pollock added that fees totalling Pounds 20,000 for Mr Graham Wilson, the insolvency practitioner who called yesterday's meeting, had been paid last week. A creditors' committee was formed representing former employees, and the Inland Revenue. Mr Paul Snook, of Touche Ross, is also on the committee representing John Freckleton and Son. Mr Smith has been involved in the flotation of several natural resource companies, two of which are the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. He recently narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy when creditors, owed more than Pounds 20m, approved his proposals for an individual voluntary arrangement.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (9): Outdated and inefficient - Communism has left a costly legacy It's an ill wind which blows nobody any good, and nowhere is the old truism more apparent than in the former communist states of eastern Europe and beyond. In the four years since the collapse of communism, precipitous declines in output from the old state-controlled heavy industrial and chemical plants have been accompanied by a substantial decline in the level of both air and water pollution. Unfortunately, however, the volume of accumulated chemical, nuclear, metallic and other wastes in the ground, in often poorly constructed and maintained dumps and storage dams and in the seas fed by polluted rivers, remains horrific and lethal, particularly in the former Soviet Union. In volume terms by far the biggest sources of pollution remain the region's coal-fired power stations, steel mills and refineries of all types. Over a third of Europe's entire emissions of sulphur dioxide are pour out of a complex of lignite or poor quality coal-burning power stations and chemical plants in the so-called 'black triangle' where Poland, the Czech republic and former east Germany meet. Poland alone expects to spend Dollars 1bn reducing emissions at one of the biggest polluters, the 2,000MW Turow power station complex, while the German environment minister has promised that the former east German plants will be brought up to EU emission standards by 1996. The German government has also agreed to finance similar environmental improvements at the Prunerow power station just across the border in the Czech republic. The coal mines are also a potent source of water pollution, especially in Poland where saline water pumped out of the deep mines of Silesia flows down the Vistula and into the Baltic, one of the most polluted seas in the world. The Baltic is closely followed by the Black Sea which is also virtually landlocked and receives the effluent from the Danube and the big rivers flowing through southern Russia and Ukraine. The chemical industry by comparison is a limited polluter, but this mainly reflects the low level of its development in the former communist bloc and the fact that many chemical, synthetic fertiliser, petrochemical and related plants were put up there on a turnkey basis by western contractors. Even so many were built before the awakening of environmental consciousness in the West, and even plants built in the 1970s frequently deliberately skimped on smoke abatement, water filtration and other environmental protection equipment. Even when environmental protection equipment was installed, itwas rarely switched on or it became inoperative because of breakdowns and shortages of spare parts. But environmental protection became a powerful stick with which to beat communist governments in the 1980s and many of the most polluting plants were closed in the first flush of enthusiasm after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and installation of the first post-communist regimes. Given the monopoly nature of the communist production system, however, several of these plants had to be re-opened to ensure minimal supplies of drugs and essential chemicals for other industries. Lack of investment and poor maintenance left the former East German chemical industry, much of it coal-based, especially vulnerable once German re-unification revealed the combination of low productivity and environmental nastiness. The introduction of D-Mark pricing was the last straw and whole swathes of the industry have simply been wiped out, leaving a huge bill for rehabilitating the polluted land on and around the sprawling acres where the plants once stood. Poland and the Czech Republic also have substantial chemical industries facing similar problems but are spared the additional burden of over-valued currencies. In Romania, where the worst polluters (such as the unspeakable carbon black plant at Copca Mica in Transylvania) have been simply closed down, the overblown petrochemical and refining industry is working at a fraction of its capacity. Throughout the region, fertiliser plants, refineries, petrochemical complexes and pharmaceutical plants have either been closed or are working far below capacity. With over-capacity in the west, little money is going into modernisation or on new greenfield sites, although the latter are generally regarded as a much better investment. The decline in Russian oil production and, above all, the end of the era of cheap Soviet energy and input prices is the main factor which has exposed the uncompetitive nature of most chemical production in the region and led to the lower output and the consequent fall in pollution. Russian statistics show an average 20 per cent decline across a broad swathe of chemical output in 1992 with no sign of recovery to date. Reliable figures are hard to come by in this area but official Polish statistics show that output of the Polish chemical industry fell 25 per cent in 1990 and a further 13 per cent in 1991 before rising by 7 and 8 per cent in the following two years. But the emission of gases, which fell from 5.1m tonnes in 1989 to 4.1m in 1990 continued to fall even when production started to rise. The statistics show a similar trend in the emission of poisonous dust emissions. This is only partly due to investment in anti-pollution devices which has remained minimal given the poor economic state of most chemical enterprises. The fall in emissions mainly reflects greater awareness of ecological issues and greater efficiency in the use of fuel and inputs prompted by more rational pricing. Gone are the days of big investment in huge, inefficient and polluting plants to produce basic chemicals from cheap Soviet oil. In future, the emphasis will be on much smaller plants, many of them foreign-owned or using the latest western technology to produce world-quality drugs, detergents, paints and downstream consumer products at greenfield sites governed by EU pollution standards. The forerunners of this new phase are the detergent plants set up in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere by Henkel, Unilever, Benckiser and Procter and Gamble.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine overseas contract workers [OCW's]  trapped in Yemen have been waiting for five days to be  repatriated to the Philippines. In an interview with GMA Radio,  a Philippine OCW identified as Josie Oliva said they have been  advised to return home immediately. According to Oliva, she and  30 other OCW's are safe and are staying at the Sheraton Hotel.  She fears that if they are unable to leave today, their lives  may be in danger.    In this connection, the Department of Foreign Affairs has  revealed that two C-130 planes from the Philippine Air Force are  set to fly to Yemen to retrieve the Phlippine OCW's once a  landing permit is secured.    [Begin Oliva recording, in progress] ...as of now we are  safe; we have not yet been affected in any way. But we do not  know about tomorrow; we do not know what will happen tomorrow.  They have already advised us to get out because we are the only  ones left here. As I mentioned before, all other nationals have  been rescued by their respective governments. Only the  Philippine Government has not acted. We are still okay,  including my brother and my uncle, but we do not have any  outside contact. We cannot communicate because there is no  international line available here. [end recording]</p>

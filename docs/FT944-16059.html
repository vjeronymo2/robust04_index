			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pangalos in poll vow to clean up Athens: Transport minister turned mayoral candidate aims to show he has a common touch Pink-faced and perspiring in unseasonably hot weather, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's former minister for European affairs, tramped around the city centre in a back-to-basics campaign to become mayor of Athens. Mr Pangalos has pledged to get rid of much that lies in his path: mounds of uncollected rubbish, motorcycles parked illegally in pedestrian zones and the street stalls set up by immigrant vendors, often ethnic Greeks from central Asia selling Chinese silk and smuggled caviar. 'The first priority is to clean up Athens, but in the right way. There's been no attempt to reduce rubbish output or organise collection of recyclable materials. The city's waste is still being dumped in quarries without further treatment,' Mr Pangalos said. Contrary to appearances, running for mayor on the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement ticket in Greece's municipal elections tomorrow is not a demotion for Mr Pangalos. He showed no hesitation about giving up the transport minister's job when asked by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to head the socialists' campaign in the first serious test of their popularity since returning to power in last October's general election. Moreover, Mr Pangalos is already seen as the front-runner to succeed the elderly and ailing Mr Papandreou as Pasok's leader, perhaps as early as next May if the prime minister stands for the presidency. 'I'm treating this campaign as an experiment in politics. It's about addressing people's real problems, having a city that works, not about attracting votes along party or ideological lines,' Mr Pangalos said. A stint as mayor would give Mr Pangalos a chance to demonstrate that he can get things done, dispelling a lingering suspicion in Pasok, based as much on his communist past and years as a university economics lecturer in Paris as on his time at the foreign ministry, that he is too much of an intellectual to rally the party. But Mr Pangalos has demonstrated his willingness to cater to Pasok's populist streak. As European affairs minister until last June, he made headlines in the Athens newspapers with his outspoken criticism of Greece's European union partners on Balkan issues or relations with Turkey. True to form, he quickly dismissed his conservative opponent in the race for mayor, Mr Dimitris Avramopoulos, an ex-diplomat, as 'a mediocre foreign ministry employee'. Mr Avramopoulos, a former foreign ministry spokesman, has had an inauspicious start to his political career. He won a seat in parliament with the opposition New Democracy at last autumn's election, only to lose it six months later on a legal technicality. However, a recent opinion poll showed Mr Avramopoulos narrowly ahead of Mr Pangalos, with almost 20 per cent of voters still undecided. The left-wing candidate for mayor, Mrs Maria Damanaki, the former leader of the ex-communist Left Coalition party, was far behind in third place. Mr Pangalos acknowledged he was unlikely to capture an outright majority tomorrow. But he appears confident of defeating Mr Avramopoulos in a run-off poll on October 24, with support from left-wing Athenian voters. Athens has a population of 2.2m but most of its residents are not eligible to vote in local elections. Registered voters number only 800,000, many of whom have moved outside the city limits in order to escape high levels of atmospheric pollution and noise. The inner city is now home to a large immigrant population, including tens of thousands of Albanians, Poles and a community of Moslems, mostly ethnic Turks from north-eastern Greece for whom Mr Pangalos has promised to find a site for a mosque. It would be the first built in Athens since Greece won independence from the Ottoman empire early last century. The city hall budget has grown from Dr42bn (Pounds 110m) to Dr70bn over four years, with the launch of ambitious schemes to reduce atmospheric pollution by creating more green areas and building a light tramway around the Acropolis and other historic monuments. Mr Pangalos plans to invest another Dr15bn yearly in projects aimed at reducing levels of traffic in the city centre. Vehicle exhaust fumes have been identified as the main source of the 'nefos', the pollution cloud that envelops Athens in hot still weather. Despite restrictions limiting the city's 1.1m private vehicles to circulating on alternate weekdays, pollution shows few signs of diminishing. Mr Pangalos said: 'Athens has a very negative image, both in Greece and abroad. Making more space for people will help to improve it.' That, he added, will mean extending pedestrian zones, building new car parks and introducing a fleet of small buses to operate routes in the city centre.</p>

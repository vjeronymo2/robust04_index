			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Society man signs up for the club: The IoD's new director-general is determined to make his mark As the busy boss of a Pounds 35bn business, Mr Tim Melville-Ross could be forgiven for not getting around to joining the Institute of Directors. But he has been wise enough to sign up in good time for his arrival on Monday as the institute's new director-general. The one-time stockbroker and oil industry man who, for the past 10 years, has been chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, admits to finally enlisting only after the Pounds 180,000-a-year IoD job came up - but before he knew he would get it. He confessed: 'By the time anyone asked me if I was a member I was able to answer 'yes' truthfully.' Eyebrows have been raised about his readiness to step down from the top of Britain's second-largest building society to run what some in the business community regard as little more than a fancy club with grand ideas. Mr Melville-Ross explained: 'I said when I became Nationwide chief executive I would do it for 10 years. It was enough for me and enough for the Nationwide. 'I did not then want to go and run another business in a narrow sense and was looking for something which involved participating in the political process.' Mr Melville-Ross is keen to engage in public-policy debate and then to act as a forceful advocate for IoD views. At 49, he takes over at the Pall Mall headquarters from Mr Peter Morgan, a fiery, free-market salesman who relished the opportunity to make waves. His successor is a more considered, consensual, low-key sort of chap who, nevertheless, is determined to leave his mark on an organisation which he accepts may be widely misunderstood and underrated. The new director-general, although anxious not to criticise his predecessor, appears impatient with the lingering image of the IoD as a bolt-hole for unreconstructed right-wingers. He intends it to be seen as a serious champion of free enterprise and business integrity with views that count. He added: 'The rightwing label is much abused. It is no longer a rightwing proposition to say wealth creation is a good thing, provided you create it within a defined set of civilised values. 'It is not rightwing to say the idea of full employment is nonsense. In the same way you have to have empty homes to make the housing market work, you need a stock of unemployed people to make the labour market work.' Pursuing his thesis, Mr Melville-Ross said his wish to see the education system further 'privatised' was not a rightwing stance. 'I think it is wrong for someone in my financial position to have my children's university education subsidised by people far less able to afford it than me. If that view is rightwing then I'm a Dutchman.' Mr Melville-Ross stressed that he has never been 'a raving Conservative or socialist or whatever', but he has long experience of nudging ministerial elbows. Cuddling up to a particular administration, he stressed, can have its drawbacks, so contacts will be made across the political spectrum. If a Labour government is elected, he will start on good terms with several of its senior figures. Mr Melville-Ross acknowledged unflattering comparisons with the Confederation of British Industry - the employers' body with which he intends to forge closer links - but denied that the IoD is less in touch with business or less influential with government. He added: 'We should not, in any case, view each other in a competitive way. If it is possible to develop similar positions on key policy areas, then that will be a very powerful combination.' The IoD, he emphasised, is not about to embark on a root-and-branch overhaul of policy, although he has given himself and his colleagues three months to review it. Then, he said, the organisation will have to present its views in 'a more coherent way'. He hinted that he might want a more streamlined policy-making process and, without uttering any threats, said he intends to run a 'very crisp' organisation. Mr Melville-Ross accepts that he comes to the job at a time when the reputation of the business community has taken some tough knocks. He largely rejects the image of directors as 'grasping and overpaid', although he has no time for rewarding failure. 'I have no problems at all with giving very high rewards for success that helps create wealth and which, in turn, sustains businesses and jobs,' he said. 'But we have to find ways of avoiding situations where someone who has manifestly failed walks away with half a million pounds. It has to be wrong and it has to be stopped.'</p>

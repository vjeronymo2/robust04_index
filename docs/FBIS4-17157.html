			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golovenko report: "Hard Currency Exercise, Or </F> How Foreign Consuls and Ambassadors, With the Help of Government  Functionaries, Dealt With Our Inspector"]    [Text] I may be wrong, but I think that nothing of such  social importance to Russia as Tuesday's parliamentary hearings  in the Security Committee has taken place in the State Duma  since the political amnesty. At first glance the agenda  appeared more trivial than sensational and intriguing: "On  Instances of the Blatant Violation of Tax and Labor Legislation  by Officials of St. Petersburg and Russia." On a superficial  examination you might have seen a banal case of the sort that  used to be heard in the USSR People's Control Committee. Okay,  you would have thought, the chief of a tax inspectorate was  fired, got himself reinstated via the courts, and was again  fired. What does this labor dispute have to do with the  Security Committee?    In fact, that was the sort of question a group of committee  members "kicked off" with: Should we be getting involved?  Wouldn't it be better to send the papers to judicial organs?  And why did some of us receive the documents rather late?  Wouldn't it be better to set up a commission and recheck  everything again?    Committee head V. Ilyukhin, who chaired the hearings, swept  aside the unjustified reproaches and called for constructive  work. Both we journalists and the committee members were handed  a very thick bundle of documents from which the criminal  background to the question was perfectly clear. Incidentally,  PRAVDA wrote about it in its report headlined "Why Does Filippov  Enjoy Authority?" 14 December last year. New details have  emerged today.    Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov is one of those leaders to  whom  the so-called "democrats" applied what is in their view an  offensive description -- "party nomenklatura." Suffice it to  say that he headed the Baykal-Amur Railroad headquarters on  authorization from the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League  Central Committee and before the smashing of the CPSU in August  1991 he worked as industry secretary of the Leningrad party  oblast committee. During the "reform" years he created the tax  inspectorate in Leningrad literally from scratch -- a totally  new and unfamiliar job. And he repeatedly proclaimed the total  depoliticization of this structure: All forms of ownership are  the same to us, he said. The most important thing is to ensure  that people observe the law and pay their taxes. The press  wrote plenty about how those former "saviors of the economy,"  members of cooperatives, concealed income. They brought these  same little tricks with them when they turned their shady  concerns into small businesses, private businesses, and joint  ventures. But how could they conceal dividends from Filippov  and his people when they were perfectly well aware of the  potential of every plant in the city, large and small? In the  meantime he had also set up a tax police -- to investigate cases  of the concealment of income -- and set about tackling the  street "commercial stores," which in defiance of all edicts and  decrees had not bothered to provide themselves with cash  registers. Soon people were coming to see him from dozens of  oblasts to hear his experience -- after all, it's a new venture!  Even City Mayor A. Sobchak held him up as an example. Visiting  the inspectorate collective one day, he said approximately the  following: "The State Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg has  rapidly found its feet, and it is to a considerable extent  thanks to this that not only do we not have a budget deficit,  but we can also do a great deal for people in the social sphere."    He turned out to be a livestock raiser, former sovkhoz  director, and later an official at City Hall. The voluble  Deputy A. Nevzorov, addressing V. Gusev, asked:    "You removed a first-class specialist, citing some sort of  omissions. But he probably has no equal in the whole of mother  Russia. And in his place you put someone with no experience of  tax affairs or the fight against swindlers."    The chief tax inspector, red-faced, did not know what to say  to the hail of questions. Why did D. Filippov, whom he had  earlier praised and held up as an example, overnight become "no  good"? Who made the call from the Council of Ministers that led  to his dismissal? If he was held to be responsible for  "omissions," why did the wording of his dismissal say "staff  cuts"?    In his address to State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin the  dismissed  person explained the persecution as follows, in particular:  "According to Yu.M. Ulyanov, deputy chief of the Russian State  Tax Service, the reason was a letter from St. Petersburg Mayor  A.A. Sobchak and pressure from First Vice Premier Ye.T.  Gaydar...."    I can also quote an extremely piquant bit of the information  supplied to committee members and journalists. It says that A.  Sobchak, A. Chubays, Ye. Gaydar, and former Finance Minister B.  Fedorov are implicated in the "unexplained dismissal" of D.  Filippov.    See what levers of power the aggrieved ambassadors and  consuls had to use to get rid of the overly intractable and  incorruptible financial inspector! But neither Chubays, nor  Gaydar, nor Fedorov, though they were invited, honored the  committee session with their presence or were able to provide  explanations "regarding the reasons for the dismissal."    In their speeches representatives of the counterintelligence  services, the Security Council, the tax police, the Russian  Federation Prosecutor's Office, and Deputies S. Govorukhin, Yu.  Vlasov, A. Nevzorov, N. Krivelskaya, and others spoke of  colossal embezzlement of the country's natural resources and  hard currency and the huge sums ending up in foreign banks.  Just as you can tell the chemical composition of an ocean from  a single drop of water, the rejoinders noted, so you can tell  from this single case that Russia is being robbed. And the most  terrible thing of all is that an incorruptible and professional  specialist has fallen foul precisely of government officials.  So whom do they serve? The conclusion is obvious: We are no  longer masters in our own country if a principled civil servant  acting in the interests of his own country can be simply  dismissed at the whim of a foreign consul or ambassador.    Summing up the debate, Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin  said the following: There is money in Russia. Enough for the  miners, students, and teachers as well. But it is being  artificially pumped into commercial structures. Statehood is  being deliberately destroyed: Millions of people are suffering  from mutual nonpayments, plants and factories are at a  standstill. And the blame for this lies not least with the  government, which, as we have seen, has very little interest in  filling the state exchequer.    The "great deal" consisted of bread subsidies, grants to  people on low incomes, free lunches for schoolchildren, free  travel for pensioners, and so forth. In fact, this was indeed  the explanation: By putting the squeeze on wheeler-dealers who  were concealing their income and tax-dodging, Filippov's service  was doing a lot to boost the city and republic budgets. And, it  transpires, he was serving not the regime but the teachers,  medics, students, and staffers of scientific establishments who  experience constant wage arrears thanks to the government,  forcing them to go on strike. Filippov hired proven, competent  people, even KGB officers, it is said.    Of course, the checks, indictments running into many pages,  and fines irritated the wheeler-dealers ensconced in many  enterprises, commercial structures, and private stores. The  city's chief financial inspector began to receive phone calls  from City Hall advising him to "go easy." Here are just a few  instances from his account to the committee:    "When we touched on a kind of sacred cow -- the property  fund  -- we were simply staggered by the scale of the swindling. As a  result of the inspections we discovered 6.623 billion rubles [R]  that had not been distributed (in other words, concealed --  Editorial Office). Of course, they got a fine of R400 million,  plus 10 percent of the sum that ought to have been paid into the  budget. As I'm sure you realize, nobody would like that sort of  thing. Furthermore, it transpired that 44,000 vouchers had  mysteriously vanished in this privatization establishment, and  Fishkov, deputy general director of the fund, was arrested over  missing checks worth R134 million...."    It also transpired that, in defiance of the law, the fund  had  privatized virtually entire neighborhoods and port  installations. But nevertheless, it turned out that the real  point lay elsewhere. The fund did not pay all revenue into a  special account, but, as it were, "lent" it to commercial banks  are a ridiculously low interest rate -- all of 2 percent!    "We are not children," Dmitriy Nikolayevich said to the  deputies, "and we must realize that businessmen are not given  such incredible benefits merely because somebody likes the look  of their face."    The real storm erupted when D. Filippov set up a special  group to inspect joint ventures. He even managed to get in  here, where not every investigator would poke his nose. And,  just think, the very first audit of the "Europa Hotel" uncovered  a staggering picture of theft. This joint venture preferred to  keep its dividends in Stockholm, naturally without paying a cent  into our budget. The financial inspectors fined the Swedes $5  million, but, as Dmitriy Nikolayevich said, "it will take a lot  more sweat to make them return the $25 million working for the  Swedish economy."    The inspectors also trod on the toes of the "Lenraumamebel"  joint venture, so greatly admired by A. Sobchak. This respected  establishment has used almost free raw materials and cheap  energy and manpower to manufacture furniture and has sold almost  90 percent of it abroad for hard currency. And that is where  the currency stayed, aiding the "revival of Finland."    "When we made the Finns return the hard currency and pay  taxes," D. Filippov continued, "a team of ambassadors and  consuls was turned loose on me. They accused me of `sabotaging  Yeltsin's policy.' My reply was: I am precisely supporting his  policy by making you fulfill his edicts and our laws."    It was noticeable how journalists sitting alongside each  other exchanged glances when the speaker disclosed the following  detail -- The ambassadors and consults hinted to him: Who has  got to call you for you to leave our joint ventures in peace?  Sobchak? A member of the Russian Government?    The call soon came.... On 11 October, after the well known  tragic events (as the assembled company immediately noted), V.  Gusev, Russia's chief state tax inspector, fired D. Filippov  without any explanation. Filippov was not intimidated and was  reinstated via the Sverdlovskiy Rayon people's court in Moscow.  But then there came an apparatus ploy familiar from the old days  of reprisals against refractory people's control workers and  other inspectors -- on 3 November a directive by V. Chernomyrdin  himself appeared which seemingly abolished D. Filippov's post in  St. Petersburg. His duties were entrusted to someone else, who  was given the status of deputy leader of the Russian State Tax  Service. What kind of a person was this?</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVES: "THE YOUNG BACH."  </P> <P> Michael Murray, organist. Telarc CD-80179 (compact disc). This disc amply  demonstrates the baroque strengths of the new Gabriel Kney organ at the College  of St. Thomas in Minnesota, in clear, cleanly recorded playing. The effort,  however, does not make much of a case for most of these works -- including the  Preludes and Fugues in C, G and D minor, BWV 531, 592 and 539, and the Fantasia  in G, BWV 572 -- with slow tempos and conventional registrations. John Henken  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forest Service Did Not Commence </F> Riuskanselkonen Forest Harvest"]    [Text] Suomussalmi -- The Forest Service and the forest  activists of the Nature Alliance are finding themselves in  confrontation over the planned harvests in the Riuskanselkonen  area of Suomussalmi in Kainuu. The Forest Service will not,  after all, begin harvesting on Monday [10 January].    About 20 of the Nature Alliance activists went cross-country  skiing in the area as they pondered possible future actions.  This forest activist group is demanding that the area be closed  to all operations and is prepared to interrupt the  Riuskanselkonen harvest with various methods.    In the opinion of the Nature Alliance, the Riuskanselkonen  area still is, despite the harvests that have already been  carried out, a significant wetland and forest entity in the  Kainuu environment. The 6,500-hectare region contains two  wetland protection zones. The harvests were planned for two  areas which have been marked for cutting. The project would have  employed 40 loggers and contractors.</p>

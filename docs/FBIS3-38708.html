			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, by Sebastiano Messina; place and  date not given: "Occhetto: Our Front Is Stable; Stop Being  Childish"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] "Stop being childish," [Democratic Party of the  Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto has said to those who  threaten to undermine the progressive forces' alignment with  "too many preconditions." He issued the following warning:  "Let us unite, because this will be a very tough battle. This  time we are dealing not with the old DC [Christian Democratic  Party] but with something much more dangerous -- a new right  that could alter this country's face for the worse."    [Messina] What is happening? Is the progressive front  already falling apart?    [Occhetto] No, if anything, it is Segni's Pact that is  falling apart. We progressive forces signed a solemn agreement  just a few days ago; we all signed it. Of course, some problems  have been raised, but we will resolve them. The Greens will  examine some of the issues at their meeting Sunday [6 February].    [Messina] The Greens were angered when they saw how many  candidates they would be fielding. Now they are saying that  unless the election of at lest 30 environmentalists is  guaranteed, they will leave the Democratic Alliance [DA].    [Occhetto] We must appeal to people's common sense. I am in  favor of a strong and visible environmentalist presence, and  this can be achieved by adhering to the sensitivity that we all  displayed with regard to the mayors. Each constituency must be  treated as a city that needs to elect a mayor, and we must all  of us together find the person that will win us that seat.  Within this framework, there is the representation of women, of  the various parties, and so forth, which are all subordinate  matters, however. Having said that, I assure you that our  sensitivity to the environmental issue will be very great.    [Messina] What about the conditions set by the Democratic  Alliance?    [Occhetto] Well, I think that it is necessary to clarify  government objectives, in accordance with the method which I  have suggested and which has been accepted by the alignment.    [Messina] What do you mean by that?    [Occhetto] That everyone is trying to present government  teams. We are trying to do so too. I can assure you that when  our lists are ready they will overshadow those of [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi and all the rest. We have a government  program such as we have never had throughout our history. But  we will discuss it with everyone. Ours will be a flexible  solution: With some we could have 100 percent agreement, with  others 95, with others 60. But we aim to establish sufficient  agreements to be able to present a convincing government team.  It is important that even disagreements be confined within the  framework of the document that we all jointly signed.    [Messina] According to La Malfa's PRI [Italian Republican  Party], your "joyful war machine" has broken down even before  the start. Is this true?    [Occhetto] We certainly have more reasons to be cheerful  than  La Malfa does. Let us say that our machine is firing away  merrily, because it embraces many personalities and has its own  internal liveliness. It would be stupid to think that it would  be possible to unite for the first time the various components  of a left that for years fought among themselves, without the  arguments that inevitably occur within a single party. This,  regardless of whether that party is great or small -- as La  Malfa well knows, since he is failing to unite even the small  handful that have remained within the PRI since it fell madly in  love with [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli.    [Messina] Yesterday the Democratic Alliance asked yet again  that the alignment put forward a name for the premiership,  hinting at its own preference for Ciampi. Will you or will you  not be putting forward a candidate for the premiership?    [Occhetto] It is pointless to try constantly to put pressure  on us. When the time comes, we will all talk about this  together, within the progressive alignment. As for Ciampi, we  form a positive assessment in his regard, because he has been  both impartial and authoritative. But right now the right thing  to do is to regard him as a valuable reserve of democracy.    [Messina] Will the Democratic Alliance result in a single  parliamentary group of the progressive forces, or after the  elections will we again have eight groups belonging to the same  alignment?    [Occhetto] The important things in politics are passion and  determination. That which is impossible to imagine in the  abstract, suddenly comes within reach if real united progress is  made. As long as people do not continue to act childishly by  setting too many preconditions, and if we start moving together  in a spirit of unity, these issues too will be broached  responsibly. Not in the abstract, but under the real conditions  of a very tough battle.    [Messina] And yet, judging from what is emerging from the  various regional negotiations on candidates, the impression is  that some people would prefer to lose with their own candidate  rather than to win with someone else's candidate. Is this true?    [Occhetto] Where such a short-sighted and erroneous stance  has existed we have fought it, and will continue to fight it.</p>

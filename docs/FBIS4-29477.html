			<p>BFN     [Text] The ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a poll of all House of  Representative members 4-11 June to survey their views on  raising the consumption tax rate (currently 3 percent), which  has been a focal point in reforming the current tax system. The  poll found that more than 60 percent of the 468 lower house  members surveyed conditionally favored raising the consumption  tax rate. They are believed to have favored raising the tax  rate out of their judgment that the consumption tax rate has to  be raised to prepare for a society of senior citizens and out of  the need to secure financial resources to make up for fiscal  shortfalls resulting from continued cuts in the income and  resident taxes. They favored raising the consumption tax rate  on condition that administrative reform is promoted and the  current tax profit [ekizei] is abolished. Many of the lower  house members, who conditionally favored raising the consumption  tax rate, proposed raising it by 5 percent. Meanwhile, about  one-fourth of the lower house members surveyed opposed raising  the tax rate.    Asked how they will deal with a bill on raising the  consumption tax rate if it is submitted to the Diet for  deliberation, 295 lower house members answered, "We will  conditionally vote for it," while 22 lower house members  answered, "We will unconditionally vote for it." The number of  those legislators represented more than 67.7 percent of the  total legislators surveyed. Meanwhile, 124 lawmakers said, "We  will vote against it," while 27 lawmakers said, "We have no  position."    With regard to conditions cited by the representatives for  favoring the raise of the consumption tax rate, 196  representatives said, "A concrete goal must be set for  administrative reform," while 110 representatives said, "The tax  profit must be abolished." Eighty-six representatives said, "The  financial resources of the local autonomous governments must be  increased," while 66 representatives said, "Daily necessities  including food must be excluded from taxation."    As reasons for opposing an increase in the consumption tax  rate, some lower house members said, "A comprehensive taxation  system must be introduced, the current unfair system must be  redressed, and the tax profit must be abolished before the  consumption tax rate is raised," while other lower house members  surveyed said, "The debate should be held to discuss whether or  not to raise the consumption tax rate three years later, when  the economy is expected to recover."    By political party, among the ruling parties, one member  each  from the Japan New Party and Komeito said, "We oppose raising  the consumption tax rate"; while three members from Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], two members from Komeito, and one member  each from the Japan New Party, the New Party Mirai, the  parliamentary group Kaishin, and the independent group said, "We  have no position." An overwhelming majority of the lower house  members surveyed said, "We conditionally favor raising the  consumption tax rate." Two members from Sakigake [Harbinger  Party] favored raising the tax rate, 20 members conditionally  favored raising the tax rate, and no Sakigake members opposed  raising the tax rate.    Meanwhile, 35 members Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ]  members "opposed" raising the consumption tax rate, while 33  party "conditionally favored" raising the tax rate. This  reveals that the SDPJ was still strongly reacting against  raising the consumption tax rate. From the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], 107 members "conditionally favored" raising the tax  rate, while 70 "opposed" raising the tax rate. All 15 Japan  Communist Party members "opposed" raising the tax rate.    Asked about a proper percentage to be raised in the  consumption tax rate, 76 lower house members who favored raising  the consumption tax rate answered by citing a figure.  Thirty-six lower house members cited "5 percent," 28 cited "7  percent," and nine cited "6 percent." About 60 percent of them  cited 5 or 6 percent, a figure falling short of the 7 percent  envisioned by the national welfare tax plan.    A large number of the lower house members surveyed cited the  administrative reform and the redress of the unfair tax system  as their conditions for favoring an increase of the consumption  tax rate. This indicates their strong belief that raising the  tax rate should be curbed in anticipation of increased tax  revenues that would come after the government cuts back its  spending and the unfair tax system is redressed.</p>

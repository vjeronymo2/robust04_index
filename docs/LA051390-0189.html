			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Slaying of woman -- In Thursday's Westside edition, a word was inadvertently  dropped from a story about the death of an elderly woman. The sentence should  have read: Geon, 23, allegedly told police the slaying was provoked when his  grandmother, 73-year-old Angelica Emma Oser, attacked him and made racial and  other remarks about his girlfriend, who is black.  </P></p>

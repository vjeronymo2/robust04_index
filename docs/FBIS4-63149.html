			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 19 May (SNARK) -- Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic [NKR] has signed its first interstate treaty. As SNARK  newsman reported from Simferopol, the comprehensive treaty  between Nagorno-Karabakh and Crimean Republic was signed by the  NKR Defense Committee Chairman Robert Kocharyan and by Crimean  Republic President Yuri Meshkov. Parties observed that the  signed document will serve a good basis for cooperation in  political, economic, cultural, and other spheres.    The treaty has been signed during the visit of Karabakh  delegation in Crimea who attended the meetings related with 50th  anniversary of Crimean Tatar deportation.    As note the observers, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic -- yet  unrecognized in the world -- has no such treaty signed with any  country, not even Armenia.    Today the Karabakh delegation left Simferopol for home.</p>

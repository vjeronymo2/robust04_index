			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATCH THE PORK BARREL, NOT HIS LIPS;  </P> <P> AFTER BOTH SIDES PRESERVE THEIR WELFARE PROGRAMS, BUSH WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT  TO ABANDON HIS "NO NEW TAXES" STAND.  </P> <P> O, what a tangled web it weaves, when first the Bush Administration practices  to deceive.  </P> <P> Why is the President about to abandon his "read my lips" doctrine? Do not be  fooled by the sudden "concern" on the part of Bush about the budget deficit,  which in combination with the "no new taxes" pledge has served the  Administration's stated ends admirably. After all, the combination of "no new  taxes" and the Gramm-Rudman constraints on borrowing has yielded a dramatic  decline in the growth rate of federal spending, particularly as a proportion of  gross national product. Is that not what Bush wants?  </P> <P> No, we must dig deeper. Let us return to the beginning of the year, when the  Administration's proposed budget assumed a decline in real interest rates and  continued strong economic growth. This allowed Budget Director Richard Darman  and other Administration pooh-bahs to view potential spending reductions under  Gramm-Rudman with a certain smugness; any cuts in defense would be no greater  than those likely to be forced by Congress in any event in light of the new  security environment. And some small cuts in domestic programs would  demonstrate "toughness."  </P> <P> What a difference a few months make. That this fiscal "conservatism" was cheap  has been made painfully obvious by the stark reality that the economic  assumptions in the budget have come a-cropper. Real interest rates have gone up  while economic growth is down. Accordingly, what looked like a small or  moderate reduction -- at most, about $25 billion -- now has turned into an  $80-billion monster.  </P> <P> From the standpoint of the Administration, it now is impolite to mention all  that old talk about bloated government and Democrat profligacy, however true it  was on its own terms.  </P> <P> Instead, the time has come for a budget summit with "no preconditions" because  good, solid Republican welfare programs are in danger. There are the  Export-Import Bank subsidies, largely a trough for aircraft manufacturers.  There is the super-conducting super-collider, a multibillion-dollar toy; pull  the cord and it emits a siren song for the Texas vote in the Electoral College.  There is the space station, a boondoggle with no defined purpose other than  provision of busywork for the space shuttles, themselves justified years ago as  needed adjuncts for the future space station. There are the subsidies for the  ubiquitous water projects, without which the Army Corps of Engineers actually  might have to find honest work. And let us not fail to mention the various farm  subsidy programs, the source of higher food prices, enormous resource waste,  considerable environmental damage, many, many billions in spending and a good  number of Republican votes. And do we really need such large armed forces under  current international conditions?  </P> <P> The Administration hopes that a decline in the deficit will reduce interest  rates, but that effect will be small. The only way to make it big will be to  increase taxes in such a way as to reduce business investment, but that will  hardly be salutary for the economy as a whole. And all this talk about enhanced  budgetary "control" for the Administration as an outcome of the budget summit  is just so much hot air. The line-item veto, for example, assumes that  Presidents systematically will be willing to take the political heat for  cutting while others get the credit for saying "yes." Don't bet on it.  </P> <P> And George Bush -- a man without clear thoughts on policies in particular or  policy in general -- is most unlikely to do so. Consider the forthcoming  avalanche of Democratic welfare. He will not veto the clean air bill, a blob of  pork that will guarantee bankruptcy for small businesses, even as it does  little for air quality but much for various special interest groups and the  coercive authority of aspiring bureaucrats. He will not veto the civil rights  bill, a measure that has little to do with "civil rights" but which will force  the nation to adopt racial quotas as a matter of course. He will not veto the  Americans with Disabilities Act, a guarantee of full employment for the  lawyers.  </P> <P> The much-ballyhooed budget summit will produce little or nothing in terms of  true spending reduction, just as an identical exercise in 1982 did not. This is  sad because, as a crude generalization, Democratic welfare hurts the poor but  expands the bureaucracy, while Republican welfare creates troughs at which only  white elephants feed. Some excise taxes are likely to rise, providing more fuel  for the federal spending machine. And the Gramm-Rudman deadlines will be  allowed to slip, thus removing another constraint on spending. If you read  Bush's lips, you will find that he cares more about special-interest largess  than about taxes, new or old. That is, until he reads the opinion polls. Taxes,  anyone?  </P></p>

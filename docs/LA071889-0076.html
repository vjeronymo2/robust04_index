			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> A HAUNTING ACCOUNT OF DEATH OF VINCENT CHIN  </P> <P> "P.O.V." -- the PBS series that showcases the work of independent nonfiction  film makers -- launches its second season tonight with a haunting, disturbing  and utterly compelling account of a multilayered tragedy:  </P> <P> The time was volatile. Despairing and frustrated about rising unemployment,  many Detroit auto workers blamed their economic woes on the auto-giant Japanese  and, by extension, other Asians, including those who were U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> Chinese-American engineer Vincent Chin was soon to be married. So, as he left  his Detroit home on a steamy summer evening in 1982 to unwind with a friend at  a topless bar named Fancy Pants, he promised his reproachful mother it would be  "the last time."  </P> <P> "Don't say last time," Lily Chin cautioned her 27-year-old son. "It's bad  luck."  </P> <P> A few hours later, Chin was clubbed to death with a baseball bat.  </P> <P> Airing at 10 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" is  misleadingly titled, asking a question for which there is already an answer.  </P> <P> The killer was Ron Ebens, a middle-aged auto plant superintendent who that  night had confrontations with Chin inside and outside Fancy Pants. Ebens and  his stepson, Michael Nitz, later stalked and found Chin and a friend at a  nearby McDonald's, where Nitz held Chin while Ebens beat the helpless victim  with the bat. Four days later, Chin died.  </P> <P> The broad facts were never in dispute. Instead, the enigmas central to the Chin  case concerned the motivation for the killing -- was it racial? -- and the  nature of a legal system under which Ebens and Nitz were able to elude jail  despite their initial guilty pleas.  </P> <P> After plea-bargaining reduced the second-degree murder charge against them to  manslaughter, each was sentenced to three years' probation and fined $3,750.  </P> <P> On the screen, Judge Charles Kaufman justifies his light sentence with an  explanation that sounds muddled and unsatisfactory:  </P> <P> "The victim lingered for four days, which . . . was indicative to me that they  attempted to administer a punishment. They did this too severely, in careless  disregard of human life, which is what manslaughter is. . . . Had it been a  brutal murder, of course these fellas would be in jail by now."  </P> <P> "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" was nominated for an Academy Award this year, and  with good reason. Shrewdly saving their revelations for the end, film makers  Christine Choy and Renee Tajima craftily and tantalizingly present the Chin  case "Rashomon"-style against the music of heavy industry and Motown in  work-hard, play-hard Motor City.  </P> <P> Speaking to us and telling conflicting stories are voices from both sides --  family, friends, lawyers, witnesses.  </P> <P> Ebens and Lily Chin (even more than Vincent) are the clashing protagonists  here, becoming striking visual metaphors for the ethnic and economic  underpinnings of this important, powerfully told story:  </P> <P> The boyishly engaging auto worker sits beside his supportive All-American wife  in their All-American home, while the victim's mother, so pathetically  distraught she is barely able to talk, squeezes off short, halting sentences in  heavily broken English. Her emotions, so raw and pure, speak for themselves.  </P> <P> Was Vincent Chin the casualty of a drunken brawl or a racial vendetta? Is the  proper question: What killed Vincent Chin? If so, is the proper answer: A  society that tolerates, and even abets racism?  </P> <P> Ebens and Nitz were later tried twice on federal civil rights charges in this  case, which lingered five years. Now, helped by this film, the memory lingers  even longer.  </P></p>

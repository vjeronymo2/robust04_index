			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOBLESS RATE AT 10-MONTH HIGH OF 5.4%;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT REPORT STIRS CONCERN THAT THE NATION IS FLIRTING WITH  RECESSION.  </P> <P> Unemployment climbed to a 10-month high of 5.4% in November and manufacturing  payrolls shrank for the eighth consecutive month, the government said today in  a report many analysts said showed the economy was flirting with recession.  </P> <P> The increase in the jobless rate from 5.3% to 5.4% came despite the addition of  210,000 non-farm jobs last month. A big jump in the number of Americans looking  for work accounted for the rise.  </P> <P> In California, the November jobless rate rose to 5% from 4.8% in October.  </P> <P> The 210,000 new non-farm jobs reported nationwide by the Labor Department was  in itself a moderately strong number, but the government also sharply cut its  job growth figures for October from 233,000 to 93,000. That brought the average  month-to-month job gain for the second half of the year to about 160,000 --  well off the average monthly gain of 270,000 for the previous 2 1/2 years. All  of the new jobs have been in the service side of the economy; manufacturing  employment is down 165,000 since March.  </P> <P> "What it means is the economy is weaker than we had previously thought," said  Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette  Securities Corp. "We're not in a recession yet, but we're perilously close in  this quarter and probably going to be perilously close in the first quarter  next year."  </P> <P> Indeed, chief economist Allen Sinai at Boston Co. Economic Advisers said the  economy might already be in recession and at best was "near and certainly  headed" for one.  </P> <P> They and others predicted the Fed will relax its credit policy, but not all  analysts shared that view.  </P> <P> "The economy is kind of moving along in second gear," said Michael Evans, head  of a Washington forecasting firm. "It's not very weak, and it's not very  strong. I don't think these numbers suggest further easing."  </P> <P> The unemployment rate has not been 5.4% since January.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said the huge revision of the October job-growth figure  stemmed from overestimating the number of teaching and other school jobs added  this fall. That revision contributed to the reported decline in the number of  local government jobs last month.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the service sector, which has been carrying the economy, wholesale  and retail trade posted gains of 18,000 and 33,000 jobs, respectively, health  services added 40,000 positions and business services added 13,000 positions.  </P> <P> The department said manufacturing employment was down 27,000 in November --  with all but 3,000 of the decline coming in the durable-goods sector. The  biggest problem area there is in automobile manufacturing, which lost 15,000  jobs last month after losing 10,000 in October.  </P> <P> Adding to evidence of a severe manufacturing slump, the government said the  average factory workweek fell from 40.8 to 40.7 hours and overtime was  unchanged at an average of 3.7 hours a week.  </P> <P> Mining and construction reported modest employment gains last month, adding  7,000 and 17,000 positions, respectively.  </P></p>

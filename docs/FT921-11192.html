			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Indicators fall raises US budget doubts A SHARPER than expected fall in the US index of leading indicators and lower home sales yesterday raised fresh doubts about the Bush administration's budget forecast of an early economic recovery. The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators fell 0.3 per cent last month. This followed a similar fall in November and three previous months of stagnation. The index is regarded as a reliable guide to future developments in the economy. Analysts had hoped for a rise last month, partly because of a recovery in share prices. However, the index was pulled down by falling orders for plant, equipment and consumer goods, lack of monetary growth and rock-bottom consumer confidence. Sales of new homes fell 6.6 per cent last month to an annual rate of 522,000. However, the fall was less severe than it looked because figures for November were revised up sharply. The latest estimates indicate that home sales have been flat since last August when last summer's brief economic recovery sputtered out. Yesterday's figures follow reports this week of a 5 per cent drop in durable goods orders last month and meagre economic growth at an annual rate of only 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. The budget predicted a sustained economic upturn starting this spring. The latest statistics, however, are prompting growing scepticism about economic prospects.</p>

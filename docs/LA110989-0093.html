			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MERCHANT OF VENICE OPENS SHOP IN N.Y.;  </P> <P> ART: LOUVER GALLERY GOES BICOASTAL BY SETTING UP AN OUTPOST IN THE HEART OF  SOHO. THE MOVE INDICATES A TENDENCY TO THINK OF THE MARKETPLACE IN MORE GLOBAL  TERMS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' seaside art scene has made a splash in Manhattan. While Eastern  galleries open outposts in Santa Monica, L.A. Louver Gallery of Venice has gone  bicoastal.  </P> <P> Louver Gallery New York, in the heart of SoHo, opened in October with a  museum-quality show of sculpture from the '80s by Edward and Nancy Reddin  Kienholz.  </P> <P> Is this a trend? Not in the obvious sense. Los Angeles dealers aren't lining up  to rent New York spaces, but the move indicates a growing tendency to think of  "the art world" in global terms and not as a New York hothouse.  </P> <P> As international art fairs assemble far-flung galleries under one roof and the  art market becomes increasingly mobile, many dealers establish themselves in  more than one city, if not more than one country.  </P> <P> Peter Goulds, owner of the two Louvers, and Sean F. Kelly, director of the New  York gallery, talk about making European connections through New York and  reaching across the Pacific from Los Angeles. Traffic will run both ways, they  say, with Louver Gallery New York providing a forum for some Los Angeles  artists while L.A. Louver continues to include British and European artists in  its California program.  </P> <P> "We have the advantage of interlinking while running distinctive programs. This  isn't a franchise, but we have more things in common than differences," Kelly  said.  </P> <P> Aficionados of L.A. Louver will find that the lineup of New York shows has a  familiar ring: Los Angeles artists Ed Moses, Peter Shelton and Tony Berlant,  and Britons John Virtue and David Nash.  </P> <P> The Kienholzes, who divide their time between Berlin and Hope, Ida., are also  better known in Los Angeles than in New York. Though they show regularly at  L.A. Louver and have an enormous following in Europe -- a major exhibition of  their work that began in Dusseldorf is now in Vienna -- this is the pair's  first show in New York.  </P> <P> Edward Kienholz, who got his start in Los Angeles, hasn't had an exhibition in  New York since 1966, long before Nancy Reddin became his wife and creative  partner.  </P> <P> "Despite the long absence, people who really know, know about them. The  response has been tremendous," Kelly said.  </P> <P> The exhibition of about two dozen sculptures, largely composed of flea-market  foundlings, is prime Kienholz. A disturbing mixture of rage, criticism,  empathy, hope and humor throbs through these artistic metaphors for aggression  against humanity and nature.  </P> <P> "The Grey Man's Parade," with a flag-waving, baby-faced man looming over a  stag's head, raises issues about sending children to war and killing off their  natural legacy.  </P> <P> "Claude Nigger Claude," featuring two life-size figures -- one caged as an  elevator operator and the other as a businessman -- questions the impact of  race, education and opportunity on social standing.  </P> <P> In "Fast Walking Through Sparrows," a pair of sturdy legs plows through a  forest of birds. "Septet," a particularly poignant assembly of dress forms and  an old photograph of German girls, suggests that lost innocence is the price of  youthful dreams and inevitable maturity.  </P> <P> Such messages are open to interpretation, however, and each cast-off component  is cloaked in its own ambiguous history. The resulting mystery allows the art  to rise far beyond politics.  </P> <P> The Kienholz show (through Saturday) has launched the new gallery as well as a  remodeled building. Louver Gallery New York is currently the lone tenant in a  handsome five-story structure at Prince and Wooster streets, but not for long.  Tony Shafrazi, Victoria Munroe, Christine Burgin, Andrea Rosen and Luhring  Augustine galleries and Petersburg Press will move in as soon as construction  is complete.  </P> <P> At that point, Louver will be tightly embedded in the New York scene. West  Coast art won't be its only L.A. connection, however. Los Angeles architect  Frederick Fisher, who adapted an old brick building in Santa Monica to the  needs of the Eli Broad Family Foundation's collection, has designed the  6,000-square-foot gallery.  </P> <P> He has married the existing structure with new additions, using an effective  mixture of natural and artificial light. Subtly detailed themes include  coffered ceilings and a cutaway form under a counter that echoes a volume  projecting below one corner of the ceiling.  </P> <P> Oddly enough, the building itself was formerly owned by Los Angeles developer  Edward Broida, who had planned to use it for a private museum. Reportedly  frustrated by red tape, Broida gave up the project a couple of years ago and  sold the building to another developer.  </P></p>

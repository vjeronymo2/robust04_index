			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Horvath, cochairman of the Hungarian </F> Justice and Life Party, by unidentified correspondent; date and  place not given--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] On 29 January the Hungarian  Justice and Life Party [MIEP] adopted its election program.  MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath is to report to the listeners of  "Extra" about the decisions made during the one-day meeting.  [passage omitted] Mr Horvath, was this one-day meeting the  opening of the election campaign?    [Horvath] Naturally, this was also the opening of the  election campaign and, like every party preparing for the  forthcoming tasks seriously, we also had to give a political  program.    [Correspondent] Parties are usually stereotyped in their own  country and abroad alike. You are called populist, national  radical, and I have even heard that the MIEP is a national  fundamentalist party. What do you consider yourself?    [Horvath] None of these. [passage omitted]    I think that the MIEP is a party which, in the Hungarian  society of castes, wishes to represent the caste of those  excluded, that is the majority caste. We consider that the old  nomenclatura allowed into its own ranks a few people from the  new parliamentary parties and created a new caste consisting of  100,000-200,000 people in this country, who can get access to  everything in this country, while the majority is living in  ever-deteriorating circumstances. So this is a national party  representing their interests, in fact, a kind of people's party.    [Correspondent] How do you mean that 600,000 people [as  heard] were allowed inside the nomenclatura? Who are inside,  the ruling parties, members of the coalition?    [Horvath] Well, the people of the ruling parties and the  coalition were let inside this nomenclatura, and the old members  have not really left. So the compromise between the two sides  was the great compromise of 1990.    [Correspondent] But members of your party were also party to  this great compromise, since the MIEP then was still part of the  MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum].    [Horvath] This was one of the initial reasons for leaving  the  MDF, for instead of the change deemed real by us, this  compromise took place. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Are you going to form an election alliance  with anybody? Which parties do you consider as potential  partners? For if you intend to participate in the government,  you will have to form a coalition, but with whom, with the MDF,  Fidesz [Alliance of Young Democrats], the HSP [Hungarian  Socialist Party]?    [Horvath] I think that these three parties are out of the  question. First of all, perhaps I can start at the level of  self-organization of society, for this is always more important  that the political parties; the Farmers' Circles [Gazdakoeroek],  Peasant Alliance [Paraszt Szovetseg], Society for the Protection  of [Hungarian] Intellectual Life [Szellemi Vedegylet]. [passage  omitted] Representatives of the KDNP [Christian Democratic  People's Party] and the Independent Smallholders' Party were  also present at our consultation, as guests, which also shows  that the MIEP, on today's political scene, is a national  people's party undertaking Christian and Smallholders interests  also. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Mr. Csurka said that the people wish to  overturn the present pseudo-order completely. What should one  understand by this?    [Horvath] What I said earlier; there is a pampered stratum  of  society which exercises the jobs-for-the-boys principle.  [passage omitted] For example, one-time comrades, now bank  president or industrialist, can lend each other hundreds of  millions, and if the loan goes down the drain at the end, the  state will bail them out with its program of bank consolidation  with taxpayers' money. [passage omitted] The MIEP wants to  replace this pseudo-order with a real order.    The manifestation of this pseudo-order in parliament is the  six- party consensus, which somehow always comes about in  parliament eventually. You mark my word, in most cases, outside  the plenary sessions the six parties sign an agreement somewhere  else, and at the plenary sessions only a pretend debate takes  place. They say that there is a consensus. This is making a  mockery of parliamentarianism a bit, this is a pseudo-order.    [Correspondent] However, according to my information the  MIEP  is not in favor of a witch-hunt, but in spite of this you intend  to sack 5,000-6,000 leaders. How can you reconcile this?    [Horvath] Innocent people must not be burned at the stake,  but where witches can be found, Christians have to take action.    [Correspondent] Mr Csurka said once that if there were not  an  overwhelming cultural revolution in Hungary, that would mean the  end of the nation; after the Chinese Cultural Revolution, this  sentence has a somewhat unpleasant connotation. What do you  mean by this ?    [Horvath] We mean something entirely different. [passage  omitted] The Hungarian cultural revolution, if I may say so, is  only a figure of speech. What it means is that in the country  there should be education and support for culture which  prioritize Hungarian interests and values. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Are you in favor of the present Hungarian  foreign policy of trying to join NATO?    [Horvath] I think it is very important that Hungary join  every European institution. We also consider it important not  to keep begging for admittance like a dog with its tail between  its legs, but to clarify the conditions and in turn we should  give our own conditions, and this is how consensus should form.  This means that a few fundamental national interests must not  be given up, for example, the autonomy aspirations of the  Hungarians living in the neighboring countries. We consider  them so important that we can not give these up in order to be  admitted to the European Community. The prime example, that if a  nation fights for autonomy steadfastly and tenaciously then it  achieves that, is Palestine. [passage omitted]</p>

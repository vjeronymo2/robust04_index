			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, on the first day of Geneva peace talks,  the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation had many meetings, including  one with Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN secretary  general and with the peace conference cochairmen Owen and  Stoltenberg. On that occasion, our state delegation presented  the stands established by the Assembly of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The three-hour talks last night between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation and the delegation of the Serbian  aggressor, which was headed by Slobodan Milosevic, ended without  any major results. It was agreed for these talks to resume  today at 1100.    During the talks with the delegation of the Serbian  aggressor, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, made remarks about the map that  was already discussed in the past. All attempts by our official  to reach a solution for the eastern and western Bosnia, however,  have hit a barrier of silence in Milosevic's camp. The only  news during yesterday's meeting was Milosevic's statement that  the Serbian aggressor's side agreed to Sarajevo's remaining  under two-year UN administration.    The basic problem in last night's talks was in the fact that  the Serb aggressor's side refuses to meet our delegation's  demand to give back the territories occupied by force on which  Muslim Bosniaks constituted majority population before the  aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Coal contract talks delayed NEGOTIATIONS on the new contracts between British Coal and the electricity industry have run into further delays. It is now unlikely that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will be able to announce them at the Tory party conference next week, as originally planned. Sources close to the talks said yesterday that several weeks of further negotiation might be needed. One of the issues delaying completion is how the risks in the contracts should be shared between British Coal, the generators and the distribution companies. These risks could come from actions by the electricity regulator or the government. There were also suggestions yesterday that the volumes of coal to be supplied under the contracts might be further reduced. These are believed to be about 40m tonnes a year, reducing to 30m. This compares with 65m tonnes this year. The government has apparently decided not to impose any political deadlines on the talks, which are vital to the proposed privatisation of British Coal. Previous attempts to secure a deal by a set date have all failed, and have if anything complicated the complex negotiations. However some urgency will begin to creep into the talks if the government is to meet its timetable of initiating the privatisation by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Pohl sees jobs as Twelve's priority 'THE REAL issue' facing Europe is the task of reducing unemployment, combined with the challenge of opening the west of the continent to the former eastern bloc, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, said last night. The objective of the Maastricht treaty for establishing fixed exchange rates and a common monetary policy in Europe was no longer the main priority. 'The question of whether the Maastricht treaty will ever be implemented is open, to say the least.' But conditions for economic and monetary union were 'much less favourable' than in the 1980s. Mr Pohl voiced doubts over whether the anti-inflation consensus espoused by the treaty would prove durable in view of the 'tremendous problems' facing Europe. These included the consequences of German unification, where he pointed to errors over the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany in 1990 and a wrong mixture of budgetary and monetary policies as contributing to high German interest rates after unity. Mr Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner responsible for external political affairs, yesterday dropped his resignation threats and agreed to a truce in his long-running power struggle with Sir Leon Brittan, the Commission's chief trade negotiator, writes Lionel Barber. Mr van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, was on the brink of quitting until a last-minute compromise brokered by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, gave him management responsibility for the EU's overseas delegations. Other commissioners have found the feuding a source of amusement - one insider's joke is that the only satisfactory way to separate the foreign affairs portfolio is to create a new commissioner called 'Mr Hans van den Brittan'.</p>

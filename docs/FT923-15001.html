			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day appoints finance director AMBER DAY, the discount retailer which has seen its share price plunge in the last six months, yesterday appointed Mr David Thompson as group finance director. Mr Thompson, 38, was group financial controller at Storehouse until the recent management reshuffle at the retailing conglomerate. He replaces Mr Graham Coles, who will become finance director at First Leisure, the hotels and leisure operator. Amber Day shares yesterday closed 6p higher at 46p. The shares have fallen from a peak of 129p last November following rumours and criticism concerning Mr Philip Green, the group's chairman and chief executive. Mr Thompson said he had joined Amber Day only after discussing the company with Mr Coles, who was finance director of Storehouse's BhS for three years before he joined Amber Day last August. Mr Thompson said: 'I obviously had to satisfy myself there was nothing untoward going on. Amber Day has a concept that works and I look forward to the challenge.' Amber Day is still looking for a chairman to work alongside Mr Green, who will continue as chief executive. Mr Coles' departure was announced on June 15, along with the resignation of Amber Day's only non-executive director, Mr Leslie Warman. On the same day, Amber Day said trading for the second half of the current year - to August 2 - had not come up to budget and full-year profits would be below stockbrokers' expectations. Analysts accordingly reduced their forecasts from Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m to about Pounds 12m. Last year the group more than trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m, thanks mainly to its acquisition in 1990 of the What Everyone Wants discount chain, which operates in Scotland and the north of England.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F> Israeli correspondents during a tour of the Jericho area on 14  June -- live]    [Text] [Qol Yisra'el's Shlomo Raz] Mr. Prime Minister, in  the course of your tour this morning, did you find that the  military deployment in the region, in relation to the  self-government, corresponds to the plans made before autonomy  was introduced here?    [Rabin] Even before the visit, I knew that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] deployment is designed to implement the  commitments we made in the agreement and to create the tools for  cooperation, to the extent possible, with the Palestinian  elements in Jericho. My impression -- and this is an impression  based on a visit of several hours -- is that the deployment and  the tools for cooperation are working, but they are still in  their very initial stages. Things become apparent as we go  along. So far, the parties are showing goodwill in order to  find solutions to some of the problems. Time will tell and will  test the other side's ability to implement everything it  undertook in the framework of the Gaza and Jericho First  agreement.    [Raz] Are they keeping the agreement?    [Rabin] Yes, as far as joint patrols and coordination of  activity is concerned. There are certainly things that still  need improvement here and there, and I will not go into detail.    [IDF Radio's Golan Yokhpaz] Is it clear when PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the region?    [Rabin] I do not know. According to the Cairo agreement, he  is entitled to come here. Here, in Jericho, is where the seat  of the Palestinian Authority -- or part of it, with some other  part in Gaza --, will be. Naturally, if he wishes to stay here,  it is his prerogative.    [Israel Television New Channel 2's Rina Matzliah] Is an open  and public meeting between yourself and Jordanian King Husayn to  be expected any time soon?    [Rabin] I do not know of any such meeting in the future.    [Matzliah] Is there news regarding the contacts with Syria?    [Rabin] Currently, there are no contacts with Syria.  Regrettably, the contacts with Syria -- past, present, and  future -- are conducted only through the United States. I do  not know for certain whether or when the U.S. secretary of state  will arrive in Israel.    [Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David] Have you  received any request from the PLO chairman for financial aid for  the autonomy, and how will you respond to such a request?    [Rabin] Regarding financial aid to the Palestinian  Authority, last week the donor countries met and decided to  unfreeze over $40 million for the June-August period. This  money was provided to allow the Authority to function in terms  of paying salaries and the like. This comes in addition to the  $5 million the United States gave them to pay the salaries of  the Palestinians in uniform -- the police, with all its  formations and uniforms -- for this month.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT's Roni Shaqed] Mr. Prime Minister, the  issue of the collaborators has not yet been settled. The  Palestinians are still arresting collaborators and have  announced that they will impose death sentences on those found  guilty of murdering collaborators [as heard]. Is this not a  violation of the agreement?    [Rabin] Regarding the second part of your question, it is  their decision to make. Regarding the pursuit of collaborators,  it does not correspond with the agreement. From this, we will  draw conclusions pertaining to the issue of the Palestinian  prisoners.    [Israel Television Channel 1 in Arabic's Yoni Ben-Menahem]  Mr. Prime Minister, the Palestinians claim that you have not  yet decided about the fate of the 200 prisoners who were  released here last Friday. Will they be allowed to return to  their homes in Judaea and Samaria? Have you made a decision on  this? On the same note, how do you view the fact that many  fugitives have found refuge in Jericho and are hiding in the  autonomous district?    [Rabin] As for the first part, we agreed that some of the  prisoners who have not yet completed serving their sentences  will be moved here. It is their duty to make the effort to keep  them here, in Jericho. We will do all we can, provided we have  the necessary means, to prevent them from reaching their homes.    It is true that several fugitives from Judaea and Samaria  have apparently arrived in Jericho. We will deal with this, and  we will see what the results are.    [Ben-Menahem] Does the agreement commit them to turn the  fugitives over to us?    [Rabin] I do not remember the exact details.    [Unidentified correspondent] If the PLO leader comes, will  he be allowed to pray in Jerusalem?    [Rabin] At the moment, I do not know when his arrival in  Jericho, which has been agreed on, will take place. I will  answer hypothetical questions on what would happen should  someone ask to do this, that, or the other when they are no  longer hypothetical.    [Matzliah] Sir, you have just met with the residents of the  settlement of Na'ama, who have been demonstrating since last  night at the border fence. Did you promise them that you will  deal with their economic distress?    [Rabin] I met with representatives of the settlers here.  Several problems were raised, the main part of which involves  agricultural issues. Last winter was warm. This had an impact  on farming not only in the Jordan Rift Valley but also in many  parts of the State of Israel, such as the northern apple and  peach orchards. The Agriculture Ministry is dealing with this  issue on a nationwide scope. A more acute problem arose here,  compared with the economic distress of the other settlers in the  valley. Na'ama representatives claim their situation is more  serious. They raised several demands, and I promised them an  answer within two days.</p>

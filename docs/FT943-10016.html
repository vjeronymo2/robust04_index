			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Business Travel (Update): Suspended Northwest Airlines is to end its non-stop daily service between Glasgow and Boston from October 25. It says it has been losing money because of excess capacity on transatlantic services from Glasgow and low yields due to insufficent business passengers. Northwest's withdrawal after 14 years is the second blow to transatlantic services from Glasgow within weeks. Last month American Airlines said it would not operate its daily Chicago service between November and mid-May. Northwest offers alternative services for Scottish travellers from London Gatwick and Schiphol, Amsterdam, connecting with Air UK.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature, and will only involve revising the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually as currently stipulated in 10 CFR 50.36a. The specific radiological effluent release information contained in this report will continue to be provided as required. The station radiological effluent releases will continue to be controlled as required by TS, including those requirements specified in the ODCM and PCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> J.W.

The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuses are simple protection devices and can only degrade by being more resistive which is in the conservative direction. The proper type and size fuse is assured as part of design, procurement, and initial installation. The testing provides no additional assurance of operability. Therefore, the deletion of periodic retesting of these fuses will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. [The proposed amendment will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The design of the penetration protection and the installation of the fuses has not changed in any way. Any undetected failure of a fuse would fall under single failure criteria. A current limiting fuse must have high electrical current in order to perform its intended function. Any fuse which has opened the circuit through the penetration would be detected. (This is not a concern of the Technical Specifications.) Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Deletion of this surveillance requirement will not minimize the intent of this Technical Specification. This TS is to assure continued operability of the containment penetration conductor overcurrent protection which helps to ensure containment integrity. Testing, however, may introduce the potential for damage to the fuses and fuse clips. Therefore, the deletion of this TS requirement will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

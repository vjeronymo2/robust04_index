			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WEBSTER SETS GOAL: STANLEY CUP  </P> <P> Tom Webster, introduced today as coach of the Kings, said he has always been  goal-oriented and his immediate goal will be to bring the Stanley Cup to Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "With the tremendous success of the team last season, I know my job is to bring  the Stanley Cup here," Webster said at a news conference at the Forum. "We will  make every effort to realize that dream."  </P> <P> Webster, 40, former head coach of the New York Rangers, said he was looking  forward to coaching Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> "Gordie Howe was and still is my idol," Webster said. "He was a class  individual and Wayne Gretzky is a class individual.  </P> <P> "Wayne has shown he doesn't like to take a day off; he's always doing his best  all the time to promote this organization."  </P> <P> Kings owner Bruce McNall said talking to people around the league convinced him  that Webster was the man for the job.  </P> <P> "Everyone gave him extraordinarily high marks," McNall related. "Usually you  will hear at least some negatives."  </P> <P> Webster succeeds Robbie Ftorek as coach of the Kings. (Story, Part III, Page  1.)  </P></p>

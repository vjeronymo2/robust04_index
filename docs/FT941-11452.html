			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Parents face fines for young offenders Parents could be fined up to Pounds 1,000 if their children do not comply with court orders, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, proposed yesterday. Courts could force parents to ensure children under 18 turned up at attendance centres or kept appointments with social workers or probation officers. 'Parents cannot wash their hands of their children once they have committed a crime,' the home secretary said. 'Teaching children the difference between right and wrong is a process which must begin in the home and continue throughout childhood.' Courts can now impose a Pounds 1,000 fine on parents who refuse to be bound over to ensure their children do not commit further crimes. Mr Howard proposes that parents could be bound over to make sure the child not only does not offend again, but completes the sentence already imposed.</p>

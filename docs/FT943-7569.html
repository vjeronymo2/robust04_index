			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexico's victor looks to calm election doubts: Markets rally strongly as ruling party extends its 65-year reign Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's presidential poll victor, made a gesture of conciliation to opposition parties yesterday, but the leading left-wing contender called for protests, claiming the elections were invalidated by fraud. Mr Zedillo's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) extended its 65-year hold on power in the country by a wide margin in Sunday's elections. As well as taking the presidency, the PRI is likely to have comfortable majorities in both houses of Congress. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the left-wing party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), third placed in the presidential vote, told supporters yesterday the government had 'committed an enormous fraud'. He added: 'It is impossible at this moment to know who won this election.' Addressing about 20,000 people in Mexico City's central square, he said: 'If they do not count us in the ballot boxes, they will have to count us in the town squares across the country.' But he stopped short of claiming victory for himself as he had in the same square after the previous presidential election in 1988. By contrast, Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate of the second-placed right-wing National Action party (PAN), said that - in spite of an unbalanced and unfair election process - he would not dispute the poll results. Mexican financial markets rallied strongly on the election outcome, which was viewed as so decisive that minor poll irregularities would have made little difference. But the stock market slipped back from its morning peak, closing 1.8 per cent higher. The peso strengthened. Mr Zedillo, 42, a former central banker, was budget and education minister in the government of Mr Carlos Salinas. He was chosen as presidential candidate after the assassination in March of the first-choice candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio. He will take office on December 1. Speaking to foreign journalists after voting ended, Mr Zedillo offered a conciliatory message to other political parties. 'Never has there been such a convergence in the platforms of the main political parties. We are all converging on the centre,' he said. Mexico had, he said, a 'great opportunity to reach an important political agreement among all the parties'. With votes from more than 36.7 per cent of polling stations counted, Mr Zedillo had 48 per cent of votes, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos 30 per cent and Mr Cardenas 16 per cent. As votes from more remote rural areas were counted, the PRI's percentage of the vote was expected to climb towards 50 per cent. The government of President Salinas said any irregularities would not have altered the outcome of the election, though the head of an important group of citizens' observers, Civic Alliance, said the 'quality of the elections is in question'.

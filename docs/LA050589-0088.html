			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-ATTY. GEN. EVELLE YOUNGER IS DEAD AT 70  </P> <P> FBI agent, judge, Los Angeles prosecutor, California attorney general and  one-time Republican nominee for governor, Evelle J. Younger died quietly, and  suddenly, Thursday in his Hollywood Hills home.  </P> <P> He was 70.  </P> <P> His only child, Superior Court Judge Eric E. Younger, said he had lunched with  the former attorney general on Wednesday and he was well. Around 8 a.m.  Thursday, his wife, Mildred, summoned paramedics to the family residence above  the Sunset Strip when Younger did not rise from his sleep.  </P> <P> He died of heart disease, said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob  Dambacher. His family said he had not seen a doctor in two months.  </P> <P> During nearly four decades as one of California's most durable law enforcement  politicians, Younger tangled with some memorable characters, famous and  infamous, of those turbulent times.  </P> <P> He was Los Angeles County district attorney during the prosecutions of mass  murderer Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan, assassin of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.  He was the first prosecutor in America to undertake mass felony prosecutions of  college campus demonstrators in the 1960s. As state attorney general, he ran  for governor and lost to Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. He also pushed the  landmark case that gave rise to the modern environmental impact statement on  private developments.  </P> <P> Among his political friends were Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and  Gerald R. Ford.  </P> <P> Through it all, campaign after campaign, office after office, Younger stood as  rock-jawed testament to the fact that political success and survival in  California are not always a matter of one's gifts for grandstands and fireworks  or the sweep of one's ideology.  </P> <P> Younger gave a good name to the reserved, down-to-business Midwestern style of  political administration and steadfast moderation.  </P> <P> "Evelle Younger served the people of California with great dedication and  distinction," said former President Reagan on Thursday. "He was a loyal and  trusted member of our (GOP) team. Nancy and I are deeply saddened by Evelle's  passing and extend our sympathy and prayers to his family."  </P> <P> Younger had been attorney general when Reagan was governor.  </P> <P> Younger was known by subordinates and associates as "The General," befitting  his position as attorney general, his rank as a reserve Air Force major  general, and his general demeanor.  </P> <P> A rival once called him as exciting as a "mashed potato sandwich," a remark  that followed him for years. "I don't think I am dull," he responded in an  interview later, "but I suppose I may not be the best judge of that. Whatever I  am, the public has confidence in me. They obviously perceive me as an honest,  competent and hard-working professional and that's just what I am."  </P> <P> Younger lost only one election but it was his biggest, the 1978 campaign  against incumbent Brown, who was then at the height of popularity. Younger  never sought public office again.  </P> <P> Until then, Younger's career had been a methodical, 37-year advance up the law  enforcement political ladder.  </P> <P> A native of Nebraska with a law degree from Nebraska University, Younger became  an FBI agent and served with military intelligence in the Burma campaign during  World War II. He also served in the Korean conflict.  </P> <P> He married in 1942 and shared with Mildred Younger a life-long bent for  politics. The daughter of a politician, she was a candidate for the  Legislature.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Became a Judge  </P> <P> After the war, Younger worked for a year as a Los Angeles deputy city attorney  and as Pasadena city prosecutor. He was appointed a Municipal Court judge by  then-Gov. Earl Warren. Next, he won election to the Superior Court.  </P> <P> His political profile rose substantially in 1964 when he was elected district  attorney of Los Angeles County. He was reelected in 1968. During his tenure  were the Watts riots of 1965, the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in  1968, the diabolical Manson cult murders of 1969, and the campus civil rights  and anti-war upheavals of the late 1960s.  </P> <P> "I had the most interesting jobs any lawyers had at the most interesting  times," Younger once said reflectively.  </P> <P> In 1970, he became the first Republican in a generation to win the office of  state attorney general. Younger campaigned as someone tough on crime but  sympathetic to consumer and environmental interests.  </P> <P> "I was particularly impressed with his respect and concern for the  environment," said Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy. He called Younger a  "respected moderate."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Important Ruling  </P> <P> In particular, Younger is remembered for pursuing the 1972 Mammoth Lake case.  This resulted in the most important environmental ruling of that decade -- that  public agencies cannot sanction new construction without first evaluating the  environmental impact it will cause.  </P> <P> Younger's environmental support dwindled later when he became a champion of  nuclear power.  </P> <P> Another Democrat reacting to the death was John K. Van de Kamp, who succeeded  Younger as both Los Angeles County district attorney and attorney general. He  called Younger a "fine administrator and a fine man to work with over the  years."  </P> <P> As with most public men whose careers were as lengthy as his, Younger's was not  without its share of controversy.  </P> <P> His biggest political blunder occurred after he won the GOP gubernatorial  nomination in June of 1978. He then went to Hawaii on vacation. This left Gov.  Brown time to reverse course and become a champion of the historic Proposition  13 tax cuts that were approved in that election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Received Four Pensions  </P> <P> Younger was also widely ridiculed for receiving four pensions -- from the city  and county of Los Angeles, the state and the military -- while still of working  age.  </P> <P> Back in the McCarthy era of the 1950s, it was a different and less moderate  Younger who proclaimed: "With the Red sympathizers in working control of most,  if not all, of the Democratic Party in California, the only thing for loyal  American members of that party to do is join with Republicans to defeat this  Communist menance."  </P> <P> In the late 1960s, Younger showed little mercy in confronting campus unrest. He  prosecuted 24 students on 1,730 felony charges when they took over two  buildings at San Fernando Valley State College (now Cal State Northridge) and  held administrators hostage. The students, most of them black, were protesting  the absence of black studies programs.  </P> <P> In 1971, after disclosures of the U.S. massacre of civilians in My Lai,  Vietnam, Younger the military man warned of the "big lie technique" that was  being used to confuse the public between the "good guys and bad guys."  </P> <P> After his retirement from politics, Younger became a partner in a Los Angeles  law firm and maintained a large, active circle of friends and an interest in  public affairs.  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements are pending but a memorial service has been scheduled  Monday at 3 p.m. at All Saints-Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills.  </P></p>

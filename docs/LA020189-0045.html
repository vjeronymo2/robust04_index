			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET  </P> <P> The prospect of dredging up adjectives with which to praise the Juilliard  String Quartet at the top of its form has become wearying, although "probing,  lush-toned, technically masterful" could easily be recycled to describe their  playing of the Beethoven Quartet in B flat, Opus 130, on Sunday afternoon at  Caltech's Beckman Auditorium.  </P> <P> What went awry in their encounter with the Second Quartet of Leos Janacek is a  good deal easier to describe.  </P> <P> While Janacek's knotty textures were clarified to a quite remarkable degree by  these brilliant and brainy artists, there were too many slips to make this  disjunct, ferocious, moonstruck but by no means incoherent thriller achieve its  full impact on Sunday.  </P> <P> First violinist Robert Mann encountered intonational difficulties in the  opening movement; in the finale, second violinist Joel Smirnoff scrambled his  strummings on their first appearance whereas they were swamped by Joel  Krosnick's cello -- which elsewhere proved uncharacteristically faint-toned --  the second time around. Leaving only Samuel Rhodes' succulent viola playing  unscathed amid the Juilliard's losing battle with Janacek.  </P> <P> Then, too, the excitement of the first movement -- and thereby of the work as a  whole -- peaked too early. This is, after all, music in which climaxes are as  common as crescendos in other composers' creations.  </P> <P> The program opened with a jaunty, not-quite-elegant traversal of Haydn's  Quartet in G, Opus 77, No. 1, and the Coleman Concerts audience was sent home  happy with Beethoven's aforementioned Opus 130, with its brief, jolly second  ending rather than the massive, nerve-rattling "Grosse Fuge."

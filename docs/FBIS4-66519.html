			<p>CSO     [Text] The annexation of East Jerusalem to Israel a few  weeks after the Six-Day War was accomplished unilaterally. No  country recognized this annexation--just as no country  recognized the annexation of the Golan 14 years ago--and no UN  framework gave it its blessing. Legally, these annexations are  no more valid than the annexation of the West Bank to  Transjordan in 1950, given the reservations of the entire world  (except for Britain and Pakistan). Politically, the powers  recognized over the years that there was no point in an  immediate clash over Jerusalem, lest it frustrate at the outset  any Israeli-Arab negotiation. This problem was therefore left  for the end of the bargaining, but we should not make the  mistake of confusing this with acceptance of the Israeli course  of action.    In one sense, there has even been something of a retreat in  Israel's bargaining power with the recognition of the PLO and  the separation of the discussion over the future of the  territories from the discussions with Jordan--since the previous  argument that Jordan, as annexer of the West Bank, had no  advantage over Israel with regard to the partition resolution of  1947 is no longer valid when it comes to a permanent agreement  with the Palestinian entity.    The preinterim agreement known as "Gaza and Jericho First"  is  again supposed to postpone discussion of Jerusalem to the time  of the final agreement. The UN condemnation in the wake of the  Hebron slaughter does not change the timetable, but only serves  to remind us of Jerusalem's controversial status in  international eyes. There is no substantive change in the  situation: The annexation goes unrecognized but also does not  constitute a basis for a claim of compensation against Israel.  This is not a pleasant situation for Israel, knowing that the  day of reckoning is yet to come, but it is also no pretext for  ridiculous shouts of crisis by the opponents of the Rabin  government. In the period of the Begin and Shamir governments,  the political situation of Jerusalem was no better, just the  contrary--their stubborn policy threatened to bring Israel into  conflict with her worldwide supporters to such an extent that  control of Jerusalem itself would emerge from that confrontation  injured and bruised.    No one should delude himself with the idea that the status  of  Jerusalem in the final agreement will be identical to the  present situation. Certainly there will be various changes, both  in terms of the connection of the eastern part of the city with  the Palestinian entity (Israel, after all, is not interested in  the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Jerusalem Arabs) and  in terms of supervision over the Christian and Muslim holy  places. An enlightened policy would be working even now to  consolidate a complex balance of appropriate authorities for the  non-Jewish quarters of the city, in cooperation with Muslim  bodies (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and, perhaps, even a  non-Arab state like Turkey) and others (the Vatican).    A pilot test of this balance could be conducted in miniature  at other sites of religious significance in the territories--in  Nablus, in Bethlehem and, above all, in Hebron. The idea of the  Palestinian police force in Hebron is not harmful, even if it is  not particularly helpful, as long as the Jewish settlers in  Hebron (and those on their way from Qiryat Arba' to the Cave of  the Patriarchs) constitute the "time bomb" that Yitzhaq Rabin  warned about, since the first clash between those settlers and  the Palestinian policemen is likely to end in human and  political disaster. The principal significance of this suggested  police force and of the condemnation in the United Nations is to  supply a pretext to the Palestinians to do what it is worthwhile  for them to do in any case--come back to substantive talks with  Israel in order to win in good time the first slice of the  autonomy administration in the territories. Following this slice  there will be others, along with Israeli accords with Syria,  Lebanon, and Jordan. Jerusalem's turn will be late, but will  also come to pass--and as Baruch Goldstein certainly also  understood, what happens in Hebron at the beginning will happen  in Jerusalem at the end.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / ENI chief being investigated MR Gabriele Cagliari, the president of ENI, the Italian state oil concern, was told over the weekend by Rome magistrates that he was under investigation for alleged embezzlement over a controversial reorganisation of the chemicals industry in 1990. Mr Cagliari is the most senior figure in a state-run industry to fall foul of a wave of investigations into illegal party funding, corruption and abuse of public office. The weekend saw a string of prominent politicians and businessmen come under investigation. For at least three weeks Rome magistrates have been looking into ENI's decision to buy out the Ferruzzi group's 40 per cent stake in their joint chemicals conglomerate, Enimont. The stake, held through Ferruzzi's chemicals arm Montedison, was sold in 1990 for L2,805bn (Pounds 1.27bn) on the basis of both international and Italian valuations. But the price was high given the state of chemicals business and in particular the losses in the fertiliser sector. ENI's accounts still reflect the consequences of this purchase. Mr Cagliari, questioned by magistrates on Saturday, has denied any wrong-doing in the operation. Earlier last week Mr Raul Gardini, the financier who headed Montedison at the the time, was also questioned about the Enimont deal. In another development, Mr Cirono Pomicino, budget minister in the previous Andreotti government and one of the most influential members of the Christian Democrat party, was warned he was under investigation for alleged corruption. The investigation centres on a port modernisation contract. Mr Pomicino, the Christian Democrat leader in Naples, vigorously denied the allegations and yesterday personally took the matter up with the magistrates. Nevertheless it is the first time in the recent spate of corruption investigations that the Christian Democrat stronghold of Naples has been touched. Among the businessmen arrested for alleged corruption over the weekend were Mr Bruno Tronchetti Provera, member of a leading Milanese business family, and brother of the chief executive of Pirelli; and Mr Paolo Ciaccia, head of ENI's engineering group Saipem. Their arrest formed part of a new branch of inquiry by Milanese magistrates into alleged kick-backs paid to politicians in the energy sector.</p>

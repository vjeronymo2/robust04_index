			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: Audi profits hit by weak dollar PROFITS at Audi, the quality car division of Volkswagen, fell 13 per cent in the first half of this year, in spite of a 20 per cent increase in sales. Margins were hit by the weakening US dollar and the concentration of demand on the cheaper new Audi 80 series rather than the costlier 100 range. As a result, pre-tax profits fell to DM315m (Dollars 225m) from DM364m on sales of DM8.6bn, compared with DM7.1bn, the company said yesterday. The overall car market was declining: Japanese demand fell for the first time in seven years, and the US business was improving only slowly. However, rising sales in Europe, excluding Germany, more than compensated for falling domestic deliveries, the group added. The proportion of deliveries to foreign customers increased to 50.4 per cent from 47 per cent. In spite of the difficulties Audi expected record production, delivery and sales figures, and a satisfactory result for the year as a whole. The VW parent, which earlier this week reported a 17 per cent fall in half-way pre-tax earnings, increased unit sales 6 per cent. First-half production rose almost 9 per cent, and extra shifts had to be employed in the Ingoldstadt factory to keep waiting times for new Audi 80s within reasonable limits. The company's two German works produced 254,530 vehicles, compared with 234,000 with a workforce unchanged at 38,000. Audi also produced 3.7 per cent more engines. Planned investment for the full year will fall below last year's DM1.1bn, a figure inflated by new model introductions. Capital spending in the first half was DM327m, compared with DM512m.</p>

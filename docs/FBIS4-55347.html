			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- Radio Sarajevo, loyal  to the Bosnian Moslem regime of hardliner Alija Izetbegovic, on  Thursday again reported fighting between rival Moslem factions  in western Bosnia-Herzegovina. That part of the war-wracked  former Yugoslav republic has since last autumn been the scene of  fierce clashes between troops loyal to [word indistinct] leader  Izetbegovic and supporters of his moderate rival and local  leader Fikret Abdic. Abdic's supporters proclaimed their own  autonomous province of western Bosnia in late September 1993,  and have since signed friendship and cooperation treaties with  the other two Bosnian nations -- Serbs and Croats.    Radio Sarajevo said that provincial forces on Thursday kept  up a sustained attack, the brunt of which was directed at the  village of Todorovo where `nearly all facilities have been  demolished, including mosques and schools, and there was a  considerable number of dead and wounded.' The source said that  the Moslem army's 5th Corps, loyal to Izetbegovic, had managed  to regain some strategically important positions captured by  Abdic's troops the day before. The reports could not be  independently confirmed.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Stockholm tries to bridge gap over Danish link: Environmental wrangles in cabinet are delaying one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects Sweden's centre-right government will today make a renewed attempt to break a deadlock that is holding up the start of work on building a bridge and tunnel link across the Oresund to Denmark - one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects. A wrangle over environmental objections to the link has caused some embarrassment to Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, destabilising his minority coalition and undercutting his enthusiastic commitment to tying Sweden closer to the European mainstream. It has also aroused irritation in Denmark which is keen to get on with the project. Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party, the Liberal and Christian Democrat coalition partners and the opposition Social Democrats are all backing the link, which was first agreed in a treaty signed by Stockholm and Copenhagen in 1991. It is seen as a vital parallel project to Sweden's application to join the European Union, which is also due to be decided this year. But the Centre party, the fourth member of the governing coalition, has dug its heels in against the project on environmental grounds, and claims to have the support of almost half the population. Their concerns are that the main bridge section will impede salt water flows into the Baltic which are vital to the health of the already heavily polluted sea. They also argue that exhaust emissions on the bridge will break Danish and Swedish commitments made at the Rio environmental summit not to increase levels of such pollutants. The 17km combined road and rail connection between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo has the strong support of Swedish industry and unions. Like the political parties, they see the bridge/tunnel - the first fixed link between Sweden and the European mainland - as a valuable boost to the economy. The Swedish side particularly has already gone to painstaking lengths, including expensive redesigns of the bridge, to minimise the environmental impact. But Mr Bildt has so far failed to overcome the objections of the Centre party, whose leader, Mr Olof Johansson, is environment minister. What Mr Bildt is struggling to achieve is a political compromise that allows the government to give the final green light to the Oresund link, without prompting the Centre party to quit the coalition. In his favour is the undisguised unwillingness of Mr Johansson and his colleagues to be forced into such a position. Some formulation allowing the Centre party to dissent from customary unanimous cabinet decisions may provide a way out. But there was little sign yesterday that such a compromise was in sight, and Mr Johansson indicated that another postponement of a final decision was likely. The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the link is due to invite construction tenders early this year. On the Danish side, work on some of the approach roads and site clearances has already begun. The total cost, including associated construction on the Danish and Swedish sides, is around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.68bn) to be paid back in rail fees and vehicle tolls. Supporters say the link will transform the Copenhagen and Malmo areas and will have beneficial effects for both nation's economies. The combined Copenhagen-Malmo region has a population of 2.3m, making it the 20th largest urban concentration in Europe and the eighth largest in terms of purchasing power - giving much greater critical economic mass than the two can muster separately. The Oresund link will cut travel times between the two city centres from a minimum 90 minutes at present to around 30 minutes. For Swedish industry particularly, the rail link will offer much faster transit times for freight that otherwise goes by ferry - halving the time it takes to move freight by rail from Malmo to Hamburg, for example. 'It will also provide an integrated labour market in eastern Denmark and southern Sweden. You can have commuter trains using the bridge,' says Mr Lars Kritz of the Federation of Swedish Industries. 'That must be good for industry and trade.'</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LAGOMARSINO SEEKS WATER SOURCE STUDY  </P> <P> A study of emergency sources of water -- including the use of portable military  desalination plants -- was proposed Wednesday by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino  (R-Ojai).  </P> <P> In testimony before a congressional subcommittee, Lagomarsino listed several of  the options to be considered, including the use of portable desalination plants  in extreme emergencies.  </P> <P> "We're in the fourth year of a drought, and we need to explore all the  possibilities," Lagomarsino said.  </P> <P> John Doherty, an aide to Lagomarsino, said it might be May before the House  Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water decides whether to finance the  $300,000 study. "We hope we can start it in the meantime and reimburse the Army  Corps of Engineers," he said.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino said the Corps has indicated a willingness to do "a quick survey"  that could take "three to six months."  </P> <P> Two of the options that could aid Ventura County, according to Lagomarsino's  office, would be the desalination plants and an exchange agreement with water  officials in Santa Barbara County.  </P> <P> "There are over 100 unused desalination plants at Army bases in California,  capable of producing 14,000 gallons a day each," Lagomarsino said. "It would be  expensive -- about $43 a month to supply a family of four -- but if there's no  other way of getting water, it becomes a viable option."  </P> <P> Doherty said the desalination plants, which filter seawater into usable water,  have been used in the past by Marines and the U.S. naval base in Cuba.  </P> <P> The exchange agreement between water districts could benefit Ventura and Santa  Barbara counties, Doherty said.  </P> <P> "Santa Barbara County has an entitlement to state water but doesn't have a  pipeline," he said. "Ventura County would get the water and give some of it to  Santa Barbara." JEFF SCHNAUFER  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Enthusiasm for stocks begins to wane SIGNS that the London market has peaked for the moment increased yesterday as stock started to wash around without readily finding a home, and a number of traders were beginning, with a certain amount of relief, to see the end of the bull run. Although the FT-SE 100 Index had found some support during the morning, a combination of disappointing government figures, a large sell programme, poor corporate results and a weakening Wall Street prompted a slide which ended with the Footsie down 25.8 at 2,694.7, just off the day's low. News that underlying average earnings for March were up 7.5 per cent led to worries that the government's restraining influence on inflation is not so firm as hoped. This gave traders their first chance of the day to do something they had been looking to do all week - namely, take profits. On the other hand, the rise in unemployment figures had been largely discounted. The profit-taking was part of a European trend that was particularly evident in France, and to a lesser extent in Germany, yesterday. There were signs of nervousness in the gilts market and in the performance of short sterling. This was followed shortly after midday by the sale of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m worth of Footsie stocks in a programme trade which took the wind out of the market. After that, there was surprise at the poor first-half performance of Hanson. The results wiped out the effect of good figures from Grand Metropolitan and Shell Transport. Futures traders reacted quickly and led the market, which had been showing a comfortable gain of around 10 points, down towards 2,700. The FT-SE contract for June delivery fell to its estimated fair value premium to cash for the first time since the general election. The fact that turnover remained very high suggested that the market was no longer able to absorb the stock being placed at current high levels. There were 706.9m shares traded yesterday, well above Wednesday's figure of 604.6m when customer retail business reached Pounds 1.154bn. Analysts were starting to look at the lower than usual dividend yield on the FT-A All-Share Index, down to 4.5 per cent with the market at 2,737. They were also examining the level of its price/earnings ratio which, said one observer, was the highest for 10 years. One of the more relieved market commentators was Mr Nick Knight of Nomura Research, who sees the market going back to 2,500 by the end of the year, and who published research yesterday arguing that the good news following the general election was already in the market. 'The degree of bullish consensus is frightening,' he said. 'Not only is the economic recovery already in the price, but the figures from Hanson show that there is no economic recovery.' With 10 companies reporting figures yesterday, individual stock movements were dominated by results. Guinness was one to suffer, affected by a poor performance from its luxury goods subsidiary, but Burton was actively higher on better than expected numbers.</p>

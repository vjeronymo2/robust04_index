[passage  omitted]    [Begin recording] [Brigadier General Andre Soubirou,  captioned as UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo sector] I have been  hindered since the start of the Gorazde crisis. Our freedom of  movement has been restricted. The tension provoked by the  Gorazde crisis resulted in massive harassment by the Serb side.  There were attempts to get more weapons through our sector by  taking advantage of these difficulties. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

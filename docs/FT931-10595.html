			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Dutch courage THE COLLAPSE of Daf has brought the UK's political left and industrial right into a not unfamiliar alliance. The Dutch and Flemish authorities, it is said, have been prompt in offering Daf financial and moral support. The UK has done nothing. As a result, Daf UK may go under while the rest is saved. This typifies the dogmatic incompetence of a government which says it wants a new approach to industrial policy but is impotent when the chips are down. While this is understandable enough in emotional terms, it leaves a number of awkward questions unaddressed: in particular, whether Daf is worth saving in its present form. The answer seems sadly obvious. As Europe's sixth biggest truck maker, Daf aimed to match its rivals' product range on a much smaller sales base. It was also unduly dependent on the UK market. In 1991 Daf's manufacturing business made a loss equal to some 40 per cent of its shareholders' funds. In 1992 it seems to have lost the remainder. In book-keeping terms, the company is thus virtually worthless. Meanwhile, the UK market is barely recovering and the rest of Europe is still in decline. It is a truism to say that if enough money were pumped in, Daf could keep going. Whether that would be a sensible deployment of scarce economic resources is quite another matter. Nor is it clear that the UK government was incompetent, as opposed to obdurate, in its handling of the situation. The Department of Trade and Industry was scarcely unaware of what was happening; indeed, it turned down an appeal from Daf for Pounds 450m of state aid less than a year ago. The question of whether the UK should have a more interventionist industrial policy is a legitimate topic for debate. Commercial lost causes like Daf, though, do little to further it; particularly when - as in the case of Leyland Daf - they have already consumed some Pounds 600m of taxpayers' money during 12 years of public ownership. That the Dutch authorities should view things differently is scarcely a matter for surprise. Any government which chooses to support commercial misjudgments on the scale of those at Phillips, for example, plainly takes a broad view of economic utility. But all this leaves out of account the question of what will happen to the assets themselves. There is supposedly a plan afoot to separate out the Dutch and Belgian parts of Daf, leaving the UK business to its own devices. Some parts at least of the UK operation would doubtless then have to close; but that might have happened anyway. There will presumably be competition to buy at least the Leyland truck plant, which has a not insignificant total of 2,200 employees. If it is bought by a large and commercially viable competitor, those 2,200 will in all probability be better off in the long run than their publicly supported Dutch and Belgian colleagues.</p>

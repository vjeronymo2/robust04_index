"I am afraid  they will shoot my husband," she told RAPPORT yesterday.    While right-wing anger has been boiling over this week over  Gen. Viljoen's decision to participate in the coming election,  Mrs. Viljoen lifted the veil on warnings last Sunday that an  assassination plot on her husband was being planned.    Two telephone calls, in which Gen. Viljoen was told that an  attempt could be made to assassinate him, led to the forming of  a thick security cordon around the Viljoen couple while they  relaxed on their farm near Ohrigstad.    They were warned in two telephone calls shortly after their  return from an excursion on the farm to inspect Dr. Viljoen's  cattle.    Soon thereafter, Conservative Party leader Ferdi  Hartzenberg,  who probably knew about the threats, phoned Gen. Viljoen.    Almost immediately after the warnings a large number of men  clad in "brown uniforms" and armed with rifles were employed on  the farm to protect Gen. Viljoen.    Mrs. Viljoen says she was unnerved by a foreign television  crew which lingered unusually long on their farm and even hung  around the farm dwelling. She was concerned that they too had  heard about the threat and wanted to be on the scene -- should  something happen.    Gen. Viljoen, who is known for his bravery as a soldier, did  not sleep at his usual place that night, but rather spent the  night elsewhere.    "I am afraid they will shoot my husband, but the Lord has a  purpose for everything," a visibly concerned Mrs. Viljoen told  RAPPORT yesterday. "It would be terrible if he had to go in  this way, especially since the far right wingers are the people  that he always wanted to protect."    She is worried that there is not sufficient control over  some  right-wing elements. "Yesterday in Mmabatho they threw military  discipline overboard and refused to accept his instructions."    However, she finds solace in the new political direction her  husband is heading in after his decision to take part in the  election.    Her husband -- "he is the most loyal man possible" -- has  done all he could to bring about right-wing unity, but it has  just not been possible.</p>

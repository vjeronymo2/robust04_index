			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ashanti's flotation valued at Pounds 1.67bn Ashanti, one of the world's biggest gold mines, will have a market capitalisation of up to Pounds 1.67bn after its flotation. Yesterday the Ghanaian Government offered 17.9m shares in Ashanti Goldfield Company, or just over 22 per cent. The price is expected to be between USDollars 17 and USDollars 20 a share. Ashanti, which reported profits after tax of USDollars 90.2m for the year to end September, is seeking listings on the London and Ghana Stock Exchanges. The company is also offering for subscription 3.5m new shares, or about 4.4 per cent. The offer is intended to raise between USDollars 290m and USDollars 340m for the Ghanaian Government after expenses, and between USDollars 47m and USDollars 57m for Ashanti. After the offer the Ghanaian Government will own around 31 per cent of Ashanti. Lonrho, which has a 45 per cent stake and is not selling any shares, will have about 43 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Mr Sam Jonah, Ashanti chief executive, described the flotation as 'the largest step in the Government of Ghana's economic liberalisation and privatisation programme.' Ashanti, which expects to produce over 1m ounces of gold in 1994-95, will use the proceeds for working capital, to help finance capital expenditure and for increased exploration. The group's net debt at January 31 was USDollars 148.6m. The Ghanian offer is expected to close on April 6, and the international offer on April 18.</p>

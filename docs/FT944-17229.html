			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Demand for temps hits high levels Temporary jobs are pre-dominant among new employment as the UK emerges from recession, says Reed Personnel Services, Richard Donkin writes. A report published today by Reed, one of the biggest UK employment agencies, shows demand for temporary staff at its 200 branches at its highest since 1989. Demand for permanent staff is slightly above half the level of 1990. Reed suggested that the growth in the use of temporary staff could reflect a structural change in the composition of the UK workforce or the slow rate of upturn leading employers to postpone decisions on the conversion of temporary posts to full-time jobs.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Nerves of steel There must indeed be a connection between the European Commission's imposition of stiff fines on steel producers accused of infringing competition rules and its efforts to cajole them into cutting production. If its leaked intention to fine was a threat, it failed. The fines have no further use as bargaining chips since it will be up to the European Court to decide whether to rescind them once the companies appeal. But the companies have been so irritated that the chances of agreement on production cuts look even more remote. In view of its outspoken criticism of December's feeble EU agreement on subsidies, some in the Commission must be quietly pleased at the coincidence which imposed on British Steel the largest fine. Yet its share price actually managed a marginal gain yesterday. Perhaps the Ecu32m fine simply looks insignificant against group net assets of Pounds 3.7bn. Profits should be spared a hit, at least until the appeal is decided. British Steel has no more production cuts of its own to offer. But it would be wasting shareholders' money if it paid for others to make cuts without first making absolutely sure that subsidised competitors could no longer step into the breach. If that did ever happen, British Steel's low costs would almost certainly allow it vastly to increase its European market share. Its strong balance sheet means it can survive the subsidy wars better than other unaided producers. But that is no reason for the equity market to rejoice, because the costs will be high. The shares are mainly resilient for a reason that will ultimately make the problem worse. Production restraints and the prospect of economic recovery have buoyed product prices. The longer that continues the harder it will be to stop the subsidies - which probably also explains the Commission's extreme frustration.</p>

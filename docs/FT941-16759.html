			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Trichet outlines vision of 'open and democratic' independent central bank: David Buchan and John Ridding meet the Bank of France governor An old institution was reborn yesterday: 194 years after being created by Napoleon to help him wage war on Britain, the Bank of France has been made independent, the better to wage war on inflation and to protect the franc from the vagaries of political interference. Yesterday saw the formal installation by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee, whose nine members are forbidden by law from 'accepting or soliciting' outside instruction in the determination of French interest rates. But how will the team operate under the 1993 law which, for all its extensive borrowing from the Maastricht treaty and the statutes and experience of independent central banks in Germany and the US, creates a distinctive Gallic model? In his first press interview following this week's nomination of the MPC, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, spelt out some of the guiding principles in the committee's composition and future operation. In addition to Mr Trichet and his two deputy governors - Mr Denis Ferman and Mr Herve Hannoun - six outsiders have been chosen by the Balladur government and President Mitterrand to sit on the committee from a shortlist of 18 names proposed by the presidents of the National Assembly, the Senate and the Economic and Social Committee. Roping so many institutions and leaders into the nomination process ensures the MPC's composition is 'the least contested possible,' says Mr Trichet. Paradoxically, too, he says centralised France may have actually produced a more diverse body to steer its monetary policy than in federal Germany or the US where regional central bankers make up much of the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve boards. The six outsiders come from finance, insurance, industry, academe, journalism and politics. 'With such outstanding personalities, I wonder if one does not have more diversity than in a federal system, whose regional banks are inevitably filled by people with the same career and professional experience.' Precisely because the outsiders are so diverse, much may fall on the shoulders of Mr Trichet and his two deputies, certainly at the outset, though the governor stresses the new 'collegiality of decision-making'. The Bank of France has not yet set its monetary targets for 1994 but is likely to have to do so by the end of the month. These targets will probably be announced at a press conference, which the hitherto secretive Old Lady of the Rue de la Vrilliere has rarely indulged in. 'In a democracy, I believe that an independent institution should both listen and explain itself,' says Mr Trichet. Referring to the bank's democratic accountability as absolutely central, Mr Trichet sees two important bridges between the central bank and the executive and legislature. In the first case, the government has access to the MPC - the prime minister or the economy minister can attend meetings but they have no vote, as in Germany. 'The experience in Germany is that this is a good thing, it allows communication between government and central bank while the law is unambiguous in protecting the latter's independence.' Of considerable importance - not least to the French parliament's desire to increase its feeble powers under the Fifth Republic - is the Bank of France's new answerability to deputies. Mr Trichet must now report at least once a year to the National Assembly and the Senate, which can also summon him to appear before them more often. 'The bank governor can also ask to be heard by these bodies - it is a symmetrical arrangement, which could be useful. . . I think it is a duty for the governor to be as active as possible in his relations with the parliament and its finance committees,' says Mr Trichet. The outcome could be a mixture between the practice of the Fed chairman making set-piece appearances before Congress and the Bundesbank's tendency to rely more on press conferences. One practice of the Fed's open market committee that Mr Trichet seems loath to adopt is delayed publication of the minutes and votes of past committee meetings. 'I think that whatever the vigour of internal arguments and debate, the credit of our institution will depend very much on the unity it projects, once decisions are taken.' Mr Trichet does not appear to anticipate much internal argument over the price stability which the law sets as the MPC's overriding goal, but does not define precisely. Defining price stability is, he says, 'more an art than a science. . . but I don't think anyone in the world would consider that a rate of 2 per cent inflation (the current rate in France) is abnormal from the point of stability'. He is keen to dispel the charge of being 'a monetary Ayatollah' which some levelled at him last summer, when as director of the Tresor he fought to maintain the value of the franc against the D-Mark. He sees no contradiction between a rigorous anti-inflation policy and best possible borrowing terms on the markets. 'With all the financial markets interconnected, once you get outside the area of very short-term rates which can be controlled by a national monetary authority, your rates depend on a judgment by investors around the world. Your credibility and stability - if they are perceived as real by investors  -give you an immediate advantage in the market. (Central bank) independence is a plus for this credibility and stability.' Mr Trichet flourishes yield charts to show that, Japan apart, France has the lowest rates among the Group of Seven countries. Cautioning against recent errors in forecasting European or world growth trends, Mr Trichet nonetheless concedes that France is locked into continental Europe's current sluggish cycle. But he argues that France is well poised for faster growth because of the country's trade surplus, the good cash flow of its larger companies and the net creditor position of its households. Yet it seems most unlikely that the Bank of France will use its new independence to make a dash for growth - any more than it will make a dash for a partial monetary union in Europe. The Bank of France may now resemble the Bundesbank. 'But I refuse completely to engage in discussions of accelerating monetary union, a two-tier or a three-tier Europe. . . We have got to make Maastricht live and apply it scrupulously, and this I intend to do with Hans Tietmeyer (the Bundesbank president), with Eddie George (the Bank of England governor) and my nine other European central bank colleagues.'</p>

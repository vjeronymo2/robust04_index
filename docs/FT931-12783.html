			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y debt restructure gains approval OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments is set to emerge from bankruptcy protection on February 1 following approval of a CDollars 8.6bn (USDollars 6.71bn) debt restructuring plan by the bulk of its creditors. However, the revamped O&amp;Y will be a pale shadow of what was the world's biggest property developer before it sought court protection last May. The Reichmann family will remain O&amp;Y's sole shareholders. But they will enjoy little economic benefit from their interest and will be stripped of any real authority over the company. Day-to-day control will pass to a court-appointed administrator, who is expected to be Mr Robert Lowe, a partner in the Toronto office of auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand and one of Canada's leading insolvency experts. O&amp;Y yesterday declined to confirm his appointment. The main unsecured creditor group, with claims totalling CDollars 9.4bn, voted in favour of O&amp;Y's proposals after an eight-hour meeting on Tuesday. The claims include contingent liabilities related to the Canary Wharf project in London, which has been under the care of an administrator since May. Of 35 lender groups which have voted over the past two weeks, 27 supported O&amp;Y's plan, while eight rejected it. The eight dissenting groups are not expected to oppose the Ontario court order which is still required to put the plan into force. However, the unsecured creditors, led by Citibank and Royal Bank of Canada, failed to press their demand that O&amp;Y water down provisions of the plan which grant sweeping releases to Reichmann family members from future claims and litigation. As one creditor lawyer noted, the lenders had to decide whether they were giving away more in the releases than they were gaining in other provisions of the plan. Rejection by the unsecured group would probably have resulted in liquidation of the company. Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, said the restructuring provided direction and stability for O&amp;Y's Canadian operations for the next five years, and allowed time to complete a reorganisation of the US assets. The US properties were not included in the court protection. Creditors are likely to seize several buildings in the US and Canada. Income from properties still nominally owned by O&amp;Y will be used to pay off the company's lenders. The main business of the revamped O&amp;Y will be property management, conducted through a new operating entity, to be called O&amp;Y Properties (OYP). OYP has secured contracts to manage several O&amp;Y buildings. Several of the Reichmann's longest-serving executives will leave O&amp;Y over the next few weeks. The new property-management arm is expected to be run jointly by Mr Philip Reichmann, nephew of O&amp;Y founder Mr Paul Reichmann, and by Mr Frank Hauer, Mr Reichmann's son-in-law.</p>

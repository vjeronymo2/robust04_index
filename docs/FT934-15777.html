			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: On top of the world US investors certainly seem to have started the quarter in some style. It appears thanks largely to them that the London market managed to shrug off disappointment at the lack of an interest rate cut at the Tory party conference and close the week at a new high. Of course, the possibility remains that base rates may be cut at the time of the Budget. UK investors may also not have fully grasped the possibility that, once down, rates could stay low for some time. Yet the market could be on dangerous ground if it is relying on foreign money to drive share prices higher meanwhile. In price/earnings terms London still looks cheap against Wall Street. Strip out the exceptional charges which have reduced US earnings in recent years, though, and the difference becomes much smaller. There is thus less logic than immediately appears in US investors diversifying into the UK because valuations in their own market are stretched. It is hard to imagine a correction on Wall Street which did not affect London and other international markets as well. Similarly, at some point one must question the link between bond yields and share prices. It is all well and good to claim that lower long-term interest rates allow shares to trade on a higher multiple. But companies must also deliver the earnings growth implicit in their rating. That will not be easy if bond yields are low because poor world growth prospects will keep inflation at bay. The actual results reported by UK companies during the interim season may validate the market's recent rise: the generally cautious tone of accompanying trading statements does not suggest much room for more.</p>

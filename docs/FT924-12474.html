			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Italy seeks Ecu8bn stand-by EC loan ITALY has asked for a special stand-by loan of Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.3bn) from its European Community partners, but the EC is likely to impose strict budgetary conditions before it agrees to the request. The Italian government announced it had begun talks on a loan facility at the beginning of the month. In asking for Ecu8bn, Italy has sought the maximum funding possible from its Community partners to offset the loss of reserves supporting the lira last month. The figure is considerably higher than the Ecu5bn which had been mentioned unofficially. Rome has indicated its willingness to accept EC conditions. Commission officials said yesterday that in practice a maximum of Ecu10bn was available to Italy under rules which allow the EC to help countries experiencing balance of payments problems or adverse capital movements.</p>

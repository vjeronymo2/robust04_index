"Clearly, (Super) 301 is, as is well known, an option," White  House Counselor David Gergen said, referring to the lapsed trade  law that allows Washington to take a strong hand in retaliating  against unfair trade practices.    Gergen, speaking briefly with a group of Japanese reporters,  said Clinton has yet to make a decision on what measures  Washington will take following the collapse of top-level trade  talks. The president "will sit down with his advisers in the  next few days to talk about that," Gergen said.    Clinton collided head-on with Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa in a meeting in Washington last Friday on ways  to reduce Japan's trade surplus and open up Japanese markets to  foreign goods.    Clinton vowed Thursday to pursue an aggressive policy to  open  markets he described as the "most closed" among industrial  nations.    While gearing up for a new offensive in increasingly  acrimonious trade disputes with Tokyo, the Clinton  administration also took steps this week to sell its trade  policy directly to Japanese business leaders. Gergen said the  White House invited half a dozen top Japanese business  executives to meet with senior Clinton aides Tuesday to send a  message to Japan that Washington is not seeking "numerical  quotas" in promoting imports to Japan.    "We hope that they can help more people in Japan understand  the administration's position was not (after) numerical quotas.  We had a good discussion about that," Gergen said.    Among the Clinton aides who attended the hourlong meeting  were White House National Economic Council Director Robert Rubin  and his Deputy W. Bowman Cutter, Treasury Deputy Secretary Roger  Altman and White House Economist Alan Blinder.    The Japanese business executives, led by Yotaro Kobayashi,  chairman of Japan's Fuji Xerox Co., were in Washington for a  meeting with a U.S. business group involved in trade with Japan.</p>

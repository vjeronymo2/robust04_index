			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: King attacked over BAe order - Defence Questions LABOUR MPs accused the government in the Commons yesterday of using orders for defence equipment to strengthen the position of Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies at the coming general election. Mr Tom King, defence secretary, announced that the decision to place a Pounds 570m contract with British Aerospace Defence for the development and initial production of its advanced short range air-to-air missile (Asraam) would 'safeguard' 7,000 jobs. Mr Robert Hayward, who won his Kingswood constituency with a majority of 1,797 at the last general election, and Mr David Sumberg, returned for Bury South with a majority of 3,720, were among the Tory backbenchers who warmly welcomed the announcement. The minister stressed that the contract would bring welcome work not only to British Aerospace Dynamics Division factories in Stevenage and Lostock near Bolton, but also to its principal sub-contractors Hughes at Glenrothes in Scotland, Royal Ordnance at Kidderminster, Thorn EMI at Feltham, and Lucas at Bradford. Mr Patrick Ground (C Feltham and Heston), who did not participate in the exchanges, had a majority of 2,148. Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow defence secretary, pointed out that the announcement had come too late to save the jobs of 450 BAe employees who were told last month they were to be made redundant. In more strident tones, Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover) said the announcement had not really been about defence but about 'Tory marginals'. Mr King hit back by condemning the 'hypocrisy' of Labour MPs, whose party had voted for 'huge cuts' in defence expenditure and then criticised the government. The minister won further cheers from the Conservative benches when he told the House that HMS Vanguard, the first of the Trident submarines which are to replace the Polaris nuclear deterrent force, was set to roll out of the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow today. He confirmed that contract negotiations with Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering for the fourth Trident submarine were under way.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  parties decided Wednesday to offer a compromise on the  government's reform bills to the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) at a joint council of both Diet houses later in the  day, coalition sources said. On electoral reform, the  compromise would allow 300 seats in the House of Representatives  to be elected from single-seat constituencies and the remaining  200 seats through the proportional representation system,  according to the sources.    A political reform package submitted by the LDP and killed  in  the House of Representatives last November called for the lower  house to have 300 seats from single-seat constituencies and 171  elected through proportional representation.    The government-sponsored reform bills rejected by the House  of Councillors last week called for 274 seats from single-seat  constituencies and 226 through proportional representation.    Also, under the coalition's compromise plan, the  proportional  representation system will be based on 11 electoral divisions  covering the whole country, the sources said.    The proportional representation system in the LDP package  was  based on the existing 47 prefectures and that proposed in the  government-sponsored bills was based on a single national  electoral district.    Concerning political fund-raising, the ruling parties'  compromise plan allows some donations from companies and  organizations to individual politicians, which was banned in the  government package, the sources said.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest party  in the ruling coalition, was reluctant to agree to the loosening  of the restriction on donations, they said.    The ruling parties proposed to the LDP to hold the joint  council of both houses in a last-ditch effort to enact the bills  by Saturday [29 January], when the Diet closes.    If two-thirds of the 20-member joint panel agree on a  compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent to  plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The  bills would become law if passed by a majority vote of both the  houses.</p>

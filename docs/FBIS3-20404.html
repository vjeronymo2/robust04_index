			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release for the information media, not an </F> official record": "The IAEA Reviews the Safety of the Chernobyl  Nuclear Power Plant"]    [Text] An international expert safety assessment team  organized by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] has  concluded a visit to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to  examine the current safety situation. This team carried out its  mission during the period 7-17 March 1994.    The review team was composed of eight safety specialists  from  Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States  along with two safety experts from the IAEA and one from the  Group of 24 Nuclear Safety Coordination Secretariat in Brussels.  The review was agreed to by the Ukrainian authorities after the  Ukraine Government's October 1993 decision to postpone closure  of the Chernobyl station which had been scheduled for the end of  1993. Unit 1 which was placed into operation last week after a  three week maintenance outage is currently operating at 80  percent of its design power level of 1000 MW and Unit 3 at its  design level of 1000 MW.    The team examined the plant safety design and a number of  specific operational aspects. The review found numerous safety  deficiencies in the two units of the plant which remain  operational. Of particular concern are specific problems in the  design of the first generation Unit 1, which have not been dealt  with sufficiently.    In addition the experts identified a number of factors which  together affect overall safe plant operation. Difficult working  conditions and a serious continuing loss of highly skilled  personnel are major problems. Limited procurement of up-to-date  equipment also has a negative effect on safety.    A major problem is the technically confirmed accelerated  deterioration of the shelter enclosing the destroyed unit 4  reactor which, if it collapses, would have serious consequences.  These findings were discussed at the end of the review in Kiev  by the IAEA's Assistant Director General for nuclear safety, M.  Rosen, with the President of the nuclear power operating  organization (GCA), M.P. Umanetz.    The IAEA Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, has communicated  on  21 March to the President of Ukraine the conclusion that  international levels of safety are not being met at Chernobyl at  present. Considering the seriousness of the situation he has  suggested that the Ukraine convene a meeting of interested  countries parties to consider what actions could be taken to  alleviate the situation; the IAEA would be ready to assist the  Ukraine in arranging such a meeting in Vienna if so requested.    The President of Ukraine, Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, responded  favourably to these suggestions in a reply dated 30 March 1994.  Expressing thanks to the expert group for their work, he  emphasized that the results of this work were considered by the  Ukrainian Government to be a significant input to the objective  evaluation of the safety level of the Chernobyl nuclear plant.  It is anticipated that a meeting will accordingly be convened  in Vienna in the second half of April.</p>

			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Metalrax advances to Pounds 4.11m Metalrax Group, the precision components, houseware and storage equipment group, increased pre-tax profits by 15 per cent from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 4.11m in the six months to June 30, on sales which rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 38.88m. Mr John Wardle, chairman, said only a very small proportion of the profits rise was due to acquisitions, of which the full benefit would be seen next year and thereafter. Mr Wardle said: 'Despite conflicting evidence as to the strength of the apparent recovery and the dubious optimism very naturally shown by official pronouncements, life continues to be very difficult at the sharp end of manufacturing industry.

Earnings per share grew by 15 per cent to 3p (2.6p). The interim dividend rose by 10 per cent to 1p (adjusted 0.91p).</p>

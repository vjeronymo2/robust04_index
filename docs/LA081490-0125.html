			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> TICKETS, PLEASE: The Irvine Barclay Theatre is giving new meaning to the term  "advance sales." . . . Tickets are already available for the 750-seat theater  on the edge of the UC Irvine campus, even though it's still under construction.  Because the theater is the size of a small Broadway playhouse, "we encourage  people to purchase their tickets early to make sure they get seats," says UCI's  Barbara Davidson. . . . The first performance, Nov. 2, will feature the Bella  Lewitzky Dance Co. introducing a dance honoring UCI's 25th anniversary.  Kristina Lindgren and John Needham  </P></p>

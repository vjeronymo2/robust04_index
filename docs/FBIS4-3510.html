			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A new political  organization - the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance - came into  being here today.    Five convenors of the Alliance Yu Sun Say, Ambrose Lau Hon  Chuen, Fanny Lai Ip Po Ping, Carson Wen and Au Yeung Sing Shiu  jointly made the announcement at a press conference here this  afternoon.    The organizing committee of the Alliance, comprising 52 Hong  Kong businessmen and professionals, is ready to admit founding  members and plans to take part in the 1994 and 1995 elections at  all levels in the territory.    Ambrose Lau Hon Chuen said after 1997, China will implement  the policy of "one country, two systems" in the Hong Kong  Special Adminstrative Region which will then be governed by the  Hong Kong people with a high degree of autonomy.    "The committee believes that those who wish to stay in Hong  Kong and take part in the building of the territory's future  should organize themselves to participate in political  activities to ensure the effective implementation of the  said-policies and a smooth transition, and to maintain the  stability and prosperity of Hong Kong," Lau said.    He noted that the Alliance advocates the importance of  building a good relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese  Mainland and to create a stable environment for businessmen to  invest in Hong Kong.    Lau stated that his organization promotes communication with  the mainland, and intends to adopt an open and positive attitude  in giving constructive views to the Chinese leaders on matters  relating to Hong Kong.    The alliance supports the development of a democratic  government, but takes a pragmatic approach and gives due  consideration to the historical situation, lau said, adding it  believes that democratic development should follow the  principles of even participation and orderly progress, so as not  to unduly disrupt the harmony and stability of the society.    In another development, two other organizations - the United  Democrats of Hong Kong and meeting point - announced on Monday  [18 April] that they would merge to form a single party - the  Democratic Party in Hong Kong in October.</p>

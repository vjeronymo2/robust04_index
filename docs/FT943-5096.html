			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Aitken targets housing benefit Housing benefit will be at the centre of government cost-cutting in the autumn public spending round, Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, signalled yesterday. Mr Aitken, a rightwinger who replaced Mr Michael Portillo in the summer cabinet reshuffle, identified the Pounds 80bn social security budget as the key target for cuts. 'There are areas such as the exponential growth in housing benefit where you have to look very carefully to make sure taxpayers' money is not being wasted,' he said. Mr Aitken said that 'quite a lot' of housing benefit recipients were 'living in houses that are too big for them' or had spare rooms. He also accused landlords of 'pushing up' private-sector rents to exploit the level of housing benefit payments. Mr Aitken also told the BBC in a radio interview that the Pounds 15bn running costs of Whitehall were a key target for efficiency savings. 'If you look hard at back-office expenses in the light of best business techniques and in the light of bringing in private finance, we can make some substantial expenditure cuts,' he said. Mr Aitken's comments suggest the Treasury is pressing Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to aim housing benefit more accurately at low-income families. The cost of housing benefit has grown from Pounds 3.75bn in 1988-89 to an estimated Pounds 8.5bn last year. The Treasury forecasts a figure of nearly Pounds 11bn by 1995-96 on current trends. Labour said the increased cost was caused by unemployment and low pay, combined with big increases in local authority and housing association rents. Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief secretary, accused the government of 'threatening' housing benefit recipients to cover its failure to reduce public spending as a proportion of gross domestic product. In a policy paper published in response to Mr Aitken's comments, Labour said that social security costs had increased by Pounds 17.5bn in real terms over the last five years. 'This staggering increase is the price we are all paying, in the form of higher taxes, for the recession and the government's economic incompetence,' the paper said. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said Mr Aitken's 'prescription of hounding the vulnerable is a sickening reminder that the rightwing is alive and kicking.'</p>

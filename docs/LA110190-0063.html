			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMMAN JUST ANOTHER QUIET TOWN AS GULF CRISIS RECEDES;  </P> <P> JORDAN: MOST ASIAN REFUGEES HAVE DEPARTED. SADDAMANIA COOLS. DESPAIR OVER THE  ECONOMY LESSENS.  </P> <P> A month ago, the Biggest Show in the Middle East was playing Amman, with  high-wire drama and eye-catching color filling every inch of the tent:  </P> <P> In Ring No. 1, the tragic spectacle of tens of thousands of Asian refugees from  Kuwait and Iraq, swarming for food and shelter in pitiful camps on the  Jordanian desert.  </P> <P> In Ring 2, Saddamania, the magical explosion of popular support for the Iraqi  president. Saddam Hussein seemed to look out on Jordan from every shop window  and utility pole, a face in the hall of mirrors.  </P> <P> And in the center ring, the grand finale, announced with fanfare by the  government of Jordan, the economy of a modern state disappearing before the  very eyes of the audience.  </P> <P> That was then. Last weekend, the first rains of winter ran through the streets  and gullies of this hilly capital of white-rock homes. On the crowded streets  dipping past the old mosque in the sunken center of the city, hundreds of taxis  trolled for leg-weary shoppers. Not one carried a poster of the Iraqi president  on its rear windshield.  </P> <P> The season was changing, and the Big Show was gone.  </P> <P> Amman, always quiet for a population of 830,000, has returned to its leisurely,  small-town pace. The Persian Gulf crisis still touches the city, and many of  the problems and some of the passion remain, but the spotlight has passed.  </P> <P> The Hotel Jordan Intercontinental, packed to the rafters with foreign  journalists a month ago, has shut two of its three restaurants for renovations.  In the last, on the rooftop, a Jordanian blonde sings "La Cucaracha" to  Japanese television crews.  </P> <P> The Information Ministry calls reporters, pushing interviews with government  officials who could not be reached in late September or early October.  </P> <P> A month ago, arrival at Amman's Queen Alia International Airport was like a  descent into Bombay or Dhaka: Thousands of Asian refugees, women of the  subcontinent in exotic saris, filled every corner of the terminals.  </P> <P> Waiting for check-in with their life's belongings in cheap suitcases and  cardboard boxes, curled in sleep on chairs and lounges, washing their feet in  restroom sinks -- all the indignities of the refugee trail were borne with  resignation and, sometimes, airport humor.  </P> <P> More than 100,000 Asians have left the Middle East through Jordan since the  Iraqi army invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, uprooting through force and fear a way of  life dependent on imported labor. But the transit camps that once held tens of  thousands, sometimes for weeks, now average between 200 and 400, and refugees  rarely stay for more than 24 hours.  </P> <P> An encampment of Bangladeshis on the airport road -- formerly rows of canvas  and blue plastic tents and rudimentary showers and toilets just feet from the  traffic lanes -- is nearly vacant. Just a few families are waiting to arrange  passage home. In the city, near the U.S. Embassy, the little sari-sari  businesses of Filipino refugees -- some soap, combs and barrettes for sale on a  towel spread on the sidewalk -- are gone, along with their operators.  </P> <P> About a mile away, at the Iraqi Embassy, functionaries no longer dodge through  the steel office door with arms full of posters of their president to  distribute. A Jordanian official said his government had nothing to do with the  posters' disappearance.  </P> <P> In conversation, most Jordanians, particularly the Palestinians, still support  the Baghdad government, and both the Arab- and English-language editorialists  bash away at Washington and London. But the hoopla of the pro-Iraqi movement --  the organized aspect, anyway -- has cooled with the climate. No major  demonstrations have been staged for at least two weeks.  </P> <P> The passion of the Palestinian community, diplomats note, was distracted by the  more personal issue of the deaths of 20 Palestinians in Jerusalem on Oct. 8 and  the violence that has followed.  </P> <P> Jordan's King Hussein, meanwhile, steers a middle course and remains an icon of  stability. Only two things could threaten his rule, one diplomat said: a  complete collapse of the economy or, politically, "if he makes a U-turn in  heavy traffic" -- meaning to go sharply against Iraq.  </P> <P> And although the economic numbers remain dismal, even the economy seems less a  topic of despair now that the initial shock has been psychologically absorbed.  </P> <P> Despite the popular tilt to Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis, King Hussein's  government closed the doors to Baghdad, its No. 1 trading partner. Two weeks  ago the last operation defying the U.N. embargo -- voluntary shipments of food  and medicine from political sympathizers -- was shut down.  </P> <P> American officials asked about the continued movement of Jordanian trucks into  Iraq and were granted a look inside. They confirmed the Jordanian account: The  trucks, suspicious because they were refrigerated, were crossing the border  empty and returning with the household furnishings of Jordanian and Palestinian  refugees.  </P> <P> But no Jordanian trucks are crossing the Saudi border. Other reasons were  given, but Saudi pique at the Jordanian position on the political crisis has  caused closure of the border to the once-profitable trade in fruit and  vegetables for the oil countries of the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> And the Riyadh government has yet to resume pumping oil to Jordan, cut off in a  politically colored contract squabble in late September. (Jordan receives most  of its oil from Iraq, in an internationally accepted exception to the embargo.)  </P> <P> This week Swissair, Austrian Airlines and Alitalia, the Italian carrier, ended  their service to Amman. The general drop in tourism in the troubled Middle East  was blamed, and service cancellations are likely to accentuate the problem.  </P></p>

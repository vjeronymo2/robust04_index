			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The King Has Approved the </F> Constitution"]    [Text] On Thursday [17 February] in Brussels the presidents  of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, the government, and  the King signed the new constitutional text, drawn up in the  wake of the latest institutional changes.    This text is a more readable, coordinated, and renumbered  version of the old constitutional texts and includes the changes  introduced by the St. Michel agreements. It was adopted  definitively by the Senate on 3 February and issued in a special  edition of the MONITEUR, published yesterday afternoon. Liberal  MPs, both French-speaking and Flemish-speaking, did not take  part in the ceremonies surrounding the signature of the new text.    For the PRL [Republican Party of Liberty]-FDF [Radical  Liberal Party--Democratic Front of Brussels French speakers]  Federation, yesterday was a "black day for Belgium and a day of  mourning for French speakers." Their MPs point out in  particular that, in their eyes, the new institutions will  encourage the separatist current in Flanders and organize the  division of the French speakers.</p>

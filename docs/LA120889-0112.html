			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ACCEPTS U.S. CALL FOR THREE-WAY PEACE TALKS  </P> <P> On the eve of the Palestinian uprising's second anniversary, Prime Minister  Yitzhak Shamir accepted a U.S. call for talks by Egyptian, American and Israeli  officials as a step toward peace, a spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> Shamir called a meeting today of the four top Cabinet ministers to approve  sending Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to the talks, Israel TV reported.  </P> <P> The "forum of four" includes Shamir and Arens of the right-wing Likud Party and  two left-leaning Labor Party members, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense  Minister Yitzhak Rabin.  </P> <P> The moves came as the Israeli army clamped an indefinite curfew on 750,000  Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip to block protests linked to today's  anniversary.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir gave the prime minister's response  to the proposed meeting in Washington after U.S. officials announced that Egypt  had agreed to the meeting.  </P> <P> "If the Americans believe it is a full response and want to see where we go  from here, we'll go in January to the meeting of the three foreign ministers,"  Ahimeir said.  </P> <P> U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged the three-way meeting to pave  the way for Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo on Israel's initiative for  elections in the West Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> Ahimeir said that Israel still had not seen the full text of Egypt's reply and  hoped that the Washington meeting could answer questions about Cairo's stance.  </P> <P> "It will be important to determine what Egypt's intentions are, and the ability  to advance the peace initiative as Israel has proposed, to hold elections," he  said.  </P></p>

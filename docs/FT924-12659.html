			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Pressure eases on government THE DECISION to delay closure of 21 mines is likely to ease immediate strains on the public sector borrowing requirement, but do little to dent overall pressures on government borrowing caused by the recession, Peter Marsh writes. Even after yesterday's change of heart by the government, the Treasury faces mounting problems with the PSBR, which is likely to reach more than Pounds 30bn in 1992-93. It could climb to as much as Pounds 40bn the year after, largely as a result of weaker tax revenues and increased spending on social security sparked by the economic slowdown. Mr Andrew Glyn, an Oxford University economist, believes that the shutdown of 31 mines under the government's plans of last week would have added Pounds 1.4bn to this year's PSBR, with roughly Pounds 600m added to the figure in the following year. Mr Glyn arrived at these figures by considering compensation payments for miners who would have lost their jobs. He added benefits for workers who would have become unemployed in other industries affected by the pit closures, and tax revenues foregone as a result of lower economic activity in the regions affected. After yesterday's announcement, the immediate effect will be to reduce substantially the Pounds 820m which British Coal had set aside for compensation payments to the 30,000 miners who would have been affected by last week's closure programme.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> ASSAULT SUSPECT HELD ON $250,000 BAIL  </P> <P> An Oxnard man was being held Monday on suspicion of assault with a deadly  weapon after family members said he threatened them with a knife.  </P> <P> Oxnard police responded to a domestic disturbance in the 1400 block of West  Juniper Street about 8 p.m. Sunday and heard someone screaming inside the  house, Sgt. Fred Berry said.  </P> <P> Officers forced their way in, Berry said, and found Roger Urango, 35, waving a  knife at his wife, Amelia, 30, father-in-law, Joe Hernandez, 53, and two  children.  </P> <P> After a brief standoff, the officers persuaded Urango to surrender. No one was  injured.  </P> <P> Urango was being held at the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of assault with a  deadly weapon and two misdemeanor drug offenses. Normal bail for the assault  charge is $5,000, a jail official said, but because of the nature of the  offense investigators persuaded a judge to increase Urango's bail to $250,000.

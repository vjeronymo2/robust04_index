			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MILES HELPS PASADENA OUTDISTANCE GLENDALE  </P> <P> Everyone knew about the big, bad Wolf, Pasadena City College's highly touted  tailback Wolf-Payne Barber, but it was the lesser-known Ostell Miles who  provided the crucial yardage in Pasadena's 17-7 victory over Glendale Saturday  in a nonconference opener.  </P> <P> Miles scored Pasadena's first touchdown on a first-quarter, one-yard plunge and  finished with 107 yards in 12 carries.  </P> <P> Barber, meanwhile, didn't get untracked until the second half and finished with  54 yards.  </P> <P> Glendale Coach John Cicuto was not surprised.  </P> <P> "I think they have great running backs at this school," Cicuto said.  </P> <P> Glendale didn't get untracked until the second half against a Pasadena team  picked as the fourth best in the country in one preseason poll.  </P> <P> Glendale scored with 5 minutes 24 seconds left in the third quarter when Bobby  Webster danced around right end on a four-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Webster's run climaxed a 12-play, 80-yard drive in which Glendale relied on the  power running of fullback Wes Bender and the speed of Webster.  </P> <P> Webster finished with 91 yards to lead Glendale, and Bender had 53 yards.  </P> <P> Glendale threatened to pull within a touchdown late in the game. Robert Floyd  intercepted a pass from Pasadena's Ken Edwards and returned the ball to the  Pasadena 26.  </P> <P> However, on the next play, Glendale quarterback Marco Arcipreste's pass was  intercepted.  </P> <P> Glendale later drove to the Pasadena 22 with less than two minutes left, but  Arcipreste threw another interception and Pasadena ran out the clock.  </P> <P> "I think Marco is going to develop," said Cicuto, who also played quarterback  Cole Speer in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Arcipreste finished with 80 passing yards and Speer threw for 23 yards.  </P> <P> "This team can be a good team if they become more disciplined on both sides of  the ball," Cicuto said.  </P></p>

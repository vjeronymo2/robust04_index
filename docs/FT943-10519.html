			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: PowerGen buys back 2.5m shares Shares in the electricity sector moved ahead strongly after PowerGen, the power generation company, said it had repurchased for cancellation 2.5m of its own equity. The market welcomed PowerGen's purchase, which represents 0.3 per cent of the total shares in issue, on the grounds that it will boost earnings per share and is likely to lift dividend payments. Shares in other companies in the sector were affected by the positive sentiment. All of them have taken powers at recent annual general meetings to buy back shares. PowerGen is only the second electricity company to do so, the other being Eastern Electricity. PowerGen has shareholder approval to buy back 10 per cent of its equity. The company said yesterday it would consider further repurchases in the coming months as market circumstances permitted. Analysts calculated that if it repurchased the full 10 per cent, earnings could be increased by between 5 and 6.5 per cent within a year. PowerGen has low gearing, with net debt at the end of last year at Pounds 282m and likely to fall this year unless the company spends significant amounts of money on acquisitions. Some brokers saw yesterday's purchases, made at 527p, as a signal to the market that the company does not see opportunities for large acquisitions. Others felt that it was a possible precursor for the company seeking an American Depositary Receipts listing in the US to enhance the marketability of its shares. Yesterday's buybacks will please the Treasury since the possibility of further buybacks is likely to provide support for PowerGen's shares in the run-up to the government's sale of its remaining 40 per cent in the company, probably in October. Shares in the regional electricity companies were also lifted yesterday by hopes that the review of their distribution businesses by the industry regulatory may be less severe than was previously feared.

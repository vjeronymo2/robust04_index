			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia's commodity exports to rise by 8% THE VALUE of Australia's commodity exports is forecast to rise to ADollars 47.3bn (USDollars 34bn) in 1992-93, 8 per cent higher than the previous year. The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, based the forecast on the lower value of the Australian dollar, which it put at an average 72 US cents in 1992-93. Top exports in 1992-93 are forecast to be coal (ADollars 7.1bn), gold (ADollars 4.2bn), wool (ADollars 3.6bn) and iron ore (ADollars 2.9bn). Mr Paul O'Mara, Abare's manager for economic policy analysis, said prices of Australian wool and beef would rise during the year. Wheat, coarse grains and sugar prices would fall because of forecast higher world grain and sugar production. Mr O'Mara said the net value of farm production during the year was expected to be ADollars 1.5bn, up 3 per cent from the previous year but still well below the average of around ADollars 4bn in the late 1980s. Australia's gold output will stay high at over 238 tonnes in calendar 1992 and decline only slightly to 234 tonnes in 1993, according to Abare. 'These relatively high production levels reflect the effectiveness of the Australian industry in addressing the joint problems of cost pressures and low spot prices,' Abare said. The bureau expects world gold prices to average USDollars 350 a troy ounce in 1992, a decline of 3.3 per cent from 1991.</p>

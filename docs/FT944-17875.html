			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Firms wary over share-deal curbs London-based securities firms reacted with caution yesterday to plans by the Stock Exchange to suspend trading in individual stocks if there is evidence that price-sensitive information has leaked. Few would welcome an increase in the number of share suspensions in the London market, where such moves are significantly less common than on Wall Street. Although they do not expect the plan to promote much change in current trading practice, City stockbrokers agree privately that existing market regulation could benefit from more frequent use of the exchange's power to suspend trading in shares seen to be behaving abnormally. The exchange monitors share price movements widely on a regular basis, but share suspension has in the past been used sparingly in London. Objectors to a more aggressive share suspension policy point out that suspension penalises all holders of the stock, as well as potential investors or, as one dealer said, 'a host of people who had nothing to do with the original offence'. He added that suspension 'should only be used as a last resort'. More frequent share suspensions could also sit awkwardly with London's marketmaking system, which depends on the willingness of marketmaking firms to take on very big positions in individual stocks. A dealer said: 'Unexpected suspension of a share could leave the marketmaker in a very difficult situation, unable to unwind his position through the market.' The exchange plan seeks to meet these objections by introducing a pre-suspension process, taking the share through stages of 'market alert' and 'trading halt' before imposing full suspension.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOST IN SPACE;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE FUTURE OF THE U.S. COMMERCIAL ROCKET LAUNCH INDUSTRY IS SO  UNCERTAIN THAT SOME BELIEVE WE MAY LOSE YET ANOTHER HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY TO  FOREIGN COMPETITORS.  </P> <P> One day last summer, in a government office in Brazil's capital city, European  business people taught McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. a painful lesson in  the competitive realities of the new commercial rocket industry.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach aerospace giant, which builds the Delta II rocket, was in  a tough fight with Arianespace Inc. of France for a $100-million-plus contract  to launch two Brazilian telecommunications satellites. Owned in part by the  French government, Arianespace already launches about half of the world's  commercial satellites.  </P> <P> The Brazilians wanted more than just a good price; they also wanted help in  developing their own rocket industry. Reckoning that the competing bids would  be close, McDonnell Douglas offered what it considered a rock-bottom price,  with a kicker: It would finance the graduate education of two Brazilian rocket  engineers and share some of its work on the planned U.S. space station.  </P> <P> But when Arianespace unveiled its offer, McDonnell Douglas was stunned. With  the apparent assent of the French government, the European company offered to  give away its Viking rocket engine technology to Brazil, something the  Americans viewed as a possible violation of international agreements on arms  trafficking and the spread of missile technology. In addition, the French  shaved the American bid by about $5 million.  </P> <P> Last month, Brazil selected Arianespace for final negotiations.  </P> <P> The apparent loss of the Brazilian launch contract underscores a growing  concern within government and industry circles. Nearly a decade after the  Ronald Reagan Administration took the first steps to spur development of  commercial launch businesses, the nascent industry is struggling to survive. In  the view of many experts, decisive government action is needed to keep it from  crashing.  </P> <P> The problems that threaten commercial rocket builders are so many and the  outlook so uncertain that some government officials talk openly of losing yet  another high-tech industry to foreign competitors.  </P> <P> "We're going to be taken out of the market if we don't do something about it,"  said Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, whose department is  responsible for the licensing and promotion of the U.S. commercial launch  industry.  </P> <P> C. J. Waylan, whose Virginia-based GTE Spacenet Corp. owns and operates six  telecommunications satellites launched into orbit by Arianespace, was even more  blunt:  </P> <P> "We have lost our way in space," Waylan said.  </P> <P> To ensure its position in the world launch market, experts suggest that the  United States consider major policy changes, including improved government  procurement practices, significantly increased public financing of rocket  research and the possible creation of a multicompany consortium to promote and  direct American commercial launches.  </P> <P> While America's national space policy bars direct federal subsidies of U.S.  rocket makers, foreign competitors often benefit from direct government  assistance. Industry watchers say the most serious threat comes from the Soviet  Union and China, which are signing up commercial customers for launches at  cut-rate prices.  </P> <P> In the long run, experts contend, the most promising way to improve U.S.  competitiveness in the field will be to develop new, more efficient rockets.  But research costs are staggering -- apparently too staggering for any one  company to bear.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, long-term market prospects are far from assured. The backlog of  worldwide satellite launches created by the 1986 explosion of the U.S. space  shuttle Challenger will abate by 1992. After that, "the market we see is 15 to  20 (satellite launches) a year, worldwide," said Alan M. Lovelace, who heads  General Dynamics Space Systems Division.  </P> <P> "It's so thin you can see through it."  </P> <P> The stakes in the fight for dominance in the commercial space market are high,  both for the nation and Southern California.  </P> <P> Two of the three major U.S. rocket builders are headquartered in Southern  California -- McDonnell Douglas Space Systems, which employs 8,200 people in  its Orange County plant, and General Dynamics Space Systems Division, which  builds Atlas rockets in San Diego. Martin Marietta Corp. builds the Titan  family of rockets outside Denver.  </P> <P> Last August, McDonnell Douglas launched the first U.S. commercial rocket to  carry a private payload into orbit.  </P> <P> In addition, Los Angeles County is home to Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of  General Motors that builds about half of the world's non-military satellites.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy Issues  </P> <P> Many experts believe that the federal government is largely to blame for  problems facing the industry in its commercial ventures.  </P> <P> The most commonly cited sins are red tape in government procurement and  uncertain, conflicting policies toward commercial space at the Department of  Transportation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the  Department of Defense, particularly within the Air Force.  </P> <P> But the overriding issue the federal government must face, many experts say, is  that the Reagan-era policy of barring federal subsidies to the industry has  left it unable to compete with foreign launch concerns.  </P> <P> "The idea, which I think was flawed, was that you could turn this over to the  private sector and they could survive without any further support," said Steven  D. Dorfman, vice president of Hughes Aircraft. "That's true if the other  nations are playing on the same type of field. But they aren't."  </P> <P> Already, industry watchers say, some of the major rocket builders appear to be  losing their enthusiasm for the commercial market.  </P> <P> A Washington lobbyist for one of the Big Three companies told a congressional  staff member recently that the company was concentrating on capturing a larger  share of U.S. government contracts because of the difficulties of competing  against foreign commercial launchers.  </P> <P> Another company, Martin Marietta, has become so disillusioned that it virtually  has abandoned commercial customers, one consultant recently charged. While a  company spokeswoman disputed that view, she acknowledged that Martin Marietta  from now on will focus its attention on launching non-military government  payloads for clients such as NASA.  </P> <P> General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas, meanwhile, insist that they are in the  commercial launch business to stay, although they concede that they will remain  largely dependent on government launch contracts.  </P> <P> "Could the Delta line be kept open solely on commercial launches?" asked Thomas  E. Williams, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems' senior manager for  communications. "Realistically, at this time, no it couldn't."  </P> <P> If the Big Three rocket makers are struggling, a host of small, new  rocket-launching concerns literally are fighting for their lives.  </P> <P> Space Sciences Inc. of Houston, American Rocket Co. of Camarillo, and Orbital  Sciences Inc. of Fairfax, Va., are three of the new companies seeking a share  of the market for suborbital and light-payload launches, usually for scientific  experiments. Space Sciences is headed by former astronaut Deke Slayton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Space Shuttle Legacy  </P> <P> The newcomers are among the most vocal critics of the conflicts that sometimes  arise within the government, particularly between the Air Force, which operates  the major government launch facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida and  Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the Department of Transportation,  which licenses their use by commercial launchers.  </P> <P> Most industry watchers say the crisis facing the commercial space launch  industry can be traced to decisions the federal government made more than a  decade ago.  </P> <P> When NASA began developing plans for the space shuttle in the early 1970s, the  agency believed that its new, reusable "space truck" would render rockets --  expendable launch vehicles, in NASA jargon -- obsolete. The shuttle was to  become the United States' only means of launching large government and  commercial satellites into space.  </P> <P> At the time, there was no commercial rocket industry. The U.S. government,  usually NASA or the Department of Defense, bought rockets from McDonnell  Douglas, Martin Marietta or General Dynamics, either for weapons systems or  satellites. The contractor delivered the rocket, and the government took charge  of the launch.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration began to envision a role for  privately launched rockets in the commercial development of space. In 1984,  Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act, which set up a licensing  system for commercial launches under the auspices of the Department of  Transportation and outlined procedures for the use of government launch pads by  private entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> But business lagged, largely because NASA offered cut-rate prices on the space  shuttle to commercial customers who wanted to put satellites into orbit.  </P> <P> The business climate changed dramatically after January, 1986, when the Space  Shuttle Challenger blew up. The accident halted shuttle operations for more  than two years and created a tremendous backlog of unlaunched satellites, both  government and commercial.  </P> <P> In August, 1986, Reagan made a sharp turnabout and banned all but a few  commercial satellites from the shuttle, citing the risk of shuttle operations  and the backlog of military payloads. Two years later, he unveiled a national  space policy that put a heavy emphasis on the commercial development of space,  and Congress put more muscle in the space launch act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreign Competition  </P> <P> But the moves may have come too late. While the United States was slowly moving  to create a domestic commercial launch industry, the Europeans were blasting  ahead.  </P> <P> Arianespace, which bills itself as the "world's first commercial space  transportation company," came into being in 1980, as the United States was  making plans to phase out its fleet of Delta, Atlas and Titan rockets in favor  of the space shuttle.  </P> <P> A third of Arianespace is owned by the French space agency. Arianespace  launches its rockets from a facility in French Guiana built by the French  government in the 1960s, and later expanded by the European Space Agency.  </P> <P> ESA, which is supported by 14 member governments, began developing the Ariane  family of rockets as an alternative to the shuttle. It has turned over to  Arianespace the plans, equipment and tooling needed to manufacture the  launchers. ESA now is working on the Ariane 5, at a cost of about $5 billion,  with the specific goal of creating a more efficient rocket that will reduce  launch costs.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, long America's arch rival in military space  ventures, has been aggressively marketing satellite launches on its Proton  rocket at cut-rate prices.  </P> <P> According to the Congressional Research Service, the Soviets are pricing a  Proton launch for a medium-sized satellite at about $30 million. That is  substantially less than the cost of a U.S. commercial launch, which is  generally estimated at from $50 million to $70 million for a medium-sized  payload, such as a communications satellite, excluding insurance.  </P> <P> So far, the Soviets have launched only one commercial satellite, for India,  because the U.S. State Department in 1987 ruled that satellites containing  high-tech components made in the United States cannot be launched on Soviet  rockets.  </P> <P> But last November, Energetics Inc. of Englewood, Colo., signed a contract with  the Soviets for up to eight launches of very small, inexpensive satellites that  will track trucks or buses as they travel across the Earth.  </P> <P> On April 7, China inaugurated its commercial space program by launching into  orbit on a Long March III rocket a telecommunications satellite manufactured in  the United States by Hughes Aircraft. The launch price has been estimated at  from $30 million to $40 million.  </P> <P> The launch provoked a storm of protest by U.S. launch concerns, who argued that  the subsidized price offered by the Chinese unfairly undercut the competition.  </P> <P> The Japanese are developing their own commercial rocket, the H-2, and the  Australians are considering an entry into the commercial launch business by  building their own spaceport at Cape York with the help of several American  firms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Corrective Efforts  </P> <P> Faced with the mounting competition, Congress and the Administration are  struggling to forge new commercial space initiatives to keep U.S. rocket  companies in the running for international contracts.  </P> <P> Closely watched is work under way at the National Space Council, the agency  that President Bush resurrected last year to sort out the nation's goals in  space. The council is chaired by the vice president.  </P> <P> In January, the Space Council began a review of the nation's policy toward the  commercial exploitation of space. Among the issues the council is expected to  examine are the extent to which foreign governments subsidize foreign launch  concerns, U.S. government procurement practices and the role of private firms  in future U.S. space exploration, including the planned mission to Mars.  </P> <P> An attempt to reduce launch costs is at the heart of legislation introduced  last year by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad). Packard believes that NASA and the  Department of Defense could help American rocket makers reduce the cost of  their commercial launches if the government agencies would more closely tailor  their procurement policies to the commercial model.  </P> <P> Another step the government could take to lower short-term launch costs is  buying rockets in bulk, experts suggested. Bulk buying is a favorite idea of  James Rose, the NASA official responsible for a wide-ranging program to develop  the space industries that one day will expand the market for commercial launch  services.  </P> <P> In the long run, however, many in the industry believe that the government  needs to fundamentally revise its relationship with the commercial launch  industry and rethink its prohibitions against federal subsidies and cooperative  action among domestic rocket makers.  </P> <P> At the Department of Transportation, Skinner has formed a task force to study  what role, if any, the federal government should take in the development of new  launch complexes to exclusively serve commercial rockets.  </P> <P> Because there are no private U.S. launch facilities, commercial rocket builders  must lease time on crowded government launch pads. Delays in government  launches have a domino effect and can wreak havoc with commercial launch  schedules.  </P> <P> One of the more radical proposals comes from Waylan, the president of GTE  Spacenet, who suggests that the government allow domestic rocket builders to  create a new company that would buy rockets from the manufacturers and then  sell launch services to commercial customers throughout the world. The new  company would be owned largely by the Big Three, but also by other investors.  </P> <P> Others have suggested a more traditional model analogous to the old National  Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, the forerunner to NASA. Such an organization  would sponsor basic research and development that ultimately could be used by  the commercial industry, just as NACA did for the commercial aviation business.  </P> <P> NASA and the Air Force are spending some funds on development of a new, large  rocket called the ALS, or Advanced Launch System. But critics say the level of  commitment is low. For the 1991 fiscal year, the Bush Administration is asking  only $114 million for work on ALS.  </P> <P> If the government does not do more to promote development of new, less  expensive rockets and launch facilities, industry experts fear, the United  States will be left in the dust in the race for commercial space.  </P> <P> For that reason, development of a new relationship between government and the  rocket industry seems inevitable, said Dorfman, the Hughes Aircraft vice  president.  </P> <P> "I'm not a big supporter of government handouts," Dorfman said, but "I think  that when people become aware of the reality, as opposed to the ideology,  they're going to see that it is important to the nation."  </P></p>

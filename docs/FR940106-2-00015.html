			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We compared individual home market prices with the monthly COPs. We tested the home market prices on a sieve-size-specific basis and found, for certain sieve sizes, that between 10 and 90 percent of sales of each in the home market were made at prices above the COP. Therefore, we disregarded the below-cost sales for those sieve sizes, if those sales were made over an extended period of time. Minasligas did not provide any information in its responses to indicate that its below cost sales were made at prices which would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. In order to determine whether below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis on a product-specific basis: (1) If respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that month below the COP, or (2) if respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below the COP during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended period of time. All of Minasligas' below cost sales were made over an extended period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Minasligas, we based FMV on home market prices. We calculated FMV based on ex-factory prices, inclusive of packing, to unrelated customers. We deducted foreign inland freight from FMV. We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). Because the home market credit figure reported by Minasligas is actually interest revenue, we imputed credit expense and then used the interest revenue as an offset against the imputed expense. We imputed U.S. credit because Minasligas did not report this expense. We used the ``First Payment'' date reported by Minasligas and the monthly interest rates based on the ``Taxa Referential'' which is the Brazilian Government's referential index for short-term borrowings. We also made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for direct selling expenses (finance charges), warehousing, and quality control expenses. We reallocated a portion of direct selling expenses to foreign brokerage and handling based on findings at verification. Finally, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We included in FMV the amount of taxes collected in the home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., the sum of any adjustments that were deducted from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. By making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of FeSi from Brazil. Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determine that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding (A)(i) above, we normally consider whether there has been an antidumping order in the United States or elsewhere on the subject merchandise in determining whether there is a history of dumping. Regarding (A)(ii) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price comparisons and 15 percent or more for exporter's sales price comparisons as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. If imports during the period immediately following the filing of a petition increase by at least 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately preceding the filing of a petition, we normally consider them massive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the calculated dumping margins for CBCC and Minasligas are not in excess of 25 percent, we cannot impute knowledge under section 735(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act. (See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987.) Petitioners provided information regarding respondent's history of dumping in a third country. Therefore, we examined whether imports have been massive. Based on our analysis of verified company specific import data, we determined that imports have not been massive over a relatively short period of time for CBCC and Minasligas. Accordingly, we determine that critical circumstances do not exist for CBCC and Minasligas. However, for Italmagnesio, a non-cooperative respondent, based on BIA we determine that critical circumstances exist. In the case of Italmagnesio, the margin in excess of 25 percent is high enough to impute knowledge of dumping and, as BIA, we concluded that imports have been massive over a relatively short period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we found that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to all cooperative respondents, we also find that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to all other exporters and producers of the subject merchandise from Brazil, except for Italmagnesio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we conducted verification of the information provided by CBCC and Minasligas by using standard verification procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records, and selection of original source documentation containing relevant information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

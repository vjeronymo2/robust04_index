The diplomat said that on the contrary, new cooperation  systems are being studied in the antidrug-trafficking struggle.    According to the ambassador, although there are some  differences of criteria between our government and the United  States over the policy of bringing drug traffickers to justice,  no break in the exchange of judicial information has taken place.    [Begin Silva recording] I do not think this decision has  been  made, because until recently we have maintained an open and  clear dialogue with U.S. authorities. At no time has this  possibility been mentioned.    I have maintained frequent and close contact with U.S.  authorities. During none of the official or informal meetings I  have held with them have they informed me of such a decision.  [end recording]    In the meantime, the attorney general has defended  Prosecutor  General de Greiff's administration and said that the two  countries are perfecting the judicial cooperation system.    [Begin recording] [Attorney General Arrieta] The fact of the  matter is that there are many people who would be interested in  blocking this cooperation process. On one occasion I have said  criminals are the only ones to fish in these troubled waters.    [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez] There have been  differences that are known to the public, but I trust we can  embark on a great effort to create an atmosphere that favors the  much-needed judicial cooperation in the international area.

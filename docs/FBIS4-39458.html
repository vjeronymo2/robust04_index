			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Russia canceled economic  limits on Abkhazia on May 24, 1994, bearing in mind positive  changes in the Sukhumi stand on Georgian-Abkhazian settlement  and the grave economic position of the Abkhazian side resulting  from the armed conflict, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's  Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin told a  briefing here today.    "Certainly, corresponding issues should be settled with due  account of our essential stand on recognition of territorial  integrity of the Georgian republic," said Karasin.    In his words, the United Nations Security Council's  secretariat held consultations on cooperation in peace-keeping  in Abkhazia late in May in New York. The consultations were  held in the presence of Russia.    "Their main result is the end to watchfulness as regards the  Commonwealth plans of a peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, and  understanding of the need for close interaction between our  peace- makers and the U.N. mission in the conflict zone," said  the Russian Foreign Ministry's representative.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Major satisfied UK has room for manoeuvre THERE were no great triumphs for Mr John Major at Lisbon. But then neither was there the uncomfortable isolation to which Britain has become so accustomed at European Community summits. So, as he prepares later this week to take over the EC presidency, Mr Major had few complaints about the overall outcome. He lost some battles, notably over the pace of future negotiations on enlargement, but returned to London content that the tone of the final communique left plenty of room for Britain to set the agenda over the next six months. From his perspective, the summit confirmed that the certainties which had led many of his colleagues into the Maastricht accord had been replaced by a more appropriate humility about federalist blueprints following the Danish people's rejection of the treaty earlier this month. President Francois Mitterrand - so often scornful of his British counterparts - added his voice to a barrage of promises from the leaders to make the Community less remote from its citizens. Subsidiarity - the principle that power should be devolved to the lowest possible level - has yet to catch the imagination of Britain's partners. But Mr Major's colleagues no longer raise their eyes to the heavens when he argues that the British presidency should place it at the centre of EC decision-making. Chancellor Helmut Kohl - repaying the efforts that Mr Major has made to establish a Bonn-London axis within the Community - proved a stalwart ally. When German journalists quizzed the chancellor in private over the direction of the British presidency, he told them not to under-estimate Mr Major's tenacity and negotiating skills. Mr Major has no cause for complacency. If he could claim with some justice that the Community is now ready to debate its future on the basis of his agenda - above all on decentralisation and the principle of enlargement - there was much evidence also that his partners believe the European train has come to only a temporary halt. For all the compliments offered to his British counterpart, Mr Kohl made it clear that Bonn will not abandon its ambition to lock Germany into a federal Europe. This precarious balance between the pragmatism forced on the Community by Denmark and federalist ambitions will remain at the heart of the debate over Europe's future during the presidency, Mr Major's advisers acknowledge. By the Edinburgh summit in December, Mr Major will have to give substance to the notion of subsidiarity. It will not be easy. While Britain sees it as the instrument to tame Brussels, Mr Jacques Delors has a rather different concept. The Commission president is happy to devolve back to national governments much of the policing of Community law. But he - and many of Mr Major's European counterparts - do not see that as a brake on greater authority at the centre for decisions on economic, foreign and security policies. The debate, though, is on ground chosen for once by Britain. Mr Major is confident that by the Edinburgh summit there will be a stronger recognition that his agenda matches the mood of Europe. But, as Mrs Margaret Thatcher reminded him yesterday, he has first to demonstrate that he can deliver on his promises.</p>

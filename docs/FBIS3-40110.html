			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yu Wen: "On Questions of Security Council </F> Reform"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Some people have  stressed that the Security Council must increase transparency in  making policy decisions and become highly democratic in  determining the procedure for the discussion of official  businesses. They believe that the Security Council should regard  the common interests of the UN members as its goal instead of  regarding the concept on value of some large nations and their  political interests as the basis to make policy decisions. In  addition, such policy decisions are often made quietly in the  form of making deals. It is difficult for the ordinary member  countries to understand the whole procedure in making policy  decisions, let alone joining with others in making such  decisions. They urge the international community to earnestly  formulate a set of strict standards and the proper procedure for  the Security Council to change this kind of irrational  phenomenon at present.  <H5>  On Organizationally Expanding Security Council </H5>   The voices for organizationally expanding the Security  Council are becoming louder and louder in each passing day.  These voices are mainly coming from the following sources:    1) Japan and Germany long to become permanent members of the  UN Security Council. They believe that the provisions on enemy  countries in the UN Charter with the World War II defeated  nations as the targets have already become "obsolete" and  something of the past, and should be abolished. In addition,  Japan and Germany have already become members of the United  Nations in 1956 and 1973 respectively. They have said that their  economic strengths are incompatible with their international  political status. They belong to the group of UN members who pay  the highest membership fees (Japan accounts for 12.45 percent of  the UN funds, next only to the U.S. share of 25 percent; Germany  makes up 8.93 percent). On the one hand, they have been asked to  shoulder more international responsibilities; while on the other  hand, they are excluded from the ranks of permanent security  council members. It is necessary to resolve the contradiction  between their bound duties and their rights. They believe that  they are capable of participating in the management of world  affairs and have the responsibility to do so.    2) The developing nations seek to have more say in UN  matters. However, there are no African or Latin American nations  that are permanent Security Council members. For example,  Indonesian President Suharto, Chairman of the Non-Aligned  Movement, proposed to add six more permanent council members. In  addition to Japan and Germany, the other four seats should be  given to developing nations. He suggested that the two large  populated Asian nations India and Indonesia be given one seat  each, while the largest nations in Africa and Latin America one  seat each.    3) Some regional large nations complain that they have not  enjoyed the due rights to speak in the Security Council in  solving regional disputes. They seek to become permanent members  of the Security Council.    4) Many countries believe that the current distribution of  the seats of the Security Council was determined by the balance  of the international power when the United Nations was first  founded. However, right now tremendous changes have taken place  in international relations, and the regional distribution of the  Security Council member states seems to be unfair. They demand  that the existing structure of the Security Council be changed.    Due to the fact that the Security Council has the power to  pass any resolution of a compulsory nature, which all UN member  states are obliged to accept and implement, a nation which is a  Security Council member of the United Nations, particularly a  permanent council member, enjoys great power in handling  international affairs. Therefore, the competition to become a  member, particularly a permanent member, of the Security Council  is naturally fierce. Here, we have several issues that we must  first take into consideration and discuss.    1) In dealing with an organization such as the Security  Council, which assumes the primary responsibility in maintaining  international peace and security, what kind of scale is most  appropriate. If the scale is too small, it will lack  comprehensive representation. If the scale is too large, it  would be difficult for the Security Council to take actions  effectively. Here there is an issue of scale. It looks like the  expansion should not be too large.    2) If it is necessary to increase the number of the  permanent  members of the Security Council, the economic strengths of the  candidates should be regarded as a major factor in selecting  successful candidates. Some people have proposed that those  nations which make the largest economic contribution to the  United Nations and support UN actions most vigorously in  maintaining peace should be selected. Others stressed the need  to impartially choose the successful candidates from different  regions. It is essential to fully discuss and deliberate on this  issue beforehand.    3) Due to the fact that a permanent member of the Security  Council has the veto power, the discussion of the issue on the  increase of the number of permanent Security Council members  will inevitably involve the veto power. Therefore, this issue  must be considered with the veto power in mind. Some people even  propose to add "semi-permanent council members" in order to work  around the issue of veto power.  <H3>  Issue of Veto Power on Principle of Unanimity Among Major  Powers </H3>   In accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter on the  voting procedure, votes of approval from nine council members  are needed to pass any resolution concerning procedural matters,  while votes of approval from nine council members including all  permanent council members are needed to pass any resolution  concerning non-procedural matters. That means to say that the  vote of disapproval from any permanent council member would veto  any resolution concerning non-procedural matter in the Security  Council. That is referred to as veto power on the principle of  unanimity among major powers.    Amid the calls for reforming the Security Council, many  people raise objections on the issue of veto power. Some people  have said that veto power has become the "privilege of large  nations." This runs counter to a passage in the UN Preface that  "various nations, large and small, enjoy equal rights" and the  principle of "all member states being equal" in its Article Two.  Other people have said that all nations, large or small, rich or  poor, should be able to discuss and make decisions on major  world affairs on an equal basis. Large nations should not enjoy  any special privilege. Still others have said that the current  situation is different from the situation at the time when the  United Nations was first founded and five major powers were  given special status. These people believe that the five major  powers should not enjoy veto power. Other people have also said  that in view of the fact that veto power has often been abused  by some major powers, the use of veto power should be abolished  or at least restricted.    We believe that we must carefully study the principle of  unanimity among major powers from an historical point of view.  When the United Nations was first founded, various nations had  studied, and drew lessons from the experience of the League of  Nations. Due to a provision of the League of Nations, votes of  approval from all member states attending any session were  needed to adopt any League or administrative resolution. It  meant that all member states of the League of Nations enjoyed  the veto power in general. As a result, the League of Nations  could hardly achieve anything effectively. Therefore, the United  Nations only gave five major powers the right to cast veto so  that the United Nations could assume its due responsibilities,  play its role effectively, and avoid taking the same disastrous  road followed by the League of Nations. On the other hand, it  cannot be denied that the major powers enjoy the right to cast  veto in order to protect their own interests. Therefore, the  principle of unanimity among major powers is built on the basis  of helping the United Nations operate effectively and of  safeguarding the interests of the large nations. This principle  has dual characteristics. It has a positive side as well as a  negative side.    From the point of view of the positive side, the granting of  the veto power to major powers not only represents a privilege,  but also enjoins them to fulfill a task to maintain  international peace and security. The veto power may spur major  powers to strengthen negotiations and cooperation, and help the  Security Council play its role even more effectively. Meanwhile  the veto acts as a restraining force on some major powers which  act wildly to trample upon the UN Charter. Nations vary in  economic and military strengths, population and strategic  positions. Therefore, their influences on the world affairs are  also different. The United Nations cannot play its role very  well, if major powers are not asked to assume some special  responsibilities, consult with one another and reach unanimity  in handling world affairs on the basis of the purpose and  principle of the UN Charter, and if they are not given the veto  power to restrain each other. Let us review the history. In July  1987, the five Security Council member states adopted, after  consulting with one another, the No. 598 Resolution, calling for  a cease-fire between Iraq and Iran. That was the first time for  scores of years that the five mayor powers had reached unanimity  on a major issue of war and peace. After this, the Security  Council had played an unique role in helping Namibia become  independent, tackling the Cambodian issue and settling regional  conflicts. During the Gulf crisis, the Security Council had  adopted 12 resolutions, effectively stopping Iraqi activities of  aggression.    From the point of view of the negative side, some major  powers abuse the veto power for their own interests. The veto  power was used 279 times from 1946 to May 1990 at the Security  Council. On many occasions, it was abused. During the period of  the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union,  both sides worked hard to oppose each other in many incidents,  seriously weakening the role of the Security Council. Right now,  the world has entered a new stage with the new structure  replacing the old one. Although the confrontation between the  two sides has ended, hegemonism and power politics still exist,  and factors for the abuse of veto power have not disappeared.    It seems that the abolition of veto power is not the best  choice. To deny the special role and responsibilities of the  major powers is unrealistic. Veto power can be abused, but it  can also be used to maintain world peace and security. The  question is how to give full play to its positive aspect, while  suppressing its negative aspect.    Opinions vary on the use of veto power right now. Some  people  propose to keep veto power, while others advocate its abolition.  Still others believe that the use of veto power should be  restricted. For example, veto power cannot be used on some  issues (such as the admission of new member states). Some people  believe that the power of the UN General Assembly should be  expanded. For example, when a major power vetoes a resolution,  such a veto can be overruled if the majority of member states  vote against this veto at the UN General Assembly. This issue  should be handled prudently.  <H5>  Principle To Be Followed in Carrying Out Reform </H5>   The success or failure of the reform program hinges on  correct orientation. In carrying out reform, we must take the  purpose and principle of the UN Charter as guidance. The reform  program should be conducive to the peaceful settlement of  international conflicts and to achieving economic balance and  development of the various countries throughout the world.    In carrying out reform, it is essential to have a clear-cut  objective. The reform is aimed at further improving the  efficiency of the Security Council, increasing its abilities to  act, and helping it fulfill the task entrusted it by the UN  Charter without affecting the council's role and efficacy and  damaging the existing effective mechanism.    In carrying out reform, we must implement the principle of  promoting democracy, justice, objective rationality and  effectiveness in a balanced way. The reform of the Security  Council involves the interests of various nations, regions and  groups. Efforts must be made to coordinate the stand of the  large nations with that of the medium and small countries, and  the stand of the developed nations with that of the developing  countries. We must carry out reform after extensively  soliciting views from all quarters, and carrying out overall  negotiations. The reform program must be generally approved by a  large number of member states. A few nations should not have the  final say on world affairs. As for the number of additional  members of the Security Council, it is necessary to take into  consideration the principle of regional distribution and  impartiality.    Reforming the Security Council involves amending the UN  Charter. However, there is a legal procedure for amending the UN  Charter. To amend the UN Charter, we must pass a resolution at  the UN General Assembly and go through a General Conference  specially held for this purpose. Article 108 of the UN Charter  stipulates: "Amendments to the present Charter shall come into  force for all Members of the United Nations when they have been  adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the General  Assembly and ratified in accordance with their respective  constitutional processes by two-thirds of the Members of the  United Nations, including all the permanent members of the  Security Council." Article 109 stipulates: "A General Conference  of the Members of the United Nations may be held for the purpose  of reviewing the present charter." It also points out that "Any  alteration of the present Charter recommended by a two-thirds  vote of the conference with their respective constitutional  processes by two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations  including all the permanent members of the Security Council."  From this it can be seen that no matter whether the alteration  is examined by the General Assembly or the General Conference,  it must win votes from two-thirds of the members of the United  Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security  Council. Therefore, it is extremely important to strengthen  negotiations among all member states and help all members of the  Security Council reach unanimity.    To sum up, the reform of the Security Council involves the  interests of various nations and the amendment of the UN  Character. It is essential to extensively solicit the views of  all the countries, discuss all issues fully and carry out  negotiations. It will be a long process.</p>

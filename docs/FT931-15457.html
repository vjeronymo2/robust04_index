			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Equity Issues: Grupo Carso plans to test investors with Dollars 350m issue GRUPO Carso, the Mexican holding company with interests ranging from tobacco to telecommunications, is preparing to raise about Dollars 350m with an international equity offering. The deal will prove an important test of investor appetite for Mexican shares after several companies were forced to abandon plans for equity offerings in the summer due to market conditions. Grupo Carso, a listed company, has stakes in several Mexican companies, including Cigatam, which manufactures and sells cigarettes, Condumex, which makes wires and cables, Nacobre, which makes copper and alloy products, and Sanborns, a retail store and restaurant group. It also owns 5.5 per cent of Telmex, the telecom group. Baring Brothers and Merrill Lynch will act as joint global co-ordinators. Investment bankers expect the issue to be quite well received now that stock market conditions have stabilised. Last summer, several Mexican companies shelved plans for equity offerings following a steep fall in the Mexican stock market and weak demand for Mexican paper from international investors who had witnessed heavy losses on their Mexican investments. Banamex - otherwise known as Banco Nacional de Mexico - was forced to abandon a Dollars 1.4bn international equity offering last June. Banamex, which is one of the leading banks in Mexico, was the first to test the water again with a convertible bond issue last month. Demand for its convertible bond issue was very strong and the deal was increased from Dollars 350m to Dollars 565m, making it the largest convertible bond issue from an emerging market. Banamex issued seven-year subordinated exchangeable debentures which can be exchanged into shares in Banacci, the quoted Mexican holding company which owns Banamex. Gemex, the biggest bottler of Pepsi-Cola in Mexico, raised Dollars 186.5m last month with an international equity offering, but Goldman Sachs, the global co-ordinator, said the international tranche was scaled back while the US tranche was increased in order to reflect investor demand. Desc, an industrial conglomerate, is understood to be reconsidering tapping the international equity markets with a Dollars 250m offering.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Rival leaders to meet on Bosnia peace proposal LORD OWEN and Mr Cyrus Vance, joint mediators to the Bosnian dispute, said last night at the UN that they were convening a meeting this weekend with Bosnian Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders as well as the presidents of Croatia, Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro. A spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen said the meeting was prompted by a decision of the Bosnian Serbs to reconsider the Vance-Owen peace plan they had rejected earlier this week. The meeting, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday in Athens, would include Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban, Serbian president Slobodan Milosovic, Croatian president Franjo Tudjman and others. It is seen as a last-ditch attempt to save the Vance-Owen peace plan and to put pressure on the Bosnian Serb Assembly when it meets on Wednesday to reconsider its initial rejection. The Athens meeting will also see Mr Vance's handover of his position as mediator to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, former Norwegian foreign minister. Western governments yesterday were struggling to maintain a united front on proposals for outside military intervention in Bosnia, amid growing reports of disagreements over what option should be chosen. A senior Nato official said the chances of decisive western military intervention in Bosnia were fading. The official blamed European opposition to the use of force which had proved 'highly influential' with the Clinton administration and closed military options. EC foreign ministers this week expressed strong reservations about military intervention and defence chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic went public with their concerns about using force without clear-cut goals. In Washington, President Bill Clinton is struggling to reach a consensus among his own civilian and military advisers on US action to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen plan. A decision is expected in the next few days. Britain, however, yesterday indicated it was ready to back a US ultimatum threatening air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia if the US administration agreed to maintain the international arms embargo.

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y takes CDollars 1.4bn write-down OLYMPIA &amp; YORK has wiped out its entire equity by writing down the value of its property portfolio and other investments by CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.2bn). The write-downs, which do not include the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands, pushed the ailing Toronto-based property developer to a CDollars 2.1bn loss for the year ended January, 1992, compared to a CDollars 359m loss in the previous 12 months. The loss is among the biggest ever recorded by a Canadian company. O&amp;Y's investment in Canary Wharf is carried on its books at a cost of almost CDollars 3.6bn. But auditors, Price Waterhouse, said in a note qualifying the accounts that the value of the project, which was put into administration on May 28, has been 'materially impaired'. The financial statements released yesterday mark the first time that the once-secretive O&amp;Y has made such information public. The Reichmann family, which owns the company, previously shared only an abridged version of the accounts with their main bankers in O&amp;Y's offices. O&amp;Y filed for court protection from its creditors in Canada on May 14 and is in talks to restructure the bulk of its CDollars 13.5bn debt. It is due to present a debt-restructuring plan by August 21. Gerald Greenwald, named president three months ago, said at a press conference yesterday the company will in future publish quarterly statements. He said results for the first quarter of fiscal 1993 will include an 'appropriate' writedown on Canary Wharf. Mr Greenwald confirmed that the Reichmanns are still trying to put together an investors group to provide the capital needed to complete Canary Wharf. He declined to give further details, except to say that some investors have expressed interest. Mr Greenwald said O&amp;Y has three immediate objectives: to complete the debt-restructuring; to form the Canary Wharf investors group; and to hold down operating costs. He expressed confidence that the value of its assets will improve over time 'to the benefit of lenders and shareholders'. According to the financial statements, O&amp;Y had a shareholders deficiency of CDollars 134m on January 31, against equity of CDollars 2.1bn a year earlier. The company estimates, however, the 'real market value' of its properties is CDollars 2.3bn more than their book value. Mr Greenwald said the balance sheet also does not do justice to O&amp;Y's continuing 'franchise value' as a respected developer and landlord. Revenues fell to CDollars 5.5bn in the latest fiscal year from CDollars 6.2bn. But there was a small rise in rental income. The operating loss widened to CDollars 641m from CDollars 205m, while cash flow from operations shrank to CDollars 77m from CDollars 583m. Less than half the CDollars 1.4bn in write-downs relates to O&amp;Y's property investments. The write-down on its buildings in the US and Canada is only CDollars 218m, with the value of preference shares in affiliated property companies cut by CDollars 335m. The rest of the write-downs relate largely to investments in resource companies, such as newsprint maker Abitibi-Price, energy producer Gulf Canada Resources and Santa Fe Energy Resources.</p>

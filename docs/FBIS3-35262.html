			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rashid Hilal] </F>   [Excerpt] Damascus, Ramallah -- Nayif Hawatimah, secretary  general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,  has affirmed that his faction will continue to participate in  the current Palestine National Council [PNC]. He said, however,  that this participation hinges on a call to rebuild all PLO  institutions on a democratic and elected coalition basis and  with national common denominators.    In an interview with AL-QUDS, Hawatimah said that this basis  will ensure a serious commitment to and compliance with the  decisions of the PLO's legislative and executive institutions.  Hawatimah disclosed that he had invited the Palestinian  leadership to discuss the Oslo-Cairo agreement and hold a  referendum over this agreement, but the invitation was turned  down. Hawatimah said that he favors a historic settlement on  the basis of two states -- one Arab Palestinian and the other  Jewish Israeli -- in accordance with the Palestinian people's  right to self-determination and the return of the refugees on  the basis of UN Resolution 194.    He added: This is what I asked for in my recent meetings  with U.S. and Russian delegations in Damascus. He said: In  these meetings I called on the delegations to cooperate with us  in holding a Palestinian referendum, inside and outside the  occupied territories, on the Oslo-Cairo agreement.    Hawatimah said: We are calling for evolution toward popular  legitimacy by convening popular conferences in the homeland and  the diaspora. This should lead to the holding of a unified  national conference which would draw up a political program and  choose a new leadership -- in a spirit of democracy and  criticism -- that enjoys the people's support. The conference  would also elect a new National Council, which in turn would  rebuild all PLO institutions on democratic and coalition bases.    Hawatimah indicated that the Palestinian negotiating  leadership is refraining from convening the current PNC because  most of the council members oppose the Oslo-Cairo agreement.

Twenty-three-year-old  Kamlaksha Shetty, arrested late in October while trying to  smuggle a kilogram of heroin out of the country, was pleading  with police officers to somehow get him off the hook.    [Passage omitted] The arts student at Bhavan's college in  Andheri, the police said, had concealed over 100 plastic  capsules containing three grams of heroin each in his stomach  and intestines, to smuggle them to Mauritius.    [Passage omitted]    Shetty's father retired a few years ago from his job as  senior technician in a city engineering firm. "No one in the  family is earning any money," Shetty says. Perhaps that led him  to agree to being a "carrier," as the police term it.    In jeans and brightly-patterned cotton shirt, Shetty is the  typical college student. Anyone meeting the dark curly haired,  third-year student of history and philosophy on the street would  expect a degree of bravado in his talk. [Passage omitted]    Now, as the enormity of his crime slowly sinks in--under the  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Shetty will  spend 10 of the best years of his life in jail--the bluster has  all evaporated. What was merely a schoolboy lark has turned out  to be serious indeed.    "There was a man, Noormohammed Salewala, who used to hang  around in the college canteen with us, and joke with me  sometimes," Shetty says. "One day he asked me if I would do a  small job for him. He would pay me Rs 30,000, he said."    Shetty is merely the youngest of an emerging new breed of  white-collar drug-traffickers, lured by the easy profits and  glamour associated with what is virtually an industry--growing  explosively, exponentially. He seems to have all the attributes  of the new breed--his parents are well-placed and fairly well  off, and his brother works in advertising.    [Passage omitted] Today, the average drug-trafficker could  well be the clean-cut, slick talking boy next door. Or like  Major Motilal Tiku, arrested in November last year after he  helped drug-traffickers set up an export unit as a cover for  their activities, they may be firmly entrenched in the ranks of  the establishment.    Apart from the odd policeman, the narcotics cell's bag of  drug-sellers last year also included an assistant collector of  central excise, two doctors, and a brace of laboratory  assistants.    In fact the cell made the largest-ever seizure of mandrax  tablets in the world--five tonnes on January 13--after officials  discovered that a doctor was routinely manufacturing heroin at  his Kurla home.    Dr Imtiyaz Mohammed Iliyas, 33, told the police that he had  opened a dispensary in a Vakola shop allegedly given to him by  industrialist Ramakrishna Bajaj. "I practiced for one year," he  says, "but I never earned enough to feed my family."    Iliyas got into the drugs trade through a classmate who told  him that his dispensary was an ideal place to "park" charas  until it was picked up. He was paid Rs 10,000 for every  consignment the drug-runners stored there. Periodically, he also  sold small quantities of heroin in the local market, around one  kilogram at a time.    One of these deals went sour, and by 1990, he had been  arrested by the police, but was released on bail. The case is  still pending in the sessions court.    A scared Iliyas fled to Indore after one of his regular  buyers, Babita Shardul, was arrested by the police. But by then  he had managed to place his brother Anis, 42, in the business.  Anis was himself later arrested by the narcotics cell.    Iliyas returned to Bombay in 1992, and put up his shingle in  Chunabhatti. He joined the ONGC [Oil and Natural Gas Commission]  as a medical officer. Again, he says, he had money problems, and  turned to his friends in the drug trade to bail him out. Put in  touch with one of the big fish, Prembhai Shetty, he was taught  how to prepare mandrax tablets from methaqualone powder.    Meanwhile he was preparing heroin at home, with raw stock  from his Pathan friends, and selling it at a profit of Rs 10,000  per kg. When arrested by the police this year, he took them to  the Victoria Docks and showed them two 20-foot containers full  of nearly five tonnes of mandrax.    Major Motilal Tiku, Kashmiri and formerly of the Dogra  Rifles, presents a case fraught with national security  implications. After retirement in 1985, he set up a factory in  Raigad. His involvement with the drug traffickers began last  year, after he was approached for help with export formalities.    Major Tiku's two sons are highly placed. One of them,  Rajendra, is in the IPS [Indian Police Service], and is an  inspector-general of police (crime) in Jammu and Kashmir. The  other, Pradeep, holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the  army, and is presently posted in Assam.    These delicate postings, combined with their father's  involvement in the drug trade, would render them ideal targets  for blackmail by agents provocateurs. Except for the fact that  both men have apparently severed relations with their father,  the latter's involvement could well have serious security  implications.    Major Tiku claims that he even advised the drug traffickers  to set up a small unit to manufacture chemical items, as a cover  for their activities, and promised to help them get a bank loan  and complete all the necessary formalities. The police were led  to him after they arrested two accomplices with more than 200  kgs. of mandrax tablets in their possession.    Last October the narcotics cell also arrested Bishistha  Narayan Singh, an assistant collector of central excise, who  misused his official position in helping a drug-runner analyse a  batch of mandrax tablets. [Passage omitted]    "There seems to be no reason but plain greed to explain why  all these people have gotten into the business," says the DCP  [Deputy Commissioner of Police], Mr Sur. "They seemed to have  nearly everything they could wish for, and yet that's not  enough."    The sheer geographical spread of his work prompted  Surendrajit Singh, a 65-year-old coach attendant on Western  Railway, to enter drug-trafficking. For 10 years before he was  arrested in 1991, he smuggled contraband across the  country--most often taped to the insides of water tanks and the  supply pipes of the toilets in the compartments he was stationed  in.    He was caught, finally, with a load of heroin he had ordered  from a supplier in Rajasthan.    "The city, serviced by 37 airlines and two ports, is the  ideal stop-over point for drugs," says Mr Sur. "And with the  far-flung network of railway lines, narcotics are travelling on  the railways into the hinterland."    During the period from 1990, when Mr Sur took over the  Narcotics cell, a total of 17 tonnes of narcotics has been  seized, running into around US$500 million in international  markets. Typically, law enforcement officials are able to seize  less than 10 per cent of contraband. [passage omitted]</p>

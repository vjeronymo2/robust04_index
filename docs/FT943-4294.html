			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Kmart to close 110 US discount stores Kmart, the embattled US retailing giant, is to close 110 of its discount stores with the loss of 6,000 jobs. It is also to reduce its management workforce by 10 per cent during the next two years, resulting in a further 1650 job losses. The closures are part of a retrenchment programme announced in January this year, when Kmart took a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 830m) restructuring charge against 1993 earnings. Kmart said yesterday that the programme, is now 65 per cent complete. The group's profits have fallen for seven quarters in a row, chiefly because of weak trading in the discount store business. Yesterday's announcement was seen by Wall Street as evidence that Kmart is concentrating on problems in its basic business. In June, Kmart agreed to float off four of its five specialty chains after a public shareholder revolt. Kmart, which has been overtaken as the world's biggest retailer by its younger US rival Wal-Mart, said the stores to be closed had not met requirements on sales, profits or investment returns. The 110 closures represent slightly less than 5 per cent of a total 2,350 stores in the Kmart chain. Mr Joseph Antonini, Kmart president, said yesterday's announcements, and the impending flotations of the specialty store chains, represented 'strong steps towards focusing on the core US Kmart business'. However, he added, 'much remains to be done.' Kmart shares closed up Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 18.</p>

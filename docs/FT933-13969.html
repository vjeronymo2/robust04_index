			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Private data IN THE same week that the British government admitted that too much public information was being kept secret, Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said new laws might be needed to stamp out a black market in personal information. Mr Howe pointed to evidence that private investigators were tricking or bribing employees of financial institutions and utilities to reveal information about their customers, which is then mainly sold to debt-collection agencies or lawyers in messy divorce cases. Mr Howe also questioned the practice among financial institutions of swapping information about their customers via credit reference agencies. He is worried that some banks have made it a condition of providing loans or opening accounts that customers agree to information being passed on in this way - a concern also raised yesterday by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. While bribing employees to reveal confidential information is clearly intolerable, that does not mean new laws are needed. Under the Data Protection Act, it is already an offence for a company to disclose computerised personal data knowingly to anybody it has not identified for this purpose in the data protection registry. The snag is that companies often circumvent the spirit of this rule by describing those to whom they might transfer data in broad categories - such as anybody who makes inquiries. Before considering new laws, it would be better to put pressure on financial institutions and utilities to use narrower descriptions, so making clear they will only reveal information where they have customers' express permission. Similarly, although swapping information about customers obviously helps financial institutions cut down bad debts, that is not a sufficient reason to breach confidentiality. Under their code of practice, banks are theoretically committed not to disclose data unless customers give consent. But requiring consent as a condition of trade makes a mockery of the code. Mr Howe already has powers to stop the practice by declaring it contrary to the Data Protection Act's provisions that information should be collected fairly. He should use them.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank stays tough YESTERDAY'S interest rate cut that did not happen was as revealing as the dog that did not bark. The Bundesbank is trying to tell the world something. Others should listen carefully and respond sensibly. It sometimes seems a pity that analysis of financial markets is dominated by les Anglo-Saxons. They are right when recognising the limits on the ability of governments to override markets. But it seems almost impossible for non-German analysts or even non-German politicians to understand what the Bundesbank is about. Surely, they have been saying, the Bundesbank would not persist with its tired monetarism, especially when monetary growth is a mere one per cent above its target range. Would it really impose a savage recession in order to push inflation from 4 to below 2 per cent, when higher administered prices explain much of the inflation? Would the Germans tolerate such severity when they are struggling with unification? And what about Mr Kohl, slayer of Bundesbank inhibitions on German monetary union, would he allow the ERM to be put to the sword? The answer to all these questions, we now know, is yes. The Bundesbank does believe in monetary targeting. Enough of the Germans who matter will not merely put up with its policy, but support it. And as for Mr Kohl, he neither can nor will do anything to halt it. Interest rates are a decision for the Bundesbank, said Mr Kohl yesterday during his summit meeting with the French prime minister, Edouard Balladur. This did not prevent the German chancellor from reiterating his desire to see Europe's economic and monetary union implemented on schedule, with the familiar proviso that participants should first meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria. Since this is precisely what the Bundesbank has made difficult to achieve, Mr Kohl might be accused of wanting to have his cake and eat it. D-Mark appreciation Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president designate, is another open to the same accusation. He wants to be free of the costs but still enjoy the benefits of the ERM, by arguing that a substantial appreciation of the D-Mark would be undesirable. Since yesterday's decision not to cut the discount rate also rules out further reductions in market rates, which are close to their floor, he is telling other European countries not to lower their rates of interest more than modestly. Presumably he is feeling the pressure from worried German exporters. In other ways, Mr Tietmeyer is a liberated man. He is freed from worry about his promotion, while the institution he is about to head is freed from day-to-day worries about the ERM. Even though the trend in German short-term interest rates is downwards, that decline is now likely to be slow and the disinflationary pressure persistent. Lower rates One reason for this is the Bundesbank's determination to restore the D-Mark to the ranks of the world's low inflation currencies. In addition, it needs to sterilise the exchange market intervention that accompanied the ERM crisis. Moreover, to have failed to lower rates in July, when that might have saved the ERM, only to do so now would pour petrol on the flames of resentment. Whether the Bundesbank is right to remain so hawkish, though an intellectually important question, is beside the point in practical terms. What is not beside the point is whether other European countries, notably France, are right to go on shadowing the D-Mark when the exchange rate link is broken. What is the point of having flexibility if the authorities will not exploit it? France is worried about the effects on European monetary co-operation of uncoupling its interest rates from those in Germany. It is worried too about its own disinflationary credibility. Both concerns are overdone. It was not French, but German policy that undermined the ERM. It is not French, but German insouciance that threatens the achievement of Emu. It is not the French, but the German economy that suffers from stubborn inflationary pressures. France and the other European countries afflicted by unnecessary recessions should exploit their freedom of manoeuvre. If they do not do so now, they will be forced to do so later.</p>

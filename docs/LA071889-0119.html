			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL TO END NORTHWEST TIMBER BATTLE REJECTED  </P> <P> Both the timber industry and the Forest Service on Monday rejected a proposal  offered by environmentalists aimed at ending the fight over logging in the  ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> The rejections came as lawmakers from the region sought to craft a legislative  compromise to ensure an adequate short-term supply of logs to keep the region's  mills operating over the next 15 months and protect the old-growth forests that  are prime habitat for the rare northern spotted owl.  </P> <P> The lawmakers had hoped to attach the compromise to the Interior Department  appropriations bill when it was scheduled to go before a Senate appropriations  subcommittee today, but the meeting has been put off until later in the week  for unrelated reasons.  </P> <P> The lawmakers have made clear they will act whether or not the  environmentalists and the industry agree.  </P> <P> Industry representatives said the environmentalists' proposal would be  "technically infeasible" because its restrictions on old-growth logging would  make it impossible to meet the timber sales levels it envisions.  </P> <P> "This is a non-starter -- an offer of terms of surrender," Mark Rey, a vice  president of the National Forest Products Assn., said at a news conference.  </P> <P> The environmentalists' proposal would reduce the harvest over the next 15  months to a level 400 million board-feet below that of an earlier plan. Rey  said the result would be the loss of 7,000 jobs, $171 million in payrolls and  $162 million in government revenue.  </P></p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Brussels Summit: Belgium tries for show of EC unity THE Belgian presidency of the EC was last night straining to prevent today's special summit of the 12 heads of government degenerating into a row over the balance of power between big and small Community member states. The summit was called to revive Europe's spirits following the traumatic process of ratifying the Maastricht treaty. France and Germany presented a new initiative this week to give momentum to the EC through a new decision-making body made up of European affairs ministers. But officials from the Commission, the Belgian presidency and a host of smaller member states feared that this could disguise a power-grab by the big member states, by shifting EC business from the Community to national governments. Additional complications could come if the UK, Germany, France and Spain insist on raising the very sensitive issue of how to share out votes between the big and small countries, including Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, now negotiating EC entry by 1995. The Belgian presidency is relying on the strong will of the Twelve to avoid a public show of division after the disarray of the past 18 months. But much depends on an agreement on the locations of a range of new EC institutions, chief among them the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the precursor of a future European central bank. It is widely accepted that Germany has an almost undeniable claim to the EMI, because of the predominance of the D-Mark among European currencies. However, a decision depends on consensus being reached on homes being found for other coveted bodies, such as the European environment agency or medicines evaluation agency, which the UK wants. UK officials said they would not use the summit to accuse France of jeopardising a Gatt world trade deal by the December 15 deadline agreed with the US because of Paris's opposition to the Blair House accord limiting subsidised farm exports. Other EC states, led by Germany, are wary of isolating France. EC leaders will also try to identify 'joint actions' in the Maastricht common foreign and security policy. Likely areas for close co-operation include dispatching observers to monitor elections in Russia and South Africa, and the Middle East peace process. But diplomats stressed yesterday it would be much more difficult to reach agreement on any new initiative on the former Yugoslavia; efforts would be confined to enhancing the humanitarian aid effort before the winter breaks in Bosnia. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is also set to present the latest ideas in his White Paper on competitiveness, employment and growth, which will be the centrepiece of the regular EC summit in December. But he is thought unlikely to push for an initiative now to tackle unemployment or to boost growth, having been rebuffed at a meeting of finance ministers this week in Luxembourg. A proposal by President Francois Mitterrand for an Ecu100bn (Pounds 77.6bn) loan to fund public works and so create jobs is also likely to be given short shrift.</p>

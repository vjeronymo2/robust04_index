			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Roasted by critics for its news re-creations, NBC News' "Yesterday, Today and  Tomorrow" won its time period in its debut Wednesday night, according to  NBC-provided estimates. Facing only reruns, "Yesterday" averaged a 12.0  overnight rating and a 23% share of audience. ABC's "China Beach" had an 8.2  and a 16 share, while CBS's "Wiseguy" had a 7.1 and 14% share. Each ratings  point represents 904,000 homes. "Yesterday" has two more shows (on Aug. 23 and  Sept. 13), after which NBC will look at the ratings and decide whether it will  become a series, a spokesman said Thursday. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

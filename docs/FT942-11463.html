			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Equitable result fails to impress Wall St The share price of The Equitable, the US insurer which is 49 per cent owned by French group Axa, slid further yesterday, despite first-quarter results showing continued progress in its life insurance activities. The results also showed the group's investment businesses had held profits in the face of volatile financial markets. A darling of the stock market from its flotation in mid-1992, Equitable's shares have gone out of favour since the US interest rate rise on February 4. In New York, they fell a further Dollars  3/4 yesterday to close at Dollars 20. The slide reflects general concern among investors about what are perceived to be interest-rate sensitive stocks. First-quarter figures were broadly in line with market expectations. Net earnings were Dollars 82.1m, or 39 cents a share, up from Dollars 31.8m, or 16 cents, a year before. Post-tax profits in the life insurance operations, before investment gains, rose to Dollars 44.7m, from Dollars 4.2m the year before. Two factors were behind the rise: a reduction in the losses from disability insurance, from Dollars 31.6m a year before to Dollars 5.8m, and higher investment spreads. Investment gains in the insurance business were Dollars 6.2m, compared with Dollars 2.9m the year before. Mr Joseph Melone, chairman of the group's US insurance arm, said the company's emphasis on variable life and variable annuity products had brought strong growth in the period. He said that new variable and interest rate sensitive premiums were 42 per cent up on the previous year, while total individual annuity premiums were 30 per cent higher. Investment operations returned post-tax profits of Dollars 47.8m, against Dollars 50.3m the year before (before restructuring charges of Dollars 3.9m). Mr Richard Jenrette, Equitable chairman, warned that recent market volatility 'has introduced a degree of uncertainty . . . on a short-term basis'. However, he added: 'We are confident that our investment businesses are strongly positioned for long-term growth.'</p>

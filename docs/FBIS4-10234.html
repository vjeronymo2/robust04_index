			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 8 Apr (AFP) -- President Joaquin  Balaguer said on Friday he does not oppose the international  community providing logistical assistance in Dominican territory  in order to supervise compliance with the UN and OAS embargo  against the Haitian military regime.    The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island  of La Hispaniola. Recently 48 U.S. Democratic congressmen sent  a letter to Balaguer calling on him to put an end to the embargo  violations by stopping the transfer of gasoline and fuel oil  across the Haitian border.    In an interview with the press, Balaguer admitted "there had  been a certain loosening in the surveillance the Armed Forces  should maintain to make the blockade effective."    He said many Haitians cross the border, thanks to the "lax  surveillance," to stock up on gasoline at gas stations in the  Dominican Republic, thus increasing the volume of fuel  contraband into Haiti.    He reaffirmed his opposition to the blockade, however,  because of the implications it could have for his country. He  said the faltering border surveillance "is because of the  exceedingly long time the embargo has been in place and because  the naval blockade has not been strictly enforced either."    He announced he has told the representatives of the Group of  Friends of Haiti (the United States, France, Canada, and  Venezuela), the Dominican Republic cannot maintain an  "indefinite policy in support of the blockade" against Haiti.  "This is impossible for humanitarian reasons."    He said that the representatives agree it is necessary to  resolve the situation and that the Dominican Republic cannot  support the blockade for too long.    For the time being, he said, the government will continue to  take steps to maintain the embargo. The measures will be  reinforced with support offered by the Group of Friends of  Haiti, as presented by a spokesman for the U.S. State  Department, with whom Balaguer met a few days ago.    Balaguer expressed his hope the Haitian crisis will soon  end.  "I believe it will, as things are moving in the right  direction. I hope the crisis will conclude sooner for the good  of all sectors and for the improvement of trade between Haiti  and the Dominican Republic," he concluded.</p>

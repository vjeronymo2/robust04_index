He said that both parties acknowledged their positions  during  the meeting. The conditions of Azerbaijan remained the same:  cease-fire must be preceded by withdrawal of Armenian armed  units from the territory of Azerbaijan. Until now this problem  is left unsolved.    Isazade mentioned that presently the representatives of  Defense Ministries of both countries maintain contacts. The  terms of the truce and withdrawal of troops will be defined at  the forthcoming meeting of the Presidents of Armenia and  Azerbaijan. The functions will be divided as follows:  Azerbaijan will have to cease hostilities along the whole front  line, Armenia will have to leave all occupied territories of  Azerbaijan outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia will have to  observe the implementation of the concluded agreements. The  fate of Shusha and Lachin is unknown. This problem is expected  to be settled during the forthcoming meeting of the presidents  of Azerbaijan and Armenia in Moscow.    Having occupied the biggest in Nagorno-Karabakh Azeri city  of  Shusha, in May 1992, Armenian units completed the process of  ethnic cleansing in the region. Having seized neighbouring with  Shusha and Gorisskiy region of Armenia, Lachin town, Armenian  units received the corridor connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with  Armenia.</p>

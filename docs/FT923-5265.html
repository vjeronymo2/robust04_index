			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Protests grow as big four review bankcharges CONSUMERS' organisations and opposition politicians yesterday expressed alarm at the possible introduction of new current account charges by the high street banks. They warned that the banks would face serious consequences if they acted together to make customers pay more. None of the high street clearers would admit to having plans to end free banking (if the customer remains in credit) in the near future, but all of the big four high street banks said they were reviewing the situation. Smaller banks indicated that they were less likely to introduce new current account fees than the larger clearers. Royal Bank of Scotland, the fifth largest UK bank, said it would not be ending free-if-in-credit banking for its customers in the foreseeable future. 'Frankly we are amazed. The banks ought to be trying to get their costs down by reducing their bad debts rather than by charging customers more,' an RBS spokesman said. At Westminster the Labour party yesterday stepped up the political pressure on the banks not to raise charges in concert - and on the government to intervene if they tried to do so - with a letter to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, calling for an in-depth inquiry into banks' costs, charges and services. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, argued there is a strong case for a statutory code of practice instead of reliance on self-regulation. He said: 'Customers - already facing rising charges in the last year - can ill afford to pay more, especially when many charges are deducted without prior billing and often the increased charges are not properly explained.' The Office of Fair Trading, which last year accused high street banks of being high handed and insensitive, said it would be watching carefully to see whether the banks act in unison when introducing charges. If new current account charges are introduced, the OFT would expect the banks to provide their customers with full notification of the changes at an early date. However, the move would not necessarily mean an automatic investigation leading to referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Ms Jean Eaglesham of the Consumers Association, which also expressed fears that the banks may jointly introduce charges, said: 'Whichever bank moves first must expect to lose a vast number of its customers so our message to the public is that if your bank brings in charges, then switch to another one.' Mr John Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a leading building society specialist, said he believed building societies would benefit if banks introduced new charges. He said: 'The high street banks are simply trying to make the consumer pay for the money they lent to Robert Maxwell and their other bad debts.' Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Chen Li (7115 0500): "The Regional Party </F> Committee Holds a Forum of Nonparty Personages To Solicit Their  Opinions"]    [Text] On 15 December, the regional party committee held a  forum of nonparty personages to extensively solicit their  opinions on the main subject of accelerating the pace of reform,  opening up and economic development and striving to realize the  grand objective of "entering the front rank" which will be  discussed at the forthcoming eighth enlarged plenary session of  the fifth regional party committee.    Comrade Wang Qun presided over the forum. Qian Fenyong and  Zhang Zuocai attended the forum.    Responsible persons of democratic parties and of the  Federation of Industry and Commerce and nonparty personages  talked and aired their views freely on the policy decisions  mentioned in the report on the main subject to be discussed at  the forthcoming eighth plenary session of the fifth regional  party committee.    In a harmonious atmosphere, Comrade Wang Qun and the  participants jointly discussed the issues of common concern. He  said in his speech: United front work is one of the magic  weapons of our party. We should develop it in a better manner.  This is a strategic issue, not a technical one. We must  promote the political advantage of multiparty cooperation, the  wisdom of various democratic parties and the information  advantage, pool the wisdom and efforts of all, work with one  heart and one mind and successfully carry out the work of the  autonomous region.    In his summing-up speech, Comrade Wang Qun noted: Next year  is a crucial year. The implementation of the "decision" of the  third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee has  indicated that our country has entered a new stage in carrying  out the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. After 15  years of reform and opening up our region, like other places in  the country, it has achieved tremendous achievements in all  fields of work. The 15 years of practice has proven that reform  and opening up is our sole correct choice. In the coming year,  we must try it and go ahead daringly and expand the degree of  reform. It is not realistic to stop halfway or retreat or slow  down our pace in reform. The only thing we should do is to  unswervingly accelerate reform and development and to rapidly  and thoroughly change the planned economic system into the  socialist market economic system. This is a road of development  and a bright one, representing the fundamental interests of the  people of various nationalities. We have conditions and  certainty of doing our work well. But we should also recognize  the problems and difficulties. Because reform in the banking,  financial, taxation, pricing and foreign trade aspects will  inevitably involve the adjustment of interests in various  aspects and some unfair distribution methods formed in the past.  Perhaps, it may also arouse ideological problems of one kind or  another and some related issues concerning the reform strength.  Therefore, we hope that comrades of various democratic parties  will make common efforts, do a good job in propaganda and  guidance, use the "decision" of the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee to unify the thinking of people of  various nationalities and various democratic parties, keep eyes  on long-term interests, the interests of the whole and the  fundamental interests, properly handle the relations of reform,  development and stability and do a good job in ideological work  and promoting unity. Wang Qun pointed out: Opposing  corruption, promoting honesty and accelerating reform should be  united. If we fail to do a good job in fighting corruption and  promoting honesty, reform and opening up will be unable to  successfully carry out. In addition to striving for achieving  expected results in the anticorruption struggle, we should also  make long-term and unremitting efforts to grasp this work. In  the complicated anticorruption struggle, we must be soberly  minded, solve problems according to their merits, seek truth  from facts and grasp this work in a down-to-earth manner. It is  hoped that all democratic parties will give help and supervision  to this work.    Comrade Wang Qun also called for efforts to fully absorb the  opinions of the people and make revisions on the report  concerning the main subject to be discussed at the forthcoming  eighth plenary session of the fifth regional party committee.  At the same time, the problems on the purchase of cars,  subjectivism, overlapping construction reflected by the  participants at the forum should be made known in the form of  issuing bulletins so that they can be rapidly solved.    Wang Chongwen, Chen Jie and Xu Bonian, vice chairmen of the  regional committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, also attended the forum.</p>

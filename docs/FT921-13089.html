			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Little progress made at rubber agreement talks THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation yesterday ended its two-day special council session without a repeat of the bad tempered scenes that marred its meeting last October but also without making much progress on updating the market-stabilising International Rubber Agreement. The most significant decision to have emerged concerns the establishment over the next few weeks of an ad-hoc group of rubber market experts to provide an independent view on the state of the market over the past two years. But the group is expected merely to 'supplement' the work of the existing buffer stock committee, made up of civil servants. Producer and consumer groups are each to nominate three members members of group, whose report to the Inro council is expected at its next meeting in May. Producers are then expected to resurrect the issue of early renegotiations to reform the rubber agreement. By May delegates representing the largest consumer members, the European Community and the US, are expected to have received their governments' decisions on the time-table for renegotiation. At this week's meeting a suggestion by one consumer for the lowering organisation's reference price, thereby lessening its obligations to enter the market, attracted no backing. And the producers refrained from suggesting any upward revision of support prices. Such a move would cost the membership between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m, the price for stockpiling 400,000 tonnes or more.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Markets: Privatising the world - Economic Eye Between 1988 and 1992, 25 developing countries undertook privatisations worth, in total, no less than Dollars 61.6bn. Of these Dollars 19.8bn were of infrastructure - telecommunications, power generation, power and gas distribution, railways, roads, ports and water supply. Furthermore, almost three quarters of the total privatisations and two thirds of the privatisations of infrastructure occurred in 1991 and 1992 alone. What is happening is little short of a redefinition of the economic role of the state. These fascinating figures come from the World Bank's latest World Development Report, out today.* Just how big a change this is I can recognise from personal experience. When I joined the staff of the World Bank in 1971, the old orthodoxy - that development simply demanded higher resource mobilisation and investment - was already being modified by concern about price distortions and by calls for better project appraisals. But few questioned the state's role in the running of such industries as steel, let alone power. This is true no longer. The reason for the change is the shocking waste. This waste is particularly significant in infrastructure, because infrastructure is itself so important. Without clean water, sewerage, roads, railways, ports, energy and telecommunications, life is intolerable and development inconceivable. Ironically, it is the central place of these activities that was used to justify the state's role as provider. Too often this has meant that the more vital is the service, the worse it has been run. On average, says the report, 40 per cent of the power-generating capacity in developing countries is unavailable for production. Only 60 per cent of locomotives were available for service in Latin America in 1991. In sub-Saharan Africa, almost Dollars 13bn worth of roads - one third of those built in the past twenty years - have eroded because of lack of maintenance. In a 1988 study of Nigerian manufacturers, 92 per cent were found to own their own power-generating equipment because of the chronically unreliable public service. But these were operating at only 25 per cent of capacity, because the government forbade them to sell their surplus power. Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. Nor is the price of such follies small. Developing countries invest Dollars 200bn a year in infrastructure, which accounts for almost 60 per cent of total public investment in the middle-income countries. But failure to charge adequately for power, water and railways imposes an annual fiscal burden of some Dollars 120bn, the benefits of which accrue disproportionately to the better off. Improved efficiency could, argues the Bank, also increase developing country gross domestic product by Dollars 55bn. As the chart shows for privatisation of telecommunications, the gains from a transformation can be enormous. This is why the policy agenda on infrastructure has moved away from concern with investment towards concern with service as 'the goal and measure of development in infrastructure'. The report's main message is that 'the causes of past poor performance, and the source of improved performance, lie in the incentives facing providers'. Its main recommendations are: first, manage infrastructure like a business, not a bureaucracy; second, introduce competition wherever feasible; third, give users and other stakeholders a strong voice; and, fourth, nurture public-private partnership, notably in finance. How can these improvements be made? Infrastructure, notes the report, can be provided in four main ways: by public ownership and operation; by public ownership, with private operation; by private ownership and operation, often under regulation; and by community and user provision. The first, though the classic approach, is the least effective by far. Admittedly, public entities do sometimes perform well for a time, but they usually succumb to political interference in the end. The others alternatives all have some merit, depending on circumstances. But privatisation is the obvious route wherever competition is feasible. Contrary to the views of many economists, privatisation can also be the best alternative for monopoly services. This is mainly because privatisation automatically creates separation from government, along with a powerful countervailing force to politicians, in the form of shareholders. As with any revolution in its early stages, there remains much to be learned  -about how best to regulate privatised utilities, for example, or how to involve the private sector in infrastructure provision. But this is already a hugely encouraging transformation, not least because it dethrones the foolish belief that the level of aggregate investment matters more than where and how investment is implemented. This folly is the main reason why the real income per head of the Czech Republic, 60 years ago among the most industrialised countries in Europe, is only 40 per cent of Austria's, despite decades of high, but largely wasted, investment. The report is, in fact, almost as relevant to advanced industrial countries as to the developing ones. Just how relevant can be judged from the concentration, particularly in the political left, on the need for higher investment. While useful, higher investment does not begin to be enough. This report shows that incentives must also be transformed, to ensure that scarce resources are used far less wastefully than hitherto. *World Development Report 1994: Infrastructure for Development (Oxford University Press, for the World Bank)</p>

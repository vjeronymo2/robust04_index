			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Call for new swap and option curbs rejected A senior international bank supervisor yesterday rejected calls for further regulation of financial derivatives such as swaps and options, arguing that banks' derivatives trading is already covered by prudential rules. Mr Tommaso Padio-Schioppa, chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision, said creating ad hoc regulations for derivatives would only be justified if they represented a new form of financial risk. He stressed that bank supervisors looked at categories of risk rather than particular products, and risks associated with derivatives were the same as those involved in other banking operations. His call reinforced the caution about regulation of derivatives expressed last month by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, who said supervisors already had sufficient powers to control derivatives. Any debate over the possible regulation of bodies such as the unregulated derivatives trading units of investment banks has been sparked by a US General Accounting Office report warning of risks from derivatives. Mr Padio-Schioppa told the International Monetary Conference, a group of executives from 103 large banks, that the only 'quantum leap' created by derivatives was in understanding, managing and containing risks. But he criticised the inadequacy of accounting techniques, disclosure and reporting of derivatives. This deprived buyers of derivative products of essential information, he stated. The Basle committee was concerned 'a market failure' had occurred in disclosure because no participant wanted to be first to publish information for fear of losing an advantage. The committee was considering allowing banks to adapt internal risk management models to calculate capital charges which they will soon have to apply to market risks, he added. Banks argue they should be allowed to use such models rather than the committee's own proposed guidelines. The committee is trying to introduce a framework for market risk similar to its 1988 accord on credit risk. Mr Robert Merton, professor of business administration, Harvard Business School, urged development of new forms of accounting to capture the risks of derivatives by reporting derivatives exposures. Mr Robert Leon, general manager of the Financiere Agache Group, affiliated to the drinks group LVMH, said the company 'very much liked' derivatives and wanted them to last and grow as a risk management tool. He called for shareholders of companies to be given more information by managements about off-balance sheet commitments on derivatives and 'the philosophy which inspires these'.</p>

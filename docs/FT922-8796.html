			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (15): Farmer with an important role - Profile of Albertino de Oliveira WHEN the fighting between government troops and the Unita rebels was at its worst in Benguela province, Albertino de Oliveira found himself caught in the middle. As bad luck would have it, his farm happened to be located in an area where some of the fiercest clashes took place, but he shrugs the memory off with a laugh. Unlike the vast majority of settlers who left the country in 1975, Mr de Oliveira stayed put. He continued to farm during the difficult years of the civil war and today he is one of a small band of private farmers who have not only survived but whose very survival bears testimony to the resilience of private endeavour and grit in the face of near-impossible odds. Today, he is relatively prosperous in a country that has faced famine and that still suffers from extensive and visible poverty - and from widespread shortages of even the most basic necessities. In the past, Mr de Oliveira's success might have caused official disapproval. Then, instead, the emphasis was on the state's role in capital-intensive agriculture in which unrealistic production targets were to be achieved with expensive but inappropriate machinery. An unofficial monument to the failed policy can be found in an open field not far from the De Oliveira farm: a row of rusting East German combine harvesters. Today, the government has made rehabilitation of agriculture, especially food production, a top priority. Any endeavours that will boost production are now welcome. And while Mr de Oliveira's farm and others like it will not solve on their own Angola's food crisis, they are making a small but important contribution towards that aim. Set on 25 hectares of land ceded by the Benguela railway company, the farm stretches across the plains surrounding Benguela, the provincial capital. It produces some 450 tonnes of onions a year, tomatoes, lettuce and other market gardening produce. About 200 workers, half of them women, clear the land, plant, tend and pick the crops. But that is where any similarities with management of equivalent farms in more propitious circumstances ends. Survival and the ability to improvise have been indispensable qualities to overcome the ravages of war and drought and the handicaps caused by lack of equipment, erratic transport and next to no technical or financial support. Drought is still affecting the province but peace has brought some improvements as the roads are open again to traffic. 'Before, we couldn't sell our products', says Mr de Oliveira. Most of the farm's produce is sent to Luanda where it fetches better prices, but he expects transport bottlenecks by July as conditions improve and farm production rises. He says conditions for private farmers have not changed since the war ended. Fertilisers and herbicides have been practically unavailable since 1975 and farmers make up their own from whatever chemicals they can find locally. The price of equipment is high - a three-cylinder pumping system costs Kz18m  -and credit is unavailable. 'For private sector farming there's no credit. I've heard of European Community help for pumps, but I haven't seen anything.' He thinks he may be able to put up the farm as security for credit 'but the situation is unclear.' Sitting at a large table in the courtyard of his small house in Benguela with friends - mostly local farmers who seem to drop in at all hours - Mr de Oliveira is better off than most local inhabitants. But he says there are no incentives to produce more. 'There's nothing in the shops and my wife has to go to the parallel market to find most things, from cooking oil to clothes.' Like most farmers, he is not over-interested in politics. His concern is to ensure the farm is able to produce and survive. Having come through 16 years of civil war, his keenest wish now is to re-equip the farm with modern machinery. 'We don't have anything. A good tractor or lorry or irrigation equipment would be useful. We need to clear everything and start again with new and better equipment.'</p>

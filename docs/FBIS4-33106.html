			<p>BFN     [Text] The Tierra del Fuego Province metalworkers' conflict  has deteriorated to an even greater degree following the  unexpected break in the negotiations and the entrepreneurs'  decision to send telegrams warning workers of their dismissal if  they fail to show up for work. Yesterday picket lines prevented  the entry of workers to factories, and cut access roads to the  industrial area. Metalworkers Union [UOM] leaders, meanwhile  insisted:    "We will continue the strike to its last consequences. If  the government or the police repress our activities we will  answer back just as harshly."    The attempt to find a solution to the conflict between  workers and entrepreneurs failed yesterday morning following  eight hours of negotiations at the Labor Ministry. Last night  entrepreneurs agreed to pay according to coefficient three  [reference unknown], but gradually and over a three-year period.  The UOM rejected the offer. The Labor Ministry then proposed  reducing the period of implementation of the coefficient three  proposal, and established a period, to be determined by  compulsory arbitration, during which coefficient three would  remain in effect. The UOM also rejected this offer.    Marcelo Sosa, UOM Ushuaia branch secretary general,  explained  the reasons for rejecting the entrepreneurs' proposal: "The  offer presented by entrepreneurs is way below what workers want.  The proposal is unacceptable."    Sosa announced that "the strike will continue until progress  is made and until entrepreneurs rehire dismissed fellow  workers." Sosa also criticized factory managers. He said  managers' arguments "are arbitrary" and "the only thing they  want is to wear out the determination of our fellow workers who  remain on strike." Sosa also blamed entrepreneurs for "breaking  the compulsory arbitration by dismissing 127 fellow workers."    The failure to find a negotiated solution generated strong  tensions in the province almost immediately. Entrepreneurs sent  2,500 telegrams warning workers to show up for work or face  dismissal. In the morning, however, picket lines prevented the  entry of workers who showed up for work. Philco and Sanyo  personnel who showed up for work were transported in company  buses to the plant for the first shift, which was to start at  0600. But the group of workers who had been camping in front of  the factory since the beginning of the strike surrounded the  bus, shouting:    "Go back, strike breakers."    A second group of strikers cut the road leading to the  industrial area and forced all other buses to return to the  city. Company directors filed a complaint at the police  department immediately afterward. Sanyo Industrial Director  Fernando Nott said "activists organized their move hours before  the buses went to pick up workers." Nott asked "the police and  other provincial authorities to take the necessary measures" to  guarantee "the safety of people who want to work."    At that hour the possibility of returning to the negotiating  table to try to find a solution to the conflict looked  impossible. Pedro Waisman, president of Tierra del Fuego's  Industrial Union, commented: "The problem started as a labor  and economic conflict, but it has now turned into a political  and ideological problem." Waisman warned: "These activists have  all been identified. The police and government must act  immediately to reestablish social peace and permit workers to  return to work on the island. You cannot work with strikers'  picket lines threatening women and children and breaking  everything."    Workers denied this statement. They denied "the existence of  active picket lines," explaining: "Buses carrying workers gave  up the idea of entering the factory zone because they considered  conditions to be inappropriate for production." The UOM held a  general meeting and decided to challenge the threats of massive  dismissal and the possibility that the strike be declared  illegal. They decided to continue their indefinite strike, which  has already been in effect for 17 days.    Angel Valle, assistant UOM Ushuaia branch secretary general,  said:    "We are going through a grave crisis. We need concrete  government answers. The only thing the government has given us  is repression."    In Buenos Aires, meanwhile, Labor Secretary Carlos Etala  said  entrepreneurs will be able to dismiss workers "with just cause"  if they continue their strike. Etala said the dismissals "will  be legal because the union disobeyed the order for compulsory  conciliation, and did not return to work." The Labor Ministry  has been delaying the decision to declare the strike illegal,  despite the fact that it is technically able to do so, because  it is trying to find a negotiated solution to the conflict.  Yesterday Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, Labor Minister  Armando Caro Figueroa, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, and  Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza met to analyze the  situation.</p>

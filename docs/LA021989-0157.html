			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING TURNS IN CLASS;  </P> <P> HALF A JOB IS PERFECT ASSIGNMENT FOR TEACHERS WILLING TO SHARE  </P> <P> Gregg, who is 5, runs up to his kindergarten teacher with a question. "Mrs.  Carley," he says, then quickly corrects himself, "I mean, Mrs. Snyder."  </P> <P> Gregg's momentary confusion is understandable. On Mondays, Tuesdays and  alternate Wednesdays, Gregg's teacher at Madison Elementary School in Lakewood  is Shiela Carley. On Thursdays, Fridays and the remaining Wednesdays, Donna  Snyder readies Gregg and his classmates for reading and cheers them on as they  count and finger-paint.  </P> <P> Carley and Snyder share a desk, a classroom and a single job. While job sharing  has not swept American schools, it appeals to a minority of teachers who can  afford to trade part of a salary for more time to raise children, take college  courses or ease into retirement.  </P> <P> No figures are available on how many teachers job-share nationwide. Statewide  statistics have not been updated since 1981 when a survey of California's 1,042  school districts found that 37% had tried job sharing and that more than 1,500  California teachers were sharing jobs.  </P> <P> According to Suzanne Smith, who conducted the 1981 survey, a recent informal  canvass indicates that the number of districts that allow the practice has  grown, although she does not know whether the number of job sharers has  increased. (Smith is co-founder and co-director of the nonprofit organization  New Ways to Work in San Francisco.) Most of the job-sharing teachers are women  with young children, although pairs have included men, married couples and even  a mother-daughter team.  </P> <P> Of the Long Beach Unified School District's 3,300 teachers, 34, including  Carley and Snyder, share jobs. Los Angeles Unified School District has about  200 job-sharers among its 33,000 teachers. The National Education Assn. gave  the practice a boost by endorsing it in 1981. Many unions, including United  Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents Los Angeles Unified teachers, support  the concept of job sharing.  </P> <P> Even without union pressure, most local school districts allow the practice, at  the discretion of individual principals. Culver City Unified School District,  for example, permits job sharing, although it has had no requests for several  years. Beverly Hills Unified School District recently approved job sharing for  an initial pair of teachers.  </P> <P> Job sharing increases a school district's paper work, but most administrators  feel it is worth the price. Richard Marr, an official with the Montebello  Unified School District, said job sharing, or tandem teaching, as the district  calls it, "seems to have worked quite well." It is one way the district can  retain good teachers who might otherwise leave the profession, he said. The  district has five teams, most of them teaching mothers, among its 1,300  teachers. "What we usually find," Marr said, "is that after their families  mature they come back to full-time teaching."  </P> <P> Carley and Snyder have shared their Lakewood classroom for three years. Both  have toddlers at home and see the arrangement as a way to eliminate the guilty  sense many working mothers have that they are not doing their best on either  front. As Snyder said, "When I'm at work, I want to give 100% to my job, and  when I'm with my family, I want to give 100% to them, and this allows me to do  that." As a result of job sharing, Carley said, "I'm completing housework  before 11 o'clock at night."  </P> <P> Carley and Snyder, who were friends before they were partners, say their  students have little or no trouble adjusting to two teachers instead of one. As  they point out, many of the youngsters attended preschools where they had more  than one teacher. And both teachers are in the classroom each day during the  first week of school so the children get to know both of them at the beginning  of the school year.  </P> <P> Interviewed in a schoolyard sandbox, several of the youngsters stopped playing  long enough to say yes when asked if they liked having two teachers. Parent  Joan Wagner, whose 6-year-old son, Scott, is in the class, said "it's nice for  the children to have a change." Carley and Snyder's principal, James Churchill,  is also pleased with the arrangement. Each of the pair gives more than 50% of  her time and energy to the school, Churchill said.  </P> <P> Compatibility and good communication are the keys to making the arrangement  work, according to job-sharing teachers Jill Cooper and Mary Schachner.  Schachner and Cooper have been teaching a combined first and second grade at  Larch Avenue Elementary School in Lennox for six years. Both were pregnant when  they proposed to their principal that they share the job. They were one of  Lennox School District's three pioneering pairs. The district now has eight job  sharers among its 200 teachers.  </P> <P> Cooper, who is bilingual, teaches Spanish reading and other courses in the  mornings, while Schachner, who teaches in English, takes over in the  afternoons. To keep abreast of what is happening in class, the women often  lunch together. "And we leave notes for each other on our desk," Schachner  said.  </P> <P> Carley and Snyder also leave messages on their mutual desk. They keep a single  classroom log as well, noting which child can't seem to concentrate, who wet  his or her pants, who is having trouble with the s sound and anything else that  might affect student performance. They also call each other regularly, usually  waiting until their own children are in bed.  </P> <P> Smith, the survey taker, said the most innovative mode of communication she  found among job-sharing teachers involved a pair who lived close to each other  but had a substantial commute to their school. After her shift, one teacher  would tape-record her observations about the class. She then dropped the tape  in her partner's mailbox so the partner could listen to it the next morning as  she drove to school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Husband-Wife Team  </P> <P> Communication was not a problem for former job-sharers Dian and Harold  Stonbraker. The Stonbrakers were on the Artesia High School faculty when Dian  became pregnant with their son, Sean, now 6. Both wanted to stay home with  their first child. They arranged to share Dian's job, teaching home economics  for a semester on alternate days (a substitute was hired to teach Harold's  social studies classes). "When it was her day to work, I got up at night to  feed Sean and change his diaper," he recalled. Some of Harold's fondest  memories are of the hours he was able to spend caring for his newborn son, he  said.  </P> <P> On rare occasions, Harold recalled, their shared students would try to divide  and conquer the teaching pair -- with little success. "The kids would try to  pull things. They would say, 'Mrs. Stonbraker said. . . .' They forgot I went  home every day and saw Mrs. Stonbraker."  </P> <P> The Stonbrakers are now back in separate classrooms at Artesia. The ABC Unified  School District has three pairs among its 900 teachers, including teams who  share library and physical education slots.  </P> <P> Most job-sharers sign contracts that specify how they will divide the work and  commit the survivor to taking over the class if one of them decides to drop  out. Most districts split salary and benefits between the teachers on the basis  of their division of classroom responsibility, although Palos Verdes Peninsula  Unified School District pays full benefits to each of its 16 job-sharing  teachers.  </P> <P> Although most job-sharers say the arrangement has improved the quality of their  lives, they cite other benefits as well. Snyder said she arrives at school on  Wednesday or Thursday refreshed and eager to teach -- it is the beginning of  the work week for her -- just when a teacher who is going it alone may be  starting to flag. She and her partner are rarely sick, and when one is, the  other substitutes.  </P> <P> Carley said the setup lessens the likelihood of burnout and helps her cope with  the occasional "children who would wear you down if you had them for a week. I  have a lot more tolerance and energy to give them." The pair also says the  children benefit from having two people plan their academic program. "Because  there are two of us, there's more going on," Carley said. "It's more exciting.  There are more ideas."  </P> <P> Schachner said dividing responsibilities has allowed her and partner Cooper to  become specialists in the subjects they teach. "I think I've become a better  teacher because I don't have to spread myself so thin."  </P> <P> Although Carley sometimes misses a full paycheck, she notes that she saves on  everything from commuting costs to a professional wardrobe. "I don't have to  worry about wearing the same black skirt five days in a row," she said. More  important, job sharing means she can do both the things she wants to do most:  teach and be with her family. As fellow job-sharer Cooper said, she works at  her teaching job more than half time "but I don't mind. It's the best of both  worlds."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 28, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister  'Ali Akbar Velayati here today in his address to the Security  Council criticized the Council for failing to come to terms with  "the real cause of the tragedy" in Bosnia. "We have never faced  a civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has been a blatant  aggression, which continues to be waged against a member of the  United Nations," Velayati told the Council, adding that, it was  the duty of the Council to see to it that aggressors were  repelled and punished. He blasted the United Nations for  overseeing the confiscation of arms from defenseless Muslims in  places such as Srebrenica while allowing the Serbs who had  surrounded the city to keep their heavy weapons.    Despite repeated declaration by the UN that it did not  possess sufficient resources and man-power to defend the  Bosnians, Velayati said, the UN failed to take advantage of the  offer by some Muslim governments to send peace-keepers under the  pretext that they were not neutral enough.    "Yet troops from a well-known supporter of the Serbs were  deployed in a most critical area around Sarajevo," he added.  Velayati also criticized the Security Council for shirking its  responsibilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina under the pretext of  having a "balanced approach" and said that such approaches were  responsible for creating the impression that "a strong bias  against Muslims is prevalent in the Security Council." The  perception, he said, leads to frustration amongs the Muslims who  perceive the Security Council as biased and insensitive towards  the plight of the Muslims. "This frustration has obvious  consequences. And the responsibility will be borne by those who  have so blatantly applied the double standards, and put their  perceived strategic interests before the lives of hundreds of  thousands of innocent human beings," he added.</p>

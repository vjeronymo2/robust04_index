Kurguzov] </F>   [Text] In the late 1970's the U.S. military-political  leadership concluded there was a need to form a specially  trained Armed Forces contingent for emergency use in areas of  "vital national interests" with the appearance of crisis  situations there. Formations and units assigned to it from the  Armed Services were supposed to have high combat readiness and  strategic and operational mobility and be capable of performing  combat missions in any region of the world as applied to  specific situations. That conclusion was preceded by an in-depth  analysis of prospects for development of the world  military-political situation, above all in areas of the Near and  Middle East -- sources of oil production and areas strategically  important to the United States -- and also Southeast Asia. In  this connection, in July 1977 the U.S. Secretary of Defense  prepared and submitted a special document to Congress entitled  "PRM (Presidential Review Memorandum)-10." Along with an  analysis of the world military-political situation, it contained  a substantiation of the need for establishing a "Rapid  Deployment Joint Task Force."    In the course of a thorough study and discussion of this  problem, the U.S. Congress approved proposals submitted by the  Secretary of Defense and decided to finance a program for  establishing a Rapid Deployment Force, [RDF],[.sup]1[/] which  President J. Carter announced on 1 October 1979.    Development of the optimum version of an RDF structure as  well as of forms and methods of its combat employment began  simultaneously on staffs of the Armed Services. In the first  phase this work was headed by the Army Staff, inasmuch as it was  believed that the ground component would play the key role in a  future RDF.    Korea, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf initially were  included in the RDF operational mission area. But important  world events which occurred in subsequent years, including the  Islamic revolution in Iran, beginning of the Iran-Iraq war,  introduction of Soviet troops to Afghanistan and a sharp  exacerbation of relations between Israel and neighboring Arab  states forced the U.S. military-political leadership to  partially revise the missions and geographic regions of  responsibility of the RDF being established, while retaining its  overall organizational development concept. Thus, in this period  the entire Near East and Northeast Africa were included  additionally in the RDF operational mission area.    In March 1980 the Defense Department officially announced  formation of RDF Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base [AFB]  (Florida) and appointment of a commander in chief. Its  operational-strategic purpose remained the same--readiness for  emergency movement and independent operations in various regions  of the world to defend U.S. "vital interests".    At that time the RDF effective combat strength numbered  around 290,000 persons. Its basis consisted of four divisions  (airborne, air assault, mechanized and Marine), two separate  brigades (antitank helicopter and Marine), five tactical air  wings, three carrier battle groups and three amphibious groups  as well as combat and logistic support units and subunits.    Views on the RDF role and missions underwent certain changes  with the Reagan Administration's arrival in power. As of 1  October 1981 the RDF commander in chief was directly  subordinated to the U.S. Armed Forces JCS and the RDF itself was  redesignated the RDJTF. The commander-in-chief and staff of this  force element were made responsible for drawing up plans for  employing the RDF in Southwest Asia and organizing and  conducting its operational and combat training.    As of 1 January 1983 the RDJTF was given the status of a  U.S.  Armed Forces unified command designated the unified Central  Command -- CENTCOM (headquarters at MacDill AFB). CENTCOM's  geographic region of responsibility was retained, but two  strategic bomber squadrons of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air  Command, which existed at that time, and in 1966 also the 7th  and 10th light infantry divisions were added to the RDF makeup.    In the period of reorganization of U.S. Armed Forces unified  and specified commands in 1987, the ground, sea and air  components of the RDF were removed from operational  subordination of CENTCOM. At the same time a conclusion was  drawn about the need to train RDF basic components for  operations in essentially all regions of the world, now in  support of commanders in chief of unified commands in forward  areas.    In terms of operational structure, the U.S. Armed Forces  presently have been placed in nine unified commands and one  specified command (with rights of a unified command). The  unified commands are classified according to the presence of  geographic zones of responsibility and functional tasking, and  all are operationally subordinate to the president through the  secretary of defense.    Five unified commands perform functions of operational  command and control of U.S. Armed Forces groupings in forward  areas in peacetime and with the appearance of crisis situations  there, fulfilling the key role in implementing the concept of  U.S. "forward presence," carried out to protect U.S. national  interests on a global and regional scale. In this connection,  operational plans for RDF employment are drawn up by their  staffs directly in forward areas and approved by the JCS. The  annual report of the U.S. Secretary of Defense to Congress cites  geographic areas of responsibility of these five unified  commands, which include the following regions:        -  Atlantic Ocean area--Atlantic Ocean (west of 17 east  longitude), Caribbean Sea, Pacific Ocean area (east of 92  west longitude), excluding South America;    -  Northeast Africa and Southwest Asia, including the Persian  Gulf, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and Red Sea;    -  European area--Europe (including Eastern European countries),  Great Britain and Ireland, Mediterranean Sea waters, a portion  of the territory of the Near East (Israel, Lebanon, Syria) and  the African continent (less Northeast Africa);    -  Pacific Ocean area--Pacific Ocean (except for waters included  in the area of responsibility of the unified Atlantic Command),  Indian Ocean, Japan, Korea, China and other countries of  Southeastern Asia;    -  Central and South America area--Central and South America  (excluding Mexico).       Territories of states of the former USSR, Canada, Mexico and  the continental United States are not included in areas of  responsibility of unified commands.    The following are primary missions of unified commands in  forward areas:        -  monitoring the military-political situation, conducting  reconnaissance, security and defense of U.S. military and  civilian installations;    -  operational direction, training, and combat and logistic  support of U.S. troops (forces stationed in their areas of  responsibility on a permanent or temporary basis);    -  planning and immediate direction (in case of a crisis) of  operational deployment and combat employment of Armed Forces  groupings (including RDF components) and support of operational  coordination with allied forces;    -  evacuating U.S. citizens from  zones of military conflicts or natural disasters;    -  fulfilling functions of U.S. Armed Forces representation in  states and international organizations within the area of  responsibility and directing measures for giving military aid to  friendly countries.       In the estimate of U.S. military experts, this geostrategic  allocation ensures continuous monitoring of the development of  the world military-political situation by the U.S. leadership,  and if necessary enables influencing the situation in its own  interests on an emergency basis by a show of military might or  the direct use of armed forces.    The list of RDF functional missions was expanded  considerably  in the early 1990's in connection with cardinal changes in the  world military-political situation and the beginning of  reorganization and partial reduction of the U.S. Armed Forces.  In accordance with a new national military strategy adopted in  1992, the RDF began to be viewed as a "contingency force," with  its primary specific purpose remaining unchanged.    During its existence, the U.S. RDF repeatedly has been  involved in performing missions in the course of U.S. Armed  Forces operations in forward areas. Operation Just Cause  (Panama, 1989), Desert Shield and Desert Storm (Southwest Asia,  1990-1991) and Restore Hope (Somalia, 1992-1993) are among the  largest of them.    In 1992, during measures which began in the United States to  implement a new national military strategy, the U.S. command  updated RDF missions and effective combat strength and specified  new requirements for its strategic mobility. This was covered  widely in official U.S. Defense Department sources and in the  U.S. military press.    In accordance with the "base forces" concept, which is the  basis of U.S. Armed Forces organizational development for the  next 5-7 years, the RDF is viewed as a special  operational-strategic component intended for emergency response  to possible changes in the military-political situation in  individual regions of the world in order to protect national  interests of the United States and its allies. Guidance  documents emphasize that the following are primary RDF missions:  Readiness for emergency movement to any region of the world;  comprehensive support to allies and pro-American regimes by  building up military presence, by a show of force, and if  necessary also by conducting combat operations; protection  (security and defense) and evacuation of U.S. citizens and  installations in crisis areas.    Along with this, the following have been specified as new,  additional RDF missions at the present time: Stopping  proliferation of mass destruction weapons in Third World  countries, combating international terrorism and the drug trade,  and performing "peacemaking missions" along UN lines. U.S. Armed  Forces groupings in overseas theaters are viewed as a base for  deploying a forward echelon and then also the main body of the  RDF.    An important feature of the present stage of U.S. military  organizational development is the fact that the U.S. command  does not view the RDF as an operational-strategic or operational  command with a permanent makeup. A number of U.S. military  publications emphasize that the most combat-ready, mobile units  stationed on a permanent basis in the continental United States  -- the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps, seven wings of the Air Force  Tactical Air Command, and the 1st Marine Division -- are the  basis of the RDF.    In the opinion of General C. Powell, Chairman of the JCS,  this force should be oriented toward use above all in those  areas where a permanent U.S. military presence is limited for  political, economic or other reasons. The U.S.  military-political leadership includes above all the Near and  Middle East, Africa, and the Central and South American area  among such regions. At the same time, employing the RDF in any  other region that is strategically important to the United  States also is not precluded. Using other Armed Forces  components for emergency response to crisis situations in  various regions of the world also is envisaged.    Thus, based on experience of military conflicts and of U.S.  Armed Forces operations as well as a number of  operational-strategic exercises, the following may be involved  in operations as part of the RDF (see figure): Headquarters 3rd  Army, XVIII Airborne Corps (six divisions), a Special Forces  Group and two Ranger battalions of the Army; Headquarters 9th  Air Force and ten air wings of the Air Force Tactical Air  Command; up to three carrier battle groups and three amphibious  groups, a Marine expeditionary division and expeditionary  brigade, five squadrons of land-based patrol aircraft and a  squadron of Navy depot ships. If necessary, strategic bombers  and submarines armed with conventional weapons may be included  in it additionally.             There can be a total of up to 300,000 servicemen, 700-750  tanks, around 1,000 guns, mortars and MLRS, over 800 combat  aircraft and up to 40 combatant ships in the RDF with this  operational makeup.    Strategic deployment of the RDF in crisis areas has to be  supported by forces of the Air Force Military Airlift Command  and the Navy Military Sealift Command with the involvement (if  necessary) of aircraft and vessels of civilian companies.    In accordance with the "base forces" concept, different  options are envisaged for establishing and building up RDF  groupings in centers of tension. Their makeup will be determined  by the U.S. Armed Forces commander in chief in the strategic  area based on the degree of threat to U.S. interests, the level  of conflict and the minimum required number of forces and assets  for localizing it in a short time. A buildup can be accomplished  by movements of troops from the continental United States  earmarked for reinforcing an Armed Forces grouping in a given  area and by using forces and assets directly from the RDF makeup.    According to views of the U.S. command, features of  physical-geographic conditions and operational preparation of  forward areas and the diversity of possible RDF operational  missions dictate the need for the presence in it of highly  mobile units of diverse makeup from all the Armed Services.    Thus, the following are assigned to the main complement of  Army forces and assets earmarked for operations as part of the  RDF: Headquarters, 3rd Army (Fort McPherson, Georgia), which is  the main body for operational command and control of the RDF  Army component; Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps (Fort Bragg,  North Carolina); 82nd Airborne Division (Fort Bragg); 101st Air  Assault Division (Fort Campbell, Kentucky); 24th Mechanized  Division (Fort Stewart, Georgia); 1st Cavalry (Armored) Division  (Fort Hood, Texas); 7th Light Infantry Division (Fort Ord,  California); 10th Light Infantry Division (Fort Drum, New York),  units and subunits of field artillery, air defense, Army  aviation, and combat and logistic support from the corps makeup,  as well as attached units. In addition, depending on the region  where operational missions are being performed, the RDF may  include a Special Forces Group, Ranger subunits, and  psychological operations, intelligence and EW, and combat and  logistic support units.    Each division making up the XVIII Airborne Corps (airborne,  air assault, light infantry, mechanized and armored) presently  has its own table of organization structure and is earmarked for  performing specific combat missions. But composite task forces  of a mixed makeup may be established under certain conditions  based on units of these divisions, reinforced by Special Forces  and Marine subunits, as was the case in Panama and during  Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. That approach ensures  expansion of these units' functional missions, especially during  operations under special conditions (on coastal axes, in a city,  in the jungle, in a desert and so on).    The Army component of the RDF may have a total of  100,000-120,000 persons, up to 650 tanks, over 800 guns, mortars  and MLRS, over 1,500 ATGM systems, around 670 air defense  weapons and over 1,100 helicopters (including around 540 attack  helicopters).    Based on available strategic movement assets and the  experience of deployment in the period of the Persian Gulf  military conflict, the following strategic mobility standards  have been established for XVIII Airborne Corps formations: A  "light" division is airlifted to any forward zone in 12 days and  a brigade from its makeup in 4 days; a simultaneous combination  movement (by air and sea) of two "heavy" divisions is  accomplished in 30 days. Deployment of XVIII Airborne Corps with  a full complement of units of corps subordination in any  overseas theater must be completed in 75 days.    U.S. experts emphasize that prepositioned stockpiles of  weapons, military vehicles and supplies in potential conflict  areas as well as forces and assets for supporting the  accelerated movement of troops there are of special significance  in questions of improving RDF strategic mobility. In connection  with this, the U.S. military budget provides annual  appropriations for resolving such problems.    The 82nd Airborne Division is considered the most  combat-ready formation of the U.S. Army. Its units and subunits  are intended for operations in the RDF forward echelon, and so  the following operational standards have been established for  them:     -  all personnel are assembled in 2 hours (each serviceman in  the division is obligated to have a portable beeper constantly  on his person);    -  one division brigade is on alert duty in 18-hour  readiness for moving to any region of the world;    -  an airborne  battalion is assigned by schedule from this brigade with  readiness of its companies for movement set at 2, 4 and 6 hours  respectively;    -  one division airborne company is constantly on  alert duty at Pope AFB in 15-minute readiness (after receipt of  a signal) for loading on C-130 military transport aircraft.       Special rigging subunits are attached to the division whose  primary mission is to ensure accelerated preparation for the  assault landing and loading of weapons and supplies into  aircraft.    Essentially all division personnel have taken part in combat  operations during various U.S. Armed Forces operations and have  a high level of professional training. Special attention is  attached to paratroop training. Combat subunits make parachute  jumps weekly and division staff officers (as well as those on  the XVIII Airborne Corps staff) do so 1-2 times a month. All  jumps are made with personal weapons and full gear, and over  half at night and under extreme conditions.    Possibilities of creating a separate light armored cavalry  regiment as a separate unit of XVIII Airborne Corps are being  studied. It is assumed that this unit will be the 2nd Separate  Armored Cavalry Regiment, brought back from the FRG in 1992 and  in a stage of reorganization at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Three  light reconnaissance battalions, an Army aviation battalion, air  defense battery and mortar company may make up the basis of the  regiment's organizational structure. In addition, it will  include a combat engineer company and NBC company as well as a  logistic support battalion. The proposed numerical strength of  the regiment is around 4,000. Initially it will be equipped with  multipurpose Hummer motor vehicles and OH-58D reconnaissance  helicopters, and in the future with light tanks, new-generation  combat reconnaissance vehicles and Comanche helicopters being  created.    The U.S. military press has mentioned repeatedly that  strategic bomber and tactical air wings of 9th Air Force  (Headquarters at Shaw AFB, South Carolina) are the basis of the  RDF Air Force component. Units of different air components are  represented in the 9th Air Force structure, which ensures its  effective combat employment in low- and medium-intensity  conflicts in essentially all overseas theaters. According to  data of AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, its order of battle includes ten air  wings: Two strategic bomber (42nd and 416th), six fighter (1st,  31st, 33rd, 56th, 347th and 363rd) and two composite (4th and  23rd). An option is being examined for disbanding three wings in  the process of implementing the overall program for reducing the  numerical and effective combat strength of the U.S. Armed Forces.    The 9th Air Force inventory presently includes 15 B-52  strategic bombers, 610 F-15, F-16 and A-10 combat aircraft of  tactical aviation, 85 KC-135 and KC-10 tanker aircraft and 50  C-130 tactical transport aircraft.    The 9th Air Force organizational structure provides for  strategic movement of RDF first echelon components to forward  areas, their air cover in the course of operational deployment,  and close air support in conducting operations. The question now  being discussed about the possibility of establishing a  composite air-land formation based on the 23rd Composite Air  Wing and 82nd Airborne Division and capable of operating  independently in any theaters deserves attention in this regard.  It is proposed that the 23rd Composite Air Wing will include  squadrons of C-130 transport aircraft (10-12), A-10 attack  aircraft (24), F-16 tactical fighters (24), as well as combat  support aircraft. Within a theater this wing will be able to  carry out the airlift and landing of up to two battalions of  82nd Airborne Division and in addition provide close air support  of division units in performing the combat mission.    The U.S. command's approach to assigning forces and assets  from the Navy to the RDF is very characteristic. It is  determined by national naval strategy presently in effect which  provides for the constant presence of groupings of U.S. naval  forces in strategic regions most important to the United States  -- in the Atlantic (Second Fleet), Mediterranean (Sixth Fleet),  Indian Ocean and Western Pacific (Seventh Fleet), and Central  and Eastern Pacific (Third Fleet).    In connection with this, the makeup of the RDF grouping  established with the appearance of a crisis in one of the  forward areas will include naval components which are in  immediate proximity to the center of conflict, and if necessary  also moved in from adjacent areas.    Activity of the U.S. Navy composite task force performing  combat missions in the Persian Gulf is most indicative in this  respect. It has been operating there since the time of the war  against Iraq. Its makeup increased from 8 to 20 combatant ships  in different stages of the escalation of tension in the region.  There are 1-2 carrier battle groups and an amphibious group  (with a Marine expeditionary battalion aboard) constantly  present in it (by rotation). Ships of this task force took part  in delivering air and cruise missile strikes against Iraq during  the U.S. Armed Forces Operation Desert Sting (January 1993), and  they delivered the missile strike against Baghdad on 26 June  1993.    According to press reports, the type makeup of a carrier  battle group may include 6-11 ships (including one carrier), 1-2  guided missile cruisers, 2-3 guided missile destroyers and  frigates, 1-3 destroyers and frigates and 1-2 nuclear powered  multipurpose submarines (SSN's). The type makeup of deck-based  aviation of a carrier battle group includes over 80 combat  aircraft and helicopters, of which 34-40 are nuclear weapon  platforms.    In some cases a missile battle group may be established and  used instead of a carrier battle group. It can have 5-8 ships,  including up to 2 guided missile cruisers, 3-5 destroyers and  frigates and an SSN. Arming missile battle group ships with  Tomahawk cruise missiles, intended for delivering precision  strikes against shore targets and forces of surface ships, gives  them the capability of effectively supporting ground troops  operating on coastal axes, and in some areas performing some of  the missions assigned to a carrier battle group.    A ship striking force (3-4 ships) may include a guided  missile cruiser and 2-3 destroyers armed both with antiship  cruise missiles as well as with Tomahawk cruise missiles for  firing against ground targets.    An amphibious group, intended for moving and landing  amphibious assault forces, includes from 3 to 8 landing ships  for various purposes, including one helicopter carrier or  amphibious assault ship. Under ordinary conditions, one Marine  expeditionary battalion is accommodated aboard ships of one  group.    A Marine expeditionary division with an overall numerical  strength of up to 50,000 persons is capable of operating as part  of the RDF both independently as well as together with naval  ship forces, ground troops and air forces. It includes a Marine  division, reinforcing units and subunits and an air wing. The  Marine expeditionary division can be landed in 3-5 days on a  beachhead up to 30 km wide and up to 40 km deep.    A Marine expeditionary brigade numbering 10,000-16,000  persons consists of a regimental landing team, composite air  group and brigade service support group. The Marine  expeditionary brigade can be landed on a beachhead 7-10 km wide  and up to 15 km deep, and the overall time for landing its first  echelon is up to 3 days.    A Marine expeditionary battalion numbering up to 2,500  persons includes a battalion landing team, composite helicopter  squadron and battalion service support group. It lands on a  beachhead 1.5 km wide and up to 5 km deep. Assault subunits of  the battalion landing team are landed in an hour and the entire  battalion landing team in 4-6 hours.    Squadrons of land-based patrol aircraft (each with eight  P-3C  Orions) are employed as part of the RDF both independently as  well as in coordination with naval ship forces for conducting  visual reconnaissance and SIGINT collection, hunting and killing  submarines and laying mines.    The 1st Marine Division (Camp Pendleton, California) and 7th  Marine Brigade (Twentynine Palms, California) are earmarked for  operations as part of the RDF. With the appearance of a crisis  in Southwest Asia, the forward echelon of 1st Marine Division  and 7th Marine Brigade will be airlifted to the conflict area  and draw weapons and military equipment from depot ships of 2nd  Squadron based at Diego Garcia Island, in the Indian Ocean.  Stockpiles of weapons have been established on depot ships for a  Marine expeditionary brigade and an Army brigade, as well as  stockpiles of supplies for supporting their operations for 30  days.    In the assessments of Pentagon representatives, a priority  direction of U.S. Armed Forces organizational development in the  next few years will be comprehensive development of means of  strategic movements. Within the framework of accomplishing this  task it is planned to implement programs to create new C-17  transport aircraft capable of delivering large combat equipment  to combat operations areas and to outfit U.S. Air Force military  transport aviation with them. Simultaneously, by the end of 1997  it is planned to bring the overall number of depot ships in  forward areas to 34 (including 13 with Marine armament and 21  with heavy equipment for the Army).    U.S. military experts believe that implementation of these  plans will permit a significant reduction in existing standards  for strategic deployment of the RDF in overseas theaters by the  year 2,000.    The U.S. command is giving heightened attention to questions  of RDF technical outfitting and operational and combat training.  In particular, RDF formations and units are being outfitted with  modern weapons and vehicles and being manned by the best trained  and most experienced servicemen, who as a rule have combat  experience.    In accordance with the global direction of RDF training,  subunits from its makeup periodically take part in operational  measures (exercises, ground reconnaissance, inspections) in  potential military conflict areas -- Europe, Central and South  America, the Near and Middle East, and Africa. Integrated RDF  exercises are held regularly in the continental United States.  Their training background conforms to particular exacerbations  of the military-political situation in various regions of the  world.    According to foreign military press reports, despite reduced  appropriations for military purposes, the United States  continues to work actively to create new and modernize existing  models of weapons, military vehicles and means of logistic  support for troops. Thus, tests of a new tank to be supplied to  "light" formations of the RDF presently are being conducted on a  competitive basis. The following are the main tactical and  technical specifications for it: Crew of four, combat weight not  over 20 tons, air-transportability, possibility of being  parachute-landed, armament consisting of a 105-mm gun and two  machineguns (7.62-mm and 12.7-mm), computerized fire control  system, and top speed of at least 70 km/hr.    Great importance also is attached to outfitting units and  subunits with qualitatively new intelligence and EW assets,  night vision devices, devices for determining coordinates, and  highly mobile computer-based C[.sup]3[/] systems. This  equipment is being created with consideration of requirements  placed on the RDF such as high strategic mobility and  probability of use in theaters of military operations with  difficult physical-geographic conditions and poorly developed  infrastructure.    The U.S. command gives special attention to questions of  developing forms and methods of RDF combat employment. During  1991-1992 the Army Training and Doctrine Command completed  development of a new concept of combat employment of general  purpose forces and their most combat-ready element, the RDF. It  was titled "Air-Land Operations." Articles presently are being  published in Defense Department central publications in which  its basic provisions are being actively studied and discussed.    The concept represents the aggregate of U.S. Army and Air  Force leadership views on the nature and methods of operations  by U.S. General Purpose Forces throughout the spectrum of  possible military conflicts and wars of modern times, and under  special conditions of peacetime. Assessments of prospects for  development of the world military-political situation and U.S.  Armed Forces organizational development for the next decade as  well as an analysis of the experience of their combat operations  against Iraq and involvement in other local conflicts of recent  years have been made its basis.    The essence of the new concept is as follows. The U.S. Armed  Forces command proceeds from the assumption that, with the  disintegration of the USSR, a large-scale military conflict in  Europe with classic combat employment of large U.S. Armed Forces  groupings is unlikely. At the same time, there is an increasing  possibility of regional changes in the military-political  situation in Third World countries which may create a potential  threat to U.S. national interests. To eliminate this threat, the  full arsenal of means must be used immediately, from political  and economic pressure to direct armed intervention using the  full might of the Armed Forces.    The RDF's role grows considerably under those conditions. It  becomes a very important tool of the U.S. leadership for prompt  pressure on potential enemies. It can be moved in part or in its  main makeup to any region of the world in compressed time  periods, with the appearance of an emergency situation there.    One of the chief requirements being placed on the U.S. RDF  at  the present time is its readiness to localize any military  conflict back in the initial stage, in order to prevent its  escalation and development into a large-scale armed clash  fraught with heavy human and material losses for the United  States. It is possible to attain this goal only with close  interworking of the Army with the Air Force and Navy and under  certain conditions also with U.S. allies. Based on this, future  air-land operations in forward areas as a rule will be "joint"  (involving different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces) and  "combined" (involving allies). Operational groupings of forces  will be established for their conduct. Depending on the content  of combat missions, they may include components of tactical and  military transport aviation, the Navy and Special Forces along  with Army units.    Developers of the concept emphasize that all C[.sup]3[/]I  systems (above all space systems), airlift and sealift assets,  and reserves of weapons, military vehicles and logistic support  assets prepositioned in forward areas; and if necessary  components of regular Armed Forces and of the organized Reserve,  should be used in support of the RDF. Their operations will be  subordinated to a unified goal -- ensure successful conduct of  the operation by the RDF main body in the shortest possible time  and with minimum losses and material costs for the United States.    Where missions are performed by the RDF together with  allies,  the activity of the U.S. command should be directed toward their  comprehensive support above all with deep interdiction of the  enemy by air and missile strikes, but not with U.S. troops,  which "should not substitute for or duplicate the allies without  extreme need."    A fundamentally new provision in views of the U.S. Armed  Forces command is the possibility of employing the RDF in the  absence of a state of war (military conflict), but in the  presence of factual preconditions for its outbreak. Such actions  may include the following: Assisting friendly governments;  combating international terrorism and "contingency operations,"  including freeing hostages, evacuating American citizens,  helping to give humanitarian assistance, and fighting the drug  trade; a show of military force; limited strikes and raiding  (sabotage) operations; and other operational measures aimed at  maintaining economic and social stability in U.S. interests.    Many foreign sources note that such aspects of the U.S. RDF  as high combat readiness, strategic and operational mobility,  technical outfitting, teamwork and coordination of staffs and  troops, and a high level of professional training of all  personnel are achieved, above all, through the U.S.  military-political leadership's heightened attention toward RDF  organizational development and training. According to many  indicators, these forces are versatile and capable of operating  in any regions of the world independently or with allies. A  distinguishing feature of the RDF is considered to be the  precisely adjusted system of operational-strategic command and  control of all its components in the absence of a regular  command and control structure.    In the opinion of the U.S. military-political leadership,  existing approaches to U.S. RDF organizational development can  ensure the presence of a powerful tool of pressure in any region  of the world, even with a further reduction in the numerical and  effective combat strength of the U.S. Armed Forces.

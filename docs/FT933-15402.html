			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Brussels scales down ambitions on mergers: Commission forced to abandon plans to vet more cross-border takeovers THE European Commission has been forced to scale down ambitions to vet more cross-border takeovers in the face of strong opposition from Britain, Germany and France. Competition officials have abandoned their original hopes of lowering the turnover thresholds in its 1990 merger rules, above which takeovers are automatically examined in Brussels, for fear of upsetting member states. Instead, the Commission may propose a further review of merger regulations, perhaps in another two years. In an article published in the Financial Times today, Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, who heads the Commission's competition department, defends the performance of the merger control task force, and argues that the Commission should try to make the best possible use of the existing merger rules. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, has yet to decide formally whether to recommend changes to the EC's 1990 merger control rules. But he is known to be doubtful about the value of pushing for increased Commission powers when most member states are calling for greater 'subsidiarity' in the Community - devolving powers to the most appropriate national or regional authority. The Commission has been conducting a wide-ranging review of the 1990 merger rules, as required by the legislation. It will hold its last meeting with national merger authorities next week, and Mr Van Miert is likely to make recommendations to his fellow commissioners before the August summer break. At present Brussels examines mergers involving companies with a combined annual turnover worldwide of Ecu5bn, (Pounds 3.86bn) and combined EC turnover of more than Ecu250m. Other cases are referred back to member states, which also have the right to demand jurisdiction over mergers of particular national significance. Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Van Miert's predecessor, the European Parliament, and EC companies have all called for a cut in the thresholds. Such a reduction would have allowed the Commission to examine potentially significant cases such as the Reed-Elsevier publishing merger last year, or the ICI-BASF swap of polypropylene and acrylic glass activities, both of which fell below the existing thresholds. But France, Germany and the UK - all with well-established merger authorities - have resisted any extension of Brussels' jurisdiction. In his article, Mr Ehlermann does not argue for or against a change in the thresholds, but he does indicate that improvements could be made to the merger regulations without having to amend the law, a move which would require member states' approval. In particular, he urges greater transparency in procedures and working methods. The merger task force has been generally praised for its efficiency since its establishment in September 1990. It has only blocked one merger - the controversial Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker in 1991 - but has imposed conditions on a number of takeovers, including the Nestle bid for Perrier last year. Cutting the thresholds would have increased the number of cases automatically examined each year from 60 to 100, officials have estimated. Personal view, Page 21</p>

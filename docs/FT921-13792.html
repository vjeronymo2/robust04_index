			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / The European Market: EC television ownership rules - a fuzzy picture / Little sign of a single market when it comes to buying a TV station MR LESLIE HILL, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent Television, is not a Little Englander of the television business trying to build barricades around Birmingham and his Midlands franchise. Central, after all, is the company that won awards with 'Auf Wiedersehen Pet', a comedy series about British building workers in Germany. He insists that he welcomes competition from the rest of the European Community but would like there to be something approaching a level playing field. In the year the single European market is due to be completed, he has drawn attention to a series of anomalies in the ownership of commercial television companies. While a Community citizen or company can in theory take over a commercial television company, there are often government restrictions preventing this. In some cases these restrictions apply to everyone, in others just to foreign owners. Some appear to be clear breaches of the Treaty of Rome and of any concept of a single market. This year, the British government will formally lodge a complaint with the Commission against apparent, very public cases of discrimination against British and other EC television companies. 'We are in uncharted territory here,' said one senior Eurocrat contemplating the imminent arrival of yet another piece of Community awkwardness from the UK. The facts are relatively straightforward. Research carried for Central shows a maze of differing television ownership rules and restrictions throughout the EC. In Germany where commercial channels have to be licensed by each regional government, preference can be given to channels with 50 per cent or more German ownership. Non-German controlled channels are not considered for traditional terrestrial, as opposed to satellite, frequencies. In Greece, foreign ownership of a commercial television station is limited to 25 per cent; in Portugal, the limit in the new commercial channel TV1 is 15 per cent. Belgian legislation stipulates that 51 per cent of the private station broadcasting to the Flemish community must be owned by the publishers of Dutch-language daily or weekly newspapers. In France and Spain there are rules setting maximum ownership limits of 25 per cent for commercial stations, although these limits apply to everyone, including French and Spanish nationals. The principal aim is to prevent concentrations of media power. In the UK, by contrast, the government was advised when drawing up the 1990 Broadcasting Act that it would be a breach of the Rome Treaty to try to exclude other EC nationals. As a result, after a temporary restriction - a two-year moratorium on hostile takeovers of Independent Television (ITV) companies which runs out at the beginning of 1994 - any Community company will be able to own 100 per cent of an ITV company. The imbalance between the position in the UK and in some other Community countries, says Mr Hill, is 'unfair and wrong'. Central is particularly concerned because it is more vulnerable to foreign takeover than most. Not only is it the second largest ITV company, broadcasting to 9m people, but it retained its franchise unopposed with a bid of just Pounds 2,000 a year. More fundamentally, however, the Central chairman believes that in the longer term the world media could be dominated by half a dozen companies, two of which would probably be American, two Japanese and two European. In such a scenario Britain's tiny ITV companies could be sidelined if they were effectively prevented from expanding at home or into the rest of Europe. There are understandable sensitivities among smaller nations trying to defend minority languages and cultures that they should have some say over who owns and operates the dominant mass medium - television. It is also impossible to address the issue of television ownership rules in the Community without considering the dangers of media concentration. There are already at least four significant cross-border operators in European television: Mr Leo Kirch of Germany, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest, CLT of Luxembourg, and Canal Plus of France. Even if exceptions on cultural grounds have to be granted there is surely a case for trying to remove some of the distortions and introduce some harmony into ownership rules within what is supposed to be developing as a single market.</p>

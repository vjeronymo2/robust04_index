			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Shorter reports backed by DTI MORE individuals connected with quoted companies will be able to receive summary financial statements in place of full ones, under proposals issued by the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday. In a consultation document containing draft company legislation, the DTI recommends that debenture and loan stock holders and partial owners of shares should be able to receive summary statements. Summary financial statements - which have been permitted since April 1990 - include the basic profit-and-loss account with directors' remuneration, an outline balance sheet and contingent liabilities. They are designed to be easier to read, and provide more abbreviated information than the full accounts, by excluding items such as cash flows and detailed notes. Under existing legislation, companies are allowed to send summary statements to existing shareholders. The DTI said it was now extending the eligibility after representations from some large companies. That extends the facility to all those entitled to receive the full accounts, and to those such as investors with partly paid shares in privatisation issues. The consultation document also highlights a number of other minor changes in the regulations, including amendments for banks and dormant companies. It asks for comments on the proposals and the costs of compliance. Any submissions should be received by the DTI by November 6.</p>

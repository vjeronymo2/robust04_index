			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Motorola invests in Mexican cellular group Motorola, the US electronics and telecommunications group, is to acquire 42 per cent of Baja Celular, a cellular telephone company in northern Mexico, in return for investing more than Dollars 100m in the company. The stake in Baja Celular will give Motorola direct or indirect equity interests in the four cellular companies that cover the 2,000-mile Mexico-US border, and all of northern Mexico. Motorola has stakes in the two cellular companies that cover north-east Mexico, while Baja Cellular, and its fully-owned subsidiary Mobitel, cover the north-west. Motorola will invest in Baja Celular with Grupo Protexa, a Mexican industrial concern, with which it has agreed to form a joint venture to explore telecommunications opportunities in Mexico. Motorola plans to form a new company with Protexa that would acquire Motorola's cellular interests, the company said. Protexa announced last week that, overall, the new company would invest about Dollars 1.5bn in Mexican telecommunications. The company will participate in the tender for a long-distance telephone concession, and in wireless data and personal communications services. Protexa said it had begun preliminary negotiations with Sprint, the US carrier, over offering long-distance services in Mexico, although Motorola would only say that the company was in talks with various US and European carriers. Motorola said it had no plans to increase its stakes in cellular companies in northern Mexico. The company had taken equity interests to participate in the cellular business along the fast-growing border area, and to promote and sell Motorola cellular technology, it said.</p>

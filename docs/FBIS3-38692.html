			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Marseille, France, Feb 7 (AFP) -- Riot police  firing tear gas and using a water cannon on Monday [7 February]  cleared Marseille's port of ship repair workers who occupied it  last week in a bid to save their jobs.    Dockers immediately called a sympathy strike with workers of  the Sud-Marine ship repair yard, vowing not to return to work  until police were withdrawn.    A total of 615 Sud-Marine workers welded up the port gates  last Wednesday occupying it round-the-clock. Freight handling  was paralysed and some ferry traffic was diverted to the nearby  port of Toulon.    A court ordered the bankrupt Sud-Marine into liquidation on  January 6, setting a February 15 deadline for it to sell off its  assets and fire the 615.    The dockers' strike paralysed the whole of the port on  Monday, including the oil and chemicals terminal at Fos-sur-Mer  in the west. The Sud-Marine action had affected only the eastern  part of the port.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> MAD MARLIN TAKES ON TWO BOATS AND THREE FISHERMEN  </P> <P> It wasn't any holiday weekend for fish as the denizens of the deep gobbled up  bait.  </P> <P> Otto Kowal of Long Beach and 7-year-old son Mickey were fishing from their  skiff at Horseshoe Kelp over the holiday weekend for an hour without a bite, so  Kowal raised anchor and made the run to Catalina Island within an hour through  calm seas and no wind.  </P> <P> His only stop there was the east end quarry. He was fishing a cast away from  kelp when a marlin jumped over the bow of the small boat, missing the two by  inches.  </P> <P> It happened as the boy was reeling in a bass and the marlin followed it to the  surface.  </P> <P> "We both were using only 10-pound test line and could never hold that hungry  jumper with light tackle," Kowal said.  </P> <P> Switching to a rock cod rod and reel, he made several casts using bait and a  jig. The fish hit. While Kowal tried to reel it in after peeling most of the  line, the marlin started to move the boat toward another angler in a small  rubber raft.  </P> <P> Erik Landsfield of Carson was hooked up and following his fish as Kowal's skiff  approached. When the two were only a yard apart they discovered the marlin had  been snagged by Landsfield and had tangled with Kowal's line.  </P> <P> After an hour the tired marlin was brought to the surface.  </P> <P> The three anglers also limited out on bass and had an 11 1/3-pound sheepshead  to show for their holiday.  </P></p>

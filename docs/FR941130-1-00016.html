The amendments would: establish a separate standard to be used to determine whether a licensee who is a manufacturer would qualify as a small entity; and adjust the receipts-based standard to account for the effects of inflation since 1985. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comment period expires December 30, 1994.

After analyzing the data and consulting with the Small Business Administration (SBA), the NRC developed a proposed size standard that would be appropriate to use in determining which of its licensees would qualify as small entities for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The NRC published its proposed size standard for notice and comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 21, 1985 (50 FR 20913). After considering the comments received, the NRC adopted its final size standards as noted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 9, 1985 (50 FR 50241). In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56671), the NRC restated the size standards to include the Regulatory Flexibility Act's definition of small governmental jurisdiction. To further improve clarity, the NRC changed the presentation of the size standards to conform to the listing of definitions of small entities in the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The size standards developed by the NRC were used in the NRC's final rule implementing Public Law 101&hyph;508 to provide for a reduced annual fee for those NRC licensees who qualified as small entities under these standards (56 FR 31472; July 10, 1991 and subsequent years). In response to these rules, the NRC has received a number of comments concerning its size standards and the failure of the NRC to promulgate a size standard that differentiates between manufacturing entities and service providers. These commenters indicated that applying a gross receipts standard to a manufacturing concern resulted in an adverse impact on a manufacturer. The gross receipts of a service provider reflect the value added by the service provider, which is essentially the value of the service itself. However, the gross receipts of a manufacturer that are equal to those of a service provider reflect a smaller percentage of the value added by the manufacturer. A manufacturer's gross receipts include the costs of the raw materials or components that, when added to the cost of manufacture, quickly send a manufacturer's gross receipts into fairly sizeable sums. The SBA size standards for manufacturers are prescribed in terms of a maximum number of employees rather than in terms of gross receipts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

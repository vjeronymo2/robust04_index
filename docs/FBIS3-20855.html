Inactivity in terms of recovery in some regions can  be the source of new economic and social differences.  Developmental projects should necessarily involve promising  firms.    Three years of transformation have restored the  macroeconomic  balance (in the sense described by Walrasov) and has created a  demanding environment for the attainment of microeconomic  balances (in the Marshall sense). This historical operation,  based on the restoration of actual ownership, its  responsibility, and motivation, will culminate in the years  immediately ahead. There thus ensues the "moment of truth," in  which it will be shown, in specific terms, what has been done  well, what has been done wrong, and what was forgotten.    Subsequent "macro" and "micro" adjustment efforts will be  ongoing in the realistic territory of the new state and in its  spatial components. The recovery and failure of companies are  connected, albeit in an undesirable way, with the recovery and  failure of jobs. No definitive regions or any regional policy  exist, but more or less prosperous territories and areas develop  and can be transformed into crisis regions. The unseen hand of  the market directs capital streams toward more advantageous  areas; in other areas, however, people must also live and  prosper. The territory of the Czech Republic is also limited and  a rare resource, which must be handled economically.    Over the past three years, there have been great structural  changes in the market, changes in the areas of production and  services, changes in the structure of employment. The latter  have taken place even in the face of an enviable and criticized  low unemployment rate. This development was aided by a specific  policy and the activities of people, things that relieve the  pressure on the labor market. The ranks of the unemployed did  not include mothers, who may devote themselves to their children  at home thanks to a social contribution--neither did the ranks  of the unemployed include those working abroad or 120,000 of  those who, with the support of labor offices, embarked upon new  activities in newly created jobs. Thus, 4-5 percent of the  people did not become unemployed but are working, for the most  part, for low wages and are paying high taxes. However, given  the ideal 3-percent unemployment rate (some consider it to be  harmfully low), individual and contiguous territories have come  into being in which an average of 30-60 unemployed can be  offered only a single job. In the city of Prague, one applicant  for work is statistically offered 10 jobs from the register and  actually has 20 from which to choose. The creation of new jobs  is progressing under influences that are different from those  that created populations in the territories. Not all of these  people can move without the development of depopulated and  "uninhabited" territories. In looking at the situation depicted  on the map, it must be clear that, in some territories, a  situation is developing that makes further restructuring more  difficult. For example, this holds true in the Saar region, the  Rhine River region, Lotringen, Linz, and the Japanese  steelmaking regions; restructuring was so successful in these  areas that the so-called centrifugal effect gave rise to the  development of thousands of small firms with hundreds of  thousands of jobs in neighboring territories. In the "old  territories" of United Germany, employment rose 5 percent over  the past 12 years in 41 industrial centers but increased 17  percent in its marginal territories! It was only as the result  of such a centrifugal effect that employment in the Rhine River  region was able to decline by 24 percent without causing  economic or social reverberations. In our country, for example,  Ostrava (with 5-percent unemployment) is surrounded by  territories having a far higher rate of unemployment and a  frozen rate of new job creation, even before restructuring,  which is far worse.  <H5>  Unemployment in the Territories </H5>   For more than two years now, there has been express  territorial differentiation regarding the development of  unemployment and the creation of new jobs. Current records, by  okres, documenting this development indicate that, on the one  hand, okreses in which there are 10 jobs per applicant do exist  and, on the other hand, there are okreses in which there are 30  applicants for one job. However, in the smaller territorial  entities, these differences are significantly greater. In the  attached map [not reproduced here] showing the territorial  breakdown of unemployment (as of 31 August 1993), territories  with double-digit unemployment (dots), quadruple unemployment  (crosses), and sextuple unemployment (black areas) can be  clearly seen in comparison with the Republic average (3 percent).    An analysis of these critical and languishing territories  shows that:     -  Long-term unemployment is growing there, and the number of  jobs is declining; the creation of new jobs is negligible,  temporary, and thus results in repeated unemployment.    -  The wage  and income level of the population in these territories is  declining; community budgets are shrinking, and resources for  temporary employment in publicly beneficial type of work are  disappearing.    -  In these territories, the number of families  drawing payments to supplement their minimum level of the  standard of living, with which it is possible to exist for a  certain time but not to live normally in the long run, is  growing.    -  These areas are not demonstrating growing buying power  and demand for new products and services; the opportunities to  develop new meaningful jobs are running up against the tight  barriers created by a market that is progressively more  impoverished.    -  In these areas, the infrastructure,  transportation, communications, etc. is failing; "uninhabited"  regions with devastated facilities, etc. are developing.    The above negative tendencies are gaining in strength and  absent any new effective policy for territorial recovery will  acquire socioeconomic emphasis, particularly in the area of  Silesia and Moravia. Additional unemployment, over and above  that shown on the map--that is to say, an increase in the Czech  Republic by 0.5 percent during the period 1 September through  the end of 1993--took place primarily in the more expanded  crisis territories of Moravia and Silesia, in addition to  several regions in Bohemia. This trend will continue at a  greater rate of speed and will, apart from affecting less or  more qualified workers, impact primarily on mothers and people  with impaired health.    If we project the ongoing trends in the territorial  development of unemployment and incorporate in them the  inaccurate notions regarding the downsizing of existing firms,  it is possible to express the notion, on an overall basis  (macro), that, if the average rate of unemployment rises to 5  percent, it will be distributed as follows:    Czech Republic--5%     Bohemia--Less Than 3%   Moravia and Silesia--More                                                 Than 9%                          Including:3 okreses     Including:Half of okreses                         with about 10%          with about 15%                         unemployment5           unemploymentOne-third of                         territories with        territories with about 25-30%                         about 15%               unemployment                         unemployment   Note: Territories do not cover an entire okres but transcend the borders of  two or three okreses.      A further "waiting for economic growth" can, particularly in  more extensive territories in Moravia and Silesia, lead to  weakening civic solidarity and support for economic  transformation. The warning thus expressed is based not only on  the analysis of the reasons for its development but also from  the evaluation of further development projected for the  territories of the Jesenik area, the Osoblah area, the Vitkov  region, the Zivotice region, the Hlucin region, the Novy Jicin  area, the Roznov area, the Belokarpaty area, the Breclav area,  the Mikulov area, the Znojmo area, the Trebic area, etc. An  evaluation of further possible development in West Bohemia,  Central Bohemia, and North Bohemia territories indicates the  possibility of a certain recovery over the next one to two years  as a result of the transfer of thousands of new jobs from  Germany (resulting from the advantage of comparatively lower  costs for the German firms involved). In a number of the  indicated regions of Czech okreses, it is more likely to be able  to anticipate a recovery, an above-average growth of wages and  income, a growth in prosperity.    In territories to the east of the Czech-Moravian highlands,  capital interest in subsupplier or cooperative establishment of  jobs is only extremely weak, the comparative advantages are  negligible; and low wage costs do not predominate over transport  and infrastructure disadvantages.    The anticipated restructuring, the downsizing and  liquidation  of some firms that do not show any structural promise for the  future, in areas that are already in a crisis today will result  in a negative multiplier effect--that is, in the liquidation of  hundreds of small private firms. In the crisis territories,  paradoxically, there was even the downsizing and liquidation of  an entire series of formerly secondary and "splinter" production  facilities, which occurred on the basis of "competitive  privatization interests." Meanwhile, privatized companies with  promising futures, located where the former "principal"  enterprises were found, approximately 100 km away, are  increasing their employment by hiring foreign workers. The  growth of authorized as well as "black" foreign employment has  grown to excessive and warning dimensions in 1993. The number of  instances in which the provision of support for the development  of new private firms has resulted in increased unemployment of  foreign workers in areas of economic prosperity and increased  unemployment in crisis areas is expanding. The excuse that  workers have lower mobility is based, for the most part, on  ignorance of the relevant demographic, economic, housing, and  transport characteristics. Further inactivity regarding  territorial recovery can, within a short time, result in new  economic and social differences--that is to say, there can  develop extensive territories of prosperity and extensive  territories of failure. For purposes of revival of territories  heading toward failure, it is necessary to fundamentally create  external advantages for the influx of promising coproduction  facilities and the development of positive multiplier effects.  <H5>  Projects Involving the Recovery of Crisis Regions </H5>   If we wish to avoid ineffective and expensive methods of  state subsidies and support for territories that are falling  behind--that is, the perfunctory kraj or okres understanding of  subsidies "from above"--we must consider the creation of  advantageous conditions for the establishment of effective jobs  by existing promising firms as the economic and social solution.  Such "external advantages" require the working out of  territorial projects, on the basis of which those firms with  good competitive prospects must be persuaded to establish  operating facilities in crisis locations.    The plan for territorial recovery should contain the  characteristics of localities for new firms on the territory,  their product and technological aims and equipment, their  infrastructure requirements, and personnel (professional)  staffing, including supplemental and on-the-job training. All of  this should then be accompanied by the appropriate financial  budget.    In the majority of cases, for demographic, technical,  infrastructure, and other reasons, this will involve the  establishment primarily of small or medium-sized enterprises of  a cooperative, subsupplier character in relatively small  territories. In 1994, approximately 12 such projects for  territorial recovery should be worked out and initiated--three  in Bohemia and nine in Silesia and Moravia. As a general rule,  the identified territories will incorporate parts of two or  three okreses and will transcend "historical" borders of various  lands (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia)--that is to say, they will  require cooperation even among several community and okres  organizations, several branch offices of banks, labor offices,  and appropriate facilities of okres offices. A so-called pilot  project should determine the adequate form for the  initiative-directing organ for the project, its composition,  authorities, and responsibilities.    Okres labor offices and their branches will thus acquire new  tasks involving the following:     -  The diagnosis of crisis territories, their labor,  demographic, and professional potential. (Note: Existing records  of job applicants do not provide all necessary data for this  purpose.)    -  Participation in placing the order for and the  financing of the project with a specialized firm.    -  Selection and  combination of amended instruments of an active employment  policy.    -  Recommendation of the optimal character of production  and services for the working potential of the territory in  question.    -  Evaluation of the mobility characteristics of workers  and qualified estimates of multiplier effects of employment in  the territory in question or in surrounding  territories.    -  Initiative activities involved in directing the  work on the project and its realization.    -  The acquisition of  firms and those interested in moving to the territories--that is  to say, collaboration with labor offices in those okreses in  which the potential applicant firms, interested in establishing  their operations in the projected crisis territory, are  active.    -  Evaluation of the extent and the need for external  advantages for the realization of the project--that is,  investments for the acquisition of suitable areas, the  infrastructure and buildings for the entry of new firms,  "softer" credits, etc.    Identifying the territories for the recovery project will  result even in a new degree of initiative, cooperative and  financial participation on the part of the Directorate of  Employment Services of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare  of the Czech Republic.    The leadership of that ministry has made a fundamental  recommendation for the necessary changes in the instruments  governing the area of requalification, participation in public  works programs, etc. It even supports the concept of  intensifying territorial recovery that I have presented on  behalf of the Research Institute for Labor and Social Affairs,  together with the Directorate for Employment Services. Now, it  is a question of finding the firms or institutes that will work  out the project with our help--of course, in competition (for a  contract price) so that the quality of these organizations might  entice both our firms and foreign firms to establish new  operations.    As far as foreign firms are concerned, let us be realists.  The recession and unemployment, which are general, tend to  prevent rather than stimulate the entrance of large-scale  capacities. Not even the most recent "high-tech" technologies  will come. Help for the crisis territories will come primarily  out of our heads and as a result of our specialized efforts. If  anyone has the desire to "help" the problem through the use of  vulgar politicization, he should consider that we are talking  here about jobs for 100,000 people and not of a few power  positions.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hoesch satisfied with performance HOESCH, the German steel and engineering group merging with its former rival, Krupp, says it is satisfied with its performance in the first third of the current year. Profits were slightly ahead of budget, and the core steel business made a profit during the period. The order book was stable, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive, said. Hoesch also released its profits for 1991, which were down by almost a half over the previous year at the operating level. It said it would hold 1991 dividend at DM10 per share. Operating profits fell to DM262m (Dollars 158.70m) last year, down from DM440m in 1990. Sales fell from DM16.14bn to DM13.31bn - reflecting not only poor steel prices but also the decision not to consolidate the O&amp;K construction equipment subsidiary. Rationalisation measures meant that Hoesch Stahl, the core steel subsidiary, broke even despite the 'incessant' fall in steel prices. Profits from other areas - such as processing and industrial technology - were up but did not reach 1990 levels. The merger with Krupp is expected to be approved at the Hoesch annual meeting on June 22.</p>

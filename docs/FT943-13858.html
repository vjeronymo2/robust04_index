			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Construction review aims to halt abuse Proposals to reduce conflict and improve services in the construction industry are to be published today in the most far-reaching review of the sector for 30 years. The review is expected to recommend the formation of a powerful industry steering group - led by the environment secretary - to oversee the changes and assist in the development of improved contract forms and management practices. It would include representatives from leading customer organisations as well as construction employers and professionals. Led by Sir Michael Latham, a former Conservative MP and ex-director of the House Builders Confederation, the review is the biggest inquiry into the industry since the Banwell Report in the 1960s. It has been financed by the government and the industry. It aims to cut construction costs and delays by reducing opportunities for contract abuses and litigation. A customers' forum, representing some of the industry's biggest clients, is likely to be proposed to provide a focal point for purchasers and provide advice on how to improve contractual relationships. The report is expected to propose improved payment procedures, including possible legislation to reduce financial strains caused by late payments. It is considering the establishment of trust funds to hold contract cash to protect companies when customers or contractors go into receivership. It is thought to be critical of public-sector tendering practices which encourage purchasers to accept the lowest prices. These can be loss-making for contractors which then have to cut costs, damaging quality, or pursue claims for additional payments to make up their money. A recent study of 50 road contracts for the Department of Transport showed that the final bill paid by the department was on average 27 per cent higher than the original contract price. Sir Michael is expected to recommend that public-sector purchasers should be further encouraged to weigh other factors such as quality and reliability when awarding contracts. The review, although it falls short of an outright recommendation, is thought to look sympathetically on contractors' requests for company registration schemes to combat cowboys. The schemes would be similar to those operating in continental European countries which are often used to discourage foreign competitors in home markets.</p>

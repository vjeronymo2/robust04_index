			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BOY MEETS GRAIL  </P> <P> Robin Williams and director Terry Gilliam are reteaming -- this time, for a  drama.  </P> <P> Williams -- who went uncredited for his depiction of the Moon King in Gilliam's  fantasy, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" -- will star in "The Fisher  King."  </P> <P> He'll play a radio-show personality whose career and life take nose-dives. Down  and out on the streets of New York, he encounters some street people who lead  him on a personal quest. The title refers to a character who figures in the  legend of the Holy Grail.  </P> <P> Scripted by Richard Lagravanese, "The Fisher King" will be produced by Debra  Hill and Lynda Obst for Tri-Star.  </P> <P> Filming's set to begin in May on a $20-25 million budget, according to a  project insider -- relatively modest, compared to Gilliam's notable  budget-buster, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen."

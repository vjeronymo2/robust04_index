			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Peace is one thing, cash another: The new world order is pulling at United Nations' purse-strings JUST FOUR weeks after President George Bush and leaders of a dozen other nations gathered in New York to solemnly proclaim a central role for the United Nations in 'the new world order', alarms are sounding over the cost of their grand design. Members always knew that sending UN troops into the field could be expensive, but a shock wave ran through the Security Council when Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new secretary-general, submitted his Dollars 633.5m budget for a year-long operation in Yugoslavia. Although he said that UN military intervention offered the best hope for preventing renewal of the civil war, full deployment of the 14,000-person force has had to be delayed. The US, Britain, France, Russia and China - the five permanent members of the Security Council - want him to pare costs by at least Dollars 100m. These veto-wielding countries must pay the lion's share - 56.155 per cent - of peacekeeping bills for the privilege of retaining their 'special responsibilities' under the UN Charter. This represents an international treaty binding on all members, yet few states honour their obligations. When Mr Boutros Ghali took over from Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar at the beginning of the year, only 25 out of 159 members (new admissions by next week will have increased the number to 175) had paid all their assessments. That left a deficit of Dollars 816.5m, equal to 45 per cent of the 1991 budget. The biggest debtor by far was the US, which also has the highest assessment  -25 per cent - based on a combination of factors including population and gross national product (GNP). The US administration has promised to pay its dues of more than Dollars 500m, but the US Congress still has not authorised funding. The world body soon will launch its most ambitious peacekeeping enterprise ever: a massive, 16-month-long plan to democratise and rehabilitate Cambodia. This is a country with virtually no infrastructure, and the UN will have to bring in even the most basic of essentials. Mr Boutros Ghali has put the total cost, to be paid by assessments, at Dollars 1.9bn. On top of that, Dollars 800m is needed in voluntary contributions to resettle 350,000 Cambodian refugees, 170,000 internally displaced persons and 150,000 demobilised troops. Critics again are shouting 'Too Much]', and the secretary-general's appeal for a Dollars 200m down-payment to start the operation has gone unanswered. UN costs for Yugoslavia and Cambodia together will come in at more than four times the Dollars 700m that UN members were asked to pay last year for peacekeeping. And there may be more expenses to come. Projected UN peacekeeping in Spain's former territory of Western Sahara during a referendum on its political future is expected to be budgeted at a minimum of Dollars 177m. A tenuous ceasefire in Somalia brokered by the UN has been hailed as Mr Boutros Ghali's first diplomatic triumph, but a UN operation in Somalia could be costly and dangerous. It might even be unpopular, if a miserly response of only Dollars 20m donated so far to a Dollars 621m appeal for voluntary humanitarian relief is any guide. Including Cambodia, where an advance group of about 1,400 personnel is already in place, there are 10 peacekeeping operations around the world today, all running large deficits. Thirteen similar missions have been disbanded since the first was begun in 1948. One is still going strong: monitoring the Arab-Israel ceasefire. Mr Boutros Ghali, a shrewd diplomat whose no-nonsense style has won critics as well as admirers, foresaw that those euphoric participants at the UN summit might sing another tune when they had to reckon with costs. He has been mandated to produce by July 1 recommendations for a new, stronger UN in a report that must also address the financial implications. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, the UN is struggling to fulfil its mandate to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, block President Saddam Hussein's nuclear aspirations and ensure that Kuwaitis and others who suffered under Iraqi occupation receive compensation. So far, a commission set up to handle this has received a paltry Dollars 17m. Iraq is supposed to foot most of the bill. But sanctions remain in force, and Mr Saddam refuses even to sell the Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil that the Security Council has agreed he may ship to meet urgent needs. Officials say there is a real possibility that the Commission may have to close shop. One of a number of top UN officials now crunching numbers observed: 'The members want to buy a Boeing 747, but all they're willing to pay for is a two-seater Piper Cub.'</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Annual statement pledge for pension schemes MEMBERS OF occupational pension schemes are to be given a new entitlement to an annual statement saying how much their savings are worth, the government said yesterday. The government committed itself to the move in its formal response to the report on the Maxwell affair from the cross-party social security committee of the last parliament. The change in the law is, however, unlikely to be immediate. It will probably be carried out along with the conclusions of the committee given the task of reviewing pension law and regulation earlier this month. The committee, to be chaired by Professor Roy Goode of Oxford University, is to publish a consultation paper within a few weeks. While the government has accepted the main recommendations of the social security committee, it continues to argue that it does not have any special responsibility for members of the BIHL pension scheme - the company that was sold to Robert Maxwell by British Airways in 1986, when BA was still publicly owned. Ministers say BA's articles of association meant that the transport secretary had to be notified of the decision, but did not have any right of consent. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has also moved to tighten information provision for pension scheme members. Information that must now be provided, under regulations laid yesterday, includes details about the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service and the ombudsman. The other members of the pension law review committee were announced yesterday. They are: Mr Tony Atkinson, professor at the London School of Economics, Mr David Berridge, Scottish Equitable Life Assurance chief executive, Mr Harvie Brown, actuary at William Mercer Fraser Ltd, Mr Bryan Hines, former ICI general manager of insurance and investments, Mr Stuart James, a partner at Rowe and Maw, Mr Terence Libby, Morrisflex chief executive, Mr Alastair Ross-Goobey, James Capel chief investment strategist, Ms Patricia Triggs, a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock and Ms Sue Ward, a freelance journalist and researcher on pensions issues.</p>

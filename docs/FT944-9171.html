			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (17): Down but not out - Hedge funds Hedge funds have been blamed for a wide variety of financial market upheavals ranging from the 1993 breakdown of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System to this year's bloodbath in the bond markets. Yet, beyond the sensational headlines about the big bucks and big egos associated with this industry, few people have a clear understanding of how hedge funds work. What is more, although hedge fund managers, like many other financial market participants, have lost large amounts of money in this year's market turbulences, talk about the imminent demise of the industry is premature. 'This year has been an aberration,' says Dixon Boardman, managing director of Optima Funds, who run some Dollars 650m in multi-manager funds. 'These people are the great investment brains of the fund management industry, and a great brain doesn't go stupid overnight. They will rise and shine again.' As observers try to assess the success rate of the manifold strategies pursued by hedge fund managers, the debate over what exactly constitutes a hedge fund continues. Originally, hedge funds were US equity funds which 'hedged' against market declines by holding short, as well as long, positions. In recent years, however, funds started using leverage and derivatives to enhance returns and taking large bets on the direction of markets. The picture is further complicated by managed futures funds, which use similar techniques to some hedge funds but invest only in derivatives, rather than cash securities. According to estimates by Tass, a London-based research firm which monitors some 1,500 absolute-return managers, Dollars 75bn to Dollars 80bn are invested in hedge funds, which number between 800 and 900 worldwide. With a handful of big players dominating the market, some 35 per cent of that money is said to be managed by about 1 per cent of the fund managers. Meanwhile, some Dollars 25bn are under management with about 450 to 500 active futures managers, according to Tass. 'The expression hedge-fund industry is a misnomer,' says Joseph Nicholas, president of Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago-based consulting firm. 'It has become a catch-all for a variety of skill-based strategies, many of which don't even use derivatives.' HFR have devised a list of 12 typical investment strategies employed by hedge fund managers, and track the performance of each of these sectors on a quarterly basis. These include short-sellers, funds which invest in distressed securities, emerging markets funds, macro funds, convertible arbitrage funds, and merger arbitrage funds. Rather than putting all their eggs in one basket by picking one particular type of fund manager, many investors choose to spread their money - and their risk - across a spectrum of management styles by buying so-called multi-manager funds. These are funds which are invested with a selection of hedge-fund managers pursuing different strategies. 'We try to blend together a group of these managers and aim to give our investors a smooth ride,' says Mr Boardman, who runs such a fund. 'In this year's volatile markets, the multi-manager approach has been vindicated,' he says, adding:'At Optima, we haven't attended any weddings this year, but Iam happy to say we also haven't attended any funerals.' In 1993, most hedge funds, especially those investing in fixed income, produced stellar performances as the global bond market rally pushed yields close to historical lows. With billions of dollars to invest, some of the large global, or macro, participants were unable to take large positions in equity markets and traded the bond and currency markets, the only ones big enough to offer the liquidity they needed. Steep yield curves enticed hedge funds and banks' proprietary traders to leverage up massively by borrowing money low rates and buy European bonds. That lucrative game came to an end early this year amid growing signs that the bond rally was overdone. The tide turned abruptly on February 4, when the US Federal Reserve raised short-term rates for the first time in the current cycle, triggering a sharp sell-off in the bond markets and inflicting heavy damage on the most highly leveraged operators. 'We have had a slow, painful bond market crash which has created an extremely difficult environment for many people, and huge losses by some of the big participants have given the hedge-fund industry a reputation it doesn't deserve,' says Jean-Francois Buisseret, managing director of Concerto Research, which advises a Jersey-based multi-manager investment company. Many macro fund managers also lost money on the mistaken bet that the dollar would rise substantially in 1994. Among this year's most widely publicised casualties were three hedge fund managers referred to as 'the three Davids': David Askin, David Gerstenhaber and David Weill. At the beginning of 1993, their fund management companies had combined equity under management of around Dollars 2.5bn; today, after heavy losses, redemptions and, in one case, bankruptcy, that has dwindled to around Dollars 70m. Some of the big macro fund managers, such as Michael Steinhardt, Leon Cooperman and Julian Robertson, also incurred sharp losses due to their high exposure to bond markets. According to Tass, macro funds lost between 18 and 20 per cent in the year to end-October. Meanwhile, many smaller hedge fund managers employing more specialist strategies managed to protect their downside or even post gains in this difficult environment. 'About 60 per cent of money under management in hedge funds showed disappointing results, but in terms of fund managers, only about 20 per cent did really badly,' says Mr Buisseret. As he sees it, specialised niche players, rather than the big macro participants, hold the key to the future. 'I am a great believer in specialisation; markets are becoming more and more sophisticated and price movements are increasingly difficult to predict unless you know a lot about the market you are operating in.' However, the macro operators should not be relegated to the rubbish heap of fund-management history, boasting as they do highly respectable long-term track records. 'Looking back over the past five to 10 years, investors in these funds know they still did vastly better than if they invested in conventional funds,' says Mr Boardman. Indeed, despite their poor performance this year, 'we are staying with the macro managers and are confident they will recover their losses', says Michael Goldman, managing director of Momentum Asset Management, which runs multi-manager hedge funds.</p>

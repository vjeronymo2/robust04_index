			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Fleet chiefs slam brakes on company cars Many UK company car drivers who felt hard done by if required to keep their cars for more than two years or 40,000 miles in the boom years of the 1980s now have to drive more than 70,000 miles and wait four years for a replacement. And 84 per cent of companies with a turnover of Pounds 500m-plus are intending to encourage employees to trade down to a cheaper car, provided it is suitable for their job, according to a survey published today. Almost half (48 per cent) of the smaller companies surveyed are planning similar action. Employees who trade down stand to make substantial savings on their personal tax bills when a new tax system for company cars comes into effect in April. It is based on a simple percentage of a car's purchase price rather than the present system of bands for price and engine size. To sweeten the pill however, a greater number of companies are allowing drivers to trade up to a higher grade of car by making a personal contribution to the cost. The findings by the Monks Partnership, in its annual survey of companies' car policies, show that 36 per cent of cars are being kept for more than 70,000 miles, up from 28 per cent in the previous year's study, and that even directors are being offered less choice of car. Even though they have to pay more tax on their company cars, fewer than one in 10 drivers being offered a cash alternative is taking it up. The small take-up on a cash alternative comes in spite of a near-doubling in the percentage of surveyed companies making the offer. The reduction in choice is being driven by greater cost-consciousness after the recession, with more companies negotiating large discounts by bulk-buying from a single manufacturer. Among the Pounds 500m-plus turnover companies, 58 per cent are now offer-ing a cash-for-car scheme, compared with 30 per cent 12 months ago. Only two out of 171 companies had moved to compulsory cash-for-car policies however. The survey makes some com-forting reading for BMW, the impending new owner of Rover group. BMWs are already twice as popular as Rovers among surveyed chief executives and all other directors except the chairman, who still usually drives a Jaguar. The survey is widely regarded as representative of British business as a whole. It was undertaken in December and January among a total of 171 companies, 62 of them with a turnover in excess of Pounds 500m. Monks Company Car Policy UK 1994.

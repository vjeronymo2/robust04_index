			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has finalized a  timetable for the privatization of 10 state-run enterprises,  with three of them to go private by the end of June, according  to the Commission of National Corporations under the ministry.    Yeh Men-sheng, vice chairman and executive director of the  Commission of National Corporations, said the Legislature in  mid- December approved a proposal to privatize the Taiwan  Machinery Manufacturing Corp. (TMMC), BES [expansion unknown]  Engineering Corp., and China Petrochemical Development Corp.  (CPDC) before fiscal 1994 ends on June 30.    Of these, the TMMC will be sold to the private sector  directly through an open tender, while the BES and the CPDC will  undergo public underwriting prior to open tender. Yeh said his  commission is stepping up related preparations for the  privatization of these three enterprises.    He continued that the BES and the CPDC will release 170  million shares and 330 million shares, respectively, for public  sales before the end of June.    Meanwhile, the state-run China Steel Corp., which will be  fully turned to private hands before fiscal 1995 ends on June  30, 1995, will release as many as 1.535 billion shares, some 22  percent of its total shareholdings, before the end of June 1994.    Accordingly, there are more than 2 billion shares to be made  available for public sales in the coming six months. In order  not to affect the performance of local stock market, the release  will be enforced in several stages of time before June 30, Yeh  said.    He added that Taiwan Fertilizer Corp. will go private in  fiscal 1995, and China Shipbuilding Corp. in fiscal 1997. And  the remaining six enterprises under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of Economic Affairs, such as Taiwan Power Company,  Chinese Petroleum Corp., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and Taiwan Salt  Works will be privatized before fiscal 2001.    Statistics showed that in the third quarter of last year,  the  10 state-owned enterprises recorded total earnings of NT$ [New  Taiwan dollars] 37.6 billion, some NT$7.4 billion higher than  the firms' projected earnings.    The reasons cited for the higher-than-predicted earnings  included reduced costs for power generation at Taiwan Power  Company, cheaper crude oil prices which cut costs for the  Chinese Petroleum Corp., a stabilization of the market for a  variety of products manufactured by state-owned companies, and  improved efficiency at the firms.    Nevertheless, the investment growth rate of the state-run  firms was estimated to slide to only 1.6 percent in 1993 to hit  a five- year low, compared with 9.59 percent in 1991.    The sluggishness of investment activities by government  enterprises was attributed to the established policy of  privatization, slowdown of economic recovery and in increase in  environment-related protests.</p>

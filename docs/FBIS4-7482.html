			<p>BFN     [Text] The executive leadership of the Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] met with Geza Entz, secretary of  state in the Hungarian Government and head of the Office for  Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, at the UDMR headquarters  in Cluj-Napoca this morning. From the statements made by UDMR  Executive President Csaba Takacs at the subsequent news  conference, our correspondent Teodor Mateescu notes that the  sides emphasized their similar viewpoints on the existence and  activity of Hungarian institutions and organizations beyond  Hungarian borders, aimed at preserving and asserting the  Hungarian identity in the national areas where Hungarians are in  a minority. The UDMR expressed thanks for the support of both  the Hungarian Government and Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, on  whose behalf Entz made this visit to Romania, with stopovers in  Timisoara, Alba Iulia, Targu Mures, and Cluj-Napoca, to hand  over important distinctions of the Hungarian Republic to  prominent members of the Hungarian ethnic group.    In his speech and answers to journalists' questions, Entz  pointed out that his presence in Romania these days also had an  official character, given the invitation he received from the  UDMR. He added that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was  informed of the visit through current diplomatic channels. Entz  said, among other things, that the Hungarian minority in Romania  has solidly structured organizations and institutions which are  capable of defending the interests of the community they are  representing.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections,  which are scheduled for 20 March 1994, monitored through 10  February.    Luis Zaldivar, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  [TSE], confirmed on 8 February that more than 60,000 citizens  qualified to vote in the upcoming elections will be left out due  to irregularities in the filing of applications for  identification cards. He said: "There are about 60,000 to  70,000 unapproved applications; this does not correspond to  exactly that same number of people or voters, because certain  citizens have filed more than five applications." He added these  people were left out for lacking a birth certificate because  "our country's Electoral Code states approval is granted after  verifying the information entered in an application with those  on the birth certificate." Zaldivar assured there will be no  strike, such as last year's, at the TSE, because the workers are  aware of the importance of the March elections. (San Salvador  Radio Farabundo Marti Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 8 Feb 94)    The Democratic Convergence will not be able to participate  in  the upcoming elections with deputy candidates. The TSE on 2  February rejected a request to extend the registration deadline.  The tribunal also reached a consensus agreement to "suspend the  advertisements of the Liberty and Democracy Institute aimed  against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front Party."  TSE President Zaldivar said "this tribunal decided to suspend  the political or electoral propaganda promoted by organizations  that are not political parties, because this is established  expressly by the code." He added there are certain  advertisements that violate the Electoral Code, but the TSE  cannot level fines prior to the filing of a lawsuit.

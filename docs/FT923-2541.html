			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Observer: Prescient Half an hour before the first base rate increase of the day, Pearl Assurance was yesterday biking around the City the latest results of the Pearl Investor Confidence Index - which proudly showed a rise for the first time since May. 'Tough,' says Pearl's insouciant marketing manager Martin Fox. 'It accurately mirrored people's views two weeks ago' - when the interviews were conducted. But Pearl's mistiming is as nought compared with that of Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger who, had he nothing else on his mind, might be wishing he had chosen a different title for the speech he delivered at the Institute of World Economics in Kiel on Monday. Receiving the Bernhard-Harms medal for contributions to world economic affairs, he spoke on the subject of 'Progress in the monetary integration of western Europe'.</p>

The sources said that Dr. al-Turabi made al-Mahdi "an  astounding offer" expressing willingness to meet all the Ummah  Party's demands if the latter agreed to merge with the NIF.    They added that al-Mahdi rejected the offer and told  al-Turabi that the NIF cannot escape accountability and  answerability for the harm done to the country.    Ummah Party sources contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT have  confirmed these facts and said that non-Sudanese parties with  NIF links also contacted al-Mahdi to persuade him to enter into  a dialogue that would lead to a reconciliation with the regime  but he refused to discuss the matter and submitted documents and  facts showing the magnitude of the damage inflicted on the  country over the past four years, pointing out that the NIF was  responsible for that.    The Ummah Party sources said that al-Turabi admitted that  the  internal situation had reached a dead end. They also said that  NIF officials who were members of the Sudanese Government's  delegation to the second Abuja round of negotiations offered  Garang's movement the option of merger with the NIF in one party  but that was rejected by the movement on the grounds of vast  differences between the views of the two sides. [passage  omitted]    Meanwhile, the Sudanese capital Khartoum is suffering from  an  acute fuel shortage leading to the reduction of the ration for  taxi drivers to one gallon a day. There has also been a severe  bread crisis in Khartoum for the past two weeks. Furthermore,  circles close to the government have admitted that there is also  a liquidity crisis which has delayed payment of the salaries of  the government employees and members of the armed forces.

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MIDWAY CITY;  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER TAKES ANNEXATION STEP  </P> <P> Over the objections of Midway City residents, Westminster received first rights  to annex that unincorporated area.  </P> <P> The Local Agency Formation Commission voted to place Midway City, four small  islands of territory near Beach Boulevard and Bolsa Avenue, in Westminster's  area for planning purposes.  </P> <P> "The people of Midway City do not want to be in the sphere of influence of  Westminster," said Art Horne, president of the Midway City Chamber of Commerce  and Homeowners Assn. "We don't need Westminster in Midway City."  </P> <P> Westminster has no plans to annex Midway City, City Councilwoman Joy L.  Neugebauer said. But because the area probably will be annexed someday, having  first rights to annexation will help Westminster take the area into account  when making long-range city plans.  </P> <P> Residents oppose joining Westminster because the city charges its residents a  5% utility tax, Horne said. Also, past attempts by Westminster to annex tiny  pieces of Midway City have created ill feelings, he said.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Don R. Roth, a member of the commission, voted against the  majority.  </P> <P> Midway City one day will be annexed by Westminster, Roth said. But the  commission should not force the issue while most Midway City residents strongly  oppose it, he said. TOM MCQUEENEY  </P></p>

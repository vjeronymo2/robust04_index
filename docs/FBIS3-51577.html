			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President Ramon J. Velasquez; place </F> not given; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] ...due to the recent Banco Latino intervention and  the rumors circulating throughout the country, I believe it is  my duty to deliver a message to the country on the position of  the national government. To confront the Banco Latino crisis and  its pernicious consequences to Venezuela, the government is  adopting a series of measures, joined in an overall plan, to  serve Banco Latino depositors and reestablish confidence in the  Venezuelan financial system, hit hard at this moment not only by  this bank's crisis but also by rumor campaigns that are  seriously hurting the country.    The complexity of the problem demands everyone's commitment  and participation. The program I am announcing today has the  support of the country's financial authorities and banking  system. President-elect Rafael Caldera has been consulted about  the program, and we trust he will give it the necessary  continuity during his administration. Likewise, we have informed  the political parties so the initiatives that need to be taken  will find the necessary receptivity in Congress, which will be  convened soon.    To address the situation that arose following the Banco  Latino intervention, I am close to appointing a board of  intervention comprising Julio Santodomingo, who will preside  over the board, Hernan Oyarzabal; Cesario Cadenas; and (Jose  Grazovechio). All of these people have broad banking, financial,  and legal experience, and they enjoy the respect and trust of  the financial community. This board of intervention will assume  the duties the banking law establishes.    2. [number as heard] Advisory Council. In order to support  the board of intervention and channel the support Venezuelan  banks are giving the state during this difficult situation, I am  appointing an advisory council comprising the following bank  presidents: (Edgard Dao), Banco del Caribe; Jose Maria  Nogueroles, Banco Provincial; Gustavo Marturet, Banco Mercantil;  Jose Bouza, Banco Venezuela; Herbie Benacerrat, Banco Union;  (Jose Alvarez Stelin), Banco Consolidado; Juan Santaella,  Bancor; and Jose Francisco Otero, Banco Italo. I have received  clear signals from members of the Venezuelan banking community  on the confidence all of them have in this effort and they have  delegated their representation and support to this group of  colleagues.    The Banco Latino action program will give priority to the  following:    Expediting depositors' accounts. To this end, we intend to  begin with accounts of up to 100,000 bolivares, as announced,  and continue progressively with larger accounts.    Larger accounts in individuals' names and public and  private institutions will be handled as Fogade's [Deposit  Guarantee Fund] financial support system begins to operate and  with the cooperation of banks. Negotiations for the recovery of  Banco Latino's loans will start immediately with effective  collection actions and the execution of all applicable  collaterals. External auditors will be hired as soon as possible  to determine the true situation of the institution and  subsidiaries, both locally and abroad. No later than 90 days  from now, such reports should serve to make the most appropriate  decisions.    There are several possibilities for selling Banco Latino and  subsidiary assets or business units, both within and without the  country, which foreign and domestic investors have already shown  an interest in. The intervention board will take the greatest  care in preserving the value of the Banco Latino and subsidiary  assests and extracting the largest possible profit from the sale  of assets to minimize the cost of this crisis. The auditors'  examination will include, not only the institution's accounts,  but Banco Latino's methods in granting investment loans.  Pertinent responsibilities will be determined very carefully.    4. [number as heard] To alleviate the pressure this crisis  and the pressure the wave of rumors are applying on the  financial system, the Central Bank of Venezuela board of  directors has agreed to the following measures:    a) Given this situation, loan support for the Bernay  monetary market has been activated to give banks the necessary  short-term loans.    b) The Central Bank mandatory reserve has been reduced from  15 to 12 percent. This measure releases 26 billion [currency not  specified], which will make it possible for banks to meet the  liquidity needs derived from the Banco Latino crisis and the  depositors' requirements.    c) The existing system for the Central Bank mandatory  reserve system is hereby modified. The foreign currency deposit  will be made in the same currency in which the obligation was  incurred.    d) To give Fogade financial assistance according to the law  to enable this institution to meet the needs derived from the  Banco Latino intervention and contribute to the recycling of  funds in the national banking system.    e) To grant financial assistance to banks facing liquidity  problems as a result of this irregular situation.    5. I have instructed the banking superintendant to go to the  proper authorities and request all of the pertinent civil and  penal actions against the individuals responsible for the Banco  Latino crisis.    6. I have instructed the attorney general to go to the  Supreme Court of Justice and apprise it of all the lawsuits that  are being processed to establish responsibility for the Banco  Latino case.    7. I have ordered the police to take specific actions  against individuals and commercial establishments that spread  rumors concerning the banking situation. This is a crime that  jeopardizes state security, and the full weight of the law will  be brought to bear against these people.    I am willing to admit the country's stability has been  threatened in an irresponsible manner. I urge the public not to  spread these rumors. The government and financial authorities  are taking all the necessary steps to ensure the proper  functioning of all Venezuelan banks and to protect the  depositors' interests. The best cooperation you can give is to  remain calm. Banco Latino depositors will be taken care of, and  customers of other Venezuelan banks have nothing to fear. Your  banks are capable of maintaining operations with absolute  normalcy, and for that they have the full support of the Central  Bank of Venezuela. Good night.</p>

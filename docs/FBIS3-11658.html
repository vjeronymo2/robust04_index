			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 31 December of last year, the Central Bank had  total reserves in foreign exchange amounting to $736 million,  the highest figure in history.    This reserve total showed an increase of $155 million over  the figure at the end of 1992, the public relations department  of the bank reported.    With reserves at this level, the institution will be able to  cover any unusual increase in foreign exchange, thus avoiding  the creation of distortions in the exchange rate.    It will also be able to cover the payment obligations to be  met on the basis of the plans for this year.    Concerning the sales of foreign exchange to the commercial  banks, it was reported that in the last two days of the week,  the Central Bank sold $25 million at the exchange rate of 12.50  Dominican pesos, plus the bank commission of 2 percent.    The result of this injection of dollars into the foreign  exchange market was the demonetization of 319 million pesos.    The exchange rate of 12.50 pesos becomes 12.75 with the  addition of the bank commission of 2 percent, the official rate  being multiplied by a factor of 1.02.    The volume of dollars injected into the market at the  effective exchange rate of 12.75 pesos generated the 19 million  pesos that were demonetized, the public relations department  reported.    With the participation of the Central Bank on the market  through the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, it will be  able to maintain a liquidity volume in Dominican pesos that is  sufficient for a healthy level of growth in the economy, the  report said.    It added that this will be done without affecting price  stability, the real rate of exchange, or the macroeconomic  aggregates achieved beginning in 1991.    The injections of foreign exchange into the market may serve  various purposes. One of these would be to obtain Dominican  pesos with a view to demonetization, in order to continue the  restriction of the means of payment in general and to control  the currency in circulation.    Another choice would be to inject dollars into the market  for  the purpose of keeping the exchange rate stable and avoiding a  certain increase therein.    The injection of foreign exchange has been effected by the  Central Bank at the official exchange rate, without regard to  the existing rate on the free foreignexchange market.    The bank added that in its view, the economic development of  the nation, in terms of economic growth with price and foreign  exchange stability, has been "the outstanding characteristic of  the Dominican economy."    This is how it has described the situation in its reports to  international bodies, the source added.</p>

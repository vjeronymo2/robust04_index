			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Christie speeds to gold in 100-metres England's Linford Christie salutes the crowd at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada, yesterday after taking the gold medal in the 100-metres. It was the second time he has won the title. Christie, who has proved himself the world's supreme sprinter in spite of his age of 34, was in a class of his own as he sped to a Commonwealth Games record of 9.91 seconds. Welshman Colin Jackson also retained his 110-metres hurdles title. However, England's success was marred as it emerged last night that a member of the Commonwealth Games squad tested positive for drugs at the European Championships in Helsinki earlier this month. England team manger Alan Lindop did not name the athlete, but shot-putter Paul Edwards admitted to reporters he had been told something was amiss with his Helsinki drug test. However, he denied he had taken a banned substance.</p>

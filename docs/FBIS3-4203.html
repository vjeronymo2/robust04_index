This was made clear by an official at a conference dealing  with the industry, which was just closed here in the capital of  east China's Zhejiang Province.    Zhang Heyong, deputy director of the State Pharmaceutical  Administration, said that the government's grants for research  in the development of medicines had greatly increased. More  than 400 such projects applied for approval last year, exceeding  the total in past years.    China has started to adopt the modern enterprise system in  this realm, to get away from the situation in which research  institutions can only get funds through one channel --  government allocation.    The Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Shandong Province and  China Pharmaceutical University recently set up a corporation  and a center for developing medicines, marking big progress in  the field.    China now has 53 independent research and development  institutions. But many problems still exist, such as  overlapping functions and separation of research from production.    The central government is set to speed up the industry's  readjustment, with stress on the establishment of advanced  pharmacy centers.    It has made a success in Shanghai, which ranks  pharmaceuticals among its pillar industries. The city now has  four bio-engineering centers, with three others on the drawing  board.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: A quieter style of management - Daniel Rappaport tells Laurie Morse his plans as the new head of Nymex MR DANIEL Rappaport, elec-ted two weeks ago as chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's fourth-largest futures exchange, plans to build on the ambitious expansion and cost-saving plans he has inherited from his predecessor, the five-year incumbent, Mr Lou Guttman. But he is not planning to step into Mr Guttman's larger-than-life image. After a hard campaign, disrupted by the blast at the Nymex's World Trade Center location, Mr Rappaport wants to keep a low profile in his new job. 'You will notice I have a different management style,' he says. 'I think the exchange should be run most appropriately by staff. I'm basically in charge of managing the board.' The Brooklyn native, who trained for the law but quickly took up the frenzied life of a crude oil futures trader, has been vice chairman of the Nymex for two years, and acted as chairman for four months last year when Mr Guttman took leave to address pending legal problems. As a result he is well acquainted with Nymex issues. One of the most pressing is the exchange's agreement to move into a Manhattan building owned by Shearson, the former American Express unit. Shearson's acquisition by Primerica this month requires a renegotiation of Nymex's lease, and will delay the move to late 1994, Mr Rappaport says. He intends to preserve the Dollars 70m in concessions contributed to the building deal by New York City. Primerica, he says, has its own uses for the building, and is reconfiguring Nymex space. 'We will get the same amount of space, but maybe not the proximity to the trading floor that we wanted.' The Nymex board is currently considering a bid for Comex (the New York Commodity Exchange), the metals market that the Chicago Board of Trade is negotiating to absorb. Mr Rappaport has appointed a committee to review the issue. 'I think if we were able to acquire the Comex on favourable terms, it would be good for the New York markets as a whole,' he says, noting the Chicago bid had been resented by the often-fragmented New York trading community. Like any chief executive, Mr Rappaport is also looking for new profit opportunities for his shareholders - Nymex members. While the Nymex has been hugely successful in its energy products, 'we don't want to limit ourselves to energy areas exclusively,' he says. He is considering building on the Nymex's successful platinum contract by launching markets in metals not listed on the Comex - and creating some direct competition for the London Metals Exchange. 'It is interesting that the LME has been having record volume while the Comex is faltering,' he says. The LME's biggest contracts are high-grade aluminium, copper, and zinc. Mr Rappaport's other product initiative will be a financial market that could be traded over the Nymex's electronic trading system, Access, which was developed with American Telephone and Telegraph. He is investigating creating a screen-based market for high-yield or 'junk' bonds. The Access system is slated to go on-line later this year. Nymex is under pressure to find products to list on its screens, since its contract requires the exchange to pay AT&amp;T Dollars 4m to Dollars 6m a year in fees, regardless of the volume Access trading generates.</p>

It used to seem simply impassable -- in  the political, economic, ideological, and military respects.  One side was personified by the Warsaw Pact, the other by the  North Atlantic bloc.    But times have changed. There is no longer a Soviet Union or  a Warsaw Pact. Even the former abyss has disappeared. Russia  and the Western countries have taken the path of developing  cooperation. The embodiment of this new era in international  life was the signing by Russian Federation Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev at NATO headquarters of the Partnership for Peace  program, adopted by the alliance in January this year. [passage  omitted]    It should be noted that, generally speaking, the path toward  Russia's entry into partnership relations with NATO essentially  began at the meeting that Army General Pavel Grachev, the  Russian defense minister, had in Brussels in May. Subsequently,  however, the Foreign Ministry virtually took over all the work  preparatory to the signing of the framework document and the  final protocol. Defense Ministry representatives were  effectively eliminated from this work, even though the  implementation of all the military measures within the  partnership framework will, naturally, be the responsibility of  the Russian Armed Forces.    Be that as it may, the most important thing is that the  implementation of the Partnership for Peace program as far as  Russia and NATO are concerned will be a bridge across that abyss  which divided Europe until just a few years ago.

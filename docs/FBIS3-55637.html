			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Yakov report: "No Shooting at Russian Border Guard </F> Subunits on This Occasion"]    [Text] Sundry news reports over the last few days have  repeatedly announced that the Moscow Border Guard Troops 13th  Subunit in Tajikistan had come under missile fire Saturday and  Sunday [8-9 January]. The Russian Border Guard Troops Press  Bureau refutes these reports.    There was indeed fire along the border over the weekend, as  reported by INTERFAX citing the headquarters of Russian Border  Guard Troops in Tajikistan. But for some unknown reason the  report went on to identify the 13th Subunit and even mentioned  the exact number of missiles launched against it -- five on  Saturday and seven on Sunday. Moreover, the time when they were  fired was given down to the minute.    On hearing this report on the radio, the duty operations  officers at Border Guard Troops headquarters in Moscow were  initially alarmed: Why had they not been informed of these  facts? It proved to be a false alarm. In actual fact -- and  reports to this effect had arrived at headquarters -- Tajik  opposition gunmen had fired mortars and recoilless rifles at  positions held by border guard troops from the 12th Subunit on 7  January.    On Saturday the gunmen launched five rocket-propelled  projectiles and fired two recoilless rifle rounds at the village  of Pervar. On Sunday, again using recoilless rifles, they fired  eight rounds at the village of Arvar. The fire came from the  territory of Tajikistan. Both villages are located in the zone  controlled by the 12th Border Guard Troops Subunit and the  gunmen's positions came under appropriate retaliatory fire. We  are very happy to report that there have been no casualties  among servicemen from the 12th Subunit, let alone from the 13th  Subunit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) President Yohei Kono will meet Michio Watanabe, an LDP  faction leader and former foreign minister, on Friday [15 April]  to ask him not to run for the premiership to avoid splitting the  largest opposition party, LDP sources said Thursday.    Kono will visit the faction office of Watanabe at 4 P.M.  [0700 GMT] Friday, they said.    Kono vowed Tuesday to run in a prime ministerial election in  the Diet for the successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who last Friday announced his resignation.    Watanabe is eager to be prime minister and had rejected  Kono's request for face-to-face talks.    Executive members of his faction met Wednesday and agreed to  lobby other LDP members by seeking their signatures endorsing  Watanabe as the next premier, faction sources said. Nearly 100  signatures have been collected, a senior faction executive said.    Watanabe faction executives affirmed their opinions that the  LDP president must not necessarily be the party's candidate for  prime minister, and that a government with large alliances of  ruling and opposition camps is needed to break through the  political turmoil following Hosokawa's announcement, they said.    Members of an LDP faction led by former Prime Minister  Kiichi  Miyazawa agreed Thursday to back Kono as the sole LDP candidate  for the premiership, faction sources said. Kono had belonged to  the Miyazawa faction until he became LDP president last July.    The Miyazawa faction decided to set up an election campaign  office for Kono in a Tokyo hotel in case Watanabe does not give  up his candidacy and to seek support from other parties'  members, the sources said.    In three other factions -- led respectively by former  Transport Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, former Chief Cabinet  Secretary Keizo Obuchi and former State Minister Toshio Komoto  -- members generally fear a party split-up and hope Kono and  Watanabe will peacefully resolve the candidacy issue through  talks, faction sources said.    Watanabe emerged earlier this week as a prime ministerial  candidate after a feud within the ruling coalition threatened to  split the government, weakening the chances of front-runner  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata being named Hosokawa's successor.    But on Tuesday, the coalition, which was on the verge of  collapse, moved to maintain the current framework of the  government, once again strengthening Hata's hand.    However, a senior member of Watanabe's faction said there is  still hope Watanabe will be named prime minister because the  ruling coalition parties have failed to mend wounds within the  shaky alliance and band together to support Hata.</p>

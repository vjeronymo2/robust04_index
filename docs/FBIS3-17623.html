Our correspondent, Arkadiy Romm,  speaks with former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who is  considered the most realistic candidate for the presidency.    [Romm] Leonid Danilovich, do you really plan to replace  Kravchuk?    [Kuchma] I have not decided yet; first of all I need to see  what kind of new Supreme Council we will have. If it is similar  to what we have now, it will be a useless waste of time. I  cannot find a single good word for what is presently going on in  the country. The economy has suffered a catastrophe.  Enterprises have effectively ground to a standstill. The  credit and economic system has completely collapsed. The  country is ungovernable: there is no state as such. If we are  to come out of the crisis, tight measures are inevitable. The  president must enjoy the overwhelming support of the population.    [Romm] What is your assessment of the president's decision  not to contest the early elections?    [Kuchma] The best thing for Leonid Makarovich is to resign  voluntarily. But will he go? The Kiev authorities do not want  the presidential elections to take place along with elections  for the Supreme Council.    [Romm] "Independence" has become as popular a buzzword in  Ukraine as it is painful. What does it mean for you, Leonid  Danilovich?    [Kuchma] As early as last spring I said that we would not be  able to withstand world prices for energy resources. I proposed  a number of options. One of them involved the Black Sea Fleet.  I am certain that if we had been given it lock, stock, and  barrel, we would have returned it ourselves in a week, because  we would have been unable to support it. Now developments in  Crimea are unfolding in such a way that we may be left without  it altogether. We should have leased the naval armada to Russia  together with the bases. What we need is a border fleet --  Ukraine does not have geopolitical interests in the world ocean.    [Romm] What do you, as former chief of a missile-making  powerhouse, think about a nuclear-free Ukraine?    [Kuchma] Stepping the missiles down from alert status is a  technically difficult and very costly process. According to  U.S. experts' estimates, this would cost Ukraine $3 billion.  But I do not want specialists to come here to transport the  nuclear warheads to Russia, and that is all. This is why I  opposed the reduction of nuclear arms and the accession to the  Nonproliferation Treaty at the closed Supreme Council meeting  last May. Believe me, in general very few people in the world  knew about a state called Ukraine. The United States' joining  our disarmament effort has been caused by the fact that the  parliament made the right decision. There had already been a  precedent: When we had tactical weapons withdrawn voluntarily,  we did not receive any political or economic dividends, although  we had been promised: Just do it and we will start helping you.    All our 130 liquid-propellant missiles have had their  guarantee terms expire. As for liquid fuel, God forbid, I would  tell you! For instance, we do not have technologies to process  and to dispose of gertin, a kind of such fuel. Or try to  neutralize a solid fuel missile. There is no such technology in  the world yet. The entire range of disarmament problems should  be resolved comprehensively.    As for the signing of the trilateral treaty between Ukraine,  Russia, and the United States, I have supported it. I think  that in the long run Ukraine should be nuclear-free. [passage  omitted]</p>

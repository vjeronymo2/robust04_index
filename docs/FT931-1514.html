			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Czech banks are warned to reduce interest rates MR Vladimir Dlouhi, Czech trade and industry minister, has warned banks they must cut interest rates and be more active in helping restructure the Czech economy. 'The banks' policies do not meet the needs of our economy. Interest rates are too high for most enterprises. The banks must take at least part of the risk (of restructuring) which we take,' Mr Dlouhi was quoted as saying at a meeting in Znojmo, southern Moravia. According to Czech news agency reports, he said the government was preparing for 'serious negotiations' with the banks, and wanted to stress the need to stimulate business. Interest rates for borrowing are running at 16-18 per cent. Mr Dlouhi said the government intended cutting high taxes and health insurance for companies. Earlier, Mr Josef Tosovsky, central bank governor, warned banks they faced big losses if businesses failed.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Davy payout hopes fade TRAFALGAR HOUSE has expressed further pessimism over the chances of former Davy shareholders receiving the remaining Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, due under Trafalgar's successful takeover of Davy. In a letter to former shareholders it said no progress had been made by Midland and Scottish Resources on completing the purchase from Davy of the Emerald Producer offshore rig. Payment to shareholders is conditional on the sale. Even if MSR wins from its bankers an extension of expired letters of credit, MSR is 'most unlikely' to obtain a Section 10 ship certificate from the Department of Trade necessary to complete permanent finance of the rig, Trafalgar said.</p>

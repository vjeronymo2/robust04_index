			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y likely to announce write-downs of Dollars 2bn OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the Canadian-based parent of the O&amp;Y group, is preparing to announce at least USDollars 2bn of write-downs on its global property holdings, according to a US executive familiar with the company's financial position. The disclosure, which would help to illustrate the weakened financial position of O&amp;Y, will be contained in a filing to be made shortly with a Toronto bankruptcy court. Along with the write-down will be O&amp;Y's disclosure of its total group assets on a consolidated basis. The write-downs, which are likely to include the Canary Wharf project in London, could be as high as Dollars 2.5bn or even more, the US executive warned. He added that O&amp;Y and its financial advisers were still working on the numbers last night. The write-down disclosure, expected before the end of this week, will refer to O&amp;Y's position at the end of its fiscal year to January 31 1992. It is part of the most comprehensive financial portrait to date to be provided by the Reichmann family's troubled group. In a related development, a set of preliminary results for O&amp;Y's US subsidiary in the fiscal year ended last January showed a loss of Dollars 184.3m, up from a net loss of Dollars 147.1m the previous year. The US figures, which might still be revised, were contained in a draft financial statement supplied recently by O&amp;Y to the two Canadian creditor committees, according to a source with knowledge of the draft report. The US financial statement showed a negative cash-flow of Dollars 42.3m for the year ended January 31 1990. For the year ended January 31 1992, the cash flow was a positive Dollars 23.3m. The expected O&amp;Y property write-downs, while not likely to affect the group's debt restructuring talks in Canada, the US or Britain, show the degree to which the Reichmann empire has been hurt by the slump in commercial property values. In April, O&amp;Y said its net equity - assets minus liabilities - amounted to CDollars 5.5bn (USDollars 4.6bn) on what it termed a fair market basis. This figure, however, would have little meaning if the group were forced to liquidate rapidly substantial portions of its property holdings. O&amp;Y filed for protection from creditors under Canadian bankruptcy law in mid-May. On May 27, O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf project in London was placed under the control of UK administrators. The Reichmanns have been seeking to avert the need for a filing under US bankruptcy law by putting several US properties on the auction block.</p>

Repair of the leak shall be completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the leak is detected. If repair of the leak cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed within the 15-day period, except as provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section, then the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator shall not add hazardous waste to the tank, surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment, or container on which the cover is installed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the repair of the leak is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Repair of a leak detected on a cover installed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a tank or surface impoundment may be delayed beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both of the following conditions occur:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Repair of the leak requires first emptying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents of the tank or surface impoundment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Temporary removal of the tank or surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment from service will result in the unscheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cessation of production from the process unit or operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the waste management unit that is generating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste managed in the tank or surface impoundment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Repair of a leak determined by the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator to meet the conditions specified in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)(7)(ii) of this section shall be performed at the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time the process, system, or waste management unit that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generating the hazardous waste managed in the tank or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface impoundment stops operation for any reason.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;265.1090  <!-- PJG

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 3. The Polish Foreign Minister, Mr.  Andrzej Olechowski, conveyed during his meeting with the  Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Dinesh Singh, that the  Pakistani resolution at the United Nations Human Rights  Commission, now in session in Geneva, "did not enjoy his  government's support."    Mr. Olechowski further said that Poland attached great  emphasis on its relations with India in the context of India's  international position and status.    The two Foreign Ministers discussed the ongoing reforms in  the UN system where Mr. Dinesh Singh emphasised the need for  strengthening the UN through greater democratisation and  economic cooperation among member nations.    Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed his Polish counterpart on  Pakistan's  attempts to internationalise the Kashmir issue in the guise of  human rights. In this context Mr. Dinesh Singh referred to  Pakistan's own "abysmal" human rights record. He further pointed  out that the political process in that State could easily begin  if Pakistan stopped abetting terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.    India and Poland called for "fresh and innovative  approaches"  to develop strong and multi-dimensional cooperation in various  area, particularly the economic and industrial sectors and in  setting up joint ventures in science and technology and  agriculture fields.    "There are conducive conditions, to expand cooperation in  promoting joint economic ventures in a wide range of areas from  mining and industrial machinery to chemical and metal products,"  the President, Mr. S.D. Sharma said at a banquet hosted by him  in honour of the visiting Polish President, Mr. Lech Walesa here  on Thursday night.    Dr. Sharma said the changes which have taken place in both  countries needed fresh approach and it was gratifying to note  that the Joint Business Council was bringing the entrepreneurs  of "our countries together." Mr. Walesa, who was accorded a  ceremonial welcome in the morning, on his arrival on a six-day  State visit held talks with the President on various bilateral  matters and issue of mutual interest.    Mr. Walesa said his country attached great importance to his  talks with the Indian leaders as the world was looking for new  solutions following the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.    Dr. Sharma said the dramatic developments that had occurred  in Poland in the last decade were an important catalyst in  changing not only the face of Europe, but in ending the cold war  and thus, transforming international relations.    He also lauded Mr. Walesa's contribution in the Polish  revolution.    The President said that India was fully committed to the  democratic way of life. "It is only natural that the  extraordinary changes which have taken place in Poland should  strengthen and add new bonds of friendship between our two  countries based on shared values and beliefs," he said.    "We look forward to the further development of friendly and  mutually beneficial cooperation in the varied spheres of our  interaction," Dr. Sharma further added.    He hoped that Mr. Walesa's visit would give fresh impetus to  the close and abiding ties between India and Poland.    He said India greatly admired the Polish contribution to  human knowledge and achievements." We also value greatly the  tradition of Indological studies in Poland," he said. [sentence  as published]    Mr. Walesa in his speech said that Poland attached great  importance to its contacts and cooperation with India.    "Our cooperation will bring benefit to our people and will  strengthen the implementation of the economic reforms in both  countries."</p>

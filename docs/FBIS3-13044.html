			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO president Yasir 'Arafat by Christophe </F> Boltanski, Marc Kravetz, Patrick Sabatier; place and date not  given: "The Peace Process Following the Hebron Massacre"--  interview copyrighted by LIBERATION/World Media]    [LE SOIR] The UN Security Council is at present debating  the problems caused by the Hebron massacre. What do you expect  from them?    ['Arafat] First of all, I regret to say that the armed  settler who carried out this horrible massacre was supported and  shielded by Israeli Army units. We can prove our claims and I  spoke quite frankly about this to Rabin when he telephoned me.  First, we expect the Security Council to take specific measures  to guarantee the safety of our people in the Occupied  Territories. This has happened before: The massacre of  Rishon-le-Zion [as published] or at the Esplanade of Mosques (in  Jerusalem). Over the last five days we have also witnessed  another massacre, throughout the occupied territories, from  Bethlehem to Gaza, including Nablus and Jenin, leaving 21 dead  and 240 wounded. In Hebron, the total dead is 65 plus 265  injured. This killing cannot have been the work of one  individual. The army is fully implicated in this conspiracy.  Perhaps not all the army, but at least the Hebron units. How  could an armed settler have accompanied a military patrol under  curfew and then attacked a mosque? We therefore need  international protection. That is why we called for a meeting  of the Security Council and the disarming of the settlers.    [LE SOIR] What kind of protection are you expecting from the  United Nations?    ['Arafat] It appears we are facing the same kind of problem  as in Algeria, before independence. These settlers, supported  by elements within the army, are a new Secret Army Organization  [OAS]. We must therefore restore confidence to our people who  have lost all faith in the peace process. The events in Hebron  have had an impact throughout the region.  <H5>  Restoring Confidence To Our People </H5>   [LE SOIR] In exactly what way is the Israeli Army  responsible?    ['Arafat] This mosque has been surrounded by the army since  the occupation of the West Bank in 1967. The Israelis have  confiscated part of the site which they have converted into a  synagogue. They control all the entrances, all the approaches.  I am entitled to ask how this gang of 10 or 12 men, well armed,  entered this mosque during dawn prayers, during the month of  Ramadan, and in the presence of Israeli soldiers. How? Some of  our people were gunned down outside the mosque, while trying to  flee, by soldiers on guard duty. I spoke with our people for  half an hour at the Hebron Ahli hospital to find out what had  happened. I was able to speak to a worshipper who accompanied  one of the wounded. During our telephone conversation one  person cried: Abu 'Ammar, they are attacking us. I heard the  shots myself. I described this incident in detail to Mr. Rabin  when he contacted me to offer his condolences.    [LE SOIR] What did he say?    ['Arafat] He said it was just a lone gunman. I replied that  this was not true and I gave him all the information. He said  he would investigate, but that I was making a mountain out of a  molehill.    [LE SOIR] Do you believe the Israeli Government is  implicated  in the mosque attack?    ['Arafat] No, I only accuse certain units within the Israeli  Army. But the government must assume its responsibilities. Who  supplied these settlers with arms? How is it they have been  able to participate in joint army patrols? The forces of  occupation bear full responsibility.    [LE SOIR] What form should this international protection  take? Observers?    ['Arafat] No, we favor, as does France, the dispatch of a  multinational force, as the Israelis do not want the United  Nations.    [LE SOIR] Would this force consist of soldiers or civilians?    ['Arafat] Civilians? To do what? They cannot oppose armed  men. In Angola they are not civilians, and nor are they  civilians in Yugoslavia, Cambodia or southern Lebanon. Why  should the Palestinians be treated differently?    [LE SOIR] Do you think you will get satisfaction from the UN  Security Council?    ['Arafat] We will do everything in our power to ensure the  protection of our people. Those who delay the adoption of these  measures or who oppose them will bear the responsibility.    [LE SOIR] You have dispatched emissaries to many different  destinations.    ['Arafat] Nabil Sha'th has gone to Cairo, Abu Lutf (real  name  Faruq Qaddumi) has gone to Damascus and Amman. I was in Algeria  on Monday. We have sent other emissaries to Morocco. I  telephoned King Fahd on Monday evening. We are remaining in  constant contact with all the Arab countries. I have called for  an emergency meeting of the Jerusalem committee under the aegis  of King Hassan II of Morocco, of the presidential office of the  Islamic Conference Organization, and of the movement of the  nonaligned countries, the committee of nine is meeting today at  the United Nations. I have also just met with a special envoy  from Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Greek foreign  minister representing the European Union.   <H5>    We Need Time </H5>   [LE SOIR] Would a Security Council resolution protecting the  population allow the peace talks to resume?    ['Arafat] I have also mentioned the disarming of Israeli  settlers. By the terms of the accord we concluded, internal  security will be guaranteed by us or, in those places where it  is present, by the Israeli Army. There will be no other  authority. Today, we are in the presence of a third force: The  settlers. Who could accept that! And I tell you that all the  Arabs support us. The Lebanese, the Syrians, and the Jordanians  have also suspended the negotiations.    [LE SOIR] Has the Hebron massacre changed the nature of the  peace process?    ['Arafat] It has totally changed the climate, but not the  basis of this process. We were on the verge of peace. But  instead of that we have witnessed a massacre. And the Israeli  Army, rather than trying to restore calm, has aggravated the  situation by claiming another 21 victims.    [LE SOIR] Do you have any other specific demands regarding  this settlers?    ['Arafat] Rabin himself has spoken of this fanatical group,  Kakh. Do you know that it has its own settlement? Are these  men going to be allowed to train, with their weapons, in this  settlement and commit their crimes? It was not me, but Rabin  who was the first to speak of these political settlements run by  these organizations.    [LE SOIR] So you want them to be dismantled?    ['Arafat] In one way or another, yes. These settlements,  these fanatical groups, these settlers are time bombs waiting to  go off. We are not asking for the moon. But we neither want to  kill peace nor be killed by it.    [LE SOIR] You have accepted Bill Clinton's invitation to  continue negotiations in Washington. At least in principle.  Has he offered you guarantees?    ['Arafat] First of all, we appreciate this initiative. We  applaud the speed of the American response. But we need time.  Especially given the present anger in the occupied territories.  The peace process has lost its credibility. We need concrete  actions in order to reassure our people that they can obtain  something different from the negotiations than massacres and  more oppression.    [LE SOIR] In present circumstances, can the framework of the  Israeli-Palestinian agreement be upheld?    ['Arafat] Since we signed this accord, the Israelis have  never stopped their intrigues and procrastination. This text  was due to be implemented on 13 December. That is more than 80  days ago. And still no result. Rabin assured me that there  would be no more than a 10-day delay. Who is to blame? The  prime minister repeats that there is no sacred date. On the  subject of an international presence, the Israelis reply that  there is no sacred demand. One day they will tell us that there  is no sacred accord. And now there has been this massacre. A  horrible massacre in a sacred place, in the middle of Ramadan.  Can you imagine the impact that it can have on Muslims?  <H5>  The Ball Is in the Israeli Court </H5>   [LE SOIR] Will the timetable be respected?    ['Arafat] (angrily) You must ask them that question. We have  spent months discussing the security of the settlers! And now  we discover that it is the settlers who are the criminals. They  are protecting criminals!    [LE SOIR] Have you also asked for security measures for the  Palestinians?    ['Arafat] (silence) Yes. They were even bargaining on the  number of police. Should it be 5,000 or 6,000 ... It is  becoming clear today that it is our people who need protection.  Not the armed settlers. Some Israeli ministers have also  called for the dismantling of the Kirjath-Arba [as published]  settlement. I am not the only one.    [LE SOIR] Has your opinion of Rabin changed following the  Hebron massacre?    ['Arafat] I will wait to see what he actually does before I  answer that question. I am a pragmatic man. It is not personal  feelings which concern me, but the facts. Our people are  appealing to us today. How can we guarantee their security?    [LE SOIR] If Bill Clinton personally invites you to  Washington, will you accept?    ['Arafat] Nobody can refuse President Clinton. If he invites  me, I will pay him a visit. But I am not going to pose for the  cameras again. The Americans give the Israelis everything they  want. Since we signed the agreement, they have provided money,  the best computers, planes, loan guarantees. They have opened  doors for them in Africa, in Asia, everywhere. When we ask for  what is owing to us, the United States tells us to be patient  and to wait until a final agreement is signed. The Greek  Government is the only one to have offered us anything.    [LE SOIR] So what do you hope to get from the United States?    ['Arafat] I repeat, let us wait and see. The peace process  is vital for everybody, not just for us.    [LE SOIR] In September, you proposed a courageous peace. Can  this wish still come true?    ['Arafat] The ball is in the Israeli court. Do the Israelis  have a de Gaulle, or even a de Klerk? De Gaulle wiped out the  OAS. It takes two to tango.</p>

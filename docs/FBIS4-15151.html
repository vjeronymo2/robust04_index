			<p>BFN     [Text] Emergency rule should not be imposed in Ukraine  unless this is done to prevent bloodshed, Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk told the press club of market reforms in Kiev  Wednesday.    Answering an INTERFAX-Ukraine question about the Crimean  situation, Kravchuk said that "flexible policy should be used in  Crimea. We could regard Crimea as an economic experiment  provided that the economic autonomy of Crimea was brought into  line with the Ukrainian legislation."    Kravchuk said that "thus far, the Crimean president has not  issued a single economic decree. Moving the hands on the clock  will not make the economy work for reforms." (INTERFAX Note:  The Crimea switched to Moscow time as of March 27).    In Kravchuk's view, "the Crimean president flagrantly  violates the legislation of both Crimea and Ukraine. Meshkov  believes that there is nobody between himself, the people and  God. This policy is dangerous and I am waiting for it to come  to an end."    In Kravchuk's view, Meshkov's entourage "continuously  provokes the Crimean president against Ukraine."    Kravchuk was confident that experience will show the lie in  the speculations that Kiev obstructed progress in Crimea.    The president emphasized that regions should enjoy the  largest possible economic latitude. He did not rule out the  possibility that political institutions might result from an  economic experiment in the four Donets-Dnieper regions.    Kravchuk thought, however, that "full-fledged  federalization"  would be premature because it would threaten the unity of the  state.    He said that hopes for a fast solution to all problems was  the biggest folly since independence.    Kravchuk thought that there was "no Zvyagilsky government as  such because it was the government inherited from Prime Minister  Leonid Kuchma. I am not ashamed of this government because it  has just started specific economic reforms such as privatization  and monetary reform."    Kravchuk thought that the monetary reform was dependent on  the availability of a currency stabilization fund and on the  help of the International Monetary Fund.    He thought that foreign countries could have provided more  aid to Ukraine.</p>

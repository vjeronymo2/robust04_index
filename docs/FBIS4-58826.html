			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified "military source" at the Defense </F> Ministry and General Staff Command; date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] With God's help and the resolve of men dedicated  and faithful to the homeland and its unity and its democratic  option, and thanks to the rallying of the masses of our people  behind our valiant Armed Forces and security forces all over the  homeland, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces have continued  to achieve victories, to besiege the elements of apostasy and  secession, to inflict successive defeats on them, and to force  them to surrender and to heed the people's will, their  Constitutional institutions, and their national options of  unity, democracy, and advancement.    Units of our valiant Armed Forces of the 8th Brigade of the  Special Forces, the 56th Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades  have managed, thanks to God's grace and massive support from our  masses in the Governorates of al-Bayda' and Abyan, to topple the  last defensive fortifications in the region [word indistinct]  and move across Mukayris in the direction of Abyan, where, at  0230 yesterday [2330 GMT on 5 May], they joined the forces of  the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan Governorate. Thus, these  forces have reassembled and formed, together, a striking force  in the hands of unity and constitutional legitimacy to inflict  defeat on the forces of apostasy which have deviated from the  popular will and consensus. At the same time, the heroes of the  al-'Amaliqah forces continued to present valiant resistance to  the ferocious, aggressive attack by the forces of treachery and  treason. The al-'Amaliqah forces fought fierce battles and  confronted an intensive sea and air offensive. During these  battles, they destroyed four tanks and four armored cars and  shot down four of the attacking aircraft of the forces of  secession.    Large numbers of the attacking forces have surrendered and  declared their defection to the al-'Amaliqah forces and their  support for unity and constitutional legitimacy against  secession. At the same time, the heroes of the 2d Armored  Division in al-Rahah have waged violent, heroic, and fierce  battles against the aggressor forces, which were dispatched by  the elements of apostasy and secession from the al-'Anad and the  'Abbud and al-Buzah Brigades, and forced them to retreat after  they beat back numerous attacks and valiantly confronted the  attacks by the enemy aircraft affiliated with the elements of  apostasy, which have been carrying out extensive sorties to  attack the heroes of the 2d Armored Brigade since the day before  yesterday. Our heroes of the air defense forces downed three of  the attacking enemy aircraft.    In another development, the al-Hamzah Camp Forces and the 3d  Infantry Brigade are continuing their steady advancement to  achieve their objectives and to pursue the rebelling  secessionist elements and forces. In a cowardly and treacherous  action, which reveals the extent of the hidden rancor and  plotting, exposes the true nature of the evil and wicked  intentions against the freedom and security and safety of the  people, and which clearly shows the truth of that uncivilized  project that developed in the minds of that criminal gang as a  bloody project for killing, terror, sabotage, destruction, and  enmity toward the homeland and people and their achievements,  the leaders of the separatist, criminal gang, led by war  criminal al-Bid and one of his traitorous henchmen, Haytham  Qasim Tahir, carried out a cowardly missile raid on the valiant  capital city of Sanaa, the capital of the unity state and the  symbol of steadfastness and victory, targeting innocent  citizens, civilians targets, and vital installations in it.  However, God's will was lying in wait for their rancor and  wickedness. Their treacherous missiles did not succeed, and  some of them sustained damage in the air.    At 1345 [1045 GMT], the forces of treachery and treason  indiscriminately fired five Scud missiles against the  inhabitants of Sanaa and civilian installations in the city.  Two of them landed but did not explode. The three others  exploded. No significant damage occurred, except for spreading  panic among children, the elderly, and women who were asleep at  the time of the treacherous and cowardly attack.    The forces of rancor and rebellion also carried out similar  missile raids on the valiant city of Ta'izz. However, these  missiles failed to achieve their objectives, except for further  frightening the peaceful residents of the city, which they  deceitfully wanted to be the venue for signing the accord  document. God has willed that this treacherous aggression be  repulsed and the criminal killers be defeated after their true  nature was exposed to the people and the world, and after the  masks were removed from their ugly faces, which deceived no one  other than their hateful persons and deluded loyalists.    As part of their hostile schemes and objective of escalating  the comprehensive war and spreading sedition in the homeland,  those forces launched air raids on the headquarters of security  and the al-Mashari' camp area in the city of 'Ataq in Shabwah  Governorate, targeting the lives of heroic security men in  Shabwah and the lives of our innocent citizens, who confronted  the forces of apostasy, secession, and repression with  unparalleled valiance, forcing them to retreat.    The source added that the secessionist, rebellious forces of  oppression and aggression will never escape just and urgent  punishment as a result of all that has taken place, the  bloodshed that they have caused, and their looting of public  funds. They are marching down the road to suicide after they  squandered the people's funds to purchase arms in order to  maliciously kill the people, their children, and the personnel  of their Armed and Security Forces. They want to destroy all  the political, developmental, and democratic achievements that  have been realized in the homeland throughout the march of the  Yemeni 26 September and 14 October revolutions. At the same  time, they pushed our people and their Armed Forces into the  incinerator of death and destruction in a suicidal losing  battle, during which they had their share of defeat, shame, and  disgrace.    These criminals and slaughterers are pushing deceived,  innocent people into the remaining military units to kill them  and shed their blood in the battlefield against their brothers  and comrades-in-arms without a clear objective or honorable  purpose. Rather, the sole objective of that criminal,  secessionist, oppressive gang is to enjoy peace, leisure, and  safety after they evacuated their families and relatives abroad,  looted public funds, sold the people's public facilities,  collected huge amounts of money and put them in secret accounts  in foreign banks. As for the down-trodden Yemeni people who are  suffering from the crisis they have fabricated, whether in Aden,  Ta'izz, Lahij, Hadhramaut, Sanaa, Abyan, Sa'dah, Shabwah, al-  Hudaydah, al-Maharah, and elsewhere, their share has been death  and destruction.    The source refuted the false allegations being reiterated by  their trumpets. The source explained that what is being  broadcast about the military situation calls for ridicule and  disdain. In addition, it is meant to deceive foreign public  opinion. As for the Yemenis, they are being kept abreast of all  the facts. These allegations reflect the state of defeat,  weakness, and the blind confusion within the gang of rebellion  and crime as it prepares for packing up to flee abroad.    The source said it is ridiculous for this gang and its  sources to continue to talk about missiles from their aircraft  hitting the Presidential Palace when they know these are false  claims, that citizens in these and other cities know this, and  that those whom it is trying to convince outside the country do  not believe it. The best proof of this is that it has continued  to talk, until yesterday, about the steadfastness and fighting  of the Ba Suhayb Forces in Dhamar, when the fighting with these  troops was settled last Wednesday [4 May], less than three hours  after they had ignited the fire of war at the behest of that  secessionist gang, led by war criminal al-Bid and his  secessionist clique.    Those troops surrendered to the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy. In addition, the commander of the Ba  Suhayb Camp, Colonel Thabit Muthanna Dawwas, half brother of war  criminal Haytham Qasim Tahir, was captured two days ago by the  forces of unity and legitimacy. He is being interrogated now,  after igniting fighting and then leaving the personnel of his  camp to confront the fire of battle and death. He fled less  than one hour after he issued orders. We do not know what else  the source can claim or brag about when it watched, along with  the whole world, Colonel Dawwas on television yesterday,  explaining the truth, speaking about the defeat inflicted on his  troops and the catastrophe he caused.    As for talking about the steps taken by those units, which  are under the control of the secessionist gang, it is a  laughable matter that insults the people's intelligence and does  not merit a reply because its falseness will be exposed by stark  facts. Many facts will expose the delusion and deception  practiced by the propaganda machine of the criminal secessionist  gang, so our people and foreign public opinion will know how low  this gang sinks in it lies. These elements think they are smart  enough to fool people. But lies will eventually be exposed and  stark facts will continue to refute falsehood and delusion. Our  people realize this is a lying, criminal, and evil gang. It  sustains defeats daily, because, by its arrogant false pride, it  wanted to stand against the people's will, which springs from  God's will. If God helps you, none can overcome you.

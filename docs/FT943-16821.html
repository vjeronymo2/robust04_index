			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Contest revealed Labour's dark side:  A result that tells us a lot about the parties in Scotland and the politics of sectarianism Labour's narrow victory in the Monklands East by-election was the party's first stumble after its recent succession of excellent poll results. Labour may have powered ahead in the local and European elections and a string of by-elections. But in Monklands East it came within 1,640 votes of losing one of its safest Scottish seats - poignantly, one that had been held by its former leader, John Smith. The bitter contest revealed the darker side of Labour's municipal politics in Scotland. It also produced infighting between neighbouring Labour MPs which, coming just before polling day, could have had a catastrophic effect. The campaign brought to the surface in a disturbing way the latent divide between Protestants and Catholics in the west of Scotland. The Scottish National party said yesterday that the recent surge in its vote  -which brought it success in the regional elections in Scotland and gained it a second seat in the European parliament - was still running strongly, even though the party fell short of overtaking Labour. But Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, insisted that Monklands East had been an 'atypical by-election' because it was dominated by one issue: Monklandsgate - the allegation that Labour-run Monklands District Council discriminates against the Protestant town of Airdrie, which is at the centre of Monklands East constituency, in favour of the neighbouring Catholic town of Coatbridge. At the same time, the attempt by Mr Tom Clarke, the Labour MP for Monklands West, to deny the allegations appears to have backfired, raising questions about his long-term future in the shadow cabinet, where his portfolio is overseas development. Mrs Helen Liddell, the new Labour MP, has pledged to sort out the long-standing problem in her new constituency. But the unusual and bitter circumstances at Monklands do not hide the fact that the SNP may yet pose a bigger threat to Labour. Some Labour officials are concerned by this. They fear that the Scottish party organisation is weaker than in other parts of the country, and that it has become too complacent following the decline in the Scots Tory vote. But Mr John Curtice of Strathclyde University says Labour has cause to be reasonably pleased with the Monklands result. Its share of the vote fell by 11 per cent - not far out of line with its performance in other by-elections where it was the sitting party. He said: 'Labour is not making the progress in Scotland it is achieving south of the border. But its vote did not fall nearly as much as it might have done. And now that Mrs Liddell has the backing of George Robertson over the Monklandsgate issue it should be possible to improve the situation with the council before the next general election.' The SNP is likely to be disappointed with its performance. Before the by-election it said that on the basis of its strong performance in the regional elections it had secured 42.3 per cent of the vote in the constituency, compared with Labour's 50.1 per cent. It therefore had only an 8 per cent gap to make up. On polling day it gained 45 per cent of the vote against Labour's 49.75 per cent. As Mr Stephen Gallagher, the Liberal Democrat candidate - who lost his deposit - pointed out yesterday, the SNP was shooting at a barn door because of Monklandsgate, but failed to hit it. There are indications, too, that the SNP took much of its vote not from Labour but from the Conservatives, whose candidate Mrs Susan Bell won only 799 votes, giving her the lowest share of the vote (2.3 per cent) of any Tory by-election candidate in Britain since the war. The by-election reinforces the immense difficulty the party faces in winning parliamentary seats from Labour in west/central Scotland. Labour's vote is too tightly concentrated in its key seats while the SNP's is well distributed across Scotland. At the same time Labour's strong performance in UK opinion polls - if it is maintained - can only undermine the SNP's attraction to voters. The prospect of a Labour victory will undermine the SNP's argument that Scotland has too little power at Westminster. One Labour politician said yesterday: 'What we can offer the Scottish people at the next election is a chance to change that outlook at Westminster.' The sectarian issue has resurfaced - but will not necessarily spread because of the dangers to all parties of playing that card. The more the SNP appeared to align itself with the Protestants in Monklands East, the more it alienated the Catholics in the constituency and elsewhere in the west of Scotland. The party which most obviously played the Orange card was the Tory party - and it came fourth.</p>

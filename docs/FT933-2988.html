			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Taurus successor riles fund managers THE Institutional Fund Managers' Association has complained that a committee set up to consider a successor to the failed Taurus settlements system mainly consists of those with a potential commercial interest in the project. The trade body for UK fund managers has told the Bank of England that the Crest committee - established by the Bank - contains only one institutional investor, representing the largest group which will ultimately use the system. Most of the other members are representatives of custodial banks or registrar banks - whom the Bank had said would play a secondary role in deciding the specifications for the new system. After the collapse of Taurus - which aimed to introduce paperless trading in the City of London and narrow the settlement period to three days from two weeks - City commentators said the Stock Exchange had tried too hard to satisfy the demands of the different service providers such as custodians and registrars, and the project became far too complex and expensive. The Bank of England said it would establish Crest as a successor system and the needs of end-users, such as institutions, would be paramount. In August IFMA wrote to Mr Pen Kent, associate director at the Bank, to express concern about the committee's structure. In reply Mr Kent offered to let the group meet Mr Iain Saville, the Bank's project controller for Crest. One IFMA member said: 'We are concerned about the lack of consultations about business specifications.' In particular, the fund managers are concerned about the recommendation that each Crest participant be allocated a single account. Another IFMA member said: 'That means that our clients who want their securities designated in their own names cannot have that.' About 85 per cent of UK pension funds insist that securities be held in their own name, not in the name of the fund manager's nominee company. Also, the institutions, which own 80 per cent of the shares traded in London, are concerned about being held hostage to price increases if a commercial vendor won a franchise to exclusively provide a portion of the settlement service. A fund manager said: 'They say they are concerned about the needs of end users. But what they really want is a convenient system devised by the service providers and we will have to fit into that.' Among the members are Mr Brian Finnegan, head of settlement operations at the London Stock Exchange - which, Mr Kent has suggested, may have little role to play in securities settlement after Crest. Also on the panel is Mr Ralph Walrond, chief registrar at Lloyds Bank Registrars. Other members include Mr Terry Pearson, senior securities adviser at Royal Bank of Scotland Securities Services, the largest independent custodian for UK pension funds, Mr Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays Bank and Mr Geoff Newman, vice president at Chase Manhattan.</p>

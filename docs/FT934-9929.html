			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (9): An attack on paperwork - Document management and business process re-engineering PAPER is a curse. At the best of times, information goes missing when it's most needed. For a financial institution processing thousands of credit card repayments or registering mortgage applications, paper is the link with its customers. These customers want to know the progress of their case, and that can only be established by locating the paperwork in question. So why not take the whole bureaucracy and store and process it electronically? Customer queries can answered instantly by calling up a screen. The technology in question is document image processing (DIP), also known as document management. Systems differ in terms of software and precise functions, but the basic technology relies on optical disks compressing and storing data. The visual image is scanned by a device that resembles a photo-copier. Essentially a serious relative of the compact disc, the optical disks are arranged in a jukebox. A 64-disk jukebox can hold up to 3.2m pages of information. A powerful desktop PC gives every member of staff the power to call up images in under 10 seconds. Abolishing paperwork through DIP has meant getting a response to the customer in less time while also cutting back on staff. But the current wave of installations have fallen in with the far grander fashion of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR). The latest in a succession of management buzzwords to spring out of an information technology industry keen to promote the concept that technology is indispensable, BPR is now intertwined with DIP. The argument runs that DIP follows a document throughout the business. So implementing a technology that cuts a swath through bureaucracy should invite a fundamental rethink of the entire organisation and its structure. The alliance of BPR and DIP has the partial blessing of Dr David Best, partner in information management at Touche Ross. But Dr Best notes that the challenge of BPR has actually hindered technical progress - 'document image processing is not as widespread as it could be, because people find it difficult to redesign their processes.' Unisys provides DIP in the form of InfoImage beginning at Pounds 75,000. High-end price tags are in the multi-million pound bracket. DIP is not a casual commitment. At Clerical Medical Investment Group, documents have been been consigned to microfiche since the 1980s. Now a Pounds 500,000 project in the annuities department has pointed the way to a wider application of optical scanning and storage. Ken Hawkes, manager of the annuities department, finds the new technology has made a difference to his telephone manner - 'people call in and say they wrote to us in January and I can say 'Yes - I've got the letter in front of me.'' Pam Webb, information systems business development manager, agrees that DIP improves customer service. But she is restrained about leaping on the BPR bandwagon - 'the image-processing hardware and software amount to just one of the tools we will use. They are very powerful, but they're not the driver. That has to come from the business itself.' Pressed on the motive for the Unisys contract, she notes: 'If I believe in re-engineering, it's with a small r' Mark Churchward, manager of Olivetti's document management division, sells Filenet. Billed as an image management and workflow system, Filenet has grown over the years to include features such as handwriting recognition. The expansion of its technical brief has been accompanied by the rise of BPR, a vogue term unheard of when DIP products first emerged. Filenet systems begin at Pounds 50,000 and stretch into the millions depending on size. To his credit, Mr Churchward is quick to offer a no-nonsense definition of the phrase on every consultant's lips: 'BPR means taking a clean-sheet approach to looking at what the business activity should be.' And realistically, he concedes that BPR does not mean a blank cheque for technology - 'it means looking at the legacy of the past and deciding what processes really add value, as opposed to automating everything. 'So DIP has become the jumping off point for more fundamental changes - the only way to use the technology to eliminate paper is to analyse the processes. There isn't one right way to do things. It's different for every business,' he says. Mr Churchward and his colleagues have weathered the healthy scepticism towards IT adopted by most companies since recession bit hard - 'we measure the benefits after implementation. A successful project will yield a substantial return on the investment in technology. Our business is guaranteeing that return.' Four years ago, NatWest Card Services began introducing a 130-workstation Filenet system to process letters arriving at its Access and Visa centre at Southend. The number of documents handled daily averages 4,500, but can peak at 12,000 for boom periods like the January sales. Over 10,000 documents are retrieved from two 'jukeboxes' every day. Credit card account details are retained on an IBM mainframe host, with 250,000 statements downloaded each day. The DIP side of this operation cost Pounds 2.2m. DIP has done more than speed up access to data at Southend. It has put every clerk directly in touch with the public. And NatWest has been sufficiently impressed to embark on its own DIP software project.</p>

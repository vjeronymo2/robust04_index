			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Major warns of market risks if EC summit fails: PM will tell counterparts to compromise MR JOHN MAJOR will this week warn of the danger of fresh turmoil in international financial markets if the European Community fails to resolve its differences in a comprehensive accord at next week's Edinburgh summit. As he embarks on a new round of diplomacy today, the prime minister is preparing to tell fellow heads of government that a series of complex deals must be reached to restore market confidence, fuel recovery and thereby prevent the recession deepening into a slump. With mistrust of the British presidency of the EC still running high in European capitals, Mr Major must persuade his counterparts to compromise on issues ranging from the Community budget to enlargement and the political crisis caused by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. In Brussels, senior EC officials are concerned that Mr Major may be gambling too much on his powers of personal diplomacy to forge the alliances necessary to avoid failure at Edinburgh. The prime minister's task has become trickier as France has stepped up its campaign to peel away support for the EC-US compromise on farm subsidies in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. A solid EC majority remains opposed to scuppering the deal, but some countries such as Spain and Belgium appear to be wavering. Mr Major is in Luxembourg today and will hold crucial talks in Madrid tomorrow with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister. His support is needed to meet Danish requests for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty and to overcome Madrid's opposition to opening talks early next year on EC enlargement with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. But Mr Gonzalez is bitterly disappointed at the UK's tough new proposals on the shape and size of the EC budget leading to the end of the decade. The UK plan was presented to a meeting of EC foreign and finance ministers in Brussels last Friday, and drew a storm of protest from poorer EC countries led by Spain. A British minister said last night, however, that it was becoming increasingly clear that agreement on the future financing of the community would hold the key to the summit. Although almost every country is seeking agreements on a wide range of issues, an accord on the new shape of the Community's financing would 'unlock everything', he said. Britain wants to freeze EC spending for the next three years, and to limit growth to a 'ceiling' of 1.22 per cent of the Community's gross national product in 1996 and 1997, before lifting it to 1.25 per cent in 1998 and 1999. The approach won support from Germany, the Netherlands and richer EC members, but Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal denounced the compromise and called for the allocation of greater resources known as 'cohesion funds'. France has been wooing Spain in an effort to build a coalition in favour of renegotiating the deal with the US on farm subsidies on the grounds that it is not compatible with the EC agreement last May to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. The aim is to end France's isolation within the EC on the Gatt trade talks, thus avoiding the exercise of a French veto which would provoke a serious split in the Community. Speaking on French television yesterday, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's industry and trade minister, described a French veto as akin to using a nuclear weapon. At the same time, he brushed aside fears that reopening the farm subsidies deal could jeopardise hopes of a wider Gatt agreement.

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Unions to consider Pounds 2.3bn Air France rescue plan Air France yesterday put a rescue plan, including a three-year wage freeze and 5,000 voluntary redundancies, to its 14 trade unions. The French government has made union acceptance a condition for injecting FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) into the ailing state airline. An official of Force Ouvriere, the largest union at Air France, said it would 'not put a spanner' in the management's plan. Two other big unions complained the government was 'blackmailing' them into accepting the scheme. Mr Christian Blanc, the new Air France president, said all 14 unions must approve the rescue to prevent any recurrence of the damaging strike that led to the scrapping of a previous austerity plan last October and the resignation of his predecessor, Mr Bernard Attali. In contrast to the Attali plan, the new measures do not include forced redundancies or pay cuts. Air France's request for 'at least FFr20bn' in state aid to help cover its losses, which amounted to FFr7.5bn last year, and to help service its FFr37bn debt, requires approval from the European Commission. Confident of approval, Mr Blanc said the Commission should be reassured that the state aid would not distort competition in the European market, as Air France would be reducing its fleet from 166 to 149 aircraft during five years. It plans to increase by 2 per cent a year the seats per kilometre it could offer, by better use of its carriers. This would also be the last time Air France would seek state aid, he promised. Decisions on airline aid are made by Mr Abel Matutes, the transport commissioner. His officials said the French aid request - though very large  -was in proportion to aid recently promised by Portugal and Greece to their carriers. The UK is expected to lobby against the state aid.

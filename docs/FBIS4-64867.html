			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Winding Up Party </F> Consultations"]    [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- Premier-designate Silvio  Berlusconi will wind up his official government-formation  consultations with political parties today, official sources  confirmed this morning.    Berlusconi began the final round of consultations with a  meeting with the (former Communist) Democratic Party of the  Left, at 1000 local (0800 GMT).    At 1100 local he will meet one of his two main coalition  partners, the hard-right National Alliance. At 1200 he will  meet the other one, the federalist Northern League. An hour  later he is scheduled to confer with Communist Renewal, and at  1400 local with his own group, Forza Italia.    A Forza Italia official, Domenico Mennitti, after a meeting  with Berlusconi announced that "the road to the formation of a  new government is all downhill."    Berlusconi may decide to withdraw the traditional "reserve"  on the mandate given by the president as early as Saturday [7  May], Forza Italia Senate whip Cesare Previti commented.    Both officials declined to comment negotiations over the  post  of Interior minister.    Berlusconi himself said he may withdraw his reserve on  Monday. "That would be the most logical thing to do," he told  reporters after ending his consultations here.    He also forecast that the Senate debate on the new  government  may begin as early as next Thursday but Berlusconi stressed he  did not want to "make commitments" on when negotiations would be  completed.    "I want to be consistent with what I have already said: it  takes time to do things well," he said, adding that he did not  want to fix definitive dates for votes of confidence or other  political developments.    Berlusconi denied he planned to withdraw his reserve  tomorrow, saying he needed more time to fine-tune his political  program. "I think it is correct to go to the president with a  program, perhaps not definitive but at least with the major  points defined, and a list of ministers," he said.    He declined to give any names of possible ministers and  stressed that for the Interior Ministry, "everything still has  to be specified."</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional behind Suter's surge to Pounds 30m INTERIM pre-tax profits of Suter jumped from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 29.6m, thanks mainly to an exceptional Pounds 19.1m gain on the disposal of the industrial conglomerate's valves business. However, the underlying businesses also improved, with trading profit from continuing operations increasing from Pounds 9m to Pounds 10.9m in the six months to July 3. Turnover of the continuing businesses was 6 per cent higher at Pounds 92.2m, about half the gain arising from currency translation. Overall sales were slightly down at Pounds 99.1m (Pounds 99.6m), but the current year included a four-month contribution from valves. Suter said significant improvements were seen in the environmental division in the UK and speciality chemicals, while businesses close to the high street - haircare products, spectacle cases and giftware boxes - also experienced a notable improvement in demand. The group said those areas offset less favourable conditions in other areas  -refrigeration wholesaling, fine chemicals and automotive components, although individual automotive businesses less exposed to continental European markets had performed satisfactorily. Mr David Abell, chairman, said: 'These interim results are pleasing but do not fully reflect the progress we have made in improving efficiency through capital investment and reduction of the costs base. The profit potential for the upturn is bright.' Mr Abell said he was content, meantime, to monitor developments at James Wilkes, the troubled engineering group in which Suter has built up a 19.3 per cent stake. Suter would not sell its stake at current price levels, but could not move until the intention of other large shareholders became clearer. Basic earnings per share jumped from 5.5p to 17.5p. Excluding exceptionals, the fully diluted figure rose from 5.4p to 6.3p. The interim dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 3.4p (3.2p).</p>

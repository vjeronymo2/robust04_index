			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Wu Tai-chi (0702 3141 1015), Chou </F> Lang-juo (0719 2597 5387), Liu Chung (0491 3095): "Hunan  Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin Says Hunan  Displays the Superiority of a Big Province, Its Inflation Rate  May be Lower Than 15 Percent This Year"]    [Text] Changsha, 2 June (WEN WEI PO) -- Hunan Provincial  Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin said in a special  interview with these reporters: In the reform year, Hunan  Province is confident of keeping the inflation rate below 15  percent. Meanwhile, we are going to enhance the reform of  state-owned enterprises and give full play to the superiority of  our role as a major agricultural province, and foreign  businessmen are welcome to invest in Hunan's infrastructure  construction.    Wang Maolin said: Owing to the introduction of some reform  measures and the effect of investment, in the first two months  of this year, the rate of commodity price rises in Hunan was  quite high, greater than the national average. Therefore, Hunan  Province has taken a series of regulatory measures and made use  of the advantage of having a plentiful supply of goods and  materials on hand to rapidly put large numbers of commodities on  the market, particularly such necessities of people's lives as  rice, vegetables, and meat. Meanwhile, price ceilings are set  on farm and sideline products and the trend of rapid and  excessive price rises is brought under control in a very short  time. In April, prices rises in Hunan were lower than the  national average level. Regarding the controlled target of  inflation this year, Wang Maolin said: With the introduction of  grain price reform in June, commodity prices may be much  affected, but we are very confident of keeping the inflation  rate below 15 percent.    Talking about this year's reform tasks, Wang Maolin said:  This year, Hunan Province will lay stress on coordinating with  reform measures introduced by the central authorities to  guarantee implementation of the measures. Meanwhile, we will  enhance reform of state-owned enterprises. We will resolutely  urge enterprises not running well for a long time to declare  bankruptcy, encourage enterprises achieving good benefit to  merge with enterprises with unreasonable product structures, and  take measures, such as auctioning off some enterprises and  letting state-owned enterprises be run by the private sector, to  improve enterprise economic benefits and reduce deficits.    Wang Maolin said: Hunan is a major agricultural province  with the output of paddy rice and live pigs ranking first in our  country. Hunan has made great contributions to our country, but  our villages are not as well-off as they should be, mainly  because processing work has failed to keep up with development.  As long as we can make enough efforts in the depth and quality  of processing and packing, and give wide publicity to the  products, Hunan's agriculture will be able to advance to a new  stage. Wang Maolin specially pointed out that as a major  agricultural province, Hunan's products should have a  considerable market share in Hong Kong. He said that foreign  businesses are welcome to invest in Hunan, particularly in  infrastructure construction. He continued: The Hunan section  of the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway is 570 kilometers in length.  At present, apart from support pledged by the World Bank and  the Asian Development Bank, we are trying to raise funds from  various channels, and domestic and overseas businesses are  welcome to invest in this "golden road." Talking about the  construction in the energy sector, Wang Maolin said: Hong  Kong's China Light and Power Company is talking with us about  joint-venture construction of a thermal power plant in Changde.  The China Light and Power Company will own 40 percent of the  stock. At present, both sides have signed a letter of intent on  cooperation.</p>

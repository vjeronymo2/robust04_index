			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (12): Prevailing winds set the pace - Politics POLITICS in Iran these days is very little about the conflict between government and opposition and almost everything to do with the tensions within a regime which has largely consolidated its grip on power. Opposition to the regime exists in a formal sense through such organisations as the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, once allied with the clergy in toppling Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, but its visibility within Iran has, along with other political factions, been relentlessly whittled down over the past 10 years. In a less structured sense, popular discontent remains far more audible than Iran's external image would suggest. Inflation, unemployment, lack of housing, rigid dress codes and the absence of entertainment facilities contribute to an absence of enthusiasm for a government which in a western democratic system would spell probably disaster at the next election. If ministers had failed to notice the extent of this dissaffection it was brought sharply home to them when many thousands of people in Mashhad and other cities rioted during the summer. The harshness of the government response emphasised its determination to nip the protests in the bud, but subsequent modification of policies has revealed how shaken part of the regime was by the outburst of public hostility. Some senior clergy refuse to acknowledge the idea of a Moslem people at odds with an Islamic government, but this does not appear to include members of the Majlis (parliament) whose attitudes during the second part of last year underwent a significant shift. At the time of the parliamentary elections in April and May it was assumed, with some justification, that President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani was orchestrating a legislature more in tune with his own ideas, especially for modernising the economy. Certainly the president succeeded in removing some of his more vocal critics. But the new Majlis has shown itself to be much more conservative than expected and far from sympathetic to the more western-oriented technocrats in the government who had been arguing for more emphatic action on economic reforms, such as privatisation and the unification of the exchange rate. On social issues, too, the past six months has been marked by some reversal of the more relaxed attitudes which had been gaining ground. Women's dress code has been more rigorously enforced, there have been a flurry of attacks on publications which deviated from the official line, and at night in the main cities there has been a significant increase in the number of roadblocks manned by the baseej, the militia force which is charged with the defence of the revolution. This could be interpreted as a setback for President Rafsanjani and his attempt to make the Islamic revolution more palatable to western nations. But with the president facing re-election in June it would anyway be prudent for him to bend with the prevailing wind. The main concern for the president is said to be preventing any form of link developing between the men he ejected from parliament last summer and the popular discontent evident in Mashhad. Accordingly, it would be politically hazardous to adopt policies in the short term which could have an effect on the living standards of the poorest or, at the other end of the income scale, threaten the capacity of bazaar merchants to generate profits. No-one in Tehran doubts that Mr Rafsanjani will be re-elected by a substantial majority, but the regime can be less confident that it was of the public mood. Part of the reason for that stems from the unique role played by Ayatollah Khomeini in the overthrow of the previous regime and in the establishment of an Islamic republic. No successor could inherit that combination of political legitimacy and spiritual authority. Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei has the authority of being the country's spiritual leader, but other ayatollahs rank above him as Islamic jurists. To that extent, spiritual leader and president need each other, and can be viewed as different sides of the same coin. They are also individually incapable of exerting decisive influence over the entire regime and government machinery. There is no concept of cabinet responsibility, such as practised in Britain. Ministers do not meet as a single, political entity. Rather there are committees, grouping several ministries, at which most decisions are taken. Mr Rafsanjani may not have initiated those decisions, but Iranians close to the process say it operates on an assumption of presidential approval unless clear opposition has been voiced. Then there are areas of economic and political activity which are more loosely part of the regime but largely unaccountable to anyone. The most obvious examples are the bonyads, or religious foundations, the largest and most powerful of which is the Bonyad Mostazafin headed by Mr Mohsen Rafiqdoost. It produces no accounts, has an annual income thought to run into hundreds of millions of dollars, is becoming involved in aviation, would like to get into the oil industry and is sometimes suspected of funding political activities overseas. More shadowy still, but very much part of the political scene, are the organisations within organisations. In several key government ministries, Iranians say that there is a clearly detectable alternative grouping, owing an allegiance beyond the immediate obvious authority. So although President Rafsanjani enjoys considerable authority, it is clearly limited and does not extend equally throughout the full range of the regime's activities. He can be rebuffed, needs to cajole the Majlis, and can be badly wrong-footed by a decision taken elsewhere in the administration which is subsequently difficult to reverse. It appears that Mr Rafsanjani knows broadly the direction in which he wishes to lead the country and appreciates that the population needs more than Islamic fervour to remain supportive of the revolution. However, he is quite prepared to take at least half a step back for every one that he takes forward. The evolution of Iran under the clergy is likely to move more at the pace of the tortoise than that of the hare.</p>

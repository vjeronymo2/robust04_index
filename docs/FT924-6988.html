			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Convenience and ready meals lift Hazlewood STRONG GROWTH from Hazlewood Foods' convenience and ready meals offset falling tomato prices to push interim profits up by nearly 7 per cent, from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 24.7m. Full impact of shares issued for the Sutherland acquisition in September last year held earnings per share growth to 0.8 per cent at 7.62p (7.56p). Mr Peter Barr, executive chairman, said 'further progress in the second half is expected'. The interim dividend goes up from 2.2p to 2.3p 'as an indication of confidence about the second half'. Sales in the six months to end-September rose 24 per cent to Pounds 364.8m (Pounds 294m). Mr John Simons, finance director, said stripping out acquisitions, mainly Sutherland, and exchange effects, underlying growth was 3 per cent. However, lower prices in many areas meant underlying volumes were 7 per cent higher. Operating profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 30.4m. Underlying growth was 4 per cent, Mr Simons said. The benefit of sterling's devaluation would be more important in the second half, he added. Although operating profit margins appeared to slip, Mr Simons said this was because of the inclusion of Sutherland's lower margin distribution activity, and comparable margins were maintained. Interest charges rose from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 5.71m as debt increased Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 139.6m, lifting gearing to 87 per cent. This came mainly from high capital expenditure of Pounds 21.7m. Mr Simons said interest cover of 5.3 times (6.9 times) was comfortable. Also the group had arranged a Dollars 80m (Pounds 52.5m) placement of seven year debt in the US which had been swapped into guilders, to match the group's assets in the Netherlands. This would enable Hazlewood to repay all its short term debt. Within the divisions, operating profits from ready meals rose from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 5m and from convenience foods from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 6m. The glut of fresh produce, such as tomatoes, in Europe cut profits in that division from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 1.6m. In shellfish, a recovery was made from the problems of the Dutch cockle industry and profits rose from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.5m. Meat profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 3.5m, with Pounds 250,000 of the drop caused by a recall of pork products in September, although these turned out not to be contaminated. Profits in other divisions were flat. COMMENT Given the traumas much of the food industry has been through this summer, Hazlewood has done well even to edge earnings up. And for once the company does not have to apologise for any nasty surprises. It appears capable of making much more out of the ready meal and convenience foods areas, though the continental operations may find life tougher as recession reaches its customers. The main concern is the level of debt. But this is in a good cause as Hazlewood wants to seize as many opportunities as it can. And the US debt placement should have prevented any short term crunch. With forecasts still about Pounds 55m (Pounds 51.3m) pre-tax for the year the prospective p/e of 8.2 leaves something to go for.</p>

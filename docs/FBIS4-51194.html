			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Provisional Procedures for Management of </F> Automatic Registration of Import of Specific Commodities,  Promulgated by Five Departments, Including the State Planning  Commission"]    [Text] The State Planning Commission, the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the People's Bank of  China, the General Administration of Customs, and the State  Administration of Exchange Control, in cooperation with other  departments concerned, have formulated the "Provisional  Procedures for Management of Automatic Registration of Import of  Specific Commodities," in accordance with the instructions of  leading comrades of the State Council, with a view to ensuring  the smooth progress of the reform of the foreign exchange  control system, intensifying the state's overall monitoring of  importation of important commodities, keeping informed of the  current state of import of a few categories of staple raw and  processed materials and sensitive commodities, and providing  guidelines to enterprises. The following is the full text of  the provisional procedures:    Article 1. These procedures are hereby formulated with a  view to intensifying the state's macroscopic monitoring of  importation of important commodities, keeping informed of the  current state of import of a few categories of staple raw and  processed materials and sensitive commodities, and providing  guidelines to enterprises.    Article 2. The State Planning Commission is in charge of  guiding, coordinating, and managing automatic registration of  importation of specific commodities nationwide.    The competent divisions and bureaus under the departments  concerned of the State Council, as well as the planning  commissions (or planning and economic commissions) of all  provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the  central government, and cities separately listed in the state  plan (hereinafter called "registration organs" for short), which  are authorized by the State Planning Commission, are in charge  of the automatic registration of imports of specific commodities  within their own departments or localities.    If any enterprises subordinate to other departments of the  State Council lacking the authorization of the State Planning  Commission want to have their importation of commodities  registered, they will do so with the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation.    Article 3. A list of specific commodities subject to  automatic import registration is to be prepared by the  department concerned of the State Planning Commission in  accordance with the state's need for macroeconomic regulation  and control, and this list will be submitted to the State  Council for examination and announced upon approval.    The following commodities are on the provisional import  registration list for 1994: 1) steel products, 2) steel billets,  3) scrap steel, 4) discarded ships, 5) non-ferrous metal  (copper, aluminum), 6) plastic material (polyethylene,  polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene except ABS  resin), 7) paper, 8) fruits, and 9) cosmetics.    Article 4. Imports in the following forms of trade are  subject to import registration in accordance with these  procedures: 1) General imports as a form of trade, 2) imports  financed by loans granted by foreign governments or financial  institutions, 3) consignment sale imports, 4) leased imports [zu  lin jin kou 4436 6324 6651 0656], 5) compensation trade imports,  6) imports by international tender, 7) imports in exchange for  labor services, and 8) donated imports.    Commodities subject to automatic import registration, which  are imported for the business of processing with supplied or  imported materials and will be directly used in processing  production and reexported as processed goods, shall be placed  under customs control and supervision.    Another set of procedures shall be formulated separately to  regulate the automatic import registration for commodities  imported by foreign-funded enterprises as capital goods, goods  for their own consumption, or materials to be used to produce  products for domestic markets.    Article 5. Import registration is necessary in the following  cases:    1. The imported commodities are those which the departments  or localities concerned need in production and construction or  those for which there is a market demand.    2. The imports are to be paid for with renminbi funds.    3. The importing foreign trade company has confirmation from  both the goods supplier and the Chinese buyer, and therefore  needs a signed import certificate.    Article 6. Before instructing a foreign trade enterprise  with authorization for importation of the specific commodity to  sign the import contract (only foreign trade enterprises  endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation should be instructed to import steel products), the  enterprise that is to proceed to import will lodge its  registration application with the appropriate registration organ  through appropriate administrative channels (enterprises  importing fruits and cosmetics will file the registration  application with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation). The registration organ concerned, upon receipt of  the enterprise's application, will proceed with registration  formalities, providing that the application fulfills the  requirements set out in these procedures, or explain if  rejecting the application.    Article 7. A "Certificate for Registration of Importation  of Specific Commodities" on a unified form printed by the State  Planning Commission is necessary for importation of specific  commodities subject to automatic import registration.    The "Certificate for Registration of Importation of Specific  Commodities" is in quadruplicate. The original copy (in black)  will be given to a bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange  upon request for conversion of local currency into foreign  currency; the second copy (in red) goes to the customs office  for examination; the third copy (in blue) goes to the foreign  trade company authorized to deal in importation of the specific  commodity as a proof of order; and the fourth copy (in purple)  will be filed by the registration certificate issuing organ.    Article 8. The valid seal for the "Certificate of  Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" is the  "Exclusive Seal for Registration of Import of Specific  Commodities" made and granted by the State Planning Commission.    Article 9. An authorized bank for dealing in foreign  exchange will render foreign exchange payment service to a  customer upon presentation of a "Certificate of Registration of  Import of Specific Commodities," while the customs office will  inspect and clear imported goods upon presentation of the  "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities"  issued by the import registration organ authorized by the State  Planning Commission.    For imports affected by such trading modes as loans granted  by Chinese or foreign creditors, donations, aid, compensation  trade, leasing trade, and counter trade, which do not entitle  the importer to buy foreign exchange, the original copy of the  "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities"  (which is to be presented by the importer to a bank authorized  to deal in foreign exchange upon request for foreign exchange  payment service) will not be issued to the importer but be kept  on file by the import registration organ.    Article 10. The validity period of the "Certificate of  Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" is six months.  If an import contract needs to be extended beyond this validity  period, reregistration will be necessary with the original  certificate issuing organ, and the import registration  certificate previously issued will be returned to the issuer.  If any particulars (other than the validity period) stated in  the import registration certificate need to be amended within  the validity period, the importer will apply to the original  import registration certificate issuer for amendment, which is  to be stated in the "Remarks" column of the certificate and  endorsed by the "Exclusive Seal for Registration of Import of  Specific Commodities."    Article 11. All the import registration organs shall  properly perform their duties regarding import registration  within their own jurisdiction, keep track of the ordering and  delivery of goods that are imported according to the import  registration, prepare a full list of import items registered in  the previous month and submit it to the State Planning  Commission by the 10th day of each month to facilitate overall  monitoring and control of import of registered commodities.    Article 12. In any of the following cases related to the  enterprise, which are regarded as violation of these procedures,  no bank shall render the enterprise foreign exchange payment  service, no customs office will grant approval to the import,  and appropriate penalties will be meted out in accordance with  relevant regulations.    1. Failure to secure a "Certificate of Registration of  Import  of Specific Commodities" according to these procedures, prior to  the signing of an import contract with a foreign party and  shipment of the imported goods which are subject to import  registration.    2. Forging, altering, or illegally reselling a "Certificate  of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities."    Article 13. Any staff member of an import registration organ  who is involved in dereliction of duty, irregularities for the  benefit of relatives or friends, or abuse of power, will be  liable to administrative action by the supervisory organ  according to the seriousness of the specific case. In case of  violation of laws, the offender will be held responsible for  criminal offense.    Article 14. These procedures shall enter into force on the  date of promulgation.    Article 15. The right of the interpretation of these  procedures resides in the State Planning Commission.

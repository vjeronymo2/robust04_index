			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: O&amp;Y hits property sector OVERNIGHT news that Olympia &amp; York had filed for protection in New York and Toronto sent leading property shares plunging when the London market opened yesterday. Hardest hit were those groups with a large commercial office portfolio which would be likely to suffer the most if the Canadian group's Canary Wharf development went into receivership. Hammerson suffered the most, tumbling 8 per cent at the opening on additional worries over the group's exposure to the New York and Canadian property sectors. However, most stocks had recovered some ground by the end of trading although one trader described the sector as 'fragile'. Hammerson 'A' lost 13 to 383p, the 'Ordinary' 13 to 405p, MEPC 10 to 332p, and Land Securities 12 to 434p. According to one leading property analyst, the demise of Canary Wharf would be bad news all round. 'Banks would be even less likely to lend money to property companies, foreign investment would be stalled and the market recovery would be further delayed,' he said. Other analysts predicted that the depression in London office rents is likely to be prolonged by the O&amp;Y situation. Banks steady Clearing banks performed well in the light of the news on O&amp;Y. Barclays, which is reckoned to have lent more money to O&amp;Y than any of the other UK clearers, closed 6 off at 380p, after being 11 down at one stage. Some analysts have said the exposure is as high as Pounds 400m and even the more conservative put it above Pounds 100m. However, the exposure to O&amp;Y in particular and the UK property market in general was already in the share price and the stock was helped by a positive note from Kleinwort Benson yesterday. The house believes Barclays is the strongest buy in the sector and argues that despite a healthy balance sheet the shares have underperformed the market by more than 30 per cent since July last year. Kleinwort reduced its estimate of O&amp;Y exposure from Pounds 250m to Pounds 200m yesterday. Kleinwort also likes Royal Bank of Scotland which, it says, has one of the lowest property exposures. The shares fell early on as it was suggested in the press that the O&amp;Y loan was around Pounds 565m. A statement by RBOS that it had no business relationship with the Canadian company and therefore no exposure to it helped the shares to recover and close a penny firmer at 193p. NatWest, which Kleinwort also rates a buy, was a penny better at 351p. Results from Unilever were in-line with market expectations, with first-quarter profits ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 377m. However, there was some disquiet over the fall in European sales leading to a decline in operating profits which in turn pressured the share price. Mr Carl Short at Nomura commented: 'Although German sales in particular were disappointing, overall organic sales growth of 5 per cent at a time when other companies are showing a decline was encouraging.' He is shading his forecast to Pounds 1.98bn full-year, with Pounds 2.20bn in 1993. BZW, Unilever's broker, has also shaved its forecasts, predicting Pounds 1.97bn and Pounds 2.17bn respectively. The shares fell 17 to 932p. Talk that a Sunday newspaper would carry a very critical story on BP, plus a block of 9m shares sold at 248p, prompted the stock to lose 2 1/2 to 250 1/2 p. Once again, Shell Transport was a very strong performer following surprisingly good first-quarter figures on Thursday coupled with enthusiastic comment. The shares rose 10 to 506p and dealers said the gain would have been twice as big if some investors had not been switching into Royal Dutch. Turnover was high with 7.3m shares traded. A sharp mark down in Pearson came after shareholders were told that newspaper advertising remained weak, although there were prospects of an upturn for its oil services unit in the second half. The shares fell 36 to 865p following the annual meeting. Arjo Wiggins Appleton held up well despite an agency cross of 20m shares at below the market price. The stake sale, carried out at 254p a share, came in the wake of the surprise resignation of the chief executive on Thursday. The shares eased 1 1/2 to 261 1/2 p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved 10 ahead to 470p, on thin volume in London, after buyers were seen in Paris. The shares picked up after the company said in a letter to share holders that it would not need extra funds to help it complete the tunnel before its autumn 1993 openning. Eurotunnel also said the Inter-governmental commission would allow the Channel Tunnel operator to carry heavy goods vehicles in semi-open shuttle wagons as long as stringent safety criteria were met. The company said the decision could mean fewer delays and could save up to Pounds 100m in additional costs. Speciality chemicals group Laporte's days in the Footsie appear to be numbered. The company is in the throes of cancelling 28m shares in the final stage of its unravelling of Interox, its 50 per cent-owned joint venture with Solvay of Belgium. After the close of trading on Monday there will be only 154m Laporte shares and yesterday's closing price of 643p, down 4 on the day, gives a market capitalisation of Pounds 977m. Analysts said the group's share price would need to reach 740p before the end of June if it is to remain in the Footsie. However, many still like the stock believing it to be cheap at the present price. Ironically, one of the companies that looks set to take Laporte's place is Burmah which prompted the Interox venture when it launched a hostile takeover bid in 1971. Burmah has risen, almost in a straight line, from 514p at the time of the general election. Yesterday, although the shares lost 7 to 657p its market capitalisation was almost Pounds 1.2bn, comfortably within the traditional Footsie cut-off point of around Pounds 1bn Hotel group Forte slipped 4 to 247p in a weak market. BZW recently reiterated its sell advice. However, Forte next week embarks on a series of meeting with institutions where an upbeat message may help sentiment. Theme park owner Euro Disney's bad week ended as it began, the shares declining 13 to 1253p. The group has been hit by reports of disappointing attendance figures. Ladbroke receded 6 to 244p on continuing property worries. Positive consideration of BICC, which has just announced a Pounds 154m cash call to fund acquisitions, pushed the shares up 11 to 370p. Body Shop was seen to recover from an allegedly badly-handled selling order shares from the US on Thursday. The shares rose 6 to 319p. Boots also came back after worries over its bond conversion, the shares adding 5 to 456p. Fading bid talk saw Dalepak Food tumble 10 to 413p. However, spurious stories raised the temperature in Unigate, ahead 6 at 360p. Morland slumped 27 to 458p as rival brewer Greene King launched a Pounds 101.3m bid with a 450p a share cash alternative. Greene King lost 7 to 507p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (180).

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle Tate &amp; Lyle's investment in the Slovak Republic represents a small lump in its corporate sugarbowl. But the move illustrates how food manufacturers in mature economies are becoming increasingly reliant on developing markets for growth. Tate's big presence in Anglo-Saxon markets precludes further acquisitions in sugar and starch. Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim are therefore assuming ever greater importance. The shift of focus inevitably raises Tate's risk profile, suggesting its earnings stream may be less highly rated. A forward multiple of 11 already places Tate below the market average. The immediate worries are understandable. But European and US food markets will experience little volume growth in coming years. Western companies which can successfully exploit developing markets should, if anything, command a premium rating. Comparatively small investments will bring disproportionate returns. Not only will they allow companies to service fast growing domestic demand. If trade is liberalised, low cost plants in countries such as Hungary or Mexico will be ideally positioned for export growth. The prizes will go to companies that can successfully manage the risks in developing markets. Nestle, Coca-Cola and Unilever lead the way. Tate, which also has to wrestle with what is essentially a commodity business, still has some way to go to establish its credentials.</p>

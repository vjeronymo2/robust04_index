			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum 'largely in balance' JOHNSON MATTHEY executive director Mr CRN Clark believes the world platinum will be largely in balance this year but slightly in deficit in 1994, reports Reuter from Tokyo. He said global 1993 platinum demand would be about 4m ounces, compared with 3.8m ounces in 1992. 'I heard from our expert that there are no more surplus stocks (in Russia) and they are merely selling what they usually mine in a normal year,' said Johnson Matthey chairman Mr David Davies. Johnson Matthey officials said normal annual production there was estimated at about 500,000 ounces. Russian platinum sales would continue lower because of lower world prices and lower national stocks, Mr Clark said. 'Russian sales will be slightly depressed from the level of the last two years.' The country sold 1.1m ounces of platinum in 1991 and 750,000 ounces in 1992, an exceptional release of stocks in order to obtain hard currency, said Mr Davies. Mr Clark and Mr Davies are in Japan to attend the opening of a technology centre in Tochigi prefecture north-east of Tokyo. Demand for rhodium, the rare metal recovered with platinum, should begin to pick up as buying from car manufacturers resumes, Mr Clark said. 'Now that worldwide stocks of car makers have been reduced and are at minimum levels, buying should start again,' he explained.'</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: US brewers look for more overseas flavour THE DEALS are coming thick and fast. On Monday, Anheuser-Busch, the number one brewing company in the US, unveiled plans to buy a 17.7 per cent stake in Mexico's leading beer producer, Grupo Modelo. A few days earlier, it announced a joint venture with Kirin Brewery in Japan. In January, Miller Brewing, the second-largest US brewer and part of the giant Philip Morris group, bought a 20 per cent interest in Molson Breweries, Canada's largest brewer. In December, Miller took a near 8 per cent interest in Fomento Economico Mexicano, a second Mexican brewer whose market share is only slightly smaller that Grupo Modelo's. The rationale behind the flurry of activity is fairly simple: the US brewers' home market has been depressingly flat of late. The Beverage Marketing Corporation, a New York-based consultancy group, estimates US domestic beer sales amounted to 188m barrels last year, virtually unchanged from the 1988 figure of 187.4m barrels. In the three intervening years, sales stood at 188.1m, 193.2m, and 188.8m barrels respectively. The fillip in 1990, moreover, was largely explained by a run-up in stocks ahead of a doubling in federal excise tax. The explanations for this bleak situation range from the ageing of the 'baby-boom' generation to the higher tax burden and associated rise in prices. Increasing emphasis on 'healthy' eating and drinking has played a significant part, too. For years, the big brewers have been producing 'light' beers, and the top three brands - Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light - now account for more than one-fifth of US beer sales. Within this maturing industry, Anheuser has achieved creditable market share gains. It has increased its take of the US domestic market from around 35 per cent in the mid-1980s to over 44 per cent last year, and has a declared target of 50 per cent. After-tax profits have also increased steadily. But Anheuser's attempts to diversify into food, snacks, theme parks, even bio-technology, are widely judged to have been a flop. For some analysts, then, a move to expand the core beer business out of the domestic arena and into international markets which are still growing, cannot come a moment too soon. Mexico has obvious attractions: the beer market has been expanding, in volume terms, at around 6 per cent annually, while the North American Free Trade Treaty would bind the country more closely to the US economy and accelerate Mexico's growth. Nafta also anticipates that a fairly heavy tariff on imported beers would be phased out. However, Anheuser has made clear that its interest in Grupo Modelo focuses primarily on the Mexican brewer's potential in its own market, rather than as a conduit for selling Budweiser abroad.</p>

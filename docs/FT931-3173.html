			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Leg-up welcomed by Lloyd's - Insurance Tax YESTERDAY'S decision to modify the taxation of insurance reserves marks the successful conclusion of a long campaign by both Lloyd's of London and the UK's insurance companies. It was warmly welcomed by the industry. New arrangements should improve the industry's ability to insure infrequent but severe catastrophe losses. The most important change concerns the troubled Lloyd's insurance market. Under new rules, Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting - will be allowed to establish more generous tax deductible reserves to meet future losses. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said the industry had for some time 'been urging the government for equality of treatment with their continental competitors' by a change in the fiscal regime. 'The better-targeted reserve would increase Lloyd's ability to deal with the type of risk in which we specialise.' A new tax deductible reserve will replace the special reserve fund, which allows Names to set aside up to Pounds 7,000 each year against higher-rate income tax. The level of the reserve has not been changed since 1955. According to the arrangements which come into effect to cover the 1992 underwriting year, a Name will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of profits to the new reserve each year, provided that the maximum value of the funds in the reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall premium income limit - the limit they can accept. Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls. Amounts withdrawn that are not used to meet losses will attract tax. The chancellor also conceded that there 'may be a case' for allowing tax relief on certain types of 'equalisation' reserve, potentially extending a similar benefit for insurance companies. Most European insurers are allowed to establish such reserves. A consultative paper will outline options. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive, of the Association of British Insurers, the trade association, said: 'It is obviously a step in the right direction. They have accepted the principle of change.' Lloyd's has also welcomed the simplification of other aspects of Names' tax treatment; the most important concerns rules for the taxation of gains accruing from the capital appreciation of premium trust funds made up of premiums earned by underwriters. The chancellor proposes to tax such gains as income rather than capital, bringing Lloyd's into line with insurance companies.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers hit The shock decision by Mr Rupert Murdoch's The Times newspaper late on Thursday to cut its cover price to 20p hit an intensely nervous publishing sector and saw hard pressed shares tumble further. The Times' move made a mockery of Thursday's Daily Telegraph price cut and prompted some analysts to talk of a domino effect in the middle market area held by the Daily Express and Daily Mail which could end up at the door of the Daily Mirror. Telegraph shares were also weighed down by questions hanging over the recent 12.5m stake by Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, the Telegraph owner. However, after the market closed the Stock Exchange cleared the newspaper. The shares fell 17 to 332p. United Newspapers, whose Daily Express now costs 60 per cent more than The Times, fell 25 to 485p, while Daily Mail Trust 'A' shares shed 33 to 870p. There was concern that if those papers were forced to reduce their price the end victim could be the Mirror, already squeezed by a cut-price Sun. Mirror Group shares fell 4 to 130p, close to the flotation price three years ago.</p>

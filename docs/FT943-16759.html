			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas buyers help shares to a firm close - Market Report The UK stock market cruised comfortably to a firm close yesterday, helped by a steadier trend in the dollar and the bond markets ahead of the meeting next week of the G7 countries. The final minutes of the London session were featured by the dramatic disclosure that Enterprise Oil had failed in its Pounds 1.7bn bid for Lasmo. After some initial uncertainty, the stock market took its lead from improvement in British government bonds. Bonds later lost most of their early gains but share prices remained very firm although many were below the best levels by the close. Traders reported some 'nostalgic buying for new time' late yesterday, the last time such dealings will take place before the London market switches over to a rolling account system on July 18. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Share Index at 2,936.4, for a net gain on the day of 17.2. After opening lower behind weakness in the Dow Average and Federal bonds overnight, the Footsie dipped 13 to 2,906.2. But equities rallied well when gilts moved higher, and the Index was nearly 20 points up at the day's peak. The Footsie 100 Index has recovered by 59.8 points this week as markets across Europe have rallied on strengthening hopes that the G7 meeting next weekend will bring agreement on monetary co-operation to ease the problems caused by the fall in the US dollar against the Yen. But the damage wrought on bond prices by the dollar's setback has been reflected in a fall of nearly 3 per cent in the Footsie 100 over the two week equity account which closed last night. Share losses across the broader range of the market left the FT-SE Mid 250 Index down 1.7 at 3,415.8 yesterday, and about 3.1 per cent lower over the equity account. Traders stressed the 'better tone' which developed in the stock market yesterday. Several small trading programmes were identified and at least one overseas fund was believed to be trying to put money - perhaps as much as Pounds 100m - into the UK market. It was thought that the fund was unable to commit all this cash to equities yesterday but traders hoped that the fund manager would try again next week. Trading volume dipped to 517.1m shares from the 601.1m of the previous session, when customer business of Pounds 1.29bn was comfortably within the range of profitable trading levels from the point of view of the securities trading houses. UK government bonds took their lead from US Treasuries, slipping back from their best levels when the prices component of the June Index of the US National Association of Purchasing Managers rose to its highest level for nearly six years. UK bonds steadied to close with gains of 3/32 at the short end of the scale and much the same in long dated stocks. Traders commented that many fund managers had reduced investment activity yesterday afternoon ahead of the extended weekend holiday in the New York markets. In addition to being foreshortened by the one day closure of US markets, next week will bring meetings of the US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, the Bundesbank policy committee and finally the G7 finance ministers. Faced with this battery of high-powered decision makers, investors are unlikely to hasten in implementing any new investment plans for the third quarter of the year.</p>

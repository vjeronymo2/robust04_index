			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Japan hedges on carbon tax When Japan hosted an international gathering this year on the environment, there was concern among industry that the country would be committed to a tax against carbon dioxide emissions. Instead, the resulting Tokyo Declaration carefully suggested that governments 'may wish to consider' a carbon tax and other environmental taxes, but must 'keep in mind the impact on international competitiveness'. This left the door open for Japan to slap on a tax if it wished. That door has been shut firmly for the indefinite future by a report from three energy advisory panels to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which wants to be seen as green but must also perform its sometimes conflicting role as defender of industrial interests. The panels' final report suggests that Japan may do more harm than good by introducing a carbon tax. 'In the event that such an initiative lacks international conformity, it would invite the international migration of industry,' the report says. It also reflects concern that the tax would make Japan less competitive, dragging down economic growth. Maintaining growth has become a priority for Japanese companies, which have falling profits and are thus trimming staff, salaries and product ranges. On delivery of the three panels' combined report, Miti said the recommendations would be the foundation for future policy. Rather than highlighting industry opposition to the carbon tax, it preferred that attention be paid to the report's 14 general proposals for a cleaner environment. These include more use of non-fossil fuels, encouraging environment-friendly business behaviour, promoting recycling and accelerating the development of technology to protect the environment. In a 'to be considered' category are recommendations that manufacturers refrain from excessive product changes and streamline components. The economic downturn has ensured that this is happening, with companies also using less packaging. Another consequence of the downturn is a slowing of tax revenue, which prompted the Ministry of Finance to enter the environment debate, having reckoned that a CO-related tax would help balance the books. It has considered doubling the petroleum tax. But it has chosen not to hurry the carbon tax debate, leaving Miti to exercise its influence. The Environment Agency, which tends to represent the government at international meetings, favours a tax based on a scale reflecting the amount of CO emitted, but is not pressing for immediate deployment. Yet an EC proposal to introduce carbon taxes is conditional on the US and Japan adopting similar measures, prompting Tokyo to wonder whether President-elect Clinton will reverse the US stance against the tax. Yoshitake Masuhara, planning director at the EA, says Japan's efforts over the past two decades to reduce emissions must be considered by foreign governments. 'Japan accounts for about 15 per cent of global GNP, but only for 4.8 per cent of emissions. The US accounts for about a quarter of GNP and a quarter of the emissions,' Masuhara said. 'We are disappointed that the Japanese government has not clearly supported a carbon tax, but we think the tax alone is not enough.'  ----------------------------------    CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS 1989  ---------------------------------- US                  22.3 % USSR                17.4% China               10.9% Japan                4.8% W.

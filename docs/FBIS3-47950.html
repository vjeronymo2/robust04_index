			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The leadership of the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest group in  the coalition government, will likely come under pressure to  resign after failing to unite its members in passing  government-proposed political reform bills through the Diet,  political sources said Friday [21 January].    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting of the party's  legislators that "the party's responsibility is grave."    But Murayama did not specify if he will take responsibility  for the failure by resigning as chairman of the largest force  within the seven-party coalition government.    In a plenary session Friday afternoon, the House of  Councillors voted down the package of four political reform  bills with a vote of 130-118.    Although the seven coalition parties hold a majority in the  252-seat upper house, 17 SDP members voted with the opposition  to defeat the bills.    After the voting, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet  Affairs Committee, told reporters the failure of the bills "will  be the responsibility of the (SDP's) leadership."    The SDP is expected to expel the 17 members who voted  against  the bills from the party, party sources said.    Murayama said Thursday he might resign if an expected  rebellion by several SDP legislators led to the breakdown of the  reform package in Friday's vote.    "If the political reform package fails to clear the upper  chamber as a result of SDP legislators' opposition, I will take  responsibility as the SDP chairman, as our party would not be  able to disclaim resultant political responsibility," he said.</p>

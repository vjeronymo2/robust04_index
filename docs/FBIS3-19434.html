Arsenis will hold talks with President  Glavkos Kliridhis and Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis  with the aim of promoting the coordination of the Cyprus-Greece  defense plans.    In a statement upon his arrival, Arsenis said he believed  that Greece-Cyprus defense cooperation will lay firm foundations  for a hopeful and peaceful course toward a just Cyprus solution  and will revive the Cypriot people's sense of security. He also  stressed that the defense doctrine was not a sudden inspiration  but a political decision made by the two countries' political  leaderships. The Greek national defense minister stressed that  his feelings about being in Cyprus are accompanied by a sense of  the major responsibility he feels for the purpose of his visit,  which, he stated, is to help to realize the unified defense area  doctrine. Arsenis also noted that in the next few days much work  is expected to be done without any fuss but that will be  practical, he said.    Welcoming Arsenis, Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis  stressed that the Greek national defense minister's presence in  Cyprus constitutes a very significant event for realizing the  unified defense planning and gives substantive content to the  decisions of the Greek and Cypriot Governments.    Arsenis was also welcomed by Greek Ambassador Alexandros  Sandhis and National Guard Commander Lieutenant General Nikolaos  Vorvolakos. A National Guard detachment consisting of all three  branches presented arms.    Arsenis has already met President Kliridhis at the  Presidential Palace. Kliridhis is now hosting a lunch in honor  of Arsenis.</p>

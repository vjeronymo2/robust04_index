			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa issue increased to meet demand Strong demand by investors for shares in Lufthansa, the German airline, has led to the placing of a further 1m shares by Dresdner Bank to bring the total raised by the privatisation issue up to nearly DM1.1bn (Dollars 730m). Dresdner, which co-ordinated the issue, said it had placed these extra shares, initially held back under the so-called 'green-shoe' option, to meet excess demand and stabilise the share price. This was the first German privatisation to use the book-building method of collecting investors' bids, which is designed to help set the most appropriate selling price and pinpoint long-term investors. The Lufthansa issue, which the green-shoe allocation brings up to 6m shares, was heavily oversubscribed and seen in the market as a precursor to the much bigger Deutsche Telekom issue, expected early in 1996. The Lufthansa shares - priced at DM182, a small discount to the market level at end-September - were made available by the Bonn government, which waived its allocation under the recent rights issue. This brought its share in the airline down to about 40 per cent from just over 50 per cent. Yesterday, the shares closed at DM186. The partial sell-off of government shares in Deutsche Telekom, the German telephone monopoly, is likely to raise more than DM10bn when the first tranche is issued. Details still have to be worked out, including the choice of banks to manage the issue. More than 20 foreign banks have recently been putting their case in Bonn to try to win the mandate of global co-ordinator. The German placing is expected to be shared between Dresdner and Deutsche Bank.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Deutsche Bank helps to lift sentiment The bourses were livelier yesterday. FRANKFURT was encouraged by the slightly better than expected results from Deutsche Bank, which was enough to lift the Dax index by 15.74 to 2,151.96, but off an intraday high of 2,158.41. There were further gains in the Ibis, the index rising to 2,163.32 Turnover was DM7.2bn. Deutsche Bank put on DM7 to DM735.50 ahead of the results which came after the official session had ended. The bank reported that during the first half operating profit had risen by 1 per cent: most analysts had been forecasting a loss. The bank also said that it expected full year results to be satisfactory. In Ibis trade the shares rose to DM743. Among other banking stocks, Commerzbank closed the official session at DM343, then rose to DM345.50, up DM7.50. The vehicle sector was strong, Volkswagen for instance up DM3.80 at DM502.30. MILAN succumbed to a fresh wave of uncertainty as the latest chapter in the long running corruption scandal unfolded, and investors worried about whether the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi would become embroiled in the investigations into his Fininvest media empire. The Comit index registered a 16.62 or 2.3 per cent fall to 709.47 as investors, lulled by last week's firm performance into expecting a traditional August rally, sought to lighten their portfolios. The falls were broadly based although insurers were among the hardest hit stocks. Generali fell L1,263 or 2.9 per cent to 42,034, Aleanza lost L638 or 3.7 per cent to L16,736 and Ras was L1,147 or 4.2 per cent lower at L26,000. Telecommunications issues also tumbled. Sip lost L119 to L4,398 and Stet was L210 lower at L5,296. Among other blue chips, Fiat gave up L196 or 2.8 per cent to L6,813 and Olivetti was L89 or 3.5 per cent lower at L2,451. One of the most resistant stocks was the Fininvest retailer Standa. The shares were unchanged at L37,000, although volumes were extremely thin. PARIS retreated from earlier highs to close the CAC-40 index at 2,076.84, a day's gain of 17.00. Turnover was FFr4.5bn. Dealers reported that activity was mainly driven by technical factors. Eurotunnel moved up more than 5 per cent, the shares putting on FFr1.3 to FFr26.45 on speculation that it might be brought into the CAC-40 index. AMSTERDAM rose on interest in cyclicals and the Aex index finished up 1.44 at 404.96. Among the most impressive performers, Heineken, helped by seasonal factors, put on Fl 4.20 to Fl 229.60, Akzo Fl 2.30 to Fl 213.50 and KLM Fl 1.10 to Fl 53.60. Royal Dutch went the other way, off Fl 2.00 at Fl 196.40, as it announced that it had sold its Billiton metal assets to Gencor of South Africa. ZURICH failed to find direction and the SMI index gave up early gains to finish 3.2 higher at 2,604.4. Banks were firm, UBS adding SFr7 to SFr1,204, amid indications that investors were switching from chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Roche certificates lost SFr55 to SFr5,490. Adia, the temporary employment group, picked up SFr9 to SFr225 following better than expected half year figures. BRUSSELS continued to reap the benefits of the budget agreement and the Bel-20 index added 6.12 to 1,451.92 in turnover of BFr1.2bn. Solvay gained BFr325 or 2.2 per cent to BFr14,800 helped by a broker's buy recommendation and speculation over first half results due out today. Financial stocks were firm. STOCKHOLM was supported by gains in Astra and Volvo. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.5 to 1,470.5. Brokers commented that Astra, up SKr2 to SKr169 in the B's, benefited from reports that a EU advisory panel had decided not to support a German request to ban the injectable version of the group's anti-ulcer drug Losec. Turnover was SKr1.7bn. Volvo, the most active share, added SKr11 to SKr756. Dealers said that the vehicle group was in heavy demand by international investors.

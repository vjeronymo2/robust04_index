			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAY STORES SAYS IT'S CONSIDERING SELLING 2 CHAINS;  </P> <P> DISCOUNT UNITS' FUNDS WOULD HELP BUY STOCK  </P> <P> May Department Stores Co. said Tuesday that it is exploring the possibility of  selling its Caldor and Venture discount chains.  </P> <P> Divesting the two general merchandise discounters would enable the retailer to  more easily pursue its intention to concentrate on its department store and  shoe businesses.  </P> <P> "The divestiture of Caldor and Venture will allow May to focus on the  operations and expansion of our higher-return and faster-growing businesses,"  said David C. Farrell, May chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> May, one of the largest retailers in the country and owner of Lord &amp;  Taylor, Hecht's, Sibley's, plus other department stores and specialty shoe  chains, including the May Co. in Southern California, said it anticipates using  a significant portion of the proceeds from a possible sale to buy back its  stock.  </P> <P> The company's stock closed Tuesday up $1.75 at $41.875 in New York Stock  Exchange trading.  </P> <P> The remainder of any sale proceeds would be spent on general corporate  purposes, including investment in the department store operations and shoe  businesses, the company said in a news release.  </P> <P> May management has been working to restore Caldor to higher levels of  profitability and had recently expressed optimism about Caldor's prospects.  </P> <P> Caldor, which operates in the Northeast, was taken over by May in 1986 as part  of its acquisition of Associated Dry Goods. Caldor's operating earnings were  $50 million in 1988 on sales of $1.6 billion.  </P> <P> May launched Venture in 1970. It operates in the Midwest and last year had  operating income of $81 million on sales of $1.3 billion.  </P> <P> Both Venture and May sell a range of items including hard line goods, such as  appliances, and soft line goods, such as clothing.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Hays, May's president, described Caldor and Venture as two  "well-positioned businesses with excellent management and committed  associates."  </P> <P> As a condition of any sale, May will insist on provisions regarding jobs,  compensation and benefits for Caldor's and Venture's employees.  </P> <P> Retail industry analysts had expected that May eventually would shed Caldor and  Venture.  </P></p>

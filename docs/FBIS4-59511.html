			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Meron Benvenisti: "Agreement of Surrender"] </F>   [Text] Now that the noise of the festivities saluting the  Gaza and Jericho First agreement has abated and the expressions  of ridicule regarding Yasir 'Arafat's buffoonery have been  thoroughly exhausted, the time has come to ponder the cause of  all this celebration and decide which party ought to be  rejoicing. A perusal of the agreement's hundreds of pages  leaves no doubt as to who stands to lose and who stands to gain  from the deal. Through the hundreds of lumbering, ambiguous,  and petty nit-picking clauses, subclauses, addenda, and  protocols, the total Israeli victory and complete Palestinian  defeat are clearly visible.    Minister Shulamit Aloni found the courage to mar the doves'  rejoicing on the very first morning after the signing of the  agreement: "Had the British written in so many restrictions,  the State of Israel would not have been established," she said.  It was an understatement, because (to use the same metaphor)  the "British" have not left and the nation that is under  occupation has, with its signature, legitimized the conqueror's  continued presence.    The peace camp is celebrating and the right wing is  screaming, but it can safely be assumed that were Menahem Begin  among us today, he would have signed the Gaza-Jericho agreement  with only minor adjustments, because this agreement represents  the successful implementation of the formulas Israel had  proposed during the autonomy negotiations -- formulas that were  rejected at that time. It is safe to assume that several  veterans of the frustrating negotiations held 14 years ago  attended the recent signing ceremony, and their contempt for  Yasir 'Arafat stemmed not only from his televised contortions  but also from the fact that the Palestinians acquiesced on some  very substantive issues which the Egyptians had refused to cede.    It is hard to tell what the Palestinians would have achieved  had they not rejected the Camp David accords, and it is easy to  understand the disappointment and rage of the territories  leaders, who have realized the magnitude of their disgrace. Had  the Israeli leaders not considered the phased implementation of  the Declaration of Principles [DOP] so important, they should  have rushed to implement it throughout the West Bank: They will  never get a better agreement in terms of safeguarding their  political and economic interests.    To gauge the Israeli success in implementing the 1981  autonomy plan, one should read the article Yo'el Singer  published in HA'ARETZ almost two years ago (31 July 1992), over  a year before the DOP was signed. Singer described at length  the Israeli proposals drafted by him at the instruction of  Defense Minister Ari'el Sharon and outlined what Israel wanted  to achieve in terms of "withdrawal," "redeployment," "source of  authority," Israeli-Palestinian distribution of powers, the  definition of "settlement areas," and the evacuation of Israelis  from the "self-rule authority's" jurisdiction. All these  proposals were rejected by Egypt: "They maintained that the  autonomy authorities should rule throughout the geographic  outlines of the territories and over all the people living in  them, including the Israeli settlers and settlements. The  Egyptians added that an Israeli presence in the territories is  illegal."    Fourteen years after their introduction, the proposals have  been fully implemented. According to the agreement, the  "security annex," which permits free IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  troop movement and the continued existence of a "military  installation" and areas of "security importance," expresses the  "full implementation" of the "withdrawal" and "redeployment."  This wording complies with the Israeli interpretation of  Security Council Resolution 242. The military government's  "withdrawal" will not prevent it from exercising powers detailed  in the Cairo agreement. These powers -- unbelievable as it is --  include "legislative, judicial, and executive powers and  responsibilities, in accordance with international law."    Thus, Gaza and Jericho continue to be under military  occupation, and the Palestinians agree that the IDF's withdrawal  does not nullify its status as sovereign and does not even  restrict this status to the settlement areas. The Palestinians  even agree that the entire complex system of military government  orders, extralegal [last word published in English]  arrangements, and extraterritorial legislation by the Israeli  Knesset, which annexed the settlements and converted them and  their inhabitants into an integral part of the Israeli system,  will remain intact.    The existing legal framework, therefore, will remain in  force, except for powers "to promulgate legislation, including  basic laws, laws, regulations, and other legislative acts,"  which have been transferred to the Palestinian authority, as  long as those actions are acceptable to Israel, because if they  are not, it has the right to annul them via a venerable body of  judges, which will be authorized to approve the legislative acts  only if they do "not seriously threaten other significant  Israeli interests protected under this (Gaza-Jericho) agreement."    Only in one area is there no restriction on the  Palestinians'  authority: their responsibility for all the commitments and all  the actions and slipups that took place prior to the transfer of  powers. Israel will cease to bear financial responsibility for  its acts and omissions during the years of occupation, and any  claims against it will be sent to the Palestinian authority.  Add to that the economic appendix, which leaves Israel in a  dominant position, and Israel's ability to execute physical  changes and unilaterally determine arrangements within the  territory it holds, which will have a decisive impact on the two  small enclaves, and the conclusion becomes absolutely clear:  The Cairo agreement does not contain anything to prevent its  adoption by all the political camps -- coalition and opposition  alike.    All the glittering props -- uniforms, flags, passports, and  stamps -- which irritated the right wing so much, cannot hide  the fact that "Gaza and Jericho First" serves to legitimize the  continuation of the status quo in its basic outlines.    It is difficult to say why Yasir 'Arafat gave in to all the  Israeli demands. Was it due to his weakness, a lack of staff  work, the purge of the "local" leaders who understand the  situation, or does 'Arafat view the entire agreement with  disdain and believe that reality will ground this entire legal  set up? After all, all colonial occupation forces withdrew from  the territories under their rule only after signing detailed  agreements with the national liberation movements. But the  agreements between the Americans and the Vietnamese, between the  French and the Algerians, turned into nothing more than a dead  letter because, from the start, they were merely meant to save  face. That might turn out to be the situation here as well, but  that optimistic forecast cannot deny the irony: The late Menahem  Begin's autonomy plan will be implemented by a dovish peace  government.</p>

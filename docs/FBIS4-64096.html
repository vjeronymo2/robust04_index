			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Alexandru Beleavschi dispatch from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Today the president of the Republic of Moldova,  Mircea Snegur, received Romania's ambassador to Chisinau, Marian  Enache, upon the latter's request.    Following their talks, Mr. Enache made the following brief  statement:    [Begin Enache recording] In my assessment, the talks I held  with President Mircea Snegur were substantial and positive. We  approached, in a constructive spirit, the relations, on the  whole, between Romania and the Republic of Moldova.    Basically, we expressed our readiness, and even more, I  would  say the necessity to genuinely revive the ties between our  states, to amplify our contacts and the furthering, on all  planes, of our sincere opinions regarding our bilateral ties, as  well as the finalization of a number of concrete economic  actions of mutual interest.    We also emphasized the need to maintain a continuous  dialogue  between the state power institutions of the two countries.  Concretely speaking, a new conference is to take place soon in  Galati regarding the traffic of passengers over the border  crossing points on the Prut River, intended to better satisfy  the needs of our economic companies and our citizens.  Similarly, there is a possibility to organize, under good  circumstances, a conference of the inter-ministerial committees  in Chisinau, with the support of the leadership of the Republic  of Moldova.    Similarly, significant political contacts are being  anticipated at top level, at government level, besides other  working meetings.    During our talks President Mircea Snegur expressed the  sincere wish of the leadership of the Republic of Moldova to  further relations with Romania, thus contradicting certain  opinions according to which a certain coolness could be  perceived lately in the relations between our countries.    Personally, I remain optimistic with respect to the  rapprochement and the cooperation between our two states, as it  is quite obvious that the things that unite us are stronger than  certain more or less aleatoric circumstances.

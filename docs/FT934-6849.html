			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Education - mixed ability assessment must be fair Sir, As we have advised parents for many years and are increasingly being consulted by companies on the educational options best suited to their families, we are acutely aware of the A-level league table dilemma highlighted by Peter Gallie, headmaster of the John Taylor High School (Letters, November 15). With about 35 per cent of students changing institute or school at 16, some schools may aim to improve their A-level ratings by rejecting entries from marginal students or insisting that they enter as private candidates. It is for this reason that the Conference of Independent Further Education has asked us to audit all their members' A-level returns before they are released to the press and potential students. The government has made an important contribution to raising standards by insisting on a core curriculum and the publication of exam results. The next essential stage is the measurement of added value so that schools that are good with mixed ability pupils are assessed fairly. This could be achieved through changes in the brief of school inspectors and we, like other independent organisations, are considering bidding for inspection contracts if we can be sure that academic and traditional achievement criteria, rather than politically correct standards, are the ones being inspected and assessed.

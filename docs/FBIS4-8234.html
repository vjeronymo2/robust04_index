			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Note of Protest of the Albanian Government"] </F>   [Text] Tirana, April 11 (ATA) -- On April 10, 1994, at  about 2.30 a.m., a unit of 6-7 armed Greek terroristic  commandos, among whom one who spoke Albanian with a Greek  accent, entered the Albanian territory in the vicinity of  Peshkepi village in the Gjirokaster district. At a distance of  four kilometres from the border, in a military training centre,  two of the group killed the soldier Arsen Llazar Gjini, 20  years, from the Seman village, Fier. After that, four others  rushed into the bedroom of the officers and opened fire against  some officers who were sleeping. As a result, the training  chief officer, first captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, 34 years old,  was killed. Shehu was born in Tepelena and lived in  Gjirokaster. Three soldiers were also wounded and many others  had injuries. During these terrorist acts, one of them screamed  in Greek: "You have this for the north Epirus. Don't think we  have forgotten".    After this act, the commandos, followed by Albanian border  forces left passing the Greek border. Traces of the commandos  led to the Greek border point of Argjirohor.    All the environments of this ugly crime makes one think that  its was a deliberate criminal act of the Greek special forces,  for which the Greek Government bears all responsibility. The  act is a grave violation of the Albanian state's sovereignty,  which the Albanian Government denounces before the Greek  Government as well as before the governments of other countries  and international organisations. The Albanian Government will  make known this act to other states and international  organisations and ask them to put pressure on the Greek  Government to put an end to these criminal acts, which have very  dangerous aims against peace and stability in our region. They  are part of the strategy and destabilization of the Balkans and  intend to stir up tension in its south.    In a strong protest against this mean terrorist act, the  Albanian Government asks the Greek Government to find out the  authors of the crime and punish them publicly. Otherwise, it  will bear all responsibility resulting from the consequences of  this grave terrorist act which runs counter to all international  acts that guarantee inviolability of sovereignty and regulate  relations between countries.</p>

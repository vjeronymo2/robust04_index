			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] We have just received another report from  Gorazde. In addition to fierce attacks on Gorazde, its unarmed  civilians and brave defenders of the town, the chetniks have  also been attacking the UN military observers in the town. UN  military observers were attacked by the chetniks at about 1700  in the Jabuka Sedlo mountain pass area while they were  inspecting the demarcation lines in the area. According to  unconfirmed reports, the chetniks killed one UN monitor and  seriously wounded a translator in this perfidious assassination.  [passage omitted]</p>

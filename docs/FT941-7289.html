			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Driving too hard a bargain endangers audit standards Sir, I read with interest your article, 'Auditing the auditors' (Management, February 7). Certainly management should ensure that it receives full value in exchange for a reasonable fee for audit services. However, the Public Oversight Board, which oversees the peer review programme of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in the US, is concerned that unduly harsh bargaining with regard to audit fees may result, and, according to information we have received, has resulted in auditors taking measures to reduce the amount of work done in connection with audits. This has led to a consequent lowering of the quality of such audits. In our report of March 5 1993, we strongly urged that boards of directors and audit committees resist the temptation to drive the hardest possible bargain lest they damage the quality of the audits they received.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rap to float with likely Pounds 17m tag Two former BTR directors are bringing a rubber and plastics distributor to the market next month which is expected to be valued at about Pounds 17m. Rap, which distributes industrial products such as hoses, gloves, gaskets and uniforms, is hoping to raise about Pounds 4.6m in an institutional placing. About Pounds 2.1m of the net proceeds will be used to redeem preference shares and the balance will provide working capital to fund expansion largely through acquisition. Rap's chief executive is Mr David Emmett, former general manager and director of BTR Farington, and joint leader of Rap's management buy-out from Haden MacLellan Holdings in 1991. He is joined on the board by Mr Lionel Stammers, former joint head of BTR's European division, who is a non-executive director. Since the buy-out, Rap has increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 496,000 in 1991 to Pounds 1.22m in 1993. Sales have risen in the same period from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 19.3m. However, the sharp rise in profits and sales was helped in part by acquisitions in 1993. In its pathfinder prospectus published yesterday, the group forecast pre-tax profits for 1994 of not less than Pounds 1.7m. The company said sales had increased largely because of greater activity in its market sectors. Margins had improved through operating efficiencies. Rap trades from 23 outlets, which are mainly close to industrial areas. Its businesses include distribution of industrial and safety products, supply and servicing of conveyor belts and import and wholesale of gloves.</p>

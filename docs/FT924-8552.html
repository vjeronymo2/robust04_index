			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (5): Unexploded bombs - Tighter rules give insurers a headache BRITISH INSURERS are reappraising the potential dangers of claims for environmental pollution in the light of shifts in the legal situation at home and the experience of the US industry, where large chunks of the insurance industry could be brought to the brink of insolvency by multi-billion dollar claims. But the change may be too little and too late according to critics who suggest pollution claims could be catastrophic for the UK industry. The exposure of UK insurers to pollution is principally through public liability policies, which cover the policyholder against any damage a third party might suffer because of pollution which results from his actions. Historically insurers have faced very few pollution claims. Philip Bell, liability insurance manager with Sun Alliance, which sells 15 to 20 per cent of public liability policies, says his company receives fewer than 100 a year. Although Sun Alliance has 'a couple of million pound claims in the pipeline' most claims are very much smaller. 'The sort of thing that normally happens is that a chimney will belch out dust which will damage cars in an adjacent car park,' says Mr Bell. However, the establishment of a more rigorous regime of pollution control and remediation in the UK is a cause for concern. In the past two years a raft of new legislation has radically redefined the liabilities faced by operators and owners of polluted sites. The 1990 Environmental Protection Act and 1991 Water Resources Act establish a legal framework in which the occupiers of a site are liable for the cost of clean up irrespective of fault. Under this legislation bankers foreclosing on a loan to a property company could become liable for the cost of cleaning up contamination. In a recent case Leeds City Council ordered more than 600 householders to pay the Pounds 5m bill needed to clean up asbestos contamination from their houses, even though this had been caused by an asbestos factory which closed in 1958. Moves by the European Community are expected to reinforce this trend towards strict liability. UK government plans to make more information about pollution available to the public through the register of contaminated land could also trigger court actions. The value of land identified as contaminated on the register is likely to fall. Mr Brian Street, a specialist with ECS Underwriting in London, says the new law will 'greatly increase the power of pressure groups to bring civil proceedings. It will cause all hell to let loose.' In the face of these threats British insurers moved to restrict coverage last April. After advice from the Association of British Insurers, most companies changed the wordings of public liability policies to exclude coverage for gradual pollution. The new policies restrict coverage to 'a sudden, identifiable, unintended and unexpected incident which takes place in its entirety at a specific time and place during the period of insurance'. Even so, insurers are still liable for claims made on policies written in the past. Most policies were written on what insurers call an 'occurrence' wording in which the relevant policy for a claim is the one which covers the year when the event occurred. US courts have also ruled that policyholders can claim on all their insurance policies stretching back to the original point at which pollution is deemed to have begun. Much of the multi-billion bill for US pollution clean-up, therefore, could ultimately fall on insurance companies who sold policies in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Mr Randolph Fields, a lawyer who has developed a thriving business in researching insurance coverages, is confident he can locate the coverage. Recalling that the UK industry underwrote unrestricted pollution liability coverage in 'carte blanche' fashion between 1930 and 1990, he warned of liabilities of 'catastrophic proportions". British insurers tend to minimise the problem. In a memo to its members sent on October 13, the liability and accident committee of the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association, described Mr Fields' arguments as 'somewhat alarmist'. The ABI said it could 'prove difficult' for the policyholder to provide proof that insurance was in force at the particular time the incident was alleged to have taken place. 'Neither insurers nor policyholders might have kept documentation for the full period in question,' added the ABI. Another worrying possibility is that British courts might begin to interpret the wordings of public liability policies in a broader way than insurers originally intended. In the US, for example, most legal opinions have ruled that clean-ups ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency under the so-called Superfund legislation constitute insured damages under the terms of comprehensive general liability policies. Insurers can be presented with cost of environmental clean-up. 'I can't see a UK court going out of its way to interpret the policies totally against the written word,' says Mr Philip Bell, liability manager of Sun Alliance. Mr Bell dismisses the possibility that UK courts may interpret the wordings of public liability policies so that they cover the cost of ordered clean-up of contaminated sites from public liability policies. Certainly insurers who now offer pollution cover are taking no chances. A handful of insurers, including American International Group, Zurich Insurance, the Chemical Industries Association and ECS Underwriting, offer insurance against the risk of gradual pollution. ECS last month introduced a policy to include the recovery of costs for the clean-up of an operator's own site. Underwriting is highly selective. Claims must be made within the period of the policy. But all the companies make the policies dependent on the implementation of an environmental audit of the site to be insured. Subsequently policyholders are obliged to maintain a rigorous system of risk control and prevention.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Sub-underwriters 'reaped excess returns of Pounds 289m' Institutional investors earned 'excess returns' of about Pounds 289m by sub-underwriting new rights offerings for UK companies between 1986 and last year, says an Office of Fair Trading study released yesterday. The study of 691 rights issues, which raised Pounds 39.1bn, said excess returns may have been even higher - as much as Pounds 480m. Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School, who conducted the study, said the exact level of excess returns depended on how frequently one expected market crashes such as that in 1987 and whether sub-underwriters tried to hedge their positions. He said: 'From a public interest viewpoint, if sub-underwriting costs are excessive, the direct costs of raising equity capital are higher than they need be. This has an important bearing on the competitiveness not only of the issuing firms, but also of the financial services industry.' Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he would announce his conclusions about the report 'in the near future'. The OFT commissioned the report as part of its inquiry into whether a 'complex cartel' exists for commissions. It was concerned that underwriting fees have remained at the same level - 0.25 per cent to brokers, 0.5 per cent to the lead underwriter and 1.25 per cent to sub-underwriters - for at least 30 years. The London Investment Bankers Association, which represents merchant banks which arrange sub-underwriting, has argued that the speed with which rights issues are arranged precludes real negotiations about fees. Moreover, variations among the qualities of issuers and varying market conditions are reflected not in the fees but in the discount applied to each issue. Prof Marsh said there appeared relatively little variation in discounts at which new shares were issued in rights offerings. He said: 'If the fees were lowered or the discounts narrowed, then you could reach the conclusion that the system is fair.' The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the trade body for institutional investors, said its members did not view sub-underwriting as a profitable activity.</p>

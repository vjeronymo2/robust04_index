			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> ERVINS RETURNS, BUT ROYSTER PLAYS  </P> <P> Tailback Ricky Ervins returned to practice Monday for the first time since  spraining his left ankle on Sept. 29 against Ohio State, but sophomore Mazio  Royster is expected to start against Arizona Saturday at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> "His status is still unknown," Coach Larry Smith said of Ervins.  </P> <P> "I would say it's moved from possible to probable. (But) Mazio, as long as he's  healthy, will start. Ricky, hopefully, will be ready to play. And if he is, he  definitely will play some."  </P> <P> Freshmen Willie McGinest, Jason Oliver and Michael Jones will remain on the  team, Smith said, pending the outcome of criminal procedures. The three face  misdemeanor charges in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a  23-year-old female graduate student.  </P> <P> "I think if you suspend a person, you're saying they're guilty," Smith said. "I  don't think we can do that. We're not a judge and jury. It's best to let the  courts handle it."  </P> <P> Asked if USC is recruiting Corby Smith, his son and the starting quarterback at  Loyola High School, Smith said: "You'll have to talk to his mother."

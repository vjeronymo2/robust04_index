			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Money Markets: Trading calms again THE UK money market was calmer yesterday after frenzied dealing on Wednesday, as two new opinion polls contradicted those that had given the opposition Labour party a clear lead. Dealers said an inevitable mood of uncertainty hung over the market as it entered the final week before the general election on April 9, but that prices had already gone a long way towards discounting a Labour majority or hung parliament. The key three-month interbank rate eased slightly to 11 1/8 -11 per cent from 11 1/4 -11 1/8 on Wednesday. The six-month and one-year rates were also each down by  1/8 point to 11 1/4 -11 3/16 per cent and 11 5/16 -11 3/16 per cent respectively. Rates still reflected expectations of at least a half-point rise in the base rate, although analysts point out that historically, rises have tended to be at least a full point. June short sterling opened up eight basis points at 88.80, but later dropped back to 88.71 in fairly slow trading. Day-to-day funding was relatively cheap, despite a shortage forecast that was nearly twice what the market was expecting, with the Bank of England apparently seeking to foster comfortable credit conditions and alleviate pressure on the shorter interbank rates. The Bank forecast a shortage of around Pounds 800m, and acted early to plug the gap, purchasing a total of Pounds 725m, comprising Pounds 405m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 120m band 2 band bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent, as well as Pounds 200m for resale on April 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. Overnight rates dropped below 8 per cent as a result, and although the forecast was revised upwards to Pounds 850m at midday, with no further operations by the Bank, they firmed only to 9-8 1/2 per cent. The Bank again did not act in the afternoon, until it provided late assistance of Pounds 35m. This left around Pounds 90m of the shortage uncovered, pushing up overnight money to 10 1/2 -10 per cent towards the close. German call money rates rose close to the Bundesbank's emergency Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, after the bank removed a hefty DM9.4bn from the system with this week's securities repurchase transaction on Wednesday. Dealers quoted call money at 9.70/75 per cent, compared with 9.65/70 per cent the day before.</p>

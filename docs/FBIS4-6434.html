			<p>BFN     [Text] The Iraqi Government has requested the Indonesian  Government, which is a fellow member of the Organization of  Islamic Conference and chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, to  help end the UN economic sanctions against that country. The  sanctions are considered to be causing severe hardship to the  Iraqi people.    The request was presented by a delegation of Iraqi  parliamentarians led by its speaker, Sa'di Mahdi, to President  Suharto at the Merdeka Palace this morning. During the meeting,  the Iraqi speaker was accompanied by his Indonesian counterpart,  Wahono. Speaking to reporters later, Wahono said President  Suharto had given a positive response to the request and  promised to help end the sanctions.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont discomforts Major MR Norman Lamont, still smarting after his dismissal from the Treasury, discomforted the prime minister and delighted the opposition benches in the Commons yesterday by highlighting the success of the policies with which he was associated as chancellor, Ivor Owen writes. Labour MPs did their utmost to underline Mr John Major's embarrassment as Mr Lamont cited 'the catalogue of good economic indicators' which was now being enthusiastically trumpeted by his former cabinet colleagues. As he did so Labour backbenchers shouted the one question Mr Lamont declined to put: 'Why was I sacked?' With heavy irony Mr Lamont contented himself with asking the prime minister to congratulate Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as chancellor 'on the rapid success of his policies'. The House was convulsed in glee, with even Mr Clarke, on the government front bench, grinning broadly. Mr Major replied: 'I know the chancellor will be most grateful for your support of his policies'.</p>

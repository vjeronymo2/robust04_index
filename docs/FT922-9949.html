			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / European Government Bonds: Low-yielding D-Mark bloc falls out of favour PERFORMANCE figures for April show that European government bond markets experienced sharp reversals of fortune during the month. In particular, the low-yielding markets clustered around Germany - known as the 'D-Mark bloc' - fell out of favour, while high-yielding markets continued to rise against expectations. At the turn of the year, portfolio investors were starting to commit funds to German bonds, often switching out of higher-yielding markets which were seen as due for a correction. Many believed German interest rates would be cut in the first quarter to stimulate a flagging economy, with inflationary pressures firmly squeezed out and bond prices rising. There have been disappointments in both respects. Although consumer price data released last week showed inflation in western Germany slowing to a year-on-year rate of 4.5 per cent in April, from 4.8 per cent in March, money supply growth remains stubbornly high. In addition, the current round of disputes has renewed fears that wage inflation will spread through the economy. The Bundesbank now looks unlikely to ease monetary policy until the second half of the year. As a result, the German market returned a miserly 0.44 per cent during April, according to the JP Morgan government bond index monitor - the worst performing bond market within the European Community. The rest of the D-Mark bloc managed to out-perform Germany, with yield spreads narrowing by 10-20 basis points, but were held back. In contrast, high yielding European markets showed the best returns on the month. The best performing European markets were the UK (with a total return of 4.5 per cent), Portuguese (2.19 per cent), and Spanish (1.34 per cent) markets. However, further gains by the high-yielding markets will be hard-won. The price rises last month were due in most cases to one-off boosts. Indeed, prices have risen so swiftly in some higher-yielding European markets that institutions are again wary of committing new funds. The UK gilts market is a prime example of this. The yield spread between the gilts and German bund market at the benchmark 10-year maturity narrowed from nearly 200 basis points to less than 120 basis points during April. Although the government managed to sell Pounds 2.5bn new bonds last week, institutional investors were questioning whether gilts offer 'relative value' at current levels. Looking ahead, the progress of high yielding bond markets depends on the ability of governments to stem inflation. So far the progress has been good and bond prices have risen in union. Equally, the UK government's determination to bring inflation down will have to remain credible if bond prices are to rise further. Italy and Spain are in a similar position. In contrast, there is little doubt about the determination of the German authorities, in the shape of the fiercely independent Bundesbank, to bring inflation under control. Consistently high interest rates mean that bond market investors have not seen the early gains they expected - April was a vivid illustration of this  - but still hold the promise of big gains ahead.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: ERM: what should investors do now? - Philip Coggan asks fund managers how they see the outlook forthose putting money into Europe's equity and bond markets THE COLLAPSE of Europe's exchange rate mechanism last weekend was an event which seemed more exciting in the build-up than in the aftermath. Currencies are now allowed to trade within 15 per cent bands, rather than the old 2.5 per cent range, but many countries have yet to take advantage of their new-found freedom. Rather like the salesman of Monty Python's Norwegian parrot, Europe's leaders seem to believe the ERM is not really dead, just stunned. Although their countries' economies appear to cry out for the soothing balm of an interest rate cut, currency stability still appears to be the priority. As a consequence, all the talk of a bonanza for British holiday-makers was premature. Compared with Thursday of last week, a pound would have bought on Thursday night 0.8 per cent more French francs, 0.7 per cent more Danish krone, 0.6 per cent more Italian lire, and 0.5 per cent more Belgian francs. But it was also worth 0.7 per cent fewer German marks, 1.5 per cent fewer Portuguese escudos, and 1.7 per cent fewer Spanish pesetas. So, if you rushed to France with Pounds 500 spending money, you would be Pounds 4 better off than you were a week ago: good enough, perhaps, to get you a cup of coffee and a croissant in a Paris bar. What about investors? When Britain left the ERM last September, the stock market rallied sharply as they realised the government was no longer shackled to the high interest rate policy of the Germans. Base rates have been reduced from 10 per cent to 6 per cent and the UK economy has shown signs of recovery. Could there be a similar effect in Europe? Investor euphoria has been distinctly muted so far. Whereas the FT-SE 100 index rose 9 per cent in the week after Black Wednesday, by Thursday night the French index was only 3.8 per cent higher and the FT Europe (ex-UK) index climbed just 2.2 per cent. We asked fund managers about their views on the effect of the ERM change on equity and bond market investors . . . Anthony Bolton, who manages Fidelity's European fund: 'The medium-term case for equities is still good. European stock markets have lagged the rest of the world. But the situation is quite unlike when we left the ERM. That was unexpected, whereas people have been expecting change in the ERM for some time. 'Politicians have been made to look like puppets in recent days and they may want to re-assert themselves, so rates may not come down for a couple of weeks. 'We continue to prefer the peripheral markets such as Italy and Scandinavia and, in particular, Norway, one of the only markets where you're seeing some real growth in Europe.' Jim Campbell, of Ivory &amp; Sime, who manages the Continental Assets investment trust: 'We recall the UK situation in 1992 where interest rates came down sharply and the market quickly discounted the impact. This year, the market has stood still as earnings have tried to catch up. 'In Europe, the markets have already discounted the benefits of lower rates and price-earnings ratios are very high in France and Germany. We tend to favour the Scandinavian markets and Italy, which were early devaluers and will see the benefits come through sooner than France and Germany.' Sally Tennant, manager of the Gartmore European investment trust: 'Governments haven't yet taken in the full implications of what the wider bands mean. 'Economic fundamentals have caused the collapse of the ERM and those will cause rate changes, whether it is over the next weeks or months. There is greater scope for real rates to fall in France; their cost base is better and they have companies that are very operationally geared for an upturn in volumes. 'In Germany, a lot has been anticipated and the market is taking on trust much of the rationalisation which will be needed.' Stephen Peak, manager of the TR European Growth investment trust: 'All is now focused on interest rates and whether somebody tries to break ranks and salvage their economy by cutting rates sharply. Stock markets are discounting some fall in short-term rates but not aggressive reductions. 'We have been underweight in Germany for some time, with a holding of below 10 per cent against an index weighting of 22-23 per cent. We are stock selection-orientated and it is relatively more difficult to find value among German stocks compared with the French, Spanish, Italian or Swedish markets. 'We wouldn't be chasing blue chips in the short term but share prices of smaller companies have lagged, as they usually do, and offer better value.' Peter Geikie-Cobb, who runs Mercury's Global Bond unit trusts, notes that European governments still seem very keen to keep their currencies within their old ERM bands. 'The longer this goes on, the better it is for the bond market because it will be very damaging for the European economy. What the continental Europeans haven't yet learned is that the UK has had very little inflationary impact from the pound's devaluation. 'We have been buying European bonds and hedging them into dollars. We have 16 per cent of the portfolio in Spanish bonds, where the peseta has been devalued heavily with very little effect on inflation, 10 per cent in France, 24 per cent in the UK and 14 per cent in Holland, which has the stability of the D-mark without the costs of reunification. 'Unemployment is high across Europe and wage pressures are, accordingly, very low. Inflation is not much of a threat for the next two to three years. 'Bond markets represent as good value as they did two to three years ago, because all that has happened is that nominal bond yields have fallen in line with inflation; real yields have remained high.' Howard Flight, of Guinness Flight: 'The main practical economic implications of the events of the past 10 days are that interest rates elsewhere in Europe can now be reduced substantially in accordance with economic needs, irrespective of whether or not the Bundesbank reduces German rates. 'We can, therefore, expect French and Italian, and probably Spanish, short-term interest rates to fall by 2 or 3 per cent more by the end of the year. 'This is why European equity markets have reacted positively, as they are now able to perceive a route to economic recovery from lower interest rates. Inflation is likely to reduce further, permitting European bond markets to strengthen further as short term interest rates fall. 'The extent of D-mark strength against other European currencies is likely to be limited and of relatively short duration. The real economic problems facing Germany are considerably worse than those elsewhere in Europe. 'Sooner or later, Germany is likely to face a major currency crisis. The abandonment of the ERM bands may have postponed this by six to nine months but, when it comes, it is likely to be worse than otherwise, to the extent that Germany's uncompetitive economic patterns will worsen further.'</p>

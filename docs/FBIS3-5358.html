Mr. and Mrs. Araj wrote a letter to the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il, asking him to give a name to their second child  born at the Pyongyang maternity hospital.    Upon receiving the letter, Comrade Kim Chong-il named the  baby "Solmae," wishing him to grow in good health with a strong  will and principle unyielding to any adversity.    A ceremony took place at the Palestinian embassy Saturday to  convey the loving care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for Solmae.    A souvenir sent by Comrade Kim Chong-il was handed to the  parents of Solmae amid a loud applause of the participants.    Addressing the ceremony, the Palestinian ambassador  expressed  heartfelt thanks to his excellency the dear leader Kim Chong-il,  who had once named a Palestinian girl "Jindallae," for naming  the baby Solmae this time.    The father of Solmae spoke next.    Noting that his excellency Kim Chong-il with extraordinary  leadership ability gave a name to his son, he said this greatly  encourages the fighting Palestinian people. He vowed to fight  with strong will and braveness for the victory of the common  cause of Palestine and Korea.    He said he would bring up Solmae to be strong as wished by  his excellency the dear leader Kim Chong-il.    He asked a Korean official concerned to convey a gift  carrying his family's best wishes for longevity to his  excellency Kim Chong- il.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Aerospace groups launch competitiveness campaign The Society of British Aerospace Companies yesterday launched a campaign to improve competitiveness. The initiative flows from the Department of Trade and Industry's white paper on competition, and is similar to that already launched in the motor industry. Mr Tim Eggar, industry minister, opened the scheme at a seminar in London. The campaign is supported by large companies such as British Aerospace, GEC and Rolls-Royce. The society's Competitiveness Challenge encourages aerospace manufacturers to share information about best industry practice and to co-operate to deepen understanding between component suppliers and the big assembling companies. It will use seminars, workshops and self-assessment questionnaires to help companies understand where their advantages and problems lie. As well as the 200 members of the society, the information will be open to 800 other companies in allied fields which are being encouraged to join the campaign. The scheme is intended to be self-financing, with companies being charged for access to the information. The DTI has earmarked an annual grant of Pounds 55,000 a year. The aerospace industry has improved its balance of trade surplus in the past decade, a distinction shared only by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.</p>

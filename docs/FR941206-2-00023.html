The decisions included in this SROD have been made in consideration of the Mather AFB Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and released to the public on April February 18, 1994, and other relevant considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mather AFB was closed on September 30, 1994. This SROD finalizes the Mather AFB disposal decisions begun with the issuance of the Record of Decision for the Disposal Reuse of Mather AFB on March 31, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major methods which will be utilized to dispose of the approximate 5,716 acre base are: public airport conveyance (approximately 2,875 acres), public park conveyance (approximately 1,432 acres), and public or negotiated sale (approximately 899 acres <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are consistent with the community's redevelopment plan for the base. The ROD announced that any potential environmental impacts would result directly from reuse and redevelopment by others. Likewise, most of the mitigation of environmental impacts would be the responsibility of future owners and developers. The Air Force has tried to take all practical measures to avoid or minimize environmental harm that may occur as a result of its disposal action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John P. Carr, Program Manager, Northwest Region. Correspondence should be sent to AFBCA/NW, 1700 N. Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Patsy J.

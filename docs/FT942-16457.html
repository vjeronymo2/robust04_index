			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Knight takes a tilt at the markets: Dominic Lawson hears the voice of doom on his radio and asks who is making the news and why? People who insist on listening to the news on a bank holiday should perhaps not expect very much in the way of enlightenment. I imagine that BBC radio's newsdesk is more than usually depleted on public holidays, and those who are working are probably not very happy to be there. All the same, I was still caught quite unawares by the announcement which headed the Radio 4 8am news last Easter Monday: 'Share prices in London,' the voice said, 'are expected to fall sharply when the market re-opens tomorrow, on fears of a stronger than expected rise in the US economy.' Now, I do not care very much for 'news' bulletins which tell me what might - and, therefore, what might not - happen tomorrow. Call me old-fashioned but I regard that sort of thing as opinion, not news. But my gast was also flabbered by the apparent reason for this expected 'news': the great surge in the US economy. Again, I might be behind the times, but I was always taught that a strong US economy was good for Britain and, therefore, the London stock market because Britain's balance of trade would benefit from increasing exports to its former colony. But let us not always blame the BBC. It was, after all, only parrotting what was already in the newspapers. The Sunday Times on April 3 had led its business section with the banner headline 'Markets fear selling frenzy'. And in turn, the Sunday Times was only repeating what someone else was saying. We are getting close to the source of all this gloom now: Nick Knight, chief equity strategist at the London branch of Nomura, the biggest Japanese investment house. According to the Sunday Times: 'On Thursday, after London had closed for Easter, (Knight) faxed his clients a deeply disturbing note predicting that Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Index will fall by 400 points to 3,200 and London's FT-SE index by 300 points to 2800.' What Knight's clients were expected to do with this information while the markets closed over Easter is something of a mystery. Panic, I suppose. Or perhaps not. After all, Knight predicted earlier in the year that the FT-SE index would rise to 4,000 by the year-end. Average that with the revised prophecy of 2,800 and you probably get a comforting middle-of-the-range-figure that Nomura clients could live with. I am told that Knight's boss in Tokyo keeps in his desk a Xeroxed photograph of Knight's smiling face surrounded, in the manner of crazily orbiting moons around a planet, by a plotted graph of Knight's differing forecasts of the international stock markets. So Knight's boss would not have panicked when he saw his London man's 'deeply disturbing fax' predicting 'quasi-crashes' in London and New York. But the Sunday Times and the BBC, not to mention their audiences, who had not got the benefit of seeing the humorous diagram lying in an important desk in Nomura's Tokyo office, could not be so sanguine. Perhaps those poor saps, the small investors who faithfully read the Sunday Times business section or listen to the BBC's financial 'news,' rushed to their telephones on Tuesday morning and told their brokers to sell, sell, sell. And perhaps, on the next morning, they picked up their copy of the Financial Times to read on the front page: 'US stocks and bonds rise sharply' and, for good measure, that 'the FT-SE index closed up 29.8 at 3116.2.' Yes, the BBC 'news' got it wrong. They believed the Sunday Times. The Sunday Times believed Nick Knight. And what of Knight's clients, the myriad heavy-hitting Japanese institutional investors who make up Nomura's client list? I would not be surprised if they were among the people mopping up the stock being sold by smaller investors who were panicked by a BBC news bulletin based on a forecast prepared originally for quite a different audience. These institutional clients are now sitting on a nice little profit, to be translated into yen at the appropriate moment. And when will that be? When the BBC leads a bank holiday bulletin with the 'news' that a run on the Japanese currency is expected on the following day. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

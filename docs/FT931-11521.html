			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Parcelling up the Post Office THE IDEA of privatising the UK Post Office seems to be taking on a dangerous life of its own. It began innocently enough, with the government's proposal last year to sell off the parcels division. Since this business operates in a highly competitive market without monopoly protection, that seemed sensible. The snag is that parcels lose money, as do the post offices themselves. The only profitable and attractive bit of the operation is the Royal Mail, which enjoys a monopoly on letters below a certain price. The notion has thus gradually taken hold of selling the whole enterprise in a lump, raising some Pounds 2bn in the process. This risks repeating a classic error of the 1980s. The issue of monopoly power should be resolved before privatisation is begun, not tacked on as an afterthought. To privatise the Royal Mail as it stands and then send in a regulator is to beg a whole range of questions about its structure, powers and social obligations. Nor is there an urgent need for change; the Royal Mail provides a world-class service, broadly satisfies the public and is, by public sector standards, well managed. One argument for privatisation has a certain force. The Royal Mail operates in a broader communications market, competing against telecoms, faxes and information technology generally. This is a highly capital-intensive, competitive world, in which the old-fashioned letter post risks becoming obsolete. If the Royal Mail cannot invest to compete, it will lose the volume which enables it to hold down its prices and thus enter a spiral of decline. And in the public sector it is not free to borrow, since that would count towards the government's budget deficit. But in fact, the Post Office scarcely needs to borrow, since it generates vast sums of cash through its operations. The snag is that the money is confiscated by the Treasury: Pounds 750m in the past decade, with another Pounds 181m to come in the next fiscal year alone. If the government is being too greedy, perhaps the Post Office needs protection. If so, to install a regulator to mediate between it and the Treasury would be a more sensible first step than privatising it out of hand and sending a regulator in afterwards. Similar logic applies in the case of the post office counters. These are highly sensitive politically, since half of them are loss-making and all of them perform a social function. But the losses are at least partly the result of arbitrary restriction by government. Legally, the post offices can only handle transactions for government departments and the formerly public utilities. They can do business for British Telecom or Thames Water, but not for Marks and Spencer or Barclays Bank. An economically important resource is thus denied the opportunity to run on commercial lines. Change might well occur most effectively under privatisation but should not be impossible without it. This is not to deny the proposition that a commercial undertaking should justify its place within the public sector, rather than the other way round. The question is rather what role the Post Office should be expected to play as a private entity and how it could then be exposed to competition. Private sector monopolies are to be avoided.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGHWAY DEER KILLS ARE PROBLEM FOR STATES;  </P> <P> WILDLIFE: AS MANY AS 350,000 DEER DIE EACH YEAR ON AMERICA'S ROADS. LAST YEAR,  131 PEOPLE DIED IN SUCH COLLISIONS; DAMAGES AND CLEANUP COSTS ARE IN THE  MILLIONS.  </P> <P> Thousands of times each day, a white-tailed deer comes nose to grille with a  motor vehicle, often with disastrous results.  </P> <P> And not just to the deer, though as many as 350,000 deer die each year on  America's roads. Last year, 131 people died in collisions with animals, and  damages and the costs of cleaning up total in the millions of dollars.  </P> <P> Wildlife and highway officials say there's no simple way to keep the creatures  and man from colliding on the nation's roads.  </P> <P> A growing deer population -- there are now 16 million to 18 million  white-tailed deer in the United States and Canada -- and "human sprawl" is  forcing traffic engineers and wildlife officials to seek ways to keep the  animals off the road.  </P> <P> "It's a fairly severe problem, particularly if it's your car that's been hit,"  said Richard McCabe of the Wildlife Management Institute in Washington.  </P> <P> "The problem is that with concentrated deer populations, particularly in states  such as Pennsylvania and northern Wisconsin that are semi-mountainous, you have  highways that intersect travel routes of deer," he said.  </P> <P> In West Virginia, the death rate grew from 2,660 deer in 1979 to 6,326 in 1989.  The typical animal that was struck caused about $1,300 in damage, said Roger  Russell of the state Division of Highways.  </P> <P> Pennsylvania, which has a deer population of more than 1.5 million, spends  about $8 million each year to collect dead deer off the roads, said state Game  Commission spokesman Ted Godshall.  </P> <P> Game officers picked up more than 40,000 deer carcasses from the highways last  year; they are given to needy families, fed to fish or buried.  </P> <P> "I know that it takes a minimum of two hours to pick up a deer, and they  usually have to drive 50 miles or more," Godshall said. "It can take two or  three hours of an officer's time. It's a tremendous bill."  </P> <P> The remedies for road kills are varied. Among them is more careful planning of  where roads go; re-examination of grasses and shrubs planted along roads;  dispensing with salt as a way of ridding roads of ice, because deer like salt;  and more warning signs.  </P> <P> Colorado and Pennsylvania are considering rerouting deer over and under major  thoroughfares, McCabe said. This seems "to have some benefits, but of course  deer populations can change," he said. "Underpasses and overpasses are fairly  expensive propositions if you don't know whether the deer are going to move."  </P> <P> Fences, by all accounts the most effective remedy, also are expensive, costing  as much as $200,000 a mile. A more recent solution, wildlife warning  reflectors, costs $7,000 per mile.  </P> <P> "The reflectors light up and set up an unnatural moving light pattern, which  scares the deer," said John Strieter, president of Strieter Corp., which sells  the reflectors. "We don't know what's going on in the deer's head, but  eyewitnesses say the deer react with them and change directions."  </P> <P> In Minnesota, the reflectors are being used at 30 sites, with a dozen more to  be added. Susan Mulvihill, accident surveillance safety engineer for the state  Department of Transportation, said they seem to be working.  </P> <P> "When we figure out a benefit cost, we use 60% reduction as an average, so  they're pretty effective if you install them right," Mulvihill said. "We've had  pretty good luck with them here. It's worked better than anything else we  tried."  </P> <P> But the high cost and mixed results at a 2-mile test-strip along Interstate 79  have made West Virginia officials skeptical.  </P> <P> "It is fairly expensive and it isn't 100% effective in reducing deer kill. . .  ," Russell said. "The only thing that is 100% effective is an 8-foot tall  fence."  </P> <P> Whistles attached to vehicles to frighten deer by emitting high-pitched sounds  also have shown limited effectiveness, McCabe said.  </P> <P> "I don't hold much credence in it at all," he said. "It may scare off deer that  are standing in the roads, but it doesn't do much for those out of the  periphery of the sounds that are running along the highway. Those tend to be  the deer that are hit anyway."  </P> <P> "Everything has been tried, nothing works," Godshall said. "Fencing is the best  thing, but they're prohibitively expensive."  </P> <P> The problem, wildlife officials say, is not really with the deer at all. It's  people.  </P> <P> "People are inclined to spread out in attractive areas that are hilly and have  forests -- areas that are traditionally and ecologically principal and critical  habitats of deer and certainly other wildlife," McCabe said.  </P> <P> "There's more traffic, more miles of travel being done each year, and more  roadways to accommodate that traffic," he said. "What it all comes down to is  when a deer bangs into a car, people tend to get annoyed at the deer, but it's  the people who are more or less invading the deer's habitat, and all of this is  a consequence of human sprawl."  </P></p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Landslide for Frei in Chilean election: New president's victory reflects popularity of outgoing Aylwin government Mr Eduardo Frei of the governing Concertacion coalition swept to victory in Chile's weekend presidential elections, winning the largest popular backing of any Chilean head of state in 60 years. Mr Frei, whose father was president from 1964 to 1969, won 58 per cent of the vote, against around 24 per cent for his main rival, Mr Arturo Alessandri of the centre-right. By securing more than half the vote, he avoided a run-off in February, and will take office on March 11. His victory was built on the popularity of the four-year government of President Patricio Aylwin, which is credited with engineering a largely successful transition to democracy from the 17-year dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. Mr Aylwin is set to leave office as Chile's most popular president ever, according to Mrs Marta Lagos, director of polling organisation Cerc. For the first time in more than half a century, the election did not result in a shift of power to the opposition. Nevertheless, it underlined Chile's long-standing voting patterns, which divide the electorate into roughly equal blocks of left, centre and right. Parliamentary elections, also held on Saturday, left the shape of Congress little altered. This will make it difficult to achieve changes sought by Mr Frei to the 1980 constitution, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses. The constitution, drawn up under the military, packs the Senate with appointees of the Pinochet regime and does not allow the president to appoint or remove the head of the armed forces - Gen Pinochet. Mr Frei is not expected to veer much from the economic policies that have helped Chile become Latin America's fastest growing economy. Growth this year is expected to be 6.2 per cent after 10.3 per cent in 1992. During the Aylwin administration, some 10 per cent of the population has risen out of poverty. Unemployment has fallen nationally to 4.5 per cent and real wages have risen by 3.5 per cent annually, largely in line with productivity growth. Meanwhile, Chile has the highest investment rate in Latin America, estimated at 27.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year. In an interview just before the election, Mr Frei said: 'It's clear the four-year transition is over and Chile has recovered its democratic tradition.' The main challenges that had faced Mr Aylwin concerned human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the reconciliation of development with social justice, he said. 'These tasks have been achieved and we therefore have other priorities, such as the fight against poverty and improving education.' Mr Ricardo Lagos, a socialist leader within the Concertacion and likely cabinet minister, said social issues would become the highest priority 'not because Aylwin did badly, but because he's done well'. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance minister, agreed that the new administration would have to reorder its priorities. 'We have institutional problems, that could become serious, in the way that health and education services are provided. 'We are not happy with the way the system is working either on the public or the private side,' he said. The private health system needed better regulation to stop insurers from withdrawing coverage from high-risk patients. The public system was overcentralised, prone to industrial conflict and still suffered from years of inadequate funding by the military regime. Mr Frei foresees radical reforms in these areas, particularly in education. 'If we are really serious about leaving the ranks of underdeveloped nations, we will have to introduce profound changes in the educational system and in work training,' he said. However, Mr Juan Villarzu, Mr Frei's main economic adviser and his expected finance minister, made clear that the Frei administration would not allow social concerns to loosen the grip of fiscal restraint. On the contrary, if the international downturn continued to weaken the prices of Chile's principal primary exports, the 1994 budget might have to be cut, he said. But in the medium term, given international recovery, he saw 'few restraints' to growth rates of around 7 per cent. Inflation is expected to fall to 12 per cent this year. This success has been accompanied, according to recent opinion polls, by a scaling-down of popular expectations about what democratic government can achieve. If this is good news for Mr Frei, there are some questions about the six-year term he is expected to serve. 'One good thing about short presidential periods is when people start to become dissatisfied you have a change of government,' said Mr Foxley. 'A six-year term may be too long for that.'</p>

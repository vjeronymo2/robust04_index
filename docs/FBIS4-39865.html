			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Mikhail </F> Shevtsov, and Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 11 Jun -- Talks between the Azerbaijani  President Geydar Aliyev and Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev are being held here today with the participation of  experts on both sides.    In a press statement Aliyev stressed the importance of the  meeting and noted in particular the friendly character of  relations between the two neighboring states. Of late, he said,  many steps have been taken to successfully develop and  strengthen these relations. Nevertheless, a broadening of  cooperation in Aliyev's view requires closer contacts, including  closer military contacts. The interests of strengthening the  security of both Azerbaijan and Russia require this. He took  the opportunity to ask Pavel Grachev to convey the most cordial  greetings to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian  people on their Independence Day and wished them happiness,  prosperity, and success on the path of building a democratic  society.    Grachev also advocated the organization of multi-faceted  cooperation between the two countries and raising it to a higher  level. In this matter, he stated, Azerbaijan will always meet  with full understanding on Russia's part. The Russian minister  said that his trip to Azerbaijan was a familiarization and  working visit. He expressed confidence that the discussion of  the planned issues would be successful.</p>

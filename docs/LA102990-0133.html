			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ACTRESS ADVISES ON PARENTING  </P> <P> Parents need to be disciplinarians rather than buddies to their children,  actress Jennifer O'Neill says.  </P> <P> "You've got to have discipline. Sometimes we try to be their buddy over being a  disciplinarian.  </P> <P> When given a choice, you should be there to guide them. In the long run, it's  going to be better," O'Neill said Saturday.  </P> <P> O'Neill, who has a 23-year-old daughter and sons age 10 and 3, participated in  a program titled "Today's Woman and Her Kids" at Johnson City Medical Center  Hospital.  </P> <P> "As a single mother, having communication with the child's father is important.  He's the only father they have, and even if you don't get along, you have to  have unity," said O'Neill, 42.  </P> <P> The star of "The Summer of '42" and former model said she has sold a script to  Paramount called "White Lies" and will co-produce the film.  </P></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Bugatti to develop cheaper Lotus BUGATTI International, which recently took over Group Lotus, the UK automotive engineering consultancy and maker of sports cars, plans to develop an affordable Lotus sports car for production in the second half of the 1990s, Kevin Done writes. Lotus, which was previously owned by General Motors of the US, abandoned the two-seat roadster market last year. Rising losses and the high cost of production forced it to halt output of its Elan less than 2 1/2 years after launch. Mr Romano Artioli, president of Bugatti Automobili, and Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman, have become chairman and vice-chairman of Group Lotus. Lotus plans initially to resume output of a limited edition of 500 to 700 units of the axed Elan in order to use up the existing stock of parts, including nearly 800 Isuzu engines left when output was abandoned last year. Once these stocks have been used up Lotus will continue to try to sell the Elan design and production equipment abroad, possibly to a carmaker in South Korea.</p>

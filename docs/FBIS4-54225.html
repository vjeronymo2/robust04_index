In attendance were  Comrade Dao Duy Tung, member of the Political Bureau and  standing member of the Secretariat of the Party Central  Committee; Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political  Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee. Also on  hand were comrade members of the party Central Committee: Ha  Dang, director of the Ideology and Culture Department; Nguyen  Dinh Huong, director of the Internal Political Security  Department; Dang Xuan Ky, director of the Institute for Research  on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought; Nguyen Duy Quy,  director of the National Center of Social Sciences and  Humanities; Le Xuan Tung, deputy secretary of the Hanoi  Municipal Party Committee; and many comrade leaders of other  departments, ministries, branches, theoretical research organs,  newspapers, and magazines....    Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, TAP CHI CONG SAN editor in chief,  reported on the work of the journal in 1993 and its editorial  direction in 1994. He stressed: In 1993, TAP CHI CONG SAN made  significant progress in the editorial, research, public  relations, printing, and distribution areas. Thanks to its  attention to research, its linking editorial work with research,  and its success in gathering large numbers of contributors, the  journal was able to improve the quality of its copy and enhance  its theoretical, recapitulative, and militant character. In  particular, the journal paid attention to maintaining close  contact with life and with burning theoretical and practical  issues and propagandized various resolutions of the party  Central Committee, the Political Bureau, and the Secretariat,  and various major positions and policies of the party and state  in a timely, concentrated, and systematic manner. It struggled  in defense of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought and in  defense of the party's lines and viewpoints, especially in the  fight against "peaceful evolution," in the human rights issue,  and in the culture, literature and arts, and publication issues.  It criticized deviationist perceptions and erroneous viewpoints.    The limitations and weaknesses of TAP CHI CONG SAN are: the  theoretical quality and scientific content of a number of  articles are still poor; some articles still have the look of a  specialized report or overemphasize local situations; the  general character of its reviews of practice is not yet high  enough and the style of writing is obsolete; and some articles  are not convincing.    Concerning the editorial direction for 1994, the comrade  editor in chief announced that the journal will deal more deeply  with various theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi  Minh thought and of socialism and the path to socialism in our  country. It will attach special importance to reviews of  practice and scientific studies and to articles aimed at  combating erroneous viewpoints and rectifying erroneous  perceptions.    In their suggestions, a number of contributors expressed  their agreement with and approval of the editorial staff's  report and welcomed and applauded the efforts, innovations, and  progress of the journal. At the same time, they suggested  additional measures aimed at continuing to improve the journal  and to improve its quality. A number of comrades stressed that  the switch to the market mechanism is both an objective demand  and a move that has a direct impact on theoretical research work  and on the press and publishing activities. Against this  background, TAP CHI CONG SAN has stood firm in its position, has  correctly performed its functions, has strictly adhered to its  guiding principles, and has satisfactory carried out his task of  determining the ideological orientation for all society. At the  same time, it has striven to stay in contact with daily life and  to touch upon not a few prominent, thorny issues. The journal  has overcome the challenge and has recorded remarkable  achievements. Its rich content and diversified, lively form have  been reflected in all domains. The economic issue, a key,  burning problem of society, has been satisfactorily dealt with.  With regard to a number of difficult questions such as  nationalities, religion, culture, literature and arts, the  journal has also carried many articles containing correct  viewpoints and written in an adequate style that are  "acceptable" to society and the reader.... TAP CHI CONG SAN has  increased its circulation of more than 38,000 copies (early in  the year) to more than 42,000 copies (at year's end) and has  successfully expanded its network of contributors and readership  (particularly in the southern region). This is a fact worth  rejoicing over.    A number of opinions suggested that TAP CHI CONG SAN should  maintain the forms of exchange of views, informal talk, and  seminar, especially concerning major, difficult issues, and  should bring up different opinions and still controversial views  to provide information and data so that the party can study them  and plan policies. It can coordinate with various departments,  sectors, or localities to organize seminars, thereby bringing  theory into contact with vibrant life and, at the same time,  enriching theory with the realities of life.    With a friendly and serious work style, TAP CHI CONG SAN  was,  is, and will be the rallying point of scientists, theoreticians,  and activists, and will become an important bridge between  science and life, between scientists and the public at large.  The journal's appeal lies primarily in the quality of its copy.  In the past, readers might come to TAP CHI CONG SAN simply  because they needed or had to understand the party's policies  and lines. Today, in the information age, readers come to the  journal with much more diversified, variegated needs and  aspirations. In particular, they want to find correct answers  for and solutions to the bustling, complex life of today.    Many contributors expressed their belief that, as a  theoretical and political organs of the party Central Committee  and with its substantial experience and its strong contingent of  contributors, TAP CHI CONG SAN will certainly continue to  advance to satisfactorily fulfill the tasks entrusted to it,  thereby living up to its readers' confidence.    After listening to the aforementioned opinions, Comrade Dao  Duy Tung made a statement. With his familiar composed, friendly  manner and his simple, incisive way of expression, he said: "A  former cadre of TAP CHI CONG SAN who had worked for it for 17  years, from 1965 to 1982 [Footnote: Comrade Dao Duy Tung was  editor in chief of TAP CHI CONG SAN from 1965 to 1982 --  (P.V.)], today I am very happy to see the brothers and sisters  who work at the journal, and to see the contributors, some of  whom have contributed since the years I still worked at the  journal."    Commending the progress made by TAP CHI CONG SAN last year  in  the content and quality of its copy, in the intellectual content  of the journal, in the renovation of its way of thinking, in the  scope of the issues dealt with, and in the educational standard  of its writers, Comrade Dao Duy Tung clearly pointed out: TAP  CHI CONG SAN has paid attention to linking theory with life and  has consciously explained and answered the problems posed by  life. Although the quality of its answers is still debatable,  the journal has made efforts in this respect, and this is the  right direction to follow. The comrade stressed: "Obviously, TAP  CHI CONG SAN has made progress in all its content, its form, and  its contingent of contributors."    Pointing to the weak aspects of the journal, Comrade Dao Duy  Tung made suggestions concerning some issues: In its capacity as  the theoretical and political organ of the party Central  Committee, how many articles of good quality and significant  scope has TAP CHI CONG SAN produced by itself, articles that are  considered interesting by many people? Has the journal delved  deeply into the reality of renovation--from the micro to the  macro level--in order to present concrete models in various  domains (especially the economic domain) of the path of  socialist construction in our country? Has it carried highly  scientific and convincing articles to contribute to heightening  the confidence of cadres and party members in the path they have  chosen, and to overcome the vacillation among a component of  cadres and party members in the face of the collapse of the  socialist system in the Soviet Union and East European  countries? How many articles has it featured that have the  effect of guiding various echelons and sectors in correctly  implementing the party's common line, and of promptly rectifying  the manifestations of deviationism? Everyday, every hour, the  opposition forces, using many means, are constantly striking at  the ideological base of the party and at the party itself. Have  the articles on this issue launched timely and effective  counterattacks?    With regard to the editorial orientation and tasks of TAP  CHI  CONG SAN in the coming years, Comrade Dao Duy Tung clearly  pointed out:    1. The journal should assert, clarify, and help develop  Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. This is an important  and pressing task. At present, the Council for the  Guidance of the Compilation of the Textbooks of the Scientific  Studies of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is  holding discussions to clarify a number of major theoretical  issues such as: the role of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh  thought; observations on the character and content of our epoch;  the theory of socioeconomic forms; the theory of surplus value;  the theory of the historical position of the working class; and  many other concrete issues.    The general issue is that we must be able to determine what  universal principles of Marxism-Leninism as a revolutionary and  scientific doctrine were correct in the past and are still  correct at present; what theses conformed to historical  conditions in the past but are no longer appropriate now; and  what theses were already inappropriate even during the lifetime  of Marx and Lenin, including the ones that had been criticized  by Marx and Lenin themselves. We must consider what  contributions our party has made to the development of  Marxism-Leninism in the process of leading the revolution.    This is an opportunity for TAP CHI CONG SAN to make  important  contributions to and to work together with the council to  clarify theoretical issues. The journal should establish close  relations with the council to secure more favorable conditions  for its editorial work.    2. TAP CHI CONG SAN should actively participate in the  research on and compilation of articles aimed at providing a  scientific basis for the decisions of the Seventh and Eighth  Party Central Committee Plenums and the eighth party congress.  The Seventh Party Central Committee Plenum will discuss the  industrialization issue, science and technology, and development  of the working class. The Eighth Party Central Committee Plenum  will discuss the rule-of-law state issue, social sciences and  the humanities, and some theoretical issues. The journal should  closely monitor the requirements and themes being prepared for  submission to these plenums in order to formulate appropriate  editorial programs.    3. The journal should closely follow the implementation of  the seventh party congress Resolution, the Resolution of the  party conference of delegates, and the various party Central  Committee resolutions. It should grasp important socioeconomic  issues in order to write articles to affirm what is proceeding  in the right direction and what is deviating from it.    With regard to the economy, the journal should carry  articles  on economic structure, economic sectors, the market mechanism,  especially the issue of state-run businesses, the forms of  cooperatives in several sectors, private businesses, pricing,  banking, money, accumulation, consumption.... Concerning  society, the journal should pay attention to the questions of  employment, social justice, elimination of hunger and reduction  of poverty, division between the rich and the poor....    Special importance should be attached to articles reviewing  models, in particular the models of production centers (such as  tea, sugarcane, mulberry and silkworm, coffee, rubber production  centers...); attention should be focused on models of  state-operate businesses and of distribution and circulation in  the new conditions; on models of agricultural cooperatives to be  built along the line of bringing into full play the strengths of  cooperative member households while consolidating and increasing  the strength of the collective of cooperative members....    4. TAP CHI CONG SAN should delve more deeply into the issues  of national culture and characteristics and fine national  traditions. It should exploit the achievements of our  forefathers, not only in the domain of fighting against  aggressors but also in other fields such as philosophy, history,  science, literature and arts, religion, law, language...    5. TAP CHI CONG SAN has carried, at an early date, articles  dealing with the issue of opposing "peaceful evolution" (issue  No. 1-1993). But now it should delve more deeply into this  matter because this struggle is taking place everyday, every  hour, in many fairly virulent forms.    6. Concerning the party, articles in TAP CHI CONG SAN should  clearly show that party building is the key task. There are many  subjects, but in the immediate future importance should be  attached to the question of heightening the vanguard character  and raising the party's standards and intellect. The journal  should carry articles written in an attractive, persuasive  manner to contribute to developing the quality of cadres and  party members, upholding the revolutionary ideal, promoting a  healthy way of living, and overcoming the manifestations of  vacillation and opportunism. In particular the journal must  struggle against corruption, smuggling, and wasteful  expenditures.    In the current complicated situation, TAP CHI CONG SAN  should  feature convincing articles to struggle against and refute  allegations against the party (allegations aimed at opposing the  party's ideological system, the party's line, and party  organizations; and at enticing, winning over, and corrupting  party cadres...). The journal must attach special importance to  the subjects concerning the cadre issue in order to gradually  improve the quality of our contingent of cadres.    Comrade Dao Duy Tung concluded: "In short, we must firmly  grasp opportunities, bring into play our advantages, and prevent  and overcome dangers in order to achieve at all costs the  objectives set by the seventh party congress, not only for up to  1995 but also for up to 2000."    On behalf of the editorial staff and the contingent of  contributors, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong sincerely thanked Comrade  Dao Duy Tung and promised the party Central Committee that they  will satisfactorily carry out the tasks of the journal.</p>

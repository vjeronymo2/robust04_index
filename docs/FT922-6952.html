			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Shares fall on Pounds 2.2m loss at Henry Barrett SHARES in Henry Barrett Group fell 6p to 26p yesterday, close to an all-time low, after the the steel and industrial fasteners company announced an interim loss and expressed caution about the immediate outlook. Barrett, which has been forced to rein back after rapid expansion in the 1980s, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.19m in the six months to February 29, compared with a profit of Pounds 272,000. Turnover fell to Pounds 49.4m, against Pounds 57.4m, which included Pounds 11m relating to discontinued activities or businesses for sale. Mr James Barrett, group chief executive, said stockholding and industrial fasteners were profitable. But the construction division, mainly involved in structural steelwork, lost money because of pressure on margins. 'We're looking for margin not volume recovery,' he said. Losses per share were 3.47p (earnings 0.37p) and no interim dividend is being paid. However, the company said it would pay a nominal final dividend because several shareholders are trusts which have to sell shares if no dividend is paid. Barrett has continued to sell loss-making businesses, leading to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.7m. Last month Park Pallet, which is involved in materials handling, was sold for Pounds 168,000. Exceptional charges of Pounds 295,000 covered redundancies in ongoing businesses. Once Barrett's disposals and cuts are complete, the workforce will fall to 800, compared to 1,350 a year ago. Net borrowings remained high at Pounds 19.9m at the end of the period, equivalent to 87 per cent of shareholders funds (74 per cent). Mr Barrett said gearing should fall towards 50 per cent by the year end as cash flow was expected to turn mildly positive and some property sales were pending. Interest costs were unchanged at Pounds 1.18m.</p>

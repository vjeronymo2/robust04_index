			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Property: It's been worth the wait in NW8 - John Brennan looks closely at one of London's best residential areas THE residential arc across the north and north-west of central London - from Highgate to Hampstead and down to St John's Wood, at the top end of Regent's Park - includes some of the most frequently-traded houses in the capital. The locals cannot sit still - and the area attracts more than its share of short-term owners from abroad. In the mid-1980s St John's Wood, in particular, was made nearly impassable because of builders' skips parked outside houses and flat blocks, filling up with previous owners' interior decorations. The turnover record probably is held by a family house in Little Venice, by the Regent's Canal; it had three new kitchens, to match its changing owners, in just four years. But in the deal-crazed pace of that period, even the decorators lost track of who was having what done There has been constant sales movement in this northern arc ever since, even though sales agencies in west-central London have been struggling to find signs of life in their market. Why the difference? Divorce always helps to make available a steady supply of houses and flats. The area has its full share of repossessions and cash-strapped sales, too. The fact that more owners live there year-round than in, say, Mayfair, Knightsbridge or Belgravia also goes some way to explain this greater activity. British buyers within this northern arc tend to have clear ideas about where they want to live. As a generality, Hampstead Garden Suburbanites may seek to trade up within their area but rarely beyond. Hampstead home-seekers often turn to the similar-sized and less expensive family homes on the Highgate side of the heath, while those who prefer St John's Wood are willing to set the probability of having to buy a leasehold against time-savings on travel into work. Overseas buyers, as Noel De Keyzer of Savills confirms, have a less-localised view of these markets. Often, they will start their search on the northern border of Regent's Park and end up two miles north in Hampstead or Highgate because they do not want to spend money on a leasehold. This applies particularly to Americans, who commonly start their search at the park's north-west corner because their ambassador's residence and the American school are there. But many end up buying freeholds to the north. The same thinking applied when the Sultan of Brunei's home-buyers were active in London a few years ago. They looked at the leaseholds, but then followed elements of the Saudi royal family north, buying several houses in Highgate. His last big purchase was a Pounds 5.6m mansion in The Bishop's Avenue, Highgate's 'millionaires' row.' But that was then. Sales agents now are attuned more acutely to the calls of Far Eastern cash. Their patience is beginning to be rewarded. 'Hong Kong buyers are active in the area now,' says De Keyzer. 'They are looking for properties that they can buy and rent out for three to four years. A lot of them are medical people who can practice over here after the hand-over to China in 1997 and, yes, they do have plenty of cash.' These buyers have been on the sidelines for the past few months, some viewing and others taking a long view on areas such as Docklands and acquiring bargain flats. But most have been dissuaded from action by the argument that London prices have further to fall. In London's northern housing arc, price cuts have been sharp enough to persuade even sceptical Hong Kong investors that they are seeing good value. These buyers are expecting, and getting, minimum returns on their investments of eight to 10 per cent from open market rents on the modern, two-bedroom flats or modernised freehold family houses that head most property shoppers' lists. They can achieve these returns (occasionally, substantially higher) at a time of stable rather than rising rents, and because of property price cuts of between a quarter to a third since 1988. The odd cautionary tale of a price collapse helps realism among vendors, and most sales agents' conversations are full of such disasters. Savills' records include one property on the Mortgage Corporation's books which sold in 1987-88 for Pounds 3.5m, and re-sold recently for Pounds 1.25m after repossession. At much the same time, Middleheath, one of the largest of the red-brick Victorian mansions built along West Heath Road to face Hampstead Heath, was on the market because of the BCCI bank crash. Promoted initially at an asking price of Pounds 3.5m, it has now been sold to Far Eastern buyers for nearer Pounds 2m. Andrew Wadsworth's is asking prices on some of his Dockland developments by Tower Bridge once overshadowed all comparable ones. Subsequent price-cutting on those schemes recognises the changed market  - as does the 'just under Pounds 2m' asking figure (actually Pounds 1.975m, via Savills in Hampstead. Tel: 071-431-4844 - his own house in Carlton Hill, St John's Wood. This is a classic 1840s Italianate villa in an area that can claim to be London's first estate development with semi-detached and detached, rather than terraced, housing. Wadsworth has done an enormous amount of renovation tothis nine-bedroom property. The Grove and The Towers are at the geographical top and bottom of the northern arc - and the two most expensive homes on sale in London. The newly-built Towers in Highgate, with 31,000 square feet of residential space, has a Pounds 25m price tag that leans heavily on the hope that someone will wish to buy, and have finished to taste, one of the biggest houses in town. The Grove is on the extreme southern edge of the arc,on the bank of the Regent's Canal. Although Pounds 17.5m for a 96-year Crown lease does put it in the same super-cost range as the Dallas-style Towers, there the similarities end. Better-known for many years as Nuffield Lodge (because of its post-war lessee) the Grade I-listed Regent's Park villa that the late Robert Holmes a Court and his family restored and improved it to a standard that would have shamed Decimus Burton's builders in 1822. Mrs Janet Homes a Court is selling it because she spends less time in London since her husband's death 18 months ago. Progressive additions have given the house 12,300 square feet of space on three floors, with a separate studio and small office building. Set in more than four acres of garden stretching half a mile along the canal, sales agent Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) is unlikely to have any problems attracting viewers. Buyers should be close behind.</p>

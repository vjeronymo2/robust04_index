			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: An hour to spare - Glasgow You are in Glasgow, with an hour between meetings. What to do? Dr William Hunter has an assured place in medical history as a famous obstetrician and the first great teacher of anatomy in Britain. Even Adam Smith, Edmund Burke and Edward Gibbon went to his lectures. His wide-ranging collections of specimens, coins and medals, and his fine library of books and manuscripts, have enriched the University of Glasgow, while his paintings form the nucleus of the Hunterian Art Gallery, one of the choicest of all university collections. Thanks are due to the doctor for the three magnificent paintings by the incomparably subtle Jean-Simeon Chardin: A Lady Taking Tea, The Cellar Boy and The Scullery Maid. But the real strength of the Hunterian focuses on the turn of this century, and the influential Glasgow architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the American-born artist James McNeill Whistler. The windows and front door from the long-demolished Mackintosh House in Glasgow were incorporated into the facade of the new museum in 1980, and its four principal interiors carefully reconstructed as Mackintosh originally conceived them. Bequests of furniture and other applied arts, drawings and designs have made the museum the pre-eminent Mackintosh archive. The Whistler holding - the contents of his studio at his death - comprises some 80 oils, including 11 full-length portraits, 120 pastels and several hundred prints and drawings. Its only rival is the Freer Gallery in Washington. Hunterian Art Gallery, 82 Hill-head Street, Glasgow</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P. C. Tang and Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Geneva, May 16 (CNA) -- A Taiwan trade mission, led  by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng, arrived in  Geneva Sunday [15 May] for the May 77-19 meeting of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) working party on Taiwan's  membership in the World Trade Organization.    Taiwan will also hold bilateral tariff talks with a number  of  nations while in Geneva, including Canada, which is expected to  ask Taiwan to cut tariffs on more than 800 items.  Director-General Huang Yen-chao will represent Taiwan during  the talks with Canada.    Delegation members will hold talks with the European Union  and Switzerland on May 17 and May 19 respectively, and Taiwan is  expected to meet with representatives from Colombia, Mexico, and  Korea on May 20.    The delegation will also exchange views with South Africa,  Chile, and Australia during the three days of meetings.    So far, Taiwan has held tariff reduction negotiations with  the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South  Africa, Hungary, The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan.    Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are  considered vital to Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based  world trade regulating body.    Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and  is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

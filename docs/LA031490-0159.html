			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SEX;  </P> <P> BEWARE THOSE LITTLE WHITE LIES  </P> <P> Here's an insight that may fail to shock dedicated students of the mating game:  People often tell lies in order to have sex.  </P> <P> Two California researchers reached that conclusion about dating behavior after  taking a survey of college students.  </P> <P> They say it's a point worth keeping in mind when trying to decide whether  potential sexual partners have ever done anything to put themselves at risk of  AIDS.  </P> <P> In the survey, 34% of male respondents and 10% of women admitted they had "told  a lie in order to have sex." Even more said they would lie if a situation arose  where it would be to their advantage.  </P> <P> "The implications of our findings are clear," the researchers wrote in  Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. "Patients should be cautioned that  safe-sex strategies are always advisable, despite arguments to the contrary  from partners." The survey was conducted by Drs. Susan D. Cochran of California  State University, Northridge, and Vickie M. Mays of UCLA.  </P></p>

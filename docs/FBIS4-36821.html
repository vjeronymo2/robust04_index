			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nasrallah: Israeli Ultimatums Will </F> Not Prevent Us From Retaliating at a Time of Our Own Choosing"]    [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Hizballah's Secretary General  Hasan Nasrallah yesterday declared that the "Israeli ultimatums  and the U.S. support for them will not prevent us from carrying  out the promised retaliation" at a time to be determined by the  resistance.    Nasrallah's declaration was made at a commemoration ceremony  for the victims of the Israeli raid on a Hizballah training  center in 'Ayn Kawkab, east of Ba'labakk, held in Beirut's  southern suburb and attended by Mohammad Kazem Khonsari,  director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Middle East and North  Africa Department scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah; Hizballah  deputies and officials; Iranian Ambassador Hamayon 'Alizadeh;  Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the "Islamic Jihad in  Palestine" [IJP]; Milad al-Qarih, representing Defense Minister  Muhsin Dallul; Staff Brigadier General Husayn Nasr al-Din,  representing Army Commander Emile Lahhud; and other influential  Palestinian and Lebanese figures.    Khonsari expressed "condolences and congratulations from the  Iranian people and government to the Lebanese people and  government." He criticized the U.S. policy "for covering up the  Zionist enemy's violation of Lebanon's sovereignty." He  commended "the cohesion of the Lebanese internal situation  manifested in the profound official and popular support for the  resistance and its right to resist the occupation." He added:  "We are fully convinced that Israel and its masters do not want  peace with the peoples and states of this region; they want full  capitulation and submission to Zionist hegemony, to deny our  Arab and Islamic peoples their will, identity, and history."    Dr. al-Shaqaqi criticized the "policy of capitulation" and  negotiation with Israel "while the enemy continues to break all  international traditions and laws, with a direct American  cover-up, by committing all kinds of terrorism against the Arab  nation." He criticized Yasir 'Arafat's policy and pledged to  "sustain the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine."    The ceremony was concluded with a speech by Nasrallah, who  listed the aims of the Israeli raid on Ba'labakk, the most  important being "to strike at the resistance, create a situation  of popular frustration and confusion in its relations with its  people and kinfolk, isolate it, create an air of incitement and  sedition between the resistance and the state, try to break the  fateful bond between Lebanon and Syria, push official Lebanon  into peripheral negotiations that would lead to a separate peace  with Israel, and send a message to Syria in continuation of the  American and Israeli pressures on its leadership to make  concessions, abandon rights, and accept Israel's peace terms."    He pointed out, however, that "these aims have failed." He  emphasized that "continuation of the resistance is a right," and  he praised the solidarity between the resistance and the people.    He said that "all kinds of sedition are forbidden and  prohibited and would be a great service to the enemy, who is  lying in wait for all of us. The domestic peace is a red line  and a great achievement which must be preserved." He denied  that "we are about to call for any form of intrinsic security."  He added: "We are not a security alternative to anyone." He  expressed a wish for "security achievement" at the level of  "exposing the Israeli groups within." He urged "confrontation  of the Israeli infiltration of the Lebanese arena through agents  and spies." He voiced appreciation for the "official support  for the resistance," which, he said, should be "deepened and  rooted." He also called for withdrawal from the negotiations.    He emphasized that Lebanese-Syrian relations "are  deep-rooted  and strategic. They are one of the main foundations of Lebanon's  strength." He praised Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's firmness  and his ability to tackle this phase skillfully and to face  pressures and tribulations. He also noted Iran's support for  Syria.    After criticizing the U.S. policy, he said: "Dear friends,  our people and kinfolk, and also the Americans carrying the  threatening messages and the Israelis who have not, since the  raid, stopped issuing ultimatums: These ultimatums and threats  will not prevent us from carrying out the promised retaliation  in the course of our continuing resistance and jihad and at a  time of our own choosing, and let Israel do what it likes. What  does it want to do? Destroy our homes, kill us, scorch our  land, steal our water, and occupy our country? It is doing that  every day, and we will not stop in the face of that threat." He  concluded: "It wanted it an open war, but when has it not been  open?" He reaffirmed "continuation of the jihad."</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris appointment confirms focus on tobacco MR GEOFFREY Bible, a senior executive at Philip Morris, has been appointed executive vice-president, worldwide tobacco - a post which will oversee the group's tobacco operations both in the US and overseas, writes Nikki Tait. The move appears to confirm top management focus on the tobacco operations. It comes just weeks after the tobacco, food and brewing group started a price war in the US cigarette market in an effort to bolster market share of its hitherto very profitable brands. Mr Bible will report to Mr William Murray, Philip Morris's chief operating officer. Reporting directly to Mr Bible will be Mr William Campbell, chief executive of Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations, and the officers who head the international tobacco businesses. Mr Bible, although a long-time employee of PM's tobacco operations, was given the position of executive vice-president international two years ago, when Philip Morris announced senior management changes relating to the retirement of its then chairman, Mr Hamish Maxwell. This post required him to oversee the international food and the international tobacco operations, and his appointment was seen as a signal that Philip Morris was focusing on international expansion.</p>

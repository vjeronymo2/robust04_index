			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> NEW POSITION A SNAP FOR MONTOYA  </P> <P> Guard Max Montoya is learning another position, long snapper, and the Raiders  plan to use him in that capacity if Dan Turk, their No. 1 snapper on punts and  field goals, is injured. "I did it back in 1986 at Cincinnati," Montoya said.  </P> <P> "I'm just doing it for emergency situations. Hopefully, I'm the backup to the  backup's backup."  </P> <P> The Raiders are also using quarterback Jay Schroeder as a backup holder on  field goals. Punter Jeff Gossett normally holds for field goals. Schroeder is  also the backup punter.  </P> <P> Tight end Mike Dyal, who suffered a pulled hamstring in the Raiders' 17-13  victory at Seattle last month, hopes to return for next week's game at Kansas  City.  </P> <P> But the Raiders don't appear to be as confident as Dyal, having signed Ken  Whisenhunt, who was cut by the Washington Redskins last month. "I was surprised  when the Raiders called, but I was very happy," Whisenhunt said.  </P> <P> A 12th-round draft pick from Georgia Tech in 1985, Whisenhunt spent four  seasons with the Atlanta Falcons before signing with the Redskins as a Plan B  free agent last year.  </P> <P> Whisenhunt apparently impressed the Raiders with his performance in the  Falcons' 12-6 victory over the Raiders in 1988.  </P> <P> Tackle Rory Graves sat out practice Thursday with a strained left foot. He  plans to return to practice next week. CHRIS BAKER  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Bottomley defends hospital reform CRITICS who believed the problems of London's hospitals had been caused by the government's internal market in healthcare were 'wrong by about 100 years', Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday. The problems, she told the Commons health committee, were long-standing and had been the subject of more reports than virtually any other issue. But she accepted that they had been brought to a head by the government's 1991 National Health Service reforms, which had changed from an institution-focused structure to a patient-focused one. 'Under those circumstances, it was inevitable that the institution-dominated health service in London would soon come under fierce scrutiny and face mounting pressure to change,' she said. Mrs Bottomley added that it was important to look beyond the pleading of individual cases and address the concerns of doctors and other professionals about the 'mounting inadequacy' of the NHS to meet modern needs in London. 'We must live up to the expectations of those who embrace, welcome and want change in the capital. This will mean swift action carried forward according to a tight timetable.' Mr Tim Chessells, chairman of the implementation group overseeing the London changes, said approaches had been received from other English regions about the possibility of relocating London specialist units elsewhere. The British Medical Association is telling its members to seek local-level recognition in trust hospitals in readiness for an expected shift from national bargaining on doctors' conditions of service. By next year almost all hospitals and community health services will have become locally managed trusts. Although staff transfer to trusts on existing national terms of employment, trust managements can seek to negotiate changes in them. BMA leaders accept that this will lead to a gradual end to the current national structure under which hospital and community doctors enjoy the same pay and conditions wherever they work. There will be a particular incentive for some trust managements to introduce new contracts for doctors in the hope of encouraging consultants to treat private patients on trust premises rather than in independent hospitals. Some trust managements are examining ways of streamlining collective bargaining, while the BMA is anxious to ensure that medical staff retain flexibility to negotiate independently on issues exclusive to the profession. It has set up a network of local negotiating committees to represent medical staff in almost all existing and potential trusts.</p>

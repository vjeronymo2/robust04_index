			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takashi Ibusuki, Environmental Technology </F> Research Center, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology]    [Text] Countermeasures for waste oxides of nitrogen  (NO[.sup]X[/]) generated by fixed sources such as power  plants and mobile sources such as automobiles have gradually  become more stringent, but in metropolitan areas like Tokyo,  Osaka and Kanagawa, the NO[.sup]X[/] concentration has not  been reduced, and in areas around roads, concentrations of  nitrogen dioxide often do not comply with environmental  standards (Figure 1). The reasons for this are the absolute  increase in traffic, delay of NO[.sup]X[/] countermeasures  and the increase in the proportion of vehicles with diesel   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-13A>           Figure 1. Condition of Environmental Standards for NO[.sup]2[/] At Automobile Exhaust Measurement Stations </FIG>  engines. Along with emphasizing the development of  NO[.sup]X[/] reduction technology, the Environment Agency has  promulgated the "Act for Special Measures Concerning the  Reduction of Total Emissions of NO[.sup]X[/] from Vehicles in  Specified Areas" and is aiming at the reduction of  NO[.sup]X[/] concentrations.       In addition to these countermeasures, there have been  various  proposals for development of technology for cleaning  environments with high concentrations of NO[.sup]X[/], but  the main roads of metropolitan areas have become more  multilayered and complex each year and creation of tunnels for  new roads is progressing. The exhaust from these large-scale  tunnels contains more than 1ppm of NO[.sup]X[/], and  elimination of NO[.sup]X[/] from large amounts of exhaust is  expected to help in improving the environment in these areas. At  present, processes in which silica gel and zeolite are used as  dry absorbents and ammonia is used for reduction processing are  being examined. However, the processing equipment for this  method is very large, and the energy and cost required for  operation are estimated to be very large.  <H5>  Why Attention Was Drawn to Photocatalysts </H5>   As one study on the behavior of NO[.sup]X[/] in the  atmosphere, the authors examined the NO[.sup]2[/] absorbency  and reactivity of soil particles and the metal oxide particles  that compose them in relation to photochemical air pollution and  acid rain. The absorbency of NO[.sup]2[/] itself was not so  large, but we obtained interesting results concerning the  absorption using incident light and the increase in nitric acid  produced (Table 1). Among the metal oxides that were examined,  titanium dioxide (TiO[.sup]2[/], which is present in soil  particles at around 1%), which has photosemiconductivity,  exhibited a large effect with incident light, and we found out  that NO[.sup]2[/] was oxidized to create nitric acid. Nitric  acid is more easily absorbed by solids, has greater dissolution  in water and is more easily processed using absorbents and  absorbent liquids than NO[.sup]X[/]. Therefore, we thought of  actively using the photocatalytic operation of these  photosemiconductive particles in the elimination of the sub-ppm  level of NO[.sup]X[/] in the atmosphere.         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 Amount of NO[.sup]2[/] Eliminated by Soil Particles and Metal O-|  |xides with Incident Light and Quantities of NO and Nitric Acid Produced (-|  |NO[.sup]2[/]: 1.6ppm, relative humidity: 50%, units: 10[.sup]-7[/]mol |  |g[.sup]-1[/]h[.sup]-1[/])                                             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |particle mate-|NO[.sup]2[/]|UV/dark[.sup]*)|NO produced   |HNO[.sub]3     |  |rial          | absorbed     |[/]        |              |[/] produc-|  |              |              |              |              |ed            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |soil particle-|14.3          |3.6           |6.3           |5.3           |  |s 1           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |soil particle-|13.2          |3.3           |5.9           |4.5           |  |s 2           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |soil particle-|13.7          |3.9           |6.9           |6.9           |  |s 3           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SiO[.sup]2     |35.6          |1.9           |5.5           |15.1          |  |[/]        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Al[.sup]2[/]|17.7          |1.3           |2.9           |8.2           |  |O[.sup]3[/] |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fe[.sup]2[/]|9.3           |21.2          |3.8           |3.1           |  |O[.sup]3[/] |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TiO[.sup]2     |25.9          |16.7          |-0.9          |15.3          |  |[/]        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CaO           |4.4           |-             |0.9           |3.4           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MgO           |12.6          |3.2           |1.9           |8.5           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*) Value indicating effect of photoincidence: amount of NO[.sup]2[/] el-|  |iminated with light/amount of NO[.sup]2[/] eliminated in dark           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  NO </H5> [.sup]X[/] Elimination Capacity of Photocatalysts    As is shown conceptually in Figure 2, the electrons of  photosemiconductive metal oxides like TiO[.sup]2[/] shift  (excitation) to the conduction band from the valence band when  light with an energy higher than the band gap (difference in  energy between the valence band and the conduction band) is  incident to them, and particles (holes) with a positive charge  are generated in the valence band. A part of the electrons and  holes are dispersed on the surface of the oxide particle, and  the electrons are involved in reduction reactions and the holes  in oxidation reactions. TiO[.sup]2[/] is a semiconductor  excited by ultraviolet light (360nm or lower) and is an  photocatalyst with great oxidative power; we conducted our  search for a catalyst for processing NO[.sup]X[/] centered on  this.  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-14A> Figure 2. Generation of Electrons and Holes Through Light </FIG>  Absorption by Semiconductors Like TiO[.sup]2[/]      <H5>  1. Experimental Methods </H5>   The experimental system shown in Photo 1 [not reproduced] is  composed of a flow-through photo reaction unit, reaction gas  control unit and analytical unit. The reaction tube is a silica  glass tube with fine glass powder sintered to the surface, and  about 250mg (0.8ml) of the catalytic powder is applied to this;  after being baked in air over night, this was placed in the  central glass tube. The catalyst on the surface of the reaction  tube was illuminated using 12 blacklights (wavelength  300-400nm). The reaction gas was air that included 1-2ppm of  NO[.sup]X[/], and humidity was controlled (dry to 70%)  using a humidifier; the reaction was carried out continuously for five  hours at a flow rate of 0.5l per minute. During this time, the  concentration of NO[.sup]X[/] (NO and NO[.sub]2[/]) in the  reaction gas was monitored continuously by a chemiluminescence  nitrogen oxide meter. After the experiment was completed, the  reaction tube was removed and cleaned ultrasonically in pure  water, and the pH and nitric acid ion  (NO[.sup]3[/][.sup]-[/]) concentration measured.  <H3>  2.  NO </H3> [.sup]X[/] Elimination Activity of the Photocatalyst    As can be predicted from Table 1, TiO[.sup]2[/] exhibited  a high NO oxidation activity, but about 30% of the NO was  released into the gas phase as NO[.sup]2[/], and we can see  that this is not a sufficient catalyst from the standpoint of  NO[.sup]X[/] elimination. Using something that absorbs  NO[.sup]2[/] well can be thought of as sufficient for  avoiding the release of NO[.sup]2[/], and we took a look at  mixing activated carbon (AC), which can be expected to absorb  NO[.sup]2[/] with TIO[.sub]2[/].    Table 2 shows the amounts of NO and NO[.sup]2[/]  eliminated and the amount of nitric acid produced when reaction  gas that included 1.6ppm of NO[.sup]2[/] was used with  TiO[.sup]2[/], AC and TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC. When there was no  illumination, it was clear that (1) AC and TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC  eliminated NO[.sup]2[/], (2) generation of NO actively  occurred with AC and TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC and (3) little nitric  acid was generated with any sample (no NO[.sup]2[/]  oxidation). On the other hand, when there is illumination, (1)  there was a large change in the activity of TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC,  and the generation of NO was inhibited and nitric acid  production hastened, but (2) there was almost no change in the  activity of AC. The elimination of NO[.sup]2[/] and  generation of NO by AC is assumed to be reduction of  NO[.sup]2[/] to NO when absorbed by AC. On the other hand,  both the oxidation of NO to NO[.sup]2[/] and the oxidation of  NO[.sup]2[/] to nitric acid (HNO[.sub]3[/]) occur on the  surface of TiO[.sup]2[/], and this is related to the  generation of various types of active oxygen (0, 0[.sup]-[/],  OH, etc.) on the TiO[.sup]2[/] surface when illuminated. The  nitric acid generated is caught by the TiO[.sup]2[/] surface,  but the ability of TiO[.sup]2[/] to absorb NO[.sub]2[/] is  low and part of the NO[.sup]2[/] is thought to be released as  a gas. The reason that the release of NO[.sup]2[/] is  inhibited by mixing TiO[.sup]2[/] and AC can be understood as  there being time for NO[.sup]2[/] to be caught by AC and the  NO[.sup]2[/] to be oxidized to HNO[.sub]3[/]. Figure 3  shows the mechanism for NO[.sup]X[/] elimination using the  TiO[.sup]2[/] photocatalyst.       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

The  results are summarized in Table 3, but in comparison with  TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC, elimination of NO with a TiO[.sub]2[/]-  AC-Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](I) catalyst is about double,  and there is a 30% or more increase in nitric acid  production. TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](II) is made by  mechanically mixing commercially available  Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder with TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC  and adjusting it, but the nitric acid production is two times  that of TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC. Since Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  itself does not exhibit much photocatalytic activity and the  optimal addition is 1-3 wt%, Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] is a  auxiliary catalyst, and it can be thought of as playing a role  in promoting the attachment of NO and NO[.sup]2[/] to the  catalytic surface (see Figure 3).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-15A> Figure 3.

Properties of the Photocatalyst Developed </H5>   The properties of this TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC-  Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](II) catalyst are as follows:    (1) The reaction occurs at room temperature, and sunlight  can  be used (wavelength: 300nm-360nm).    (2) Special reaction materials (ammonia, ozone, etc.) are  not  needed (NO[.sup]X[/] oxidation uses atmospheric oxygen and  the electrons and holes generated on the surface of  TiO[.sup]2[/]).    (3) It has a high activity for directly oxidizing low  concentrations of NO[.sup]X[/] (nitric acid production), and   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-15B>           Figure 4. Applications of Photocatalytic </FIG>  nitric acid is caught by the surface.    (4) Regeneration of the catalyst is easy (water wash: see  numbers (1)-(3) in Table 3).    (5) Easy adjustment (mechanical mixing of the three  components).    (6) Changes in catalytic activity due to relative humidity  are small.    (7) TiO[.sup]2[/], activated carbon and  Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] are available in large quantities  and are not expensive.  <H5>  Toward NO </H5> [.sup]X[/] Elimination Applications of the  Photocatalyst    We have shown that oxidative elimination of NO[.sup]X[/]  using a photocatalyst centered on TiO[.sup]2[/] can be  effectively carried out, but in order to use this catalyst in  the cleaning of tunnel exhaust as in Figure 4, a system that can  process large volumes of exhaust gas must be constructed. On the  other hand, in cases in which an open atmosphere is the object,  as with street canyons (environments that include roads  surrounded on both sides with tall buildings in which the  concentrations of pollutants like NO[.sup]X[/] are high),  there is a need for appropriate placing of the photocatalyst in  the environment.     <H3>  1. Cleaning of Closed Atmospheres Like Tunnels (Using  Artificial Light) </H3>   The small reaction unit shown in Photo 1 [not reproduced]  was  insufficient for obtaining the necessary data for designing a  system for processing tunnel exhaust, and experiments were  started using a large scale unit produced jointly with Fuji  Electric Co., Ltd. On the inside surface of the cylindrical  reaction chamber (1.5m x 0.2m) in the middle of Photo 2  [not  reproduced], 20-30g of catalyst was applied, and illumination  provided by an internal fluorescent lamp. Reaction gas  containing several ppm of NO[.sup]X[/] passes through an  electrostatic precipitator from the inlet at the far left, at a  rate of several meters of gas per minute. Part of the results  are shown in Figure 5, but in a reaction chamber (basic type) in  which the gas passes straight through, with a flow of 2m per  minute, the rate of elimination is low at 10%. On the  other  hand, the data shown by solid black circles is that obtained for  a reactor set up with a circular cone shaped screen, and there  is a great improvement in NO elimination. We can see that when  the gas flow is large, it is important to improve the contact of  the gas with the catalyst, inclusive of the time of contact.  Research on developing systems, including reaction tube length  and diameter and light intensity, aimed at practical  applications is continuing.     <H3>  2. Atmospheric Cleaning for Open Systems Such as Highways  (Using Sunlight) </H3>   It is not easy to use sunlight in tunnels, but it is  possible  with open systems such as highways. In such cases, the energy  for artificial lighting is unnecessary, and we can expect energy  efficient economical NO[.sup]X[/] elimination systems.  However, since it is difficult to apply powdered photocatalysts   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-16A>           Figure 5. Evaluation of NO Elimination Performance </FIG>  to the surfaces of sound absorption panels on highways and the  surfaces of buildings and not have exfoliation over the long  term, it is necessary to create panels and set them up.    What was developed for this were the sheet catalysts shown  in  Photo 3 [not reproduced]. A fluorine-contained resin powder and  the photocatalyst were mixed, and these were formed by rolling.  Experiments comparing the two 10 x 10 cm sheets continually  exposed to a flow of 0.5l per minute of air containing NO for 12  hours were conducted. With an atmosphere with a 0.05-2ppm NO  concentration, it was confirmed that almost all of the NO was  eliminated. The NO elimination rate decreases with the time of  use of these sheet catalysts, but if they are washed with water  the activity is completely recovered. There are many small holes  in the fluorine-contained resin used to form the sheets, and, it  was shown that starting with NO, gasses and water are easily  diffused within the sheet, osmosis takes place, and there was  sufficient contact with the catalyst. In addition, when these  sheets are exposed to outside air for a long time, a large  amount of nitric acid is recovered, so it was confirmed that the  photocatalyst works with sunlight. From here on, we plan to move  forward with evaluation and research on helping to develop a  high activity, durable catalyst, determining how much the  photocatalyst can contribute to NO[.sup]X[/] elimination at  actual sites such as highways and determining on what scale  there is a need for using the photocatalyst in order to make a  contribution.    While there is a great deal of basic research at present on  breakdown and elimination of pollutants using photocatalysts,  there are very few that have actually been offered for use.  Since photocatalyst technology for elimination of pollutants  that does not require thermal energy and does not use reaction  materials like ammonia is technology that is in harmony with  environmental protection, we plan to promote research and  development with the goal of reducing materials that cause air  pollution, starting with NO[.sup]X[/]. The sheet  photocatalyst that was developed, has the merit of easy  "separation on contact with water," which was difficult with the  earlier powdered photocatalyst, and there are expectations for  applications in the processing of water pollutants and  high-level processing of water.</p>

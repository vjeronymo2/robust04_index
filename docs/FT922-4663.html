			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Lloyd's losses for 1989 may exceed Pounds 2bn LOSSES at Lloyd's of London for 1989 are likely to exceed Pounds 2bn, according to the latest forecast by Chatset, the company which analyses the insurance market. The result will 'exceed most people's worst expectations', said Chatset, which had estimated a loss of Pounds 1.35bn as recently as January. In line with its three-year accounting system, Lloyd's will report its 1989 results later this month. Chatset's forecast is based on final figures for the large majority of the 401 syndicates which traded at the market in 1989. The bad news was underlined yesterday when Sturge Holdings, the biggest agency group at Lloyd's, cut its interim dividend by 50 per cent and gave a more downbeat assessment of the performance of its syndicates in the 1990 year. Sturge, which like Lloyd's is chaired by Mr David Coleridge, said it would 'take longer than expected for profits to return to their previous levels'. It owns agencies which manage syndicates and handle the affairs of Names, the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Sturge's shares fell 35 per cent yesterday to close 59p lower at 111p. Chatset said a minority of syndicates specialising in so-called 'spiral' business - in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's catastrophe exposures - will bear the brunt of the 1989 loss. Syndicates managed by agencies such as Gooda Walker and Feltrim were overwhelmed by a series of catastrophe losses - such as hurricane Hugo  - towards the end of 1989. Other syndicates have been hit by US claims where insurers are meeting the cost of cleaning up polluted sites and removing asbestos from buildings. Mr John Rew, co-editor of Chatset's reports and himself a Lloyd's Name facing heavy losses, predicted that losses in 1990 and 1991 could force many Names out of the market and reduce the capital base from its present level of Pounds 10.1bn to as little as Pounds 4bn by 1995. He said the bail-out plan for Lloyd's Names facing the most severe losses and currently being examined by Lloyd's would not solve the market's problems and that tax breaks and credit lines may be necessary to secure its future. Lloyd's announced it was investigating a bail-out scheme in April and one may be announced at the society's annual general meeting on June 24. Although Lloyd's is not challenging the Chatset forecasts, senior figures on the market take issue with long-term projections. Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents' Association, which represents more than 100 Lloyd's agents, said 'the long-term projections are absolutely wrong'. Pointing to rising insurance rates and the number of Names joining Lloyd's through his own Murray Lawrence agency, Mr Archard said Chatset was 'in cloud cuckoo land'. Mr Rew said Lloyd's was attempting to 'gull investors'. He said: 'Hindsight shows that to have been optimistic about Lloyd's has been misplaced.'

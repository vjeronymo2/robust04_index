			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Market moves towards a new peak UK STOCKS shook off a somewhat dull backcloth yesterday to move towards new peaks before being thwarted in late dealings by an unimpressive start to the new Wall Street session. Earlier, the market had bounced ahead to challenge its previous intra-day highs, supported by activity in the FT-SE futures sector. A firm performance by sterling also helped sentiment, although market strategists continued to suggest that further cuts in UK base rates may be delayed until later this year. Poor trading volume for the first day of the new equity market account appeared to indicate an underlying lack of enthusiasm. The Footsie Index gained more than 25 points in early trading but came off the top as the premium on the futures contract faded. The market's gain, already clipped to less than 20 points, came under further pressure when Wall Street reversed an early gain to show a fall of 1.24 on the Dow as London closed down for the day. London is acutely sensitive to Wall Street influences at present because of the possibility of cuts in US interest rates. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,542.8, a gain of 16.7 on the session and a mere 2.5 below the all-time high achieved on April 5. At mid-morning the Index challenged, but failed to reach, the intra day peak of 2,552.1 of April 5. Traders agreed that it was a session featured more by a rise in market indices than by any change in investment sentiment. In early trading the market was led forward by a modest premium on the FT-SE June contract against fair value. By the end of the session this premium had been largely eliminated and equities were left to drift off from their best levels. Seaq trading volume was sharply lower at 394.1m shares, against 621.4m on Friday. However, it was clear that the big institutions remain unwilling to sell stock and will buy shares at suitable prices. Hints that a significant corporate move is pending in the stock market resurfaced strongly in late dealings, although there was no general agreement on whether this would be a substantial fund-raising or a bid for a Footsie-listed stock. Expectations of further rights issues were unaffected by further relatively modest cash calls, notably for Pounds 96m from Morgan Crucible, the London-based industrial materials group. While the market was helped by the firmness on Wall Street on Friday, which reflected hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon cut US interest rates, investment optimism was a little more subdued in London yesterday. Friday's cut of half a point in UK base rates, followed by the reductions in house lending rates which will help the fight against inflation, has left the London stock market with little to look forward to in the immediate future. Further base rate reductions are assumed, but it is expected that these will wait for clear news of improvement in the core rate of domestic inflation. Oil shares again attracted support as last week's uptick in crude oil prices reversed some of the more bearish views on the sector taken recently by at least one leading UK securities house. International blue chip stocks were also firmer yesterday, despite the improvement in sterling which is a bearish factor for their overseas earnings. BAT Industries and Glaxo stood out well, with the weak feature provided by ICI, still overshadowed by bearish statements from the boardroom earlier this year.</p>

The pro-ration formula is as follows: The total number of scallop DAS in that year is divided by the percentage of the year the vessel was in the fishery (by month). In pro-rating the days for such vessels, the Regional Director shall take into account the date the vessel entered the fishery, the vessel's subsequent fishing history, and other relevant information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New owner.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vessel owners who purchased their vessel during the 1985&hyph;1990 time period may request that the DAS formulas be based solely on their individual history in the scallop fishery, excluding all previous owner's scallop histories. Under this option a vessel's first year in the fishery may be pro-rated based on the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For vessels qualifying for a limited access scallop permit under paragraph &sect;650.4(a)(1)(i)(C), pro-rate to a full year the total number of DAS for trips the vessel would have fished and landed over 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops in 1990 based on the actual number of DAS the vessel did fish in 1990 and the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Then, calculate the average number of DAS for trips landing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops for the years 1991 and 1992. The number of days to determine the category shall be the lower number between the pro-rated 1990 days and the average of DAS in 1991 and 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DAS allocations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each vessel qualifying for one of the three categories specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be allocated, annually, the maximum number of DAS it may participate in the limited access scallop fishery, according to the category for which it qualifies. A vessel whose owner/operator has declared it out of the scallop fishery pursuant to the provisions of &sect;650.26, or has used up its allocated DAS, may leave port without being assessed a DAS as long as it does not possess or land more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.61 hl) of in-shell scallops and complies with the other requirements of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual DAS allocations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The annual allocations of DAS for each category of vessel specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 6,L2,tp0,i1,s20,10,10,10,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1DAS category  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1 1994  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11995&hyph;96  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11997  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11998&hyph;99  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 12000+ <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Full-time  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 204  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 182  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 164  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 142  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 120 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part-time  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 82  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 66  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 57  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 48 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Occasional  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 18  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 16  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 14  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 12  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accrual of DAS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DAS shall accrue in hourly increments, with all partial hours counted as full hours.

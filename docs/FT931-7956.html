			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Management: Linking values to success A link between corporate values and good business performance has been claimed by more than one management guru in recent years. So it is perhaps encouraging that a survey* of executive opinion sponsored by the Digital Equipment Company reveals the widespread use of formal mission statements in the UK. Corporate values are defined as important beliefs widely held to be crucial to the success of an organisation. According to the Digital survey 80 per cent of 429 top managers interviewed last year say they have formal statements, a similar number believe these contribute directly to profitability, and 75 per cent see implementing them as one of their central responsibilities. Companies' top five priorities - defined both by the relative importance attached to a value and the scope seen for improvement - are people, competitiveness, customers, quality and productivity. More intriguingly their lowest priorities are social responsibility - mainly because there is perceived to be little room for behaving better  - and profitability. The low emphasis on profits sounds like defeatist talk in the midst of a recession. But the authors believe it may be that companies do not really see it as a value as such, or that profitability is the result of a value-driven strategy. The real test, of course, is whether mission statements are integrated into a company's day-to-day activities. Only 6 per cent of those interviewed openly admitted that corporate values make little practical difference, but 30 per cent confessed that short-term commercial gain gets priority if there is a conflict between the two. Interestingly the under 40s turned out to be more single minded in the pursuit of profit than their elders. *Copies of Corporate Values: The Bottom Line Contribution. Available from Bob Vickers.

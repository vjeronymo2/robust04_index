			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Re-export boost for Dubai ports Freight traffic at Dubai's two ports, Rashid and Jebel Ali, rose by 18 per cent in 1992 to 1.48m containers, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Traffic was buoyed by a big rise in electronics re-exports to former republics of the Soviet Union. The emirate's older Port Rashid handled some 800,000 containers and Jebel Ali the remainder.</p>

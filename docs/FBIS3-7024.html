Nor will it continue to consider itself bound by its  obligations to the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA].    In a statement to a SANA correspondent, the ambassador said  this follows the distortion by the United States and the IAEA of  the results of the recent inspection of its nuclear facilities.  This was used as a pretext to pressure the DPRK.    He said his government took this measure based on the  principles contained in the Korean-U.S. agreement reached in New  York on 25 February 1994 which stipulate a simultaneous move on  both sides to secure the full implementation of this agreement.    He said it is his government's firm and continuous position  not to abide by its pledges to the United States as long as the  latter is breaking its pledges.    The Korean ambassador noted that the United States resorted  to distorting and fabricating the issue dealing with the IAEA's  inspection. It used it as an excuse to resume joint military  maneuvers with South Korea and to threaten the use of force to  exert pressure against the Korean Government. Moreover, it  reveals a U.S. intention to have the UN Security Council impose  sanctions on his country. He said the United States should make  an accurate and responsible assessment of the current situation.    The ambassador expressed his deep appreciation of the  Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for supporting his  government's just and reasonable stand toward the nuclear issue.</p>

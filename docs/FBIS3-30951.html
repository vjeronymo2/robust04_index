			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Minister Granic [Croatian deputy  prime minister and foreign minister], [Bosnian Muslim] Prime  Minister Silajdzic, and General Roso [Bosnian Croat Army chief  of the General Staff] have signed a joint statement in Geneva.  Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will send letters to the UN  Security Council demanding international supervision of  Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders with the aim of finding a peaceful  solution. The two sides have agreed that the commanders of the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army,  Ante Roso and Rasim Delic respectively, will meet over the next  seven days to implement the agreement on an absolute cease-fire  between the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on all fronts as  the first step in resolving all issues of interest to the Croat  and Muslim peoples.    [Begin recording] [Granic] We are deeply aware of the  gravity  of the problem, especially in the field. Therein lies the great  importance of these meetings, because we discussed matters  openly and reviewed all burning issues. As you can see, utmost  priority has been given to ending all conflicts and exchanging  prisoners as soon as possible. However, we also discussed all  fundamental issues pertaining to overall Bosniak Muslim-Croat  relations and the agreements reached so far. We will go on  talking and we believe that we will be meeting again in the near  future. [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Silajdzic] First, I must say that we held  talks in a constructive atmosphere, in an encouraging  atmosphere, if I can put it that way, about very difficult and  complex issues. It is not that simple to find a solution. I  think that the beginning was good. We agreed, among other  things, to organize a meeting between military commanders within  the next seven days to discuss a permanent cease-fire. We  agreed that one of the main principles is the return to their  homes of all refugees -- whenever it is possible to control this  -- to talk seriously and to resume talks about the exchange of  prisoners and of the Mostar group in particular. We also agreed  to continue talks at all levels. [end recording] [passage  omitted]    [Begin recording] [Mile Akmadzic, minister for  interrepublic cooperation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna,  identified by caption] Under the auspices of cochairmen Lord  Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg, we talked about the possibility of  exchanging prisoners, restoring the energy-generating system in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and about humanitarian aid. However, the  focus of today's talks was the massacre in Sarajevo and the ways  of establishing who was responsible for it. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  delegation  in the talks with the Muslims consisted of Ministers Akmadzic  and Zubak and General Roso. After the agreement reached last  night about relations that are to be based on a union of three  republics and about the possibility of setting up counties,  provinces, regions, and cantons on an ethnic principle within  the republics and with a degree of autonomy, the Muslims are  again asking for something quite the opposite. They came up  with a proposal that failed to mention the republics in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is unacceptable to the Croats.    Observers here think that the map by Komsic [Croat member of  Bosnian Muslim delegation and member of Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency] is, among other things, a maneuver to gain time. The  Muslims have put forward a proposal similar to the Vance-Owen  plan under which the cantons or provinces -- whatever you want  to call them -- can be formed on an ethnic principle.    Some parts of the Komsic-Muslim proposal are unacceptable to  the Croats and some parts are unrealistic, sources close to the  delegation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna said.    Croats and others studied the proposed map of the cantons  and  reacted by saying that it had come too late. Among themselves  the republics should talk about protecting national minorities.  The best way of providing protection would be through cantons  and counties within autonomous units. Any decision by the Serbs  to leave the union would change the situation and more precise  solutions would then be needed.    Both the convention in Livno and the state of Croatia itself  support the EU plan, which was also endorsed by President  Clinton. President Clinton's envoy Redman and diplomat Tarnoff  are expected with interest here in Geneva.    The [Croat-Muslim] statement is of enormous importance at  this time of pressure from the international community and on  the eve of tomorrow's UN Security Council session on  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will help to create a climate more  conducive to defusing the tension between Croats and Muslims.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS VOTES NO ON PAY RAISE  </P> <P> Now that Congress has seen the errors of its ways and has rescinded the pay  raise so generously offered up by the Cutler Commission, it is time to examine  the phenomenon which has developed in Washington that is government by  commission.  </P> <P> Today, whenever Congress or the White House does not want to take the heat for  proposing unpopular policy, they simply appoint an "independent, blue-ribbon"  commission to "study" the matter and make a "recommendation." As we have seen  in some cases, a recommendation can simply become law unless Congress votes  against it.  </P> <P> Recently, when Congress and President Reagan wanted to close military bases  around the country, they ducked the responsibility and appointed a commission.  When affected communities throughout the country voiced protests, our  legislative and executive branches were able to wring their hands and adroitly  point toward "the commission."  </P> <P> For months now, we've been hearing about something called the National Economic  Commission. This "bipartisan" body has been charged with coming up with ways to  cure our deficit ills. The scenario will be something like this: Congress won't  be able to discern anything meaningful from the lips of President Bush and the  good old NEC will step in and speak for all of them. Guess what they're  recommendation's gonna be? (See: raise taxes.)  </P> <P> While we're talking reform regarding the legislative process, we should not  pass on this opportunity to stop our "representatives" from abdicating the  responsibility they were elected to discharge. Conferring such power of  governance upon unelected, amorphous bodies such as these silly commissions  makes the best case imaginable for denying these slackers the raises they've  whined about.  </P> <P> DONNIE G.

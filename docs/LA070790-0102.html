			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WALTRIP INJURED IN SEVEN-CAR CRASH  </P> <P> A seven-car crash during practice for today's Pepsi 400 stock car race at  Daytona Beach, Fla., sent former Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip to the  hospital with a broken leg, a broken elbow and a concussion.  </P> <P> Terry Labonte and Dave Marcis were less seriously injured in the accident in  which six cars, including three of the eight fastest qualifiers, were so badly  damaged that their owners will have to use backup cars in the race.  </P> <P> Waltrip, 43, who had qualified for his 500th start, instead will be sidelined  for at least two months after being admitted to the intensive surgical care  center at Halifax Medical Center in serious but stable condition.  </P> <P> Waltrip was unconscious when rescue workers reached his Chevrolet, but he  quickly regained consciousness. His car was hit on the driver's side door, and  most of the front end was torn off. Workers cut away the roof, pulled Waltrip  out and placed him on a stretcher.  </P> <P> Labonte and Marcis were treated at the hospital and released, and each said  they hoped to be well enough to start the race. Jimmy Horton, who has won four  consecutive Automobile Racing Club of America races on superspeedways this  year, will replace Waltrip.  </P> <P> Mark Martin, Ernie Irvan and Phil Barkdoll also crumpled their cars but were  not hurt. Bill Elliott cracked the front bumper on his Ford but was otherwise  unscathed.  </P></p>

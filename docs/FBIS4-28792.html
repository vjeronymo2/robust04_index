			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Moresby, June 14 (AFP) -- Hopes of a settlement  in Bougainville's bloody six-year civil war have risen,  following successful talks between senior Papua New Guinea  officials and rebel leaders at the weekend, officials said  Tuesday.    The talks held in the Solomon Islands and hailed as  historic,  were said to have ended with an agreement signed by both sides,  paving the way to fresh peace negotiations.    The negotiations will be aimed at ending the secessionist  conflict on Papua New Guinea's copper rich island province.    Some estimates have put the death toll in the area as high  as  3,000, with casualties occurring either in fighting between  rebels and Papua New Guinea forces, or indirectly through  neglect resulting from lack of adequate food and medical care.    Port Moresby was represented at the meeting in Honiara by  the  secretary of the prime minister's department, Brown Bai, and  foreign affairs secretary Gabriel Dusava while the self-styled  interim government of Bougainville was represented by Martin  Miriori, Mike Forster and Moses Havini.    Dusava confirmed the signing of the agreement but said  details would be released officially by foreign minister Sir  Julius Chan later this week.    According to reports from Honiara the agreement states: "The  purpose of this series of consultations is to pave way for peace  and that must be the ultimate objective of the meeting."    The interim government has meantime released a statement  saying certain undertakings were agreed on and signed by both  sides, a move which would open the way for further progressive  negotiations.    "I believe that there is now a real commitment to peace by  both sides," spokesman Mike Forster said.    "We are treading very carefully so as to keep both sides  happy as we approach the pan-Bougainville conference."    Forster said the meeting was only the second in what was  hoped would become a long series of consultative meetings aimed  at constructive measures to achieve peace.    "By the end of the consultations this time, there was a  sense  of trust and understanding between the two negotiators which had  been missing for years," Forster said.    Further talks may continue in Australia, he said.    Prime Minister Paias Wingti, "mindful" of two failed peace  accords since the outbreak of hostilities, is said to be taking  a cautious approach to the new dialogue.    He has said the talks would be low-key to avoid building up  false hope.    The agreement commits both sides to negotiations and to  implementing as soon as possible a schedule within which a  mechanism can be put in place for a peaceful settlement of the  crisis.    This latest development follows moves by Port Moresby to  seek  the assistance of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and the Solomons in  setting up a regional peacekeeping force to monitor the peace  process.    Each has agreed in principle to establishment of the force  which would use soldiers provided by Fiji, the Solomons and  Tonga.</p>

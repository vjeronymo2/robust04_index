			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Tax guru known for his dry wit Mr Tim Smith, who resigned yesterday as a junior Northern Ireland minister, enjoys a reputation at Westminster for excellent connections with the worlds of business and finance. However, his parliamentary career has been marred by claims from Labour MPs that he has asked parliamentary questions on behalf of companies for which he has acted as a paid consultant. Such an activity is within parliamentary rules if the MP declares his connection with the company in the Commons' register of members' interests. But Labour MPs have pointed out that the practice uses up considerable sums of public money when too many questions are tabled. Mr Smith, MP for the very safe seat of Beaconsfield, is an Oxford graduate who acted as a consultant for a variety of organisations in the 1980s. A former member of the public accounts committee, the tall old-Harrovian was once commended by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, for his 'unparalleled expertise on the tax system'. Before gaining office he held a variety of backbench posts, including parliamentary private secretary to Sir Leon Brittan. He is known as a dry wit with a casual charm and an occasionally rowdy sense of humour. Mr Smith has made no secret of his role as a consultant for a wide variety of companies, in particular Price Waterhouse, the accountants. He has openly declared his relationship with Price Waterhouse and is understood to have argued that the accountants' rivals learn something from the answers which ministers provide. Yesterday the firm confirmed that Mr Smith had acted as a paid consultant for it and vigorously defended the relationship. It said payments made to Mr Smith had covered his putting down parliamentary questions on its behalf. However, it refused to discuss the payments or the exact nature of the relationship. 'Mr Smith was paid as a consultant which involved him asking questions on our behalf. That is far removed from being paid to ask questions,' it said. Labour MPs raised complaints about the way Mr Smith was - quite legally - asking parliamentary questions in March 1988. He tabled 58 questions in two days asking ministers for details of computer contracts. In July 1988, Mr John Marek, a Labour MP, accused Mr Smith of tabling amendments to the finance bill on behalf of business clients. Two years later, another Labour MP, the late Bob Cryer, claimed that Mr Smith had tabled 32 questions on behalf of PW at a cost of about Pounds 3,000 to the taxpayer. However, it was the business relationship between 1986 and 1988 with Mr Mohamed Fayed, House of Fraser chairman, that led to his downfall. Mr Smith raised questions on behalf of Mr Fayed's interests during the war with Mr Tiny Rowland, the Lonrho chairman, over the takeover of House of Fraser in the 1980s. In April 1986, for example, he is reported to have complained about Mr Rowland's use of The Observer newspaper to further Lonrho's interests. Confirmation came yesterday that the relationship had not been officially declared.</p>

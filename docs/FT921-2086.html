			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Service industries show record drop in output THE SEVERITY of the recession was underlined yesterday by figures showing record reductions last year in output by service industries and in the underlying level of company investment. The Central Statistical Office also said that non-oil company profits excluding the recently-privatised electricity groups, fell last year by the largest amount for 17 years. Output by the service sector, which accounts for 60 per cent of the economy and includes retailing, transport and government services such as education, fell 1.6 per cent last year. This is only the second year since the CSO started records in 1950 in which services production has shown a fall. The CSO said investment by industrial and commercial companies, excluding electricity, fell 16 per cent in value terms last year - the highest since records began in 1963. Gross trading profits by industrial and commercial companies, leaving aside oil and electricity, came to Pounds 63.6bn last year after Pounds 67.7bn in 1990. The fall of 6 per cent in value terms was the biggest since a fall of 12 per cent in 1974. Last year the total economy shrank by a revised 2.4 per cent. Excluding North Sea oil and gas production, the contraction was 2.7 per cent. Within this, output by distributive services - including shops, hotels and catering - fell 3.2 per cent. Transport and communication fell 3.5 per cent while 'other services', including financial services and government activities, were flat. The only previous recorded service industries fall was in 1980, when output fell 0.4 per cent in the last recession. That recession had its biggest effect on manufacturing. Real personal disposable income - total consumers' income less tax - fell 0.4 per cent last year. This was the first decline since 1982. Other data indicated the reluctance of consumers in the final quarter of last year to increase spending, which has inhibited the economic recovery. In the final quarter consumer spending, accounting for two thirds of the economy, was flat compared with the previous three months. For the year it fell 1.7 per cent. In the fourth quarter the savings ratio - consumer savings as a proportion of disposable incomes - fell to 10 per cent after a revised 10.4 per cent in the third quarter and 11.3 per cent in the second quarter. For last year the savings ratio was 10.2 per cent against 9 per cent in 1990. Companies' total financial deficit fell to Pounds 10.9bn last year from Pounds 24.1bn the year before. The deficit in the fourth quarter was Pounds 1.7bn - only slightly down from the figure in the third quarter.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Agreements on Reaching Civic Accord in Russia /8 </F> Blocks-Pages/ Draft/ Version 1/ 27.03.94" -- ITAR-TASS headline]    [Text] Russia now needs civic accord as never before. The  tasks ahead are too complicated and difficult to squander the  strength of society in political confrontation. There will be  no victors in an irreconcilable struggle. There can only be one  result of such struggle -- the destruction of Russia and  suffering of millions of Russian people.    There are no such problems in Russia which cannot be  resolved  without intensifying tension in society or resorting to violence  or riding rough shod over the laws and common sense. Dialogue,  consultations and negotiations, the search for meeting points  and common positions and sensible compromises should become the  fundamental norm of public and political life.    Civic accord should be reached on the basis of respect for  various world views, political convictions, national and  cultural traditions, and the dignity of the individual.    In order to reach civic accord the president of the Russian  Federation, the Federal Assembly, the goverment, the constituent  parts of the Russian Federation, political parties, trade unions  and other public organizations conclude this agreement.  <H5>  I. Political Life in Society </H5>   1. In their activities the sides pledge to adhere strictly  to the principles of democracy, civic society, federalism,  law-governed state, the separation of powers and the priority of  human rights and liberties.    The sides view the Russian Federation Constitution in force  as the foundation of Russia's legal system and statehood.  Emphasizing the necessity to observe the constitution, the  sides will make use of the multilateral conciliation procedures  to study and disseminate the experience of its application and  to coordinate the elaboration of constitutional amendments.    In order to ensure civic accord the sides pledge to refrain  from introducing into the Constitution such amendments as would  destabilize the situation in society.    2. The sides regard as the foremost task a joint elaboration  of electoral laws, the law on parties and the law on referendum.  The sides take upon themselves the obligation not to initiate  political campaigns in order to carry out early elections of  federal bodies of power not provided for in the Constitution  currently in force.    3. In all their activities, including political activities,  the sides pledge to renounce violence in all its forms as a  means of resolving problems that emerge in society. The sides  pledge not to appeal for violence, nor to kindle social,  national or religious strife, nor to suppress or oppress those  of dissenting views nor to incite citizens to it. Those who  organize rallies, demonstrations or strikes assume  responsibility for a peaceful nature of these events and for  staging them in strict compliance with the laws.    The sides regard it as their duty to prompt all forces in  society to get involved in the process of ensuring there is calm  in the country and that a spirit of cooperation is created.    4. The sides pledge to refuse to use the mass media in an  uncivilised or an incorrect manner in order to further their  political interests.    5. With due consideration for the grandeur of Russian  history, its heroic and tragic pages, the contribution of the  generations of our citizens who gave their strengths to serving  the Fatherland, the sides will avoid offensive assessments of  the past and mud slinging. The sides appeal not to use  assessments of the events in August 1991 and in September and  October 1993 as reasons to deepen confrontation and opposition.  <H5>  II. Regional policy </H5>   1. The sides regard it as necessary immediately to take  measures to:    - Strengthen the unity of Russia's economic, political and  legal space;    - coordinate the activities of regional authorities in the  solution of tasks which go beyond the remit of individual  regions;    - establish a single labor market on the basis of an  unswerving observance of the code of labor laws, conventions and  recommendations of the International Labor Organization  throughout the country;    - to compensate the regions from the budget for the  consequences of the decisions by the federal state bodies in  such cases when regional interests have been made to suffer in  the process of pursuing statewide interests.    2. the sides agree that it is necessary to adopt the  following federal laws:    - On the general principles of organizing representative and  executive power in the components of the federation;    - on the principles of the demarcation of powers and areas  of authority between the federal level and the components of the  federation;    - on the principles of local self-government.    3. The parties recognize the need to widen the economic  independence of the components of the federation by means of  strengthening the taxation base of their budgets and federal  guarantees of the per-capita minimum of the region's budget  through the federal subsidy fund. At the same time the  responsibility of the power bodies of the components of the  federation for collecting federal taxes on their territories is  being enhanced.    4. The parties emphasize that implementation of the rights  of the components of the federation is possible only if the  country's state integrity and its political, economic and legal  unity are guaranteed. To this end the components of the  federation agree to refrain from altering their constitutional  status in the course of two years.    The constitutions, charters and other legislative acts of  the  subjects of the federation will be drawn up in accordance with  -- and elaborated anew in strict accordance with -- the federal  Constitution.    The federal and regional power bodies declare a moratorium  on  the signing of bilateral treaties between them on the  demarcation of areas of authority and powers until the adoption  of a federal law on the principles of the demarcation of powers  and areas of authority between the federal and regional bodies  of state power.    5. The parties emphasize that, with the objective of  strengthening local self-government, a package of federal laws  should be elaborated and adopted in the first half-year,  envisaging as follows:    - The general principles of the organization and functioning  of bodies of local self-government;    - the guarantees of the independence of local  self-government bodies in solving local issues;    - the provision by local self-government of an independent  taxation base and the right to establish the normatives of  payments into their own budget, with guarantees of a budget  minimum on the part of the state;    - the rights of local self-government bodies to  participate in solving problems common to the regions and to  Russia as a whole.  <H5>  III. Ethnic Policy </H5>   1. The sides pledge that they will abide strictly by the  principle whereby the source of power in component parts of the  federation is their multi-ethnic population; representatives of  no ethnic community have the exclusive right to assume control  over the territory, institutes of power or resources.    2. The sides will support various specific forms of  self-organization in the ethnic communities, excluding those  which are destructive to state unity and territorial integrity  of the Russian Federation. The sides think that national  associations [natsionalnyye assotsiatsii], unions  [ob'yedineniya], fellowships [zemlyachestva] and other types of  national-cultural unions are in need of a special state support  scheme.    3. The sides stress that the carrying out of social and  economic changes in the areas inhibited by small peoples and  ethnic groups should be accompanied by a complex of measures  aimed at retaining their traditional lifestyle.    4. The sides think that it is necessary to reinforce state  and public supervision of the observance of human rights as far  as nationalities' matters are concerned, not to allow and to  avert any manifestations of ethnic, racial or religious  discrimination.    5. The sides call upon national movements and parties to  declare a moratorium on demanding border changes and the  established administrative and territorial division.    6. The sides acknowledge their obligation to protect  actively the rights and interests of Russians living in other  states, and to receive and make provision for compatriots  resettling in Russia, providing them with all-round support.  <H5>  IV. Socioeconomic Policy </H5>   The sides agree that their joint efforts should be directed  toward overcoming the socioeconomic crisis and continuation of  the economic reform in the interests of Russia's population. In  order to stabilize the socioeconomic situation in 1994 the  following urgent problems must be solved:    - Achieving a steady, predictable and controllable level of  inflation;    - overcoming the nonpayments crisis;    - ensuring the necessary level of social protection, the  efficiency and precise targeting of social aid;    - stopping the general decline of production levels before  the year ends;    - starting the positive structural transformations and  increasing investment activity;    - strengthening economic cooperation within the CIS  framework;    - strengthening the country's position in the world market.    The sides believe that a standing economic conference should  be set up in order to elaborate the agreed proposals in the  sphere of economic policy for the period this agreement remains  in force. Those attending it should be representatives of the  president, the government, the Central Bank of Russia, the  Federation Council, the State Duma, the main professional  associations of the working people and the associations of  manufacturers and entrepreneurs.    Over the next two months the economic conference is to  prepare specific proposals on current problems in economic  policy, which will be submitted to the president and the  Federation Council.    For the duration of the economic stabilization measures:    1. The trade unions, their associations and organizations of  their members undertake not to carry out and not to take part in  organizing strikes for the purpose of redistributing budget  finances or allocating subsidies or benefits from state credits  or taxation to individual industries or territories, or for  other purposes having nothing directly to do with wages, working  conditions or saving jobs.    2. Associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs and their  members undertake to refrain from unjustified stoppages of  activities and production, the breaking of commitments to  suppliers and customers, to the budget and banks, and the misuse  of state investment resources.    3. Organs of state power, associations of manufacturers and  entrepreneurs and their members undertake to attend conciliation  procedures for the settlement of labor disputes, to provide the  trade unions with sufficient information about the state of the  relevant budgets and the position of enterprises, and to ensure  that the trade unions have the organizational back-up for their  statutory activities.  <H5>  V. The Security of Citizens and the State </H5>   1. The parties consider the guarantee of the individual  security of the citizens and the fight against organized crime  and corruption to be the most important task. The parties  pledge to provide the necessary legal base to solve the problem  of crime and to carry out the reform of the law-enforcement  bodies.    2. The parties pledge to prevent:    - The irreversible technological lagging behind and  isolation  of the country's economy from the world economy;    - the social regression and disintegration of society and  the destruction of the environment;    - the reduction in defense capability and the weakening of  the social protection of military servicemen, persons discharged  to the reserve and members of their families.    3. The parties oppose the creation of any kind of armed and  militarized formations by political parties and movements and  public and commercial organizations, and should they be so  created to call for their immediate disbandment.    4. The sides consider attempts to draw the state's military  structures into supporting political programs and demands to be  illegal and immoral.    5. The sides consider the reform of the army and navy an  urgent task facing the state and society. The sides undertake  to ensure the elaboration of the concept for the armed forces'  move to a professionally based service.    6. The sides support the participation of political parties,  movements and public organizations in the elaboration of the  concept of national security during the transition period.    7. The sides undertake to help achieve the cessation of  armed conflicts and support stability in the states bordering  Russia.  <H5>  VI. Spiritual, Moral, Ethical and Cultural Values </H5>   The sides emphasise that the love for the Fatherland,  freedom  and the moral duty to the country and society, religious and  humanistic values and creative work should become the basis for  the resurrection of Russia. To reassert these values tirelessly  is a matter not just for every member of society, but for the  state. The sides pledge:    1. To restore and propagate Russia's ancient spiritual and  moral traditions, to assert by words and deeds the norms of  moral conduct in politics, the economy and social life. The  mass media and educational, scientific and cultural  establishments and religious organizations, the efforts of which  should meet with state and public support, have a special role  to play in this process.    2. To pursue agreed policies in the area of the moral,  spiritual, cultural, patriotic and aesthetic upbringing of  children and young people. To identify potential to stimulate  children's and young people's creativity, physical education and  sport, to organize leisure time for children and adolescents,  for which purpose the relevant activities by public, religious  and other organizations should be encouraged.    3. To facilitate the preservation of the system of free  basic, specialized secondary and vocational technical education  and also to prevent a decline in the existing level of financing  of higher education. To encourage the establishment of  non-state establishments affording general access to higher  education to prepare specialists for vitally important areas of  the economy, public life, science, culture and education.    4. To identify resources to finance cultural and scientific  establishments at a level commensurate with developed countries.  In subsidizing these establishments, preference is to be given  to structures which implement priority state programs and which  do not have alternative sources of financing that would ensure  the survival of these structures.    5. To provide a taxation policy on favorable terms with  regard to scientific, cultural, educational and health  establishments. With the help of corresponding taxation benefits  to encourage the provision of charitable assistance to  educational, scientific and cultural establishments and  religious organizations.    6.

To elaborate a mechanism for implementing the provisions of  the present agreement a conciliation commission is being formed  from the plenipotentiary representatives of the Russian  Federation president, the government, the chambers of the  Federal Assembly, factions of the State Duma and also a number  of prominent public and cultural figures.    In order for the conciliation commission to work through  specific issues, conferences, round tables and temporary working  groups are being organized.

The conciliation commission monitors the compliance with the  provisions enshrined in the agreement and establishes facts of  violation of the provisions of the agreement by one or several  parties.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Second section outperforms as Nikkei index recovers Bargain hunting and arbitrage buying supported share prices and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 130.23 up at 19,391.68 after fluctuating in a narrow range between 19,432.59 and 19,314.76. Brokerage dealers and domestic institutions purchased shares, but foreign investors turned net sellers. Sentiment stayed subdued, with many investors remaining cautious ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and volume eased from 229m shares to 219m. The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 10.82 to 1,528.64 and the Nikkei 300 moved forward 2.10 to 280.80, while rises outnumbered falls by 738 to 219, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.06 to 1,259.44. Traders said speculative investors, discouraged by the low volatility in the first section, explored the second section and the over-the-counter market. A branch manager at Nikko Securities said he would recommend that clients focus on small-capitalisation stocks on the second section and in the OTC market backed by strong earnings growth. The second section index climbed 35.25 or 1.7 per cent to 2,147.11. Privatisation issues, which had been battered by recent profit-taking, staged a rally. Reports that the government had abandoned the plan to list West Japan Railways in the current fiscal year cheered market participants. Japan Tobacco recouped Y30,000 at Y991,000 on buying by corporate investors, breaking out after six straight sessions of decline. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y12,000 at Y876,000. Brokers, which have been hurt by the recent drop in the stock market, advanced. Nomura Securities rose Y60 to Y1,930 and Nikko Securities Y30 to Y1,030. Steels and shipbuilders were actively traded but finished mixed. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, moved up Y3 to Y385 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries added Y9 at Y749. NKK dipped Y4 to Y276. High-technology stocks were firm. NEC improved Y20 to Y1,180 and Hitachi Y4 to Y974. Sony rose Y30 to Y5,780, but Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y10 to Y1,530 in spite of strong consolidated earnings growth. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 143.89 at 21,437.47 in volume of 58m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, rose Y120 to Y2,420. Roundup Senior markets, in particular, were inspired by Wall Street's overnight gains and prospects following an expected rise in US interest rates. Jakarta, hosting the APEC summit, was closed for the second day in succession before reopening today. HONG KONG rose 2 per cent, the Hang Seng index climbing 186.74 to 9,565.66 and turn-over more than doubling to HKDollars 3.91bn from Monday's four-month low of HKDollars 1.78bn. However, the view remained that the US situation offered trading, rather than investment, potential. Concerns over US inflation data and rates trends over the longer term were expected to linger after the US credit tightening move widely expected yesterday. Recently weak banks and property shares attracted the most attention, with HSBC, the most active stock, appreciating HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 91.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.25 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 49.90. KUALA LUMPUR reported strong retail and institutional buying as the KLSE index rose 25.43 or 2.4 per cent to 1,069.74, its largest single-day gain in more than three months. Volume swelled to 299m shares, its highest in four weeks, from Monday's 132m. Brokers said the market had factored in a 50 basis-point increase in US interest rates, but that a larger rise could put some pressure on the market. Meanwhile, Baring Securities market strategist Mr Alan Butler-Henderson said in his Tiger Talk monthly that the Malaysian market would have the 'best bounce' after any US interest rate increase. BANGKOK surged as the market finally discounted expectations of a rise in US interest rates, and the SET index closed 19.01 better at 1,496.85 in heavy turnover of Bt8.69bn. Buying interest emerged initially in the finance sector, and spilled over to some property issues. SINGAPORE ended off intraday highs, the Straits Times Industrial index finally standing 14.24 up at 2,341.18. Foreign held bank shares were firm, Overseas Union Bank foreign gaining 25 cents at SDollars 8.75, United Overseas Bank foreign 20 cents at SDollars 16.30 and Overseas Chinese Bank foreign 50 cents at SDollars 15.80. WELLINGTON was led down by forestry stocks Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey as the NZSE-40 index retreated 11.98 to 2,042.63. Fletcher finished 14 cents off at NZDollars 4.12 after some forecasters downgraded their expectations, and Carter slipped 6 cents to NZDollars 3.78 in sympathy. Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three British Columbia pulp and paper mills voted on Monday in favour of strike action over working conditions, which would not have helped the stock's tone, said brokers. SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index rallied 15.0 to 1,941.4, with brokers noting bargain hunting in resource stocks following the heavy selling in this sector in the previous few days. Among the day's best performers, BHP moved ahead 20 cents to ADollars 19.10, CRA 18 cents to ADollars 17.84 and MIM 6 cents to ADollars 2.54. In the media section, News Corp was down 4 cents at ADollars 5.34 after losing an early gain, but Fairfax advanced 12 cents to ADollars 2.72. KARACHI sagged at the close as market sentiment remained depressed by fears of ethnic violence in Karachi, political uncertainty and shortage of funds. The KSE 100-share index fell 18.67 or 0.9 per cent to 2,178.91. SHANGHAI's A share index declined sharply after Beijing denied reports that it planned to allow pension funds to be invested in the domestic market. The index dropped 29.8 or 3.9 per cent to a day's low of 724.55.</p>

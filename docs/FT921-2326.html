			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Rentokil Rentokil has made itself a hostage to fortune by promising annual earnings growth of 20 per cent. The target was comfortably exceeded in 1991, but it will become ever more demanding as inflation recedes. So it is natural to question its long-term prospects, especially since one possible route to higher profits  - squeezing margins  - is approaching exhaustion. The margin on environmental services, which make up most of the business, climbed to over 28 per cent in last year's second half. That is pushing against what even the company admits is the ceiling. Happily, Rentokil also managed a healthy level of organic growth, even in the depressed Anglo-Saxon markets. There should be further scope from that quarter, while the company has plenty of cash to finance a steady flow of small acquisitions. But it will become increasingly dependent on such a diet and much depends on whether enough opportunities emerge. Failure to keep up the pace would be a clear warning of faltering growth down the road. A historic multiple of 25 suggests the market is unperturbed about Rentokil's ability to meet its growth target for the next five years or so. By 1997, however, it should be growing profits from a base of at least Pounds 235m. Given that Rentokil shares were the 13th best performer in the FT-SE over the past year, they will only appear cheap to those who believe that momentum can be maintained even after 1997. Rentokil must be approaching the point where there is more risk than sure reward.</p>

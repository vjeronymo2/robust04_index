			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / BA chief attacks Virgin court action BRITISH AIRWAYS chairman Sir Colin Marshall yesterday attacked Virgin Atlantic Airways for its continued pursuit of legal action over the 'dirty tricks' his airline played on it. Sir Colin, pictured with some of the board at BA's annual meeting in London, denied prior knowledge of the 'dirty tricks' and renewed his call for arbitration. He said: 'We do not believe that what was done caused significant damage to Virgin or brought significant benefit to BA.' Virgin Atlantic chief Mr Richard Branson dismissed the offer. 'We might just as well decide the matter by having a trans-atlantic hot air balloon race,' he said, referring to an earlier exploit of his. 'I think it is looking more and more inevitable that it will end up in court. You have to ask why BA wants the battle to be fought before an arbitrator and not in the courts,' Mr Branson added. 'It is like Napoleon asking Wellington if he would move the battle of Waterloo to a more convenient spot once fighting had already begun.' BA on the offensive, Page 19; Lex, Page 18.</p>

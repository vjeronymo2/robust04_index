			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sprint puts Dollars 350m into network Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telephone company, has announced plans to spend Dollars 350m over the next three years to double the capacity of its 23,500-mile network, using advanced digital transmission technology. The group said the upgrade would provide its customers with the ability to send voice, video and data traffic over its network simultaneously at speeds of up to 2.5 gigabits per second. A further upgrade to 10 gigabits per second is planned as capacity demands increase. Sprint said it had selected Alcatel Network Systems and NEC America to provide synchronous optical network, or Sonet, transport equipment and optical amplifiers to boost the capacity of its network. Sonet equipment will be installed at each of the 338 locations where Sprint's long-distance network connects with regional telephone services. Sonet is the transport element of Sprint's broadband network design which was announced in 1992. This also employs asynchronous transport mode switching technology.</p>

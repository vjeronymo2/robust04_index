			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Rocard set to quit French post Mr Michel Rocard was yesterday said by aides to be preparing to resign as mayor of Conflans St Honorine, a small town outside Paris, which is the former Socialist party leader's last elected post in French politics. His impending resignation in favour of Mr Jean-Paul Huchon, his deputy mayor and righthand man at the Socialist party, would appear to reflect his growing disenchantment with politics. Mr Rocard was ousted as party leader on June 19 after he led the Socialists into a heavy defeat in the European parliament elections, though he himself won a seat in the Strasbourg assembly. But aides said Mr Rocard was not planning to quit politics altogether. His ouster from the Socialist leadership has left wide open the question of who will be the party's presidential candidate next year, unless Mr Jacques Delors, the retiring European Commission president, decides to run. Until the mantle of the presidential candidacy settles definitively on someone else, Mr Rocard may be keeping open the option of a come-back.</p>

This cooperative farm set a target a few years ago for all  farmers to learn how to operate tractors and other farm machines  and sent 520 farmers to the Sukchon agricultural mechanization  school to study while working on the occasion of the 30th  anniversary of the publication of the rural theses.    Managerial and junior officials of the farm and three  revolution team members dispatched there themselves learned how  to drive tractors, leading farmers.    Thus, 520 farmers have graduated from the school and been  able to operate all farm machines.</p>

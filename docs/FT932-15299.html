			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hostile Pounds 1.2m bid made for Plateau Mining A HOSTILE bid was made last night for Plateau Mining, the former natural resources company which is now a shell with no employees, no liabilities or overheads but more than Pounds 1m in cash. The all-share bid, worth Pounds 1.2m, is by Kingstream Resources, a small Australian exploration company which wants Plateau's cash to pay for a feasibility study for an integrated iron ore mine and a steel mini-mill project in Western Australia. The offer, of 1 Kingstream ordinary for every 8 Plateau ordinary, values each Plateau share at 2.62p compared with the recent suspension price of 3p. Plateau was floated at 90p a share in January 1990. Guinness Mahon, acting for Plateau, described the Kingstream offer as 'unbelievable' because, not only was it hostile, but it also offered less than the cash in the company. Kingstream is being advised by Ionian Corporate Finance.</p>

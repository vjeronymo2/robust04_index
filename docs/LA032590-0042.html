			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: MICHELIN'S NEWEST STARS IN FRANCE  </P> <P> The 1990 Guide Michelin for France was published March 12 and, as usual,  contained a few surprises. Chief among these was the elevation of Alain  Ducasse's Louis XV at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo to coveted three-star  status. At 33, Ducasse is Michelin's youngest three-star chef. The guidebook  moved unusually fast in promoting him -- he's only been at the restaurant since  1986, and was virtually unknown before then.  </P> <P> The most famous chef in Ducasse's neighborhood, Jacques Maximin, was doubtless  surprised at Louis XV's promotion, too. In his years at Chantecler in Nice's  Hotel Negresco, Maximin was given top status by almost everybody -- except  Michelin. The third star was withheld, according to widespread rumors, because  his restaurant was part of a large hotel, and thus he couldn't devote proper  attention to each plate. Since the younger, less-famous Ducasse is also  installed in a hotel dining room, another possibility has been raised: that the  guidebook simply never thought Maximin quite good (or consistent) enough for  three stars.  </P> <P> In any case, Maximin was given two stars for his new establishment in Nice,  called simply Maximin. (Maximin was not elevated from one to two stars, as  reported in the New York Times, incidentally, since his place opened only last  year and didn't appear in the '89 Michelin.)  </P> <P> In other Michelin news, Oustau de Baumaniere in Les Baux-de-Provence was  demoted from three to two stars -- surprising no one. Le Vieux Moulin in  Bouilland, near Beaune, was among those elevated from one to two stars; Le Pre  Catelan and Le Petit Bedon in Paris were among those demoted from two stars to  one; and Amphycles, one of the hottest new restaurants in Paris, was given its  first star -- as did some 47 other places around France.  </P> <P> EAT TO GIVE: Friday, the Women's Culinary Alliance hosts its second annual  Dining for Dollars. It's not a food and wine festival, but a program by which  more than 40 L.A. area restaurants donate 10% of their gross dinner (or, if  they're not open for dinner, lunch) receipts to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation.  Participants range from Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom and Dem Bones Bar-B-Q  Shack to Spago and Citrus. Others include Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, Campanile,  Beau Rivage, the Chin Chin restaurants, Indigo and Maxine's Seafood Cafe. Lew  Mitchell's Orient Express and Palette will donate 15% of their dinner receipts,  and Pennyfeather's plans on giving 20%. Zabie's in Santa Monica will serve a  special sit-down dinner Friday and Saturday with all proceeds donated. And  Salisbury Manor in Los Angeles will offer a special menu with entertainment;  its waiters have agreed to donate their tips, too.  </P> <P> WINE DINNERS: Monday is a good night for wine drinkers. At Fino in Torrance,  Chalone wines are featured at a $55-a-head wine dinner. . . . Also tomorrow,  for $45 a head, Belle Vue in Santa Monica offers a six-course repast featuring  Napa Creek wines.  </P></p>

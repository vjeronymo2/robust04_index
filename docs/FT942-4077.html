			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner tumbles to NKr54m Bergesen, Norway's largest shipowner, yesterday reported a steep fall in pre-tax profits for the first four months, to NKr54m (Dollars 7.5m) from NKr212m in the same period last year, reflecting weaker markets for tankers and LPG carriers. The company was uncertain about the outlook for the rest of the year. 'No significant change is expected in the tanker market this summer. If break-up (scrapping) activity continues, there could be an improvement in the autumn,' it said. Group operating revenue fell by NKr81m to NKr865m. Operating profit, before depreciation costs, was reduced by NKr83m to NKr182m. Taking depreciation costs of NKr212m into account, against NKr191m, Bergesen fell to a loss of NKr30m at the net operating level, from a profit of NKr74m. The result was bolstered by foreign-exchange income of NKr124m against NKr91m last year. Tankers suffered an increase in operating losses, to NKr104m from NKr69m, while LPG carriers saw operating profits cut by more than half to NKr51m from NKr121.</p>

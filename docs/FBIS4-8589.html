			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter addressed to the newspapers ALEANCA, KOHA JONE, </F> RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, ZERI I POPULLIT, and DITA INFORMACION by  Shyqyri Cela; date and place not given: "Public Order Minister  Agron Musaraj and Shkoder National Intelligence Service Chief  Fitim Meta Asked Me To Have My Brother Selami Cela Wounded To  Excuse Gjovalin Cekini's Tragic Murder"]    [Text] I, Shyqyri Cela, former Democratic Party deputy  elected in Mat District on 22 March 1992, and police chief in  Shkoder immediately after the elections, an appointment that  obliged me to hand in my mandate as deputy, feel obliged to  address the press to condemn the low machinations of Public  Order Minister Agron Musaraj, and Fitim Meta, National  Intelligence Service [ShIK] chief in Shkoder, in covering up and  excusing the murder of Gjovalin Cekini in Shkoder on 14 January.    Much has been said and written in the press and in public  about this tragic murder that shocked the Cekini family,  Unfortunately, according to what witnesses have written, my  brother Selami Cela was involved in this tragedy.    I know that Selami was not at the Democratic alliance  meeting  on 14 January, nor in any group involved in breaking up this  meeting. While the meeting was taking place in the Midjeni  Theater, he was with his friends in a cafe in the Rus quarter.  A policeman found him there, and asked Selami to take him in  his car to the Migjeni Theater. Selami agreed; when his car  reached the front of the theater, he saw the participants in the  meeting emerging. From the published testimonies of relatives  of the late Gjovalin Cekini, I have learned that Selami traded  harsh words and insults with the people coming out of the  theater. Somebody hit him in the jaw, and he began to turn back  toward Radio Shkoder. He also drew his revolver but did not  fire it, continuing to move backwards while facing Gjovalin  Cekini, who was begging him not to shoot. It was at this moment  that Gjovalin Cekini was shot down and killed. Everyone  believes this sincere testimony of one of Gjovalin Cekini's  relatives, who saw the events of 14 January with his own eyes.  I too believe it, not simply out of relief that my brother was  not the killer, but because it is the testimony of one of those  most affected, who was at the scene of the crime. As for the  relief, I want to say that my family and I remained distressed  that one of us was involved for no reason at all in a quarrel  that came to a tragic end. The fact that he was slightly drunk,  as his friends have told me, is no excuse.    Many people know what I have just written, but what I am  about to write is known only to one or two of my close friends.  I want everybody to know, because everybody should know.    What happened after Gjovalin Cekini's murder? On 17 January,  three days after the incident, Public Order Minister Agron  Musaraj summoned me urgently to Tirana. I was somewhat  surprised. I had been unemployed and without pay for about 18  months. This minister had not replied to my requests for a  meeting, for a job, and for an explanation of why I had been  left in the lurch. Nevertheless, I went to the ministry. In  the presence of two or three other people, Mr. Musaraj very  courteously lamented the fact that I had been left unemployed  and immediately suggested that I should start work at once as a  lecturer at the Police College. I was in great need of work,  but the circumstances under which the suggestion was made  floored me. All Shkoder and the entire press were mentioning my  brother as implicated in the murder of an innocent lad from an  ordinary, poor family. It was at such a time that I was being  offered work in Tirana. Agron Musaraj blithely went on to make  me another proposal, without imagining that he was offending or  dishonoring me. In exchange for a lecturer's job, he told me to  hand in my brother, implying that the matter of 14 January would  be smoothed over. I did not know where my brother was, and had  not even seen him. Only our mother had seen him just before he  left home.    Minister Musaraj did not want a reply there and then in his  office, but gave me three days to think about it. However, he  did not wait three days. On the following day, 18 January, he  arrived in Shkoder and asked me to go to the police station.  This man who disgraces the office of minister, together with  ShlK chief Fitim Meta, asked me for something that day that I  would never have believed if I had not heard it with my own  ears. They told me that my brother had been wounded, and had  committed the murder in self-defense. My flesh crept. My  mother had told me that Selami was not wounded, and in fact  nobody had threatened his life opposite the Midjeni Theater.  How could I agree to such disgraceful bargaining over the blood  of an innocent, just-buried victim? Fitim Meta, thinking that I  had failed to understand the trick, put it bluntly: "We will  wound Selami, and then bring him to trial, where it will be  demonstrated that he killed in self-defense. We will put him  inside for a little while, then release him, and that will be an  end of the matter."    This is not the language of human beings, but of criminals.  They wanted us to take upon ourselves a blood-score. They  wanted to conclude the murder of 14 January in such a  disgraceful fashion. The two people who planned this were  highlevel officials of this state and members of this government  for which I too had voted as a Democratic Party deputy. The  earth almost gave way beneath me. At that moment, it became  clear to me that my brother was not the direct murderer. It was  clear to me that Gjovalin Cekini's murder really did have a  political hue. The public order minister and the ShIK chief  were trying to cover up this murder in a criminal fashion, and  they did not turn a hair at involving another person, even  offering me a good job in Tirana.    I left these unscrupulous people. I did not and did not wish  to see their faces again. I thought I was rid of them, but this  was not entirely the case. They manage and govern with  incomparable hypocrisy, and people who trust them do not know  how wicked they are. I knew, and now had proof that was  poisoning my life as long as I kept it to myself. I could not  refrain from telling a few close friends, and thus word began to  get around. Then these "angels" revealed their true faces, and  used someone from Kukes to try to liquidate me in an attempted  assassination.    However, I did not wish to vanish without telling the truth,  which is very bitter not only for myself who experienced it, but  for all Albanians who do not wish to see their country setting  out on the path of crime and in the hands of such immoral and  unprincipled people as Agron Musaraj. The truth will require me  again, but I am no longer safe here and I cannot entrust my life  to criminals invested with power. I am therefore leaving  Albania with a broken heart, but with the hope that justice and  genuine democracy will not be long in coming.</p>

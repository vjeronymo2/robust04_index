			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee  for Comprehensive Management of Social Security and the Justice  Ministry have jointly issued a circular on intensifying public  security and law propagation during the Spring Festival.    The circular says: China today enjoys political stability  and economic growth, the people live in peace and work in  contentment, and the reform of the economic and political  administrative systems are continuing. Nevertheless, we must  soberly realize that we cannot afford to be optimistic about the  state of security in certain places and departments. This is  particularly true during the Spring Festival period when people  will visit their families and friends, schools will be closed  for holidays, and there will be all kinds of celebration  activities. Lawless elements will take advantage of these  opportunities to steal, rob, practice hooliganism, and abduct  women and children; and such residual phenomena as gambling,  prostitution, patronage of prostitutes, feudal superstitious  habits, and other social viles are likely to resurface. Thus,  leading party and government authorities must exert great  efforts to ensure social security and intensify law propagation  during the Spring Festival and consider this project an  important assignment for safeguarding social stability. Plans  should be drawn up and performance should be accessed  collectively so that the people will have a peaceful and happy  Spring Festival.    The circular urges all committees for comprehensive  management of social security and judicial departments to work  in conjunction with party committee propaganda departments to  launch a project to publicize the law during the Spring  Festival. It says: We should fully take advantage of radio and  TV broadcasts, newspapers, and other modern mass media as well  as literary and art shows and other projects, such as holding a  propaganda week (or day), to publicize the significance of  intensifying social security; to publicize "PRC Criminal Law"  articles about punishment for conduct that endangers public  safety, violates citizens' personal freedom and democratic  rights, and infringes upon others' property; and also publicize  the "PRC Regulations for Controlling Public Offenses" so that  the masses will be reminded to abide by Chinese laws and  regulations and take an active part in comprehensive management  of social security, so that we will all understand our  responsibility and work with various departments and units to  safeguard social security.    The circular says: We must count on the masses and give full  scope to the roles played by grass-roots units -- such as  neighborhood and village committees, and crime squads formed by  the masses -- to discover lawless conduct in time and harshly  and promptly crack down on crimes which seriously undermine  social security and order. All committees for comprehensive  management of social security must coordinate with various other  units to work with public security authorities to ensure  security during the Spring Festival. Judicial authorities at all  levels must intensify their control of and assistance and  education for personnel undergoing reform or education through  labor and take the initiative to assist public security  authorities and party and government departments in placing,  assisting, and educating those who are on probation.  Grass-roots mediation organizations must actively provide  mediation services so that factors that may sharpen  contradictions will be nipped in the bud.</p>

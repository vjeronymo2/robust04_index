			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Crueller realities of life at the top / Assessing the political damage caused by the week's events to John Major and Norman Lamont Mr John Major is wounded, but not fatally. The same cannot yet be said of Mr Norman Lamont. The chancellor is to stay for now at No 11. We should not underestimate the prime minister's loyalty to his colleagues  - witness his stubborn defence of the unfortunate Mr David Mellor. But Mr Lamont, like the heritage secretary, has lost the authority to go with the job. There is no justice in the assessment. It was the prime minister who staked his government's reputation on DM2.95. It is he who must live with the agonising echoes of a speech just a week ago in which he likened devaluation to betrayal of the nation's future. Mr Lamont was never in his heart convinced there was no alternative to the ERM. He did more than was asked of him in defending the policy. But those who argue that he cannot be the scapegoat for the failure of the government's economic strategy miss the crueller political reality. The awesome task facing the government is to rebuild something that resembles a coherent policy on the economy and Europe. The judgment of his peers is that Mr Lamont cannot recover the political authority such a task will demand of the chancellor. They may be proved wrong. Mr Lamont is a resilient politician. He is utterly determined to stay. But as of now the consensus at Westminster runs as follows: if Mr Douglas Hurd is discounted, there are only two members of the cabinet equal to the present challenge - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine. At a pinch Mr Michael Howard can be added to the list. But what of Mr Major? He is devastated by the events of Wednesday. The capitulation was not the U-turn of a cynical politician who saw a fixed rate for the pound as a convenience and devaluation as no more than an awkward moment. He believed in the policy. He gave in on Wednesday night only when he was told that Bank of England's reserves were 'haemorraging'. With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see when the strategy went wrong. Mr Major was brave enough on Wednesday to raise interest rates to 15 per cent but by then it was too late. Well before the latest crises it was clear that sterling would remain under pressure until after the French referendum. Senior officials were privately warning of that possibility in July. Presumably they suggested a pre-emptive interest rate rise. Presumably Mr Lamont - and/or Mr Major - rejected the idea for fear of a backlash on the Tory backbenches. But the government cannot afford to indulge in postmortems. The suspension of sterling's membership of the ERM has left a gaping hole in its economic strategy. It threatens to destroy Mr Major's painstaking attempts over the past two years to persuade the Conservative party that it must come to terms with Europe. Yesterday's cabinet meeting was a holding operation. The carefully orchestrated display of unity - and genuine commiseration with the chancellor's predicament - was designed to allow the government to catch its breath. The cabinet's Euro-sceptics, notably Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley, by all accounts kept their counsel. The subsequent statement that sterling would rejoin the ERM as soon as conditions are favourable was an attempt to buy time. For all his anger at the behaviour of the Bundesbank, Mr Major still sees the ERM as the only available anchor for a credible anti-inflation strategy. Beyond that nothing can be decided until ministers have had time to assess the reaction of the markets to the French referendum. Nobody knows where sterling will be next Tuesday morning - nor whether the ERM can survive in its present form. Mr Lamont also wants firm evidence that German interest rates are heading lower before he sets a new D-mark rate for the pound. He does not rule out a small cut in British rates in the meantime. But Mr Major does not have much time to map out a new course. He should not underestimate the angst in his party. It is not only the irreconcilables who are asking now what on earth was the point of all the pain of the past two years. There are the usual suspects - Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit among them. But others such as Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, are also preparing to step into the power vacuum. They are confident this week's debacle will provide a fertile recruiting ground for their efforts to disown permanently the ERM as a prelude to ditching Maastricht. The Euro-sceptics have a spring in their step. Their ranks are being swelled by the uncommitted on the Tory backbenches. They are peddling an attractive potion. With the pound floating freely, interest rates could be cut to a level which would get the economy moving again. Small businesses, the bedrock of the government's support, would stop going bust. The housing market would pick up. Unemployment might stop rising. Monetary targets could be reintroduced to guide anti-inflation policy. And if prices crept up a little faster, what harm? Anti-Europeanism, and more particularly paranoia about Germany, has come back into fashion on the Tory backbenches. It has been fed this week by Downing Street's ill-judged public onslaught on the Bundesbank. The question being asked by some colleagues is that if Mr Major blamed the Germans for his humiliation this week, why on earth should he risk a repeat performance?. The answer is that he still thinks the defeat of inflation offers the only real prospect of reversing Britain's long-term economic decline. He saw enough of the sterling crises of the 1980s to understand that a free-floating pound does not insulate the government from the foreign exchange markets. He believes fervently that Britain's long-term future can be secured only within the mainstream of Europe. How long will business be able to cope with a gyrating exchange rate once the European single market is in place? So his strategy must be to start again from scratch: to rebuild confidence in sterling as a prelude to its return to the ERM and, after a decent interval, steer the Tory party back into the belief that Europe represents an opportunity rather than a threat. It will not be easy. Mr Lamont believes it will be weeks if not months before the markets have settled sufficiently for sterling to be fixed with confidence at a new D-mark parity. But the longer Britain is outside the ERM the harder Mr Major will find it to persuade his party to rejoin. He can expect angry rebellions if he keeps his word. There is though no alternative. After all it was the failure of Lady Thatcher's approach to Europe and the economy that put him in Downing Street.</p>

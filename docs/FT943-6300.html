			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (5): Where three states meet - The northern triangle Penang is now trying to market itself as the industrial hub of a 'growth triangle' linking the northern peninsula of Malaysia, north Sumatra in Indonesia, and the southern states of Thailand. This growth triangle, following an earlier southern version based around Singapore, was endorsed by all three governments last year. The third meeting of the Northern Growth Triangle (NGT)governments this December, flanked by meetings of business leaders, will discuss a report from the Asian Development Bank containing proposals for improving transport links and labour mobility and establishing cross-border industrial estates. The NGT is meant to be business-led but the three governments have rather different attitudes to their business organisations. The Thai government is happy to let the business leaders take control, but the Indonesian government is more intent on keeping control. The Malaysian government lies somewhere in the middle with an important role in promoting the NGT taken by the Penang state government. Mr Koh Tsu Koon, chief minister of Penang, and most influential Penang business leaders, see the NGT as a means of channelling labour intensive operations out of Penang and into northern Malaysia or southern Thailand. Meanwhile, Penang hopes to become a regional centre for business services, research and development and high value-added production. Some business leaders fear that the NGT may aim too high and disappoint expectations. 'It would be nice if we could abolish all tariffs and borders and have completely free movement of capital, goods and people. But it takes decades to get anywhere if national sovereignty is at stake, just look at how long it is taking to harmonise regulations in the European Union', warns one Penang business leader. He believes that the greatest potential in the short-term is in sorting out some of the transport bottlenecks. Currently, for example, there are no flights between Penang and Southern Thailand and there is no direct sea link across the straits of Malacca linking Penang with Medan. Freight has to travel all the way down to Singapore and back up again. He also believes that travel restrictions could be removed allowing for much more free movement for business people. This is not the same as free movement of labour. There is already a large flow of immigrant labour - much of it illegal - from the periphery to fast developing regions like Penang. But the Malaysians worry about being swamped by foreigners and hope that the NGT might help to slow the flow by providing more jobs in the outlying regions. The Asian Development Bank report, which will form the basis of December's meeting, is expected to concentrate on the following themes: Highway development, air services, streamlining of regulations and tariffs, a gas pipeline, labour mobility, cross-border industrial estates and tourism.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Region               Area (sq km)    Population ('000)   Persons/sq km  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Malaysia         32,257                4,658             144 Southern Thailand         20,809                2,840             136 North Sumatra            127,070               13,667             108 TOTAL                    180,136               21,165             117  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: official statistics  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND TV;  </P> <P> SUMMIT, FOOTBALL, NEW SHOWS TOO  </P> <P> News of the Bush-Gorbachev summit in Finland and the tense situation in the  Persian Gulf is likely to overshadow everything else this weekend -- even the  kickoff of the pro football season, the finals of the U.S. Open tennis  tournament and the debuts of several new entertainment shows.  </P> <P> Prior to the season premiere of "NFL Live" Sunday, for example, NBC will  broadcast 4 1/2 hours of live news from the summit, beginning at 5 a.m. ABC,  CBS and CNN will also provide extensive coverage of the meetings in Helsinki  all weekend.  </P> <P> NBC (4)(36)(39) debuts "The Fanelli Boys," a new sitcom about an Italian  family, tonight at 9:30 p.m. (The show will air regularly this season on  Wednesdays at 9 p.m.) Following at 10 p.m., Gary Collins hosts the "Miss  America Pageant."  </P> <P> Fox counters at 10 p.m. tonight with the Mardi Gras premiere of Mark Frost's  and David Lynch's new documentary series, "American Chronicles."  </P> <P> Sunday, "The Late Mr. Pete Show," once an outrageous Westside public access  cable talk show, moves to broadcast television on Channel 5 at 11:30 p.m. Mr.  Pete (Peter Chaconas), the flamboyant host who habitually sports a hideous  plaid red jacket, is nothing if he is not one zany guy. Martin Mull guests.  STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

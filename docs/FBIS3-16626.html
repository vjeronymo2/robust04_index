			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "You Can Go to America for </F> Good Even Without Spending $100"]    [Text] Back at the beginning of February the American  Embassy in Moscow made a brief announcement: As of 1 October  this year the U.S. Government will start holding a lottery, the  winners of which will receive not money, but green cards --  documents entitling them to take up permanent residence and to  work on the other side of the Atlantic. Such lotteries are not  new, they have been held for several years now, but it is the  first time Russians and inhabitants of other countries of the  former Union will be able to participate.    The lotteries are intended to enable people who do not meet  the normal requirements for the issuing of a green card to  settle in America. If, say, you do not have close relatives in  the United States or there is no employer who is prepared to  take full responsibility for you and assure the U.S. immigration  authorities that unless you, a unique professional, are given  work in America America's prosperity will suffer badly as a  result.    Judging by information from the embassy, the process of  receiving applications to participate in the lottery will begin  in the spring. You will not have to fill in any form, all you  will have to do is make a written application and send it to the  appointed address.    The embassy issued another notice: "There will be no need to  pay any intermediary for assistance in framing an application.  Paying for such services will not improve the applicant's  chances of success."    The other day it was confirmed for me at the embassy that no  additional information has been issued since the February  notification. In other words, the details are still being  worked out and coordinated. Just wait.    But the intermediaries are already buzzing around all over  the place. Some made a practical suggestion to the editorial  boards of newspapers in the capital, including IZVESTIYA: Act  as an agent for a U.S. law firm, help us distribute forms, and  then we can share the proceeds.    They even sent us a copy of the form which lottery  participants would be expected to fill in and which would then  be passed on to the U.S. law firm for it to deliver to U.S.  territory and register by a certain date.    What would the law firm charge for its services? $100 a  head. The explanatory letter says that "families will double  their chances if husband and wife fill in separate forms." That  makes $200.    It appears that the U.S. law firm is operating entirely at  the potential lottery participants' risk. And, of course, it is  trying to make money, big money. Money out of our fellow  citizens' ignorance and ingenuousness.    I talked on the telephone with those who, as it were,  represent the firm's interests in Moscow. I tried to ascertain,  in particular, the credentials of this firm, which has been set  up in California by people who were compatriots of ours not long  ago. Alas, my questions about its successes remained unanswered.    The interesting thing is, though, that Russian citizens will  find it hard to do without the services of intermediaries.  Judging by the experience of past lotteries, the U.S.  authorities would like to "eliminate" as many applicants as  possible and prevent them from participating in the lottery.  And it will be very easy to do this, I was told: Either the  application would be declared void on the pretext of some  inaccuracy and thrown in the bin or it would take so long to get  to the United States that it would fail to meet the deadline.  The firm will be accurate and prompt.    "Is it true, as the American Embassy says, that the efforts  of intermediaries will not improve the chances of success?"    "It is true," came the reply. "It is a lottery, after all."    Anyway, I personally would not be in too much of a hurry to  hand over my greenbacks. At least until the U.S. immigration  service has dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's, in  particular on the question whether it is indeed possible to try  one's luck in the lottery without intermediaries.</p>

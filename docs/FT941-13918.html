			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Number one flowerpot man - Concentrating exclusively on up-market terracotta has taken Jim Keeling from a 'dogsbodyship', to selling pots worth up to Pounds 750,000 a year. Clive Fewins visits him Jim Keeling is Britain's number one flowerpot man. He has achieved this remarkable position and a tenfold increase in turnover in the last decade by developing an old-fashioned cottage industry. In 1985, in an interview with the Financial Times, Keeling explained why he did not intend to employ a sales staff nor to buy automated equipment to beat off foreign competition. Far from being a business plan for extinction, this strategy has enabled him to grow from an annual turnover of Pounds 75,000 in 1985 to Pounds 750,000 and to hold on to his gains through the recession. Keeling, the founder of Whichford pottery, is about the opposite of the popular idea of a successful businessman. He is thoughtful and restrained - a Catholic convert, who is greatly concerned that we should all be able to realise our own 'inner journey'. He is, however, undeniably Britain's leading maker of flower pots: he has written two books on terracotta gardening. His output ranges from the small terracotta flowerpots that graced every potting shed before the age of plastics, to giant baroque urns adorned with decorative fruits and acanthus leaves that cost up to Pounds 1,300 each. In between comes a range of wallpots, Italianate jars, exotic ewers, pastry pots, barrel-style pots, ornate troughs, animal figured pots, wallpots, rhubarb forcers, strawberry barrels and a host of others. They are all hand-thrown, and made from a blend of local clays mixed and refined at the pottery. It all started almost by accident. Shortly before going to Cambridge 22 years ago Keeling spent a summer reconstructing ceramics on an archaeological dig in the Middle East. Then he gained what he calls a 'dogsbodyship' at a small pottery near Farnham in Surrey. Keeling recalled: 'The buildings were falling down and I had no proper wage. But I learned to throw and I specialised in plant pots from the word go. I was taught to be very economical with materials and effort - that is how to do it properly. Fortunately I have been able to pass on this throwing tradition to nine others. 'The experience only lasted six months but it was a vital time. On my best day I managed to throw 720 pots.' In 1974 Keeling and his wife Dominique moved to Middle Barton in Oxfordshire, where they bought a cottage for Pounds 15,000 with the help of a Pounds 12,000 legacy and a small mortgage. Keeling then turned a nearby barn he rented into a pottery. He financed this with a Pounds 5,000 bank loan guaranteed by his father. He built a kiln from scrap metal and spares and made little money out of potting for the first two years. After three years the pottery was turning over Pounds 25,000, employing a sales agent and training the first of several local young men, one of whom is still with him, to be potters. 'I was working desperately hard, teaching myself to throw up to 60 15-inch pots a day,' Keeling said. He realised that if he could guarantee quality and continue to sell his pots there was money in terracotta. By the time the couple left Middle Barton in 1972 they had a turnover of Pounds 36,000 (of which nearly 30 per cent was profit) a staff of three, and a catalogue with 45 styles of pot. Keeling took out a Pounds 30,000 mortgage to finance the move to a second dilapidated cottage, eight miles away in Whichford, in the Warwickshire Cotswolds. There he resolved to stay with terracotta. 'I was fascinated by the basic flower pot shape and was keen to produce as many variations as possible. I also knew that by using terracotta I could make bigger profits than other potters,' he said. Three months later he was wondering if he had made the right move: 'I was desperate to sell pots. The business was not known in its new surroundings and I had a running battle with the planners over signs. I needed to sell a lot more pots to finance expansion, yet found it increasingly difficult to persuade the trade to buy from a small English producer.' A friend suggested an exhibition in a warehouse in east London that was available for weekend lets. Thanks to some national press coverage the venture took Pounds 5,000 in the first three hours. The pottery's entire stock went in two days. 'I was getting the full retail price by selling direct. The experience opened my eyes and showed me the way forward was by direct selling,' Keeling said. 'It also convinced me that there was a big future if I could increase production.' He took out a Pounds 40,000, 10-year loan from Lloyds bank, and set about building a Pounds 33,000 pottery. He expanded his range and made strenuous efforts to attract the attention of professional gardeners. He steered away from garden centres and stores selling cheap imported terracotta pots and pursued an unashamedly up-market policy. 'At Whichford I am keen to uphold the best manual working traditions,' Keeling said. 'Here we have taken a good look at our hand-thrown tradition, decided what works, and added to and improved on that. In his 11 years at Whichford, Keeling has increasingly relied on advertising and today more than half his sales are direct. Gardeners beat a path to the pottery and he has expanded regional sales at country homes and nurseries. Twenty per cent of his output is exported, about 20 per cent is sold to garden centres, and the rest is sold by mail order. Whichford Pottery holds a sale and 'open house' in the three weeks before Christmas during which it disposes of a large number of seconds. This helps to fill the gap at the time of year when production tends to fall below the target of 1,000 pots a week. 'By and large we produce things we enjoy making. We also do a lot of one-offs and adapt designs for grand gardens and the stately homes trade,' Keeling said. Turnover is likely to be down from the anticipated Pounds 750,000 this year as Keeling has been developing new ideas and doing little throwing himself. He is optimistic, however, that the company will show the Pounds 100,000 profit he likes to see at the end of each year. He still owes Pounds 12,000 to the bank but, is in a good position to expand if he chooses. Whichford Pottery, Whichford, Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire CV36 5PG. 0608-84416</p>

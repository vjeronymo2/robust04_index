			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM FOOD;  </P> <P> REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;  </P> <P> WE REMEMBER MAMA;  </P> <P> WHEN IOWA CAME TO CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> My mother was born in Dubuque, Iowa, and she never lost her taste for  Iowa-style roast pork, corn on the cob and apple pie. Cooking was her great  love, and her trusted guide was "Fannie," meaning Fannie Merritt Farmer, the  author of the original "Boston Cooking School Cook Book." However, Mother never  followed a recipe as written, not even "Fannie's," because she insisted on  adding her own touch. There was no recipe that she couldn't improve and nothing  that she couldn't cook, if she set her mind to it.  </P> <P> When she moved to Los Angeles long before I was born, she continued to enjoy  roast pork and corn on the cob, but she also responded to the new influences  around her. She quickly became expert at Mexican food, copying the green corn  tamales at El Cholo and duplicating the dishes that she enjoyed at a  neighborhood Mexican restaurant. She made wonderful egg foo young, sukiyaki,  Japanese cucumber salad, gazpacho, Norwegian lefse, Danish aebleskiver,  baklava, German Christmas cookies and anything else that appealed to her, often  simply copying what she had tasted. Dinner was always a feast, and the  conversation frequently centered around the great finds she had made at the  market that day.  </P> <P> When I began to write cookbooks, she was of immeasurable inspiration. And I was  pleased to tell her that my manuscript for a book on bread had been accepted.  It was she who taught me to bake, making easy what could have been an  intimidating pursuit. Unfortunately she passed away before she could see the  book, but her recipes live on in its pages, among them this sumptuous coffee  cake.  </P> <P> ANNE HANSEN'S DANISH ALMOND COFFEE CAKE  </P> <P> 4 cups flour  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 cup butter, softened  </P> <P> 1 envelope dry yeast  </P> <P> Granulated sugar  </P> <P> 1/4 cup warm water  </P> <P> 3 eggs  </P> <P> 1 cup sour cream  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> 4 ounces almond paste  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons water, about  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted  </P> <P> Sift flour and salt together into large bowl. Add butter and rub into flour  with fingers until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir yeast and dash  granulated sugar into 1/4 cup warm water and let stand until yeast is  dissolved.  </P> <P> Combine 1 whole egg and 2 yolks in medium bowl. Place remaining 2 whites in  small bowl, cover and refrigerate. Beat eggs until combined. Beat in sour cream  and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Add dissolved yeast and beat until blended. Add to  flour mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Cover and chill thoroughly  overnight, or at least 2 hours.  </P> <P> When ready to complete coffee cakes, mash almond paste with enough of reserved  egg whites to make soft mixture of spreading consistency. Beat until smooth.  </P> <P> Measure 2/3 cup granulated sugar. Sprinkle some sugar over work surface. Divide  chilled dough in half, returning one half to refrigerator. Place dough on sugar  and pat to fairly smooth round. (Dough will be very soft and sticky.) Sprinkle  dough lightly with more sugar and roll out to rectangle, rolling one way in  each direction, not back and forth. Sprinkle any parts of dough that stick to  rolling pin with sugar.  </P> <P> Fold short edges of rectangle to meet at center. Do not overlap. Pat dough with  hands into even rectangle. Sprinkle with sugar and roll out again to rectangle.  Repeat this procedure third time. Fold short edges to center once more and  sprinkle with sugar.  </P> <P> Roll dough out to 14x10-inch rectangle. (Make as even as possible.) Spread  entire surface with half almond paste mixture. Roll up like jellyroll, starting  at one long edge. Place seam side down on large ungreased baking sheet. Repeat  with remaining half of dough and place on baking sheet well separated from  other roll.  </P> <P> Let coffee cakes stand in warm place, away from drafts, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (They  do not need to double in bulk.) Bake at 375 degrees about 25 minutes, or until  light brown. Cover loosely with foil if cakes start to brown too much. Remove  from oven and immediately slide spatula under each to loosen. Let cool on  baking sheet, loosening again if necessary.  </P> <P> To make frosting, blend powdered sugar with about 2 tablespoons water (use  enough to make spreading consistency). Add remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla and  beat until smooth. Spread frosting over warm coffee cakes (frosting will not  cover cakes completely). Sprinkle with sliced almonds. Makes 2 coffee cakes.  </P></p>

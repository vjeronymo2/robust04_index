			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: River &amp; Merc Extra launches Pounds 16m cash call RIVER &amp; Mercantile Extra Income Trust, a split capital investment trust, is making a rights offer to shareholders in an attempt to raise Pounds 15.9m. The offer represents the latest attempt by an investment trust to exploit the fact that its shares are trading at a premium to net asset value. Trusts cannot make rights issues when the shares are at a discount, without further diluting net assets per share. Shareholders are being offered one new share at 106p for every two they hold, although they will be able to apply for excess shares. The issue is not being underwritten and there will be no trading in nil paid rights. If the rights are not taken up in full, the trust may attempt to place the excess shares in the market, or issue unused shares to new PEP investors. The total number of new shares that will be issued will not exceed 15m. The net asset value of the trust was 105.95p per share as of April 11, compared with 103.47p per share fully diluted at the end of March. Net revenue in the six months to March 31 fell to Pounds 944,000 (Pounds 1.65m) and earnings per share were 3.15p (5.48p). The second interim dividend is 1.96875p (1.875p) and at the offer price for the rights shares, the prospective gross annual dividend yield is 9.9 per cent. The Extra Income Trust has, in addition to its ordinary shares, a class of zero coupon debenture stock which was issued at a discount and is repayable at par. The rights offer will, depending on the take-up, reduce the gearing of the ordinary shares by lowering the growth rate in assets needed to repay the debenture stock. The shares were unchanged at 110p.</p>

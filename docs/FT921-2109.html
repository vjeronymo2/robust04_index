			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World News in Brief: Queen confirms York separation The Queen issued a statement that the Duke and Duchess of York were to separate, six years to the day after their engagement, and made it clear it was the duchess who had initiated the move. An official said the Queen found media speculation undesirable during the general election campaign. There are no immediate plans for either the duke or the duchess to move out of the family home, Sunninghill Park, near Windsor. Ballot box, Page 9</p>

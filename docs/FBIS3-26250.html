The province, with farm families accounting for 78 percent  of  its total population, has witnessed good results in pushing  provincial development forward through a campaign aimed at  educating and training those in the countryside to make them  more adaptable to the market economy.    The campaign has swept through Jiangsu's 27 cities and  counties and some 440 towns, stressing vocational training and  adult education, in addition to ordinary schooling.    For example, largely due to the movement, 14,000 out of  15,000 poor households have been lifted out of poverty in  Huaiyin county, a remote backwater area of the province.    Statistics show that the province holds 3,000 training  classes annually, enrolling 110,000 people, several thousands of  whom are then given technical titles.    A survey shows that in Jiangyin city, whose output value  from  township enterprises reached 20 billion yuan, more than 85  percent of the managers and 90 percent of the skilled workers  are from those training classes.    Nantong city, where 300 construction teams formed by  peasants  bring in an annual output value of five billion yuan, has  launched two specialized schools for builders, with about 10,000  persons having passed examinations.    And Changshu city has injected some 10 million yuan into  technological schools for adults in 32 towns in recent years.  Nearly 1,000 graduates have been employed as engineers,  certified accountants and managers.    Moreover, institutions of higher education have emerged in  the province's rural areas.    China's first village-launched college was set up recently  in  Yanshan village, which grossed 600 million yuan last year.    And Huaxi village, a reform pioneer, has established a  training center focusing on foreign language and foreign trade.    Experts hold that the campaign has also contributed much to  the local agricultural research force.    Wuxi county, whose industrial output value is second to none  in the country, boasts rural China's largest scientific base,  involving some 100 research institutions in the fields of  metallurgy, electronics, biology and machinery. The county's  rural network has trained thousands of peasant-turned scientists.    In 1993, over 110,000 township enterprises in the province  recorded 400 billion yuan in industrial output value, up 58.9  percent over the previous year.    Also in the past year, the peasants in the province launched  4,670 new enterprises involving 3.6 billion U.S. dollars of  overseas investment. They have also set up 200 businesses in 36  countries and regions.</p>

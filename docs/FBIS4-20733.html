			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Part 3 of 3-part article by 'Uthman Mirghani: "Who Leaked </F> Details of Itinerary of Al-Turabi's Visit to Canada?"]    [Text] Ironically, Canada, where the general secretary of  Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF), Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, was  subjected to attack on 25 May 1992, was not included originally  in the itinerary of his European and American tour. The tour was  planned to include Britain and the United States and end at the  Vatican. The main purpose was to win backing and support for the  Khartoum government and strengthen al-Turabi's position on the  international scene. In particular, he wanted to set himself up  as a mediator between the West and the movements of political  Islam.    Because Canada plays no direct part in Sudan's policies or  in  al-Turabi's ambitions and plans, it lies outside the circle of  interest when the NIF general secretary began his tour; indeed,  it was added to the tour schedule only during al-Turabi's visit  to the United States.    Perhaps the most interesting irony is that when al-Turabi  decided to go to Canada from the United States, he encountered  difficulties in making arrangements. The Canadian consulate  general in Washington rejected his application for an entry  visa, whereupon a number of Canadian members of Parliament and  other parties intervened to pressure the government in Ottawa  before an entry visa was allowed to be granted to him from the  consulate in Washington.    Canadian Conservative member of Parliament Don Blankarn  [name  as transliterated] confirmed to AL-MAJALLAH that he intervened  to ensure that an entry visa was granted to al-Turabi. He  indicated that during his visit al-Turabi was going to discuss  topics of trade and investment in Canada.    Blankarn was more explicit when a Canadian journalist  interviewed him after the attack on al-Turabi. He said that the  NIF leader and the Sudanese Government wanted to conclude deals  with Canada in the areas of transportation, banks,  communications, and pharmaceuticals. However, when al-Turabi  talked about the goals of his visit to Canada and his Western  tour, he described them as neither trade, teaching, nor tourism,  but rather as a mission and a summoning to God--this according  to a speech carried by the Sudan News Agency, delivered at the  celebration of his recovery at Green Square in Khartoum on 31  July 1992.    For their part, Canadian Foreign Ministry officials insisted  later that al-Turabi had come to Canada on a private visit and  that the Foreign Ministry had arranged a meeting with him as "an  important personality" in Sudan. AL-MAJALLAH contacted Richard  Chappell, a Canadian Foreign Ministry official who was one of  those who met al-Turabi during his visit to Ottawa. (He was  transferred afterward to another department--West  Africa--without explanation of whether his transfer was a normal  procedure or related to the consequences of the attack on  al-Turabi.) When AL-MAJALLAH asked Chappell about the  circumstances of al-Turabi's visit, he declined comment, saying  that "his department would not allow him to talk about the  subject." He referred us to the department concerned with East  Africa and Sudan.    AL-MAJALLAH then contacted Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves  Gagnon, who said: "Al-Turabi met with officials in the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs. We received him as an influential  personality."    Gagnon denied that any trade topics were discussed during  al-Turabi's meeting with Canadian Foreign Ministry officials. He  said that they used the opportunity to express anxiety about  political conditions, the civil war, and human rights violations  in Sudan.  <H5>  Charged Atmosphere </H5>   Besides the problems accompanying the obtaining of a visa,  al-Turabi's visit to Canada took place in an atmosphere charged  with tension and anger. As soon as he arrived in Toronto, his  companions were surprised by a number of Sudanese who received  them with a noisy hostile demonstration, even though the  itinerary of the visit had not been "officially announced." The  demonstration continued in front of the hotel where the NIF  general secretary stayed.    This hostile reception by Sudanese opponents was a  phenomenon  that accompanied al-Turabi throughout his European and American  tour. During his visit to Britain a protest demonstration was  organized in front of a number of public buildings and  institutions that he visited to hold meetings or deliver  lectures. The demonstrators shouted hostile slogans, such as:  "Al-Turabi, murderer of Khartoum!" Some carried pictures of the  officers whom the government of Lieutenant-General 'Umar  al-Bashir executed in 1990 on the charge of organizing an  attempted coup. Al-Turabi was forced to use the rear door to  leave after one of his lectures.    The events accompanying al-Turabi's lecture before the Royal  Society of Arts in London on 27 April 1992 typified the charged  atmosphere of the tour. During the lecture a Sudanese lawyer,  'Abd-al-Baqi 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Rih, stood and lifted his robe,  exposing the artificial leg that had replaced his natural leg  that was amputated because of the effects of the torture he  received during his imprisonment in Sudan in 1989. Having retold  the story of his torture amid cries by some in the audience  hostile to al-Turabi, al-Rih ended by asking the general  secretary, "Does this have anything to do with Islam?"    The story of lawyer al-Rih became a subject of conversation,  and the British newspapers wrote about it until it almost  overwhelmed the visit and the subsequent stages of al-Turabi's  tour. The British newspaper THE GUARDIAN published a long  article that began as follows: "The tall man stood in his white  robe and turban, displaying his wooden leg in the face of the  speaker at the lectern and asking, `Is this what Islam  means?--torture and dictatorship?'"    The story continued: "'Abd-al-Baqi al-Rih was a lawyer in  Khartoum until December 1989, when the Sudanese authorities  arrested him for membership in an opposition party. After 48  days, during which he was tortured, he lost his leg.  'Abd-al-Baqi waved his artificial leg in the face of the man who  is considered the real power behind the Islamic regime in  Khartoum--Hasan al-Turabi."    When al-Turabi went from London to Washington, the story of  lawyer al-Rih pursued him. Finally, he was forced to say at a  press conference in the American capital on 13 May 1992 that  al-Rih's story might not be true and that cancer may have been  the reason his leg was cut off. He added that al-Rih had been  detained no more than 40 days!--and suffered from cancer. He  did, however, go on to say, "If torture was the reason, it was  wrong according to the teachings of Islam."    Al-Turabi's visit to Washington came off no better than his  visit to London. In addition to the story of lawyer al-Rih that  pursued him, al-Turabi found himself surrounded by a hostile  atmosphere. At a demonstration following a lecture by al-Turabi  at the Institute for Strategic and International Studies on 12  May, angry demonstrators surrounded him. One of them pulled him  by his necktie, and two others then joined in, kicking, pushing,  and cursing. The American police intervened to rescue al-Turabi  and took him away in one of their cars.  <H5>  Uproar in Canada </H5>   In addition to the protest demonstrations that greeted him  in  Toronto, al-Turabi faced a flood of criticisms in Canada that  continued even after the attack on him. Two associations--the  African-Sudanese Association in Canada and the Sudanese-Canadian  Friendship Association--issued statements expressing anger and  displeasure at the visit. Some Canadian deputies raised  questions in Parliament about the facts and circumstances of the  visit and the granting of an entry visa to al-Turabi. Liberal  deputy Jim Peterson demanded to know the reasons that led the  Canadian Government to receive al-Turabi and allow him to enter  Canada, given reports by Amnesty International and Africa Watch  of "arrests, torture, and summary executions in Sudan."    Member of Parliament Svend Robinson sent a letter dated 27  July 1992--after the attack--to Barbara McDougall, the minister  of state for foreign affairs, expressing concern that al-Turabi  had been granted an entry visa to Canada "despite his  reputation."    Robinson noted that "a number of reports have hinted that  officials in the [Canadian] Foreign Ministry may have leaked  al-Turabi's itinerary in Canada," and he demanded an explanation.    Many questions indeed were raised about how the Sudanese had  known the details of al-Turabi's itinerary in Canada, when it  had not been announced officially.    Although some circles have hinted that the Canadian Foreign  Ministry, which reluctantly granted al-Turabi an entry visa  after several members of Parliament intervened, leaked his  itinerary to Sudanese opponents so that they could greet him  with protests, well-informed sources have told AL-MAJALLAH that  the itinerary was leaked by a Sudanese, not by a Canadian. These  sources said that a Sudanese informed some of his Sudanese  friends about al-Turabi's scheduled arrival time and details of  his itinerary. They in turn contacted their colleagues to  organize the protest demonstration that greeted al-Turabi when  he arrived in Toronto.    Because his itinerary had been leaked, al-Turabi not only  faced protest demonstrations in Toronto, but was surprised by a  protest demonstration waiting for him in front of the Foreign  Ministry building in Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with  officials on 25 May 1992. Al-Turabi was forced to use the rear  door to enter the Canadian Foreign Ministry building to avoid  the demonstrators who were waiting for him at the front door.  Hashim Badr-al-Din, with his wife and two children, were among  them.    The leaking of the itinerary undoubtedly made it easier for  the Sudanese to organize the protest demonstrations that raised  the temperature until matters climaxed in the attack at the  airport.    In his account of the incident, Hashim Badr-al-Din said that  he returned to his home frustrated, like the other Sudanese who  participated in the demonstration before the Canadian Foreign  Ministry. They had been unable to express their feelings against  al-Turabi because he had used the rear door of the building to  enter and leave.    Badr-al-Din indicated that he went that evening--25 May  1992--to say goodbye to a Sudanese who was on his way back from  Ottawa to Toronto after having taken part in the protest  demonstration.    While he was at the airport, Badr-al-Din saw al-Turabi rush  in to catch his plane. Just as circumstances had intervened to  cause al-Turabi to add Canada to his itinerary belatedly, they  also played a role in the confrontation between him and  Badr-al-Din at Ottawa Airport. Had al-Turabi not delayed his  departure time from six in the evening, as scheduled, to seven,  he would never have encountered Badr-al-Din.  <H5>  Security Measures </H5>   The leaking of news of the visit was not the only  controversial and unclear matter during al-Turabi's visit to  Canada: some circles also questioned why no security protection  was provided for him. From the available information and  statements it appears that a mix-up occurred and led to lack of  coordination among the Canadian security agencies concerned,  thus contributing to the lack of protection for al-Turabi.    Canadian newspapers picked up this aspect after the attack  on  al-Turabi and pointed to conflict among security agencies. In  its 27 June 1992 issue, THE CITIZEN published an article  entitled, "Unsuccessful Security Warning Behind Attack at Ottawa  Airport." The article stated that Canadian intelligence had sent  the police a warning of possible danger to al-Turabi because of  the demonstrations and protests during his visit. However, when  the NIF general secretary arrived aboard a commercial flight  from Toronto to Ottawa the morning of 25 May 1992, the  Gloucester police, who are responsible for the airport, were  unaware of his presence there. They were not informed about it  until later, when they learned indirectly from the Ottawa police  that al-Turabi would leave for Toronto at 1800 that day.    THE CITIZEN quoted Celine Boudrail, a spokeswoman for the  Canadian intelligence service, as saying that the service  "received information about possible danger to al-Turabi," and  conveyed this information to the other concerned agencies.  However, the spokeswoman refused to answer questions about the  kind of danger, the agencies that conveyed the information  originally, or those that were informed of it afterward.    It seems that the complexities of the federal system were  behind the mix-up. Inspector Phil Lockett of the Ottawa district  police informed AL-MAJALLAH that they did not know of  al-Turabi's arrival in Ottawa and that the information they  received about it reached them very late. He added: "The mistake  also stemmed from our not having been informed of the alias  under which al-Turabi was traveling. When we searched the  airport records for his real name, we did not find it."    Inspector Lockett's words imply that instead of reporting  the  warning to the Gloucester police, who are responsible for  airport security, the intelligence services reported it to the  Ottawa police. Although the Canadian authorities considered  al-Turabi's visit "private," they felt uneasy after the events  that accompanied his visits to Britain and the United States, in  addition to the protest demonstration in Toronto. They therefore  tried to provide protection for him at the airport on his  arrival and during his departure. However, the belated warning  frustrated any preparations to arrange a security reception for  al-Turabi when he arrived at Ottawa airport the morning of 25  May, just as the conflict between agencies frustrated protection  arrangements during his departure that evening.    At the suggestion of the Gloucester police, some police  officers went to Ottawa Airport after having learned "belatedly"  that al-Turabi would leave at six that evening from Ottawa to  Toronto. There they looked for al-Turabi's name and did not find  it on the passenger lists. Also, they were not informed that  al-Turabi had changed his flight from 1800 to 1900. They  therefore waited until 1830. When he did not arrive, the  security alert was lifted, and the policemen involved left the  airport.    In this regard, Inspector Lockett said that his forces had  not been informed that the demonstrators had broken into the  lobby of the hotel where al-Turabi had been staying in Toronto  before coming to Ottawa. He added in an interview published in  Canada: "Had we known that problems had occurred in Toronto and  that the person [al-Turabi] was well known and subject to  security dangers, we would have taken other measures."    Similarly, officials of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  (RCMP) said that they had not tried to provide al-Turabi with  personal protection because he was on a private visit. Thus, the  procedures that the RCMP follows for official visitors were not  applied to him. The RCMP did take charge of providing  round-the-clock protection for al-Turabi during his stay in  Civic Hospital after the attack. However, the OTTAWA SUN  newspaper quoted Inspector Jerry Boucher of the RCMP as having  said later that they would urge al-Turabi to leave Canada as  soon as he was able.    A Canadian member of Parliament, Eugene Belmer, summarized  the events accompanying al-Turabi's visit by attributing the  affair to lack of proper coordination among the security  services.</p>

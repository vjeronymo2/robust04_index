			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Slocan rejects CDollars 715m takeover bid by Canfor Slocan Forest Products of Vancouver has dismissed a CDollars 715m (USDollars 511m) takeover bid by Canfor Corp, Canada's biggest lumber company, aimed at creating one of the world's biggest sawn timber producers. Rejection of the share-swap offer could set the stage for a protracted struggle for Slocan, which has no controlling shareholder. Canfor has offered to swap each Slocan share for 0.935 of its own common shares. This amounts to a one-third premium on Slocan's share price prior to the bid. Canfor's offer is due to expire on January 10. Describing the Canfor bid as a 'gamble' for Slocan shareholders, Mr Irving Barber, Slocan chairman and chief executive, said they 'would be at the mercy of the discretionary conditions established by Canfor'. The conditions include approval by British Columbia's forestry ministry on terms acceptable to Canfor. 'At the end of the day, Canfor will have an option to back out of the deal four months later,' Mr Barber said. Canfor has proposed to conclude the deal by initially issuing deposit receipts, which would be converted into shares only after regulatory approvals.</p>

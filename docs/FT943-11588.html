			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: Bernard Delfont - Obituary The death, at the age of 84, of Lord (Bernard) Delfont, marks the passing of one of the two Grand Old Men of the British entertainment industry - the other is his brother Lord (Lew) Grade, still going strong at 87. Between them these two Russian born sons of the formidable Olga, and Isaac, Winogradsky, established, with brother Leslie, a 50 year dominance over every aspect of the nation's leisure activities, from the music halls through to television, where their influence lives on in Leslie's son, Michael Grade, the controller of Channel 4. Bernie Delfont, a tall, handsome man well into his eighties, with a mane of silvery hair, never stopped working. He was well into his seventies when he acquired First Leisure, with its interests in discos, bowling and much of Blackpool, and he was an active president of the company at his death. Like brother Lew, Lord Delfont began as a professional Charleston dancer but soon found being an agent a more profitable business. From there it was a short step into owning theatres and cinemas and his long reign as King of British show business. It was Bernard Delfont who produced the Royal Variety Show for 25 years. He managed home grown stars, like Morecambe and Wise, and brought over big foreign names like Maurice Chevalier and Lena Horne. He became a force in the movie and record businesses when the Grade Organisation was sold to EMI and then became its chief executive. Every time Lord Delfont was ejected by young Turks he bounced back, and it was his experience that guided First Leisure to success. Despite the inevitable cigars, he was never a great showman. He was not a discoverer of new talent or an inspired creator, or even a friend of the avant-garde: he was the businessman, with his finger on the pulse of public taste, whose main interest in the theatre was that night's take at the box office. Sometimes his judgment wavered - he turned down the chance to manage the Beatles - and he rejected an investment in Monty Python's Life of Brian because he thought it blasphemous - but he was known as a considerate employer, a generous supporter of good causes, and a throughly old fashioned gentleman. Even his 'vice' was excusable - he was a keen racing man who once owned a string of horses. His only hobby was watching the racing on television spiced by a few bets.</p>

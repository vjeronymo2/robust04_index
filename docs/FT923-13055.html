			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fiat expands ties with Hitachi and Sumitomo FIAT has decided to expand its co-operation with Japan's Hitachi and Sumitomo in the field of earth-moving equipment. The Turin-based automotive group yesterday signed an agreement to form Fiat Hitachi Construction Equipment, controlled 80 per cent by Fiat Hitachi Excavators and 20 per cent by NH Geotec. Fiat Hitachi Excavators is already controlled 51 per cent by Fiat, 44 per cent by Hitachi and 5 per cent by Sumitomo. The venture is to be controlled ultimately 51 per cent by Fiat through Geotec and based at Lecce in southern Italy. Whereas the previous venture combined the Italian groups and the two Japanese companies' production and technology in hydraulic excavators, the new deal extends this to roller loaders, dozers and construction equipment. The agreement follows withdrawal by John Deere earlier this year from a three-pronged venture. The capital for the venture has yet to be decided.</p>

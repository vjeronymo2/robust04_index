			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Turkish group in Dollars 1.7bn Kazakh power plant deal A TURKISH group yesterday signed a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 886m) deal with the government of Kazakhstan to construct a power plant, financing the project by using export revenues from the joint development of a nearby oil field. United BMB group, a privately-owned Turkish group, and the Kazakh Ministry of Energy agreed a contract to build a 1350 MW combined cycle power plant at Aktubinsk in north east Kazakhstan. Under a countertrade arrangement, the Turks will supply a power plant under turnkey terms, in exchange for the right to a share of the revenues from the export of Kazakh oil. The agreement could set the pace for similar deals in a region rich in resources but in desperate need of infrastructure. The deal follows a visit by Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, to the region earlier this year, and is the first big break for Turkish groups bidding to do business against competition from western and European oil companies. Officials confirmed the area under consideration contained recoverable reserves of 600m barrels. Under the deal, the Turkish group will export the oil using one of the existing or planned pipelines to Europe. Under a production sharing arrangement, BMB will be able to recover its costs of exploration and development of the field. Any 'profit oil' which remains once the company's costs have been deducted is to be used to finance the power plant.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Recovery in truck sales peters out A TENTATIVE recovery in commercial vehicle sales in the final months of 1992 petered out in the first quarter of this year. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that registrations of commercial vehicles last month were 11.75 per cent lower than in the same month a year ago. The March figures are in stark contrast to those for registrations of new cars, which were up 11.58 per cent in March compared with the year-ago month. In its role as an economic indicator, the vehicle market is thus sending conflicting signals to the government about the prospects for recovery. The fact that sales of commercial vehicles - which are driven mainly by commercial and industrial activity - remain so badly depressed heightens suspicions that the car market recovery is being over-stated by dealers and manufacturers. They may be by registering cars for which there are, as yet, no final buyers in an effort to boost market shares and keep plants busy. The 17,741 commercial vehicle sales in March, down from 20,103 a year ago, meant that sales in the first quarter as whole were 5.36 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 1992. The receivership at Leyland Daf, which has been a substantial exporter to the Continent, and increasing imports of Vauxhall of light vans built in Portugal were among the factors in a sharp rise in imports. They took a 42.21 per cent share of the market in March compared with 34.11 per cent in the year-ago period. In the first quarter they rose to 40.71 per cent compared with 35.37 per cent a year ago. With the exception of small vans, mainly those derived from cars, all main sectors of the commercial vehicle market are running below the first quarter of last year. Worst hit are panel van sales, which are down nearly 12 per cent, and heavy trucks - those over 15 tonnes - down by nearly 6 per cent. However, light van sales are up 3.85 per cent in the quarter. Leyland Daf's problems have meant that Iveco group, controlled by Fiat of Italy and incorporating Ford's UK truck operations, is now the clear truck market leader. It had a share of 26.51 per cent for the quarter compared with 18.51 per cent for Leyland Daf, which has been demoted to third behind Mercedes-Benz.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-MARCH 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Mar 93  Jan-Mar 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                50,244       -5.36      100.00      100.00 Imports                      20,453       +8.92       40.71       35.37  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                        17,205       +3.85      100.00      100.00 Imports                       6,260      +78.25       36.38       21.18 Ford                          7,963      +21.24       46.28       39.65 Vauxhall (GM)                 5,939       +9.17       34.52       32.84 Peugeot (incl.

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWISS BALLOON APPEARS CONTEST WINNER  </P> <P> A Swiss pilot landed his helium-filled balloon Monday outside a small town in  Montana to become the apparent winner of the Gordon Bennett distance race.  </P> <P> Karl Spenger of Switzerland and his son-in-law and co-pilot, Ronald Schuler,  safely touched down in their balloon, Jura, at 1:45 p.m., a mile west of  Ashland in southeastern Montana, about 40 miles north of the Wyoming state  line.  </P> <P> Townspeople welcomed the crew, which had to attend to their balloon themselves  because they brought no support crew with them.  </P> <P> Race officials were calculating how far the Jura traveled from Palm Springs  before declaring Spenger the winner. The landing site was about 800 miles  northeast of Palm Springs.  </P></p>

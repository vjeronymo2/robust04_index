			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Putting value on variety Does biodiversity - the preservation of wide varieties of species - have any economic value? Since biodiversity was one of the goals adopted by environmental policymakers at the Rio earth summit, the question is highly topical. On the face of it, the answer seems to be no, or very little. A stretch of rainforest rich in plant, animal and insect life does not have enough value to prevent people chopping it down and selling the timber for short-term gain. So how can its value be enhanced to persuade people to leave the forest alone? Professor David Pearce, the environmental economist who has made a career out of pricing the environment, believes it can be done. In a new book* he says that biodiversity might be able to compete with alternative land uses if there was greater parity between the two. The trouble is that alternative uses tend to enjoy special treatment, such as tax breaks or distorted property rights. 'This,' he writes, 'is one dominant reason why more investment in biodiversity does not automatically take place.' There is a further reason: the absence of what Pearce calls 'global markets in the benefits of biodiversity'. In particular, developing countries find it difficult to exploit their biodiversity because no one is willing to pay enough for it. For example, industrialised countries do not put a value on the ability of rainforests in the developing countries to soak up carbon from the atmosphere. Pearce argues that poorer countries need more help from richer ones and from multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank's Global Environment Facility, to extract this value. Even so, Pearce believes that there are many cases where biodiversity pays: wetlands with potential for human use, and tropical forests that could yield between Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,900) and Dollars 7,000 per hectare, which Pearce says is 'clearly attractive'. *The Economic Value of Biodiversity, by David Pearce and Dominic Moran.

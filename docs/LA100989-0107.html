			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BILLS' KELLY TO BE OUT 3 WEEKS; BACKUP TO START AGAINST RAMS  </P> <P> The Hand of fate -- Indianapolis Colts defensive end Jon Hand -- finally caught  up with Jim Kelly.  </P> <P> Never seriously injured during his four-year NFL career, the Buffalo Bills'  quarterback was smashed to the Hoosier Dome's artificial turf by the 300-pound  Hand on Sunday, suffering a separated left shoulder that is expected to  sideline him for at least three weeks.  </P> <P> "They don't know how long it's going to be (before it heals)," Kelly said  today. "It could be four weeks, maybe six, maybe three."  </P> <P> The loss of Kelly, who was on the way to having his best NFL season, capped an  abysmal day for the Bills, who were drubbed by the Colts 37-14.  </P> <P> Frank Reich, Kelly's backup for the past three seasons, finished Sunday's game  and he will start next Monday night against the unbeaten Rams.  </P> <P> "I have a lot of confidence in Frank Reich," Kelly said. "He's going to do a  good job."  </P> <P> In four years as a pro before Sunday, Reich completed 10 of 20 passes for 123  yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions.  </P></p>

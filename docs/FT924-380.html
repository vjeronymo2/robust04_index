			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Food and Drink: A pre-prandial pep talk - Jancis Robinson knows how to impress a Frenchman SUPPOSE you had to entertain a top Frenchman to a meal, as an increasing number of British readers of the Financial Times surely will next year. The first thing you must do is dispense with any feelings of inferiority when it comes to wine. Believe me, the average Frenchman knows next to nothing about the subject, he just acts as though he does. French wine producers of my acquaintance are unanimous in their admiration of the British wine drinker. It was to Colchester, in Essex, for instance, that the producer of the world's most expensive wine, Domaine de la Romanee-Conti burgundy, came the other day to present 13 wines at an unprecedented tasting and dinner for 180 Lay &amp; Wheeler customers (few of them typical Essex Men, however). Such an event would be quite unthinkable in France, he told me. Chatelains, vignerons and recoltants alike agree that Britain is the toughest market in the world, where consumers are assailed and therefore educated by the best that the world's wine producers can offer them. And it has long been so, with only a short post-war lull in imports to knock our confidence in the nation's connoisseurship, before wine consumption became a much more democratic habit. We have been major customers for the world's wines since the early Middle Ages when only wool was traded more than wine by English merchants. Thanks to our expertise as vintners, and to England's increasingly impressive domestic wine industry, it would be perfectly possible to wine (and of course dine) a visiting Frenchman in an entirely British fashion - and impress him to boot. Malt WHISKY is the obvious trump card, and you could choose to play it first and/or last. As the aperitif the French regard as most chic of all, 'un malt' could tactfully be offered first of all so as to meet your French guest halfway - in a cross-channel duty-free shop, as it were. Oddbins have some particularly special ones but your Frenchman would probably be thrilled by any malt (although avoid Aberlour; it's owned by Pernod Ricard). My own inclination would be to hit him between the eyeballs with the razor-sharp tang of a good SHERRY, a wine designed since the 14th century for the English. This ancient Andalucian fortified wine is known in France, just, as xeres, but the only place I have ever encountered a bottle of decent quality on French soil is at the Parisian wine bar Juveniles - run by expatriate Brits. (Tio Pepe, incidentally, is one of the few wines it makes sense to buy at duty free on the way to France.) It might be wiser, however, to lull your French guest initially with the Scots' great gift to the world before offering him a light, dry manzanilla or fino with a fishy first course. But if it is smoked salmon, which it probably should be as ours is so much better than that commonly available in France, sherry somehow will not do. This is the moment to play the joker, a fruity but seeringly crisp ENGLISH WINE - preferably made from the hybrid grape Seyval Blanc that EC (for which read French) authorities will not allow as capable of producing the carelessly named 'quality wine'. Breaky Bottom's (Pounds 6.95 from The Hermitage, London N10 081-365-2122) made near Glyndebourne by the son of a Frenchwoman, should demonstrate otherwise. When it comes to a red wine, you could seek out a mutually flattering old BRITISH-BOTTLED example of a fine French wine (at The Butlers Wine Cellar of Brighton 0273-698724, Reid Wines of Hallatrow near Bristol 0761-52645 or La Vigneronne of London SW7 071-589-6113) but there is one more obvious choice. CHATEAU LATOUR, the world-famous Bordeaux first-growth is, as I write anyway, owned by the British in the somewhat corpulent form of Allied-Lyons. What a compliment to both host and guest] The only snag of course is that a wine as good as this is expensive, and difficult to buy by the single bottle. More modestly priced, much faster maturing and almost identically labelled (if you get my meaning) is Latour's 'second wine', LES FORTS DE LATOUR, another extremely well-regarded claret. Vintages to drink now are the ripely scented 1985 (Pounds 19.75 Waitrose, Pounds 19.80 Harveys of Bristol 0272-268882, but Pounds 26.49 top Tesco stores), perfectly respectable 1984 (Pounds 11.95 Harveys), gorgeously rich and youthful 1982 (Pounds 20.91 Harveys), aromatic 1978 (Pounds 25.30 Harveys, Pounds 27.50 Oddbins) or even the beautifully mature 1970 (Pounds 39.38 a bottle, Pounds 80.10 a magnum from Harveys) - but this last would probably confirm the French national conviction that we Brits are wine necrophiliacs. If, however, after a bottle of Les Forts, your guest does not feel like giving you a million pound order/relocating to your new town/slashing 15 per cent off his selling price, then you may have to play the heavweight card of VINTAGE PORT. The French import vast quantities of 'porto', more even than we do, and yet most of it is light, young ruby of the sort you would not dream of offering a guest of any nationality. 'Le vint-age' is at long last becoming a bit of a cult among French wine connoisseurs, however, so you could profitably offer your guest a bottle of good vintage port, just so long as you choose one of the many that sport good, solid British names. Graham, Taylor, Smith Woodhouse come to mind, as does the newest port shipper Churchil Graham - a name to resonate in French ears, I would have thought. And when he drools over this magic wine, quite unparalleled by anything produced in France, make sure you tell him that port was devised by and is known as 'the Englishman's wine'. Rather like bordeaux, really.</p>

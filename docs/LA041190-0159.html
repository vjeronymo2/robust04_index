			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NETWORKS JUGGLE SATURDAY MORNING TV LINEUPS  </P> <P> Watching kidvid on Saturday mornings next season, remember -- you heard it  someplace else first.  </P> <P> The three networks have revealed their new series for next year, which are  animations of everything from "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on CBS to Roseanne  Barr's childhood on ABC, with a strong rock beat from NBC.  </P> <P> In the process, nine shows have been dropped from the Saturday morning  schedule. NBC will no longer broadcast "Alf," "Smurfs," "The Karate Kid" and  "Kissyfur." CBS has eliminated "The California Raisins," "Dungeons and Dragons"  and "The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy," while ABC parts with "Gummy  Bears," "Weekend Specials" and "Animal Crackups."  </P> <P> The market involved is not chopped marshmallows. Brandon Tartikoff, president  of NBC Entertainment, said in emceeing his network's presentation to  advertisers that the 36 million children who spend Saturday morning in front of  the tube also have about $7 billion in allowances, gifts and odd-job pay -- and  influence their parents' purchases of $70 billion worth of goods.  </P> <P> The new NBC shows are:  </P> <P> "Rick Moranis in Gravedale High." Half-hour series features the voice and  animated image of Moranis as a dedicated teacher who becomes headmaster of a  high school for monsters.  </P> <P> "Kid 'n' Play." The half-hour animated comedy was inspired by the rap duo from  the hit movie "House Party."  </P> <P> "The Boys Next Door" (working title). In this live-action half hour, five  teen-age boys pirate the airwaves to broadcast their own music and sketch  comedy show from the basement of their California home.  </P> <P> "Saturday Videos" (working title). Celebrity guest hosts will present the music  videos aimed for a younger audience.  </P> <P> "Inside Stuff: The Entertainment Magazine of the NBA." The half-hour show will  feature the best plays and players in the National Basketball Assn., with a  strong behind-the-scenes and off-court focus.  </P> <P> The new ABC shows:  </P> <P> "The Wizard of Oz." The Wicked Witch has been magically reincarnated so that  Dorothy, the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow can overcome her.  </P> <P> "The New Kids on the Block." The hot musical group stars in a half-hour series  in which each episode opens with live-action music before switching to animated  adventure.  </P> <P> "Little Rosey." Roseanne Barr stars in the animated story of her life at 10.  </P> <P> The CBS newcomers:  </P> <P> "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Each hourlong show will present two new  adventures of the heroes on the half shell.  </P> <P> "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures." The stars of the hit kids' movie, Alex  Winter (Bill) and Keanu Reeves (Ted) will recreate their roles as the voices of  the time-traveling teen-agers in this animated series.  </P></p>

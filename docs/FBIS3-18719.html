This follows from a letter that FRG  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) wrote to the top economic associations. The  negotiations on a regulation for dual-use goods in Brussels are  now entering their final stage, Rexrodt wrote. The partners do  not support the stringent German export control system, he said.    Rexrodt announced that Germany's previous additional rules  have therefore to be changed. This applies, for example, to  goods that are not on a control list and are only checked  because of their use in the military sector. Here the reduction  of the controls to the few countries that have isolated  themselves in the international community has to be considered.  Rexrodt wants to examine whether the controls for services and  the transfer of sensitive knowledge that are not contained in  the Brussels regulation are only to be valid for a hard core of  countries and for products to be more precisely defined. As the  single market continues, one should be increasingly exacting  regarding the maintenance of additional national rules.    The German economy called for the harmonization of the  export  rules for dual-use goods without any national exceptions, so  that the competitive disadvantages resulting from the strict  German rules are eliminated. There will not be a general change  of course on real arms, Rexrodt affirmed. However, the Federal  Government will soon adopt measures that will make the  authorizing policy clearer and more predictable for  international cooperation on the level of enterprises so that  faster decisions can be expected.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments urged the agency not to adopt a testing method that utilizes photosensitizing chemicals. The comments presented a number of arguments against this type of testing. It is considered unethical because of the carcinogenic potential of the photosensitizing chemical (such as 8&hyph;MOP). The action spectrum (i.e., for 8&hyph;MOP induced erythema) is artificial and inappropriate. The values obtained vary with the sensitizing chemical used and the spectrum of the irradiating source used. The values obtained have no relevance to real-life situations. The testing may result in a persistence of pigmentation or blistering reactions. 8&hyph;MOP sensitization exaggerates the biological response and presents a risk of causing severe ulcerative acute reactions. 8&hyph;MOP puts subjects at risk for phototoxic reactions for up to 6 hours after exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment contended that photosensitizing testing methods have a number of benefits, such as short irradiance times, clearly defined endpoints, and reproducible results. The comment added that the results from these test methods are relevant to patients taking 8&hyph;MOP or other photosensitizing drugs with similar action spectra. The comment concluded that photosensitizing test methods could be useful to determine photoprotection factors for claims against phototoxic reactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments urged the agency to accept the IPD testing method for determining UVA protection. One comment stated that the IPD method is generally recognized by a substantial body of scientists as the preferred UVA testing method. Several comments provided a number of benefits for using the IPD method. They claimed that this test method is the one that is most representative of true conditions because it is an in vivo determination that accounts for biological reactions that can occur on living skin. Unlike the testing procedure using skin photosensitized with 8&hyph;MOP, the IPD test is indicative of a true broad spectrum response of normal healthy skin. Unlike erythema that is a response only to the shorter wavelength UVA radiation, IPD is a response to broad spectrum UVA radiation. The IPD method requires the use of considerably lower doses of radiation energy, thus exposing subjects to less risk. The IPD method uniquely compliments the current SPF system by accurately reflecting the actual amount of long wave UVA radiation attenuated by a sunscreen product. The IPD method is reliable, accurate, and reproducible. The IPD test can be performed in a standard sunscreen evaluation laboratory with minimal adaptation of existing equipment. The comments concluded that until well-established action spectra for specific UVA damage are established, IPD is the best method currently available because it reflects broad spectrum UVA protection equally across the entire UVA spectrum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment submitted a testing protocol using IPD as the endpoint (Ref. 21). The comment stated that the suggested testing procedure fulfilled a number of criteria. The resulting protection factor gives the consumer additional information about the sunscreen number, complementing the SPF value. The response variable has a relatively flat action spectrum (i.e., 320 to 400 nm, with a low peak at around 340 nm) throughout the region of interest. Using this spectrum results in UVA protection values that closely reflect the actual amount of radiation reduced. The testing response obeys dose reciprocity over the anticipated irradiance range. The test is practical with minimal risk to subjects. The comment added that an eight-center clinical test has validated this method as acceptable for determining UVA protection over the entire UVA spectrum, including long wavelength UVA (i.e., 340 to 400 nm).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment submitted clinical test results from the eight test sites (Ref. 21). Each testing facility completed between 10 and 20 subjects. Subjects with skin types III and IV were used. Four sunscreen formulations and a vehicle control were tested. The sunscreen products contained:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 7-percent padimate O,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 2-percent oxybenzone,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 5-percent oxybenzone, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) 4 percent titanium dioxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The protocol used a randomized, complete block design with all subjects at each testing center receiving all five test materials. The comment stated that the studies were conducted similar to an SPF test, but a detailed protocol was not submitted. For example, UVA dosages and application density of the test sunscreens were not noted. Six sites used a 150&hyph;Watt (W) Xenon lamp with 3-millimeter (mm) WG335 and 1-mm UG11 filters. One site used a 1,000&hyph;W Xenon lamp with 3-mm WG335 and 2-mm UG11 filters. One site used a Krypton lamp (i.e., Dermlite) of unspecified wattage. The comment noted that neither of the last two UVA sources are recommended, and the results obtained using these lamps were included for information purposes only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IPD threshold dose of UVA radiation was first measured on unprotected skin, then on protected skin. The ratio of these two doses was then calculated to derive the UVA Protection Factor (UVA-PF). The IPD was graded immediately after UV exposure, allowing complete testing in a single visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Accountancy interests 'dominated auditing' AUDITING POLICY has historically been dominated by views that have favoured the leading accountancy firms above other interests, an academic said yesterday. Speaking at an auditing conference organised by Bristol Business School, Mr Prem Sikka, of the Polytechnic of East London, analysed the development of the 'going concern' auditing guideline required for the approval of company accounts. He said the definition of a going concern in the guidelines was designed to 'minimise audit effort and maximise protection from lawsuits'. The guidelines were drawn up by the Auditing Practices Committee, which did not publish its voting and which had a membership dominated by large accountancy firms. Mr Sikka also emphasised that the use of the word 'profession' in relation to the practice of accountancy was loaded, suggesting knowledge, altruism and a pursuit of the public interest. He suggested that in reality the leading firms were 'significant businesses which have to secure a favourable environment to make profits, avoid lawsuits and retain their legitimacy'. He did not consider the role of the new Auditing Practices Board. The board, which was created last year, includes a majority of non-practising accountants. Environmental auditing is still interpreted in a wide range of different ways, Ms Josephine Maltby told the conference. Commenting on the results of a survey of environmental auditors, she concluded that their perceptions of the purpose of the audit and the way in which it was conducted varied considerably.</p>

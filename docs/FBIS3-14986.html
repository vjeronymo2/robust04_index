The  first pluripartite democratic elections in Moldova were run in  "an atmosphere of normality and honesty" and according to the  law on elections to parliament, stated from behalf of NATO  delegation. The observers visited over 60 polling stations in  various Moldova's regions; they noticed some technical and  organization deficiencies, mainly caused by the lack of  democratic experience in Moldova and this is not a reason to  contest the results, says a press release issued by the  observers. Lord Lucas said that about 12 percent of left bank  population voted while other inhabitants of east Moldova had,  though with difficulties, the real possibility to participate in  elections. NATO and CSCE observers remarked as "a suggestion  for future" the state's obligation to insure equal access to  media for all political forces during the electoral campaign.</p>

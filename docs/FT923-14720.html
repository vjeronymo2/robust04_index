			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (6): A difficult knot to untangle - Pensions PENSION REFORM has been promised so often that it is hard to take any proposal seriously. Yet the pressure to reform Italy's exceptionally generous state pensions scheme - and in parallel also open up the system to private pension funds - is unrelenting. Social welfare spending, principally pensions, has become one of the main causes of the country's expanding public sector deficit. Last year, pension payments increased 11.3 per cent, a real rise of 5 per cent and faster than the overall level of social welfare spending. Pensions accounted for 83 per cent of the L184,000bn social spending budget. Indeed, pensions distort it, reducing the state's ability to spend on other items, notably health care, where Italy's outlays are below the European average. Payments to the country's 14.2m pensioners are now equivalent to 14 per cent of GDP. With the increasing longevity of the population and a stable - if not declining - active workforce, the difficulties of funding the existing scheme are growing exponentially. Within 30 years, if the current system is unchanged, it will require something close to a 50 per cent contribution from labour force salaries to balance contributions and payments. Alternatively, pension outlays would account for nearly all the current budget. The latest Bank of Italy annual report, released at the end of May, commented bluntly: 'If the increase in spending is not controlled, it will be necessary to resort to higher contribution rates or charge more to the state budget. In the first scenario company profitability is likely to suffer. In the second instance, it would be necessary to carry out either tough fiscal measures or spending cuts elsewhere in compensation.' It is not just this generosity that needs remedying. The system is open to considerable abuse and political manipulation. Nowhere else in Europe does such a high proportion of people claim early retirement on disability pensions. No fewer than 4.2m people, one-third of all pensioners, receive disability pensions. A high proportion of the latter are in the south where it is a widespread practice to ask local politicians to ensure that the relevant medical certificates are granted to guarantee a minimal disability. Equally, state employment and its exceptionally generous terms for early retirement have been gravely abused. A state employee has the right to take early retirement after only 20 years' service if male, and as little as 15 years if a woman (childbirth and childcare time is included). This compares to 35 years' minimum service for an old-age pension in the private sector. According to a recent report by Censis, the social research institute, 87 per cent of all male state employees have benefited from some form of early retirement scheme. State employees also have their pensions calculated in a more advantageous manner so that they can expect to receive up to 94 per cent of their final salary inflation-proof. The best that private sector employees can expect from the state, after contributing the same quota for pensions from their pay packets, is 80 per cent of the average salary of the previous five years. The difference in pension payments between public employees and the rest of the workforce has been one reason why state employment has proved so attractive and public sector payrolls so high - with the consequent burden on the treasury. The funding of state employee pensions also bears little relation to the demands of accountability. There is no state pension fund - although private sector employers are obliged to pay in 18.6 per cent and all employees a further 7.1 per cent of wages to INPS, the state social welfare institute. Thus, payments are direct out of the annual budget. By 1990 there were over 1m state employees receiving pensions averaging over L18m a year. The normal retirement age for women in Italy is fixed at 55 years, five years below the European average. The male retirement age of 60 is also lower than the EC norm of 65. The pensions scheme is thus generous in almost every aspect. This has been the product of two mutually reinforcing elements. First, a powerful trade union movement in the early post-war period fought hard to ensure basic pension rights. These were gradually consolidated, often with the help of sympathetic judges who gave benign pensioner-biased judgments in a series of court cases where the regulations were tested - and frequently expanded. This was especially the case with inflation-related adjustments to existing pensions. Second, both the political parties and the employers were prepared to concede advantageous pensions to employees as a means of buying peace on the shop floor. Good pensions represented guaranteed social cohesion. And it is precisely this aspect which makes reform such a sensitive issue. For at least 10 years, parties across the political spectrum have accepted the need for reform. No government has had the courage to take action. Since 1984 there have been four separate sets of proposals to change the system. The latest in August last year, put forward by Mr Franco Marini, then labour minister, represented a modest step towards reducing pension benefits and saving the treasury some money. But the Marini proposals were shelved towards the end of 1991 as general elections approached and no party wished to court unpopularity by cutting pensions. The new government now has two alternatives: adopt the Marini reforms or go back to the drawing board. Given the need for action, the Marini proposals represent a reasonable point of departure. In addition, they are merely a tightening of the three previous plans produced in 1984, 1989 and 1990. All, for instance, propose the raising of both male and female retiring ages to 65. Mr Marini planned to phase this in for men by 2005 and for women by 2015, saving by the year 2010 some L18,000bn (10 per cent of the budget deficit). They all proposed stiffening the qualifications for early retirement by raising the minimum number of yearly contributions. In the case of the Marini scheme this is 35 years all round, including state employees. He further proposed that pensions should be calculated on the basis of the previous 10 years' pay with a maximum ceiling of 80 per cent. There are other provisions regarding the form in which pensions will be indexed to inflation. Pension reform also has to take into account moves to privatise and the resistance of state employees to privatisation. Beyond this, the government will need to examine a reform of the public administration. Too many people are poorly paid, and because of that, they are encouraged to retire early and seek another job while drawing their pension.</p>

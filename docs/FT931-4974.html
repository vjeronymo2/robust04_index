			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Walker asks to be made bankrupt MR GEORGE Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker charged with the theft of Pounds 12.5m from the company, yesterday asked to be declared bankrupt in an attempt to secure legal aid to pay for his defence. The surprise move came six months after Mr Walker successfully fought off attempts by creditors to make him bankrupt and instead reached an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) with them to repay debts. In January he was charged with the theft of Pounds 12.5m from the company following an 18-month Serious Fraud Office investigation of the affairs of the property and leisure group. The trial is expected to start early next year and Mr Walker's defence costs are expected to exceed Pounds 1m. Although Mr Walker's application for legal aid was approved in principle, it was refused last week because, in spite of the IVA, the Legal Aid Board deemed he had assets and income available to meet his costs. Lawyers for Mr Walker yesterday said the decision of the legal aid board indicated an anomaly between its regulations and the purpose of IVAs, first legislated for in the 1986 Insolvency Act. The Legal Aid Board was unable to comment yesterday. After a 30-minute pri-vate hearing in the High Court yesterday, bankruptcy registrars postponed their decision on Mr Walker's application until March 22. It is thought almost certain, however, that Mr Walker will then succeed in being made bankrupt. TSB Bank, which claimed to be owed nearly Pounds 10m by Mr Walker, tried last year to have him declared personally bankrupt. The petition failed when Mr Walker came to the voluntary arrangement with his creditors. In all, claims against Mr Walker total about Pounds 180m. Creditors with claims of Pounds 136.5m, more than 75 per cent of the total, voted in favour of the arrangement under which Mr Walker's assets and most of his income was pledged to the creditors. Under the IVA Mr Walker said he would pursue claims against Brent Walker for wrongful dismissal, and in France against banks which lent to Mr Walker's family company. These actions might not be pursued if he is declared bankrupt. Mr Walker was not in court yesterday as he was believed to be in Russia, where he is working for his wife's company importing cigarettes and cosmetics. He is likely to attend the hearing on March 22.</p>

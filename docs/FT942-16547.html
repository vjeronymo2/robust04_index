			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Anxieties, butterflies and parachute jumping Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters and a veteran of annual meetings, likens AGMs to jumping from a plane. 'When you have done it and landed, then it is no problem, but every time might be the last,' the former parachutist says. Some might think Sir Christopher has less cause to feel anxious than many others who face shareholders every year. Yet even he finds AGMs 'slightly anxious' occasions. 'There is a vaguely confrontational feel about the thing,' he says. The butterflies are common, although in some cases they may be described rather differently. 'I love AGMs, I really love them,' says Mr David James, the company doctor and chairman of Lep who makes a habit of taking on posts where the AGMs are inevitably confrontational. 'They are great adrenalin developers.' Most chairmen will spend a considerable amount of time preparing for the meetings. Sir Christopher's schedule calls for a detailed examination of the report and accounts, all the press announcements made during the year, and a review of the letters sent in by shareholders. Mr James demands a dress rehearsal at his companies, which include the board, financial advisers and lawyers. Yet no company can prepare for the variety of questions which may be thrown at the board. At Barclays, one shareholder demanded to know why there had not been enough Easter eggs to pass out to all the customers waiting in the queue at his local branch. The eggs ran out just before they got to him. Such questions often seem to dominate AGMs, leaving many chairmen with the private belief that the meetings accomplish little. 'Often the questions that are asked are not the important ones which face the business,' says one chairman of a struggling company. 'They are about trivia.' The fact that institutions seem to share this sentiment almost ensures that in many cases the main issues receive scant attention. 'If they would come and ask about the really important issues that face a company, that would create a better balanced meeting,' the chairman says. There are some companies where shareholders never ask questions, such as at the shoe company Fii where the formal part of the AGM rarely lasts more than 15 minutes. In fact, shareholders have been known to bring stop-watches to the meetings to see whether the chairman, Mr Monty Sumray, can beat his record time of less than two minutes. Publicly and privately, almost all chairmen will say that AGMs are an important part of corporate governance. 'Shareholders should have the right to question directors providing they use the AGM to ask about the company and not for political matters,' says Mr Andrew Buxton of Barclays. 'It gives them a way of voicing their concerns.' For many, the most useful part of the meeting is when the business is concluded, and shareholders seek out the board personally.</p>

Chiang said Monday [17 January] that Taiwan may  unilaterally lower import tariffs prior to holding tariff  consultations with the United States Jan. 19-20.    The move will help Taiwan avoid additional tariff cuts  during  later negotiations about Taiwan's entry to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Chiang said after meeting with  visiting British Deputy Secretary of Trade and Industry  Christopher Roberts.    The United States has asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 699  farm  and industrial products by as much as 50 percent. U.S.  negotiators have also been opposed to a Taiwan suggestion that  the tariff cuts be included as part of expected GATT-related  tariff cuts.    If Taiwan gives in to both U.S. and GATT demands, Chiang  said, Taiwan would have to cut import tariffs twice.    However, a unilateral tariff reduction prior to negotiations  with the U.S. would effectively help minimize any undesirable  impact, Chiang added.    Meanwhile, Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of  Foreign Trade left Taiwan Monday for Washington, D.C., where he  will take part in tariff negotiations with U.S. Trade  Representative Office officials.    Huang said prior to his departure that government agencies  have concluded that Taiwan can allow tariff cuts for only 10  percent of the industrial products requested by the United  States, and tariffs will not be reduced on any agricultural  items.</p>

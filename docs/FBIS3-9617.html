Manolic, the former head of the intelligence  service in communist Croatia, represents the moderates.  Following the outbreak of fighting between Muslims and Croats  in Bosnia in 1993, a split arose between Manolic and Tudjman.  On Thursday, Manolic was ousted from the HDZ party leadership  and the Central Committee.    "It is a coup," the elderly politician calmly states. "But  it is not so much directed against me as against the Washington  accord. Under strong pressure from the United States, Tudjman  has signed the agreement for a confederation with Bosnia, but he  has never for a moment planned to implement the accord."    Politicians from the moderate wing of the HDZ who support  the  accord also believe that Tudjman saw the removal of the  influential Manolic as a way of being free to interpret the  agreement as he thinks fit. Last Friday the Bosnian Croats,  Bosnian Muslims, and Croatia agreed in Washington to form a  federation in Bosnia, later to be enlarged into a confederation  with Croatia. Tudjman was himself present at the ceremony,  which he later described as a major step toward peace in the  former Yugoslavia.    Manolic, an enthusiastic supporter of the confederation  plans, went further. The day after the signing he called for  the removal of Croatian Defense Minister Susak. This hardliner  from Herzegovina is the support and anchor of the Croatian hawks  in Herzegovina who are trying to set up their own state in the  southwest of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "This man," says Manolic, "is responsible for the senseless,  cruel war between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia, it is he who  implicated Croatia in this war by sending Croatian troops to the  war zone, and he is responsible for the international  community's threat to impose sanctions against Croatia due to  this military involvement."    "Susak is so pleased with the Washington accord, so pleased  that he wished it had never existed. If we want to seriously  implement the accord, then Susak must go."    "But Tudjman does not want to get rid of Susak, and does not  want any agreement. He is simply afraid of losing Western  support for Croatia, of sanctions. As a gesture of goodwill to  the international community he replaced the hawk Boban as leader  of the Bosnian Croats by the more moderate Zubak."    "An empty gesture," says Manolic. "Zubak is no more than a  stand in and the extremists all remain in their posts. Boban  was simply the tip of the iceberg. But if you touch Susak the  iceberg starts to wobble." The serene politician flared up:  "Can you imagine that Susak in an interview with THE JERUSALEM  POST, a Jewish newspaper, said the following: `My father was a  ustasha, but not a fascist, he was a patriot.'"    "I knew that I risked coming under fire myself when I called  for Susak to go. We had already made a bet on it," he cracks  with smile for his adviser Zdenko Svete. Manolic, seated at the  head of a large, highly polished table, exudes an air of  serenity as he receives congratulations from excited members of  Parliament for his tactical move at Friday morning's Senate  session.    It had been the intention to move a motion of no confidence  in the parliamentary leader at the beginning of the session, but  the disorganized MP's missed their opportunity. This formally  entitled Manolic to himself determine the time allowed for the  vote, with the restriction that it must take place within 30  days. He therefore still has some respite. At the time of this  conversation the session has been suspended for one hour. "They  are telephoning Tudjman," says Manolic with a grin.    Manolic was once a colleague and personal friend of the  Croatian president. In early 1993 things started to go wrong.  Then war broke out between the former allies in Bosnia, the  Muslims and the Croats, and although Tudjman denied Zagreb's  involvement in the war, Manolic knew better. But support for  the "extremists in Herzegovina" was not the only stumbling block  in their relationship, he now says.    "I have always openly criticized the judiciary system. The  fact that we have only recently achieved independence, that a  war is being waged within our borders, are not circumstances  which can be used as excuses for the inefficiency of the legal  system. We have our extremists in Croatia, and these also  include people from the government, from the governing party."    "There is a mentality of grab what you can get, there is a  lively black market trade, former public property is being  plundered, houses burned, and human rights infringed.  Opposition parties have no chance, the media is being strictly  controlled by the government. Little is being done to stop any  of this and I have repeatedly spoken out against it, but I do  not believe that it has been reported in the media."    He therefore reckoned on the possibility that one day he  would have to go. Tudjman is and remains the boss. "But the  timing is bad," says Manolic. "He is shooting himself in the  foot. Tudjman is now showing the outside world exactly what  kind of authoritarian leader he is and how he is in fact opposed  to the Washington accord. This is the kind of high-handed,  undemocratic leader the West is having to deal with."</p>

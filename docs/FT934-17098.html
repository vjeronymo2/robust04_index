			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT hit by broker revisions SWIFT reaction by UK analysts currently visiting BAT's US insurance operation sent the shares tumbling after analysts phoned home with gloomy views on near-term prospects. By the close, the shares had lost 20 to 462p, making them the day's biggest losers among FT-SE 100 stocks, as volume rose to 5.1m. Researchers at James Capel appeared to be the first off the mark. Early in the day the broker was reported to have downgraded 1994 profit expectations from Pounds 2.05bn to Pounds 2.01bn. Hoare Govett was advising investors to 'take profits'. Dealers cited the poorer than expected performance at Farmers, the group's California-based insurance group, possible increases in US taxes on tobacco, and the continuing price war with arch-rival US group Philip Morris. Further profit downgrades are expected next week when the analysts return from the US trip.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Agneta Engqvist report: "ABB Buys Leading Electrical </F> Engineering Company in Vietnam"]    [Text] ABB [Asea Brown Boveri] has gained a real head start  through a strategic investment in Vietnam. The company is  taking over one of the country's leading electrical engineering  plants. This will be the first of at least five jointly owned  companies over the next few years.    "This gives us a real thrust," Ulf Rolander, ABB's managing  director in Vietnam, said. According to ABB, this initiates a  business that will reach an annual figure of 0.8 to 1.5 billion  Swedish kronor [SKr] in Vietnam by the turn of the century.    In practice, this means jobs worth hundreds of millions of  kronor for ABB companies in, among other places, Finspang,  Vaesteras, and Ludvika.    ABB thus becomes a majority owner of a local Vietnamese  company already showing a profit today. This will be the first  jointly owned electrical engineering company in the country.  <H5>  A Dominating Position </H5>   ABB takes 65 percent of the new joint venture company and  the  transformer company CTBT outside Hanoi takes 35 percent. CTBT  has a dominating position on the market.    The new jointly owned company is called ABB Transformers  Ltd.    The plant is to employ 600 people and produce power  distribution transformers based on the most recent technology.    It aims to become one of the three best of ABB's 30 plants  in  the world in this product sector in terms of cost efficiency,  quality, and technology.    "One of the tools, a low-cost piece of equipment, is already  in place," Rolander explained. The plant will later add, among  other things, medium-tension switch gears and power transformers  to its product range.  <H5>  A Twofold Strategy </H5>   ABB Vice President Goran Lindahl, in charge of the  transmission and distribution sector, explained: "Our strategy  focuses on two fronts: import of projects that attract  favorable financial support from Sweden and other countries, and  the creation of products with value added through local  manufacturing, assembly, and engineering."    This shared-risk enterprise sets a precedent, making it  simpler to obtain funds from the World Bank and the Asian  Development Bank (ADB), which often insist on local  manufacturing as a condition.  <H5>  Development Subsidies </H5>   ABB also hopes to get subsidies from SIDA [Swedish  International Development Agency] and BITS [Agency for  International Technical and Economic Cooperation], basing its  argument on the fact that much of the project has to do with the  supply of electricity to the population. The rate of energy  consumption per capita in Vietnam is one of the lowest in the  world.    The sales volume of ABB's project is expected to reach  between SKr0.8 and 1.5 billion in five years. Half the turnover  is expected to come from local manufacturing and the other half  from imports into Vietnam.    This creates immense opportunities for ABB in Sweden,  Finland, and Norway: Stal in Finspang with gas turbines,  Vaesteras with signaling systems for railroads, and Ludvika with  such things as high-tension switch gears.</p>

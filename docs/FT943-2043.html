			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bryant jumps 99% after completions surge in north A surge in completions in the north of England caused a 99 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Bryant Group, the Midlands-based housebuilder. In the year to May 31 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 36.5m on turnover up from Pounds 310m to Pounds 392m. Operating profits rose from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 37.7m. Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief executive, said the development of a multi-regional structure had strengthened the homes division and put it in a position to benefit from a steady improvement in the UK economy. 'We will see volume increases on the back of our regional expansion,' he said. The homes division contributed 78 per cent of turnover and 90 per cent of operating profit. It had been helped to a strong start in 1994 by fixed rate mortgages, Mr MacKenzie said. The division recorded a 15 per cent increase in financial completions to a record 3,255. The main 'growth in Homes has come from Northern,' Mr Mackenzie said. There were 400 completions from Yorkshire and the North West. Selling prices rose from Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 95,000 Sales since May were 30 per cent higher than the same period last year and provided the position Bryant needed to achieve its target of 15 per cent growth for 1995. The luxury homes division Bryant Country Homes, with average selling prices of Pounds 300,000, saw its first 15 completions. Mr MacKenzie said initial setting up costs had led to small deficits for Country Homes and Scotland. The land market had become increasingly competitive and was likely to remain difficult, he said. 'The planning system, particularly in the south east, is consistently failing to provide an adequate supply for market needs.' Bryant increased its directly held land bank by 1,000 lots to 9,200. Gearing stood at 14 per cent compared with a cash positive position last year. Earnings per share rose from 4.9p to 8.9p. A final dividend of 3.6p (3.4p) has been recommended. COMMENT These results exceeded even the top end of expectations, and with them Bryant brings a sense of security to a sector that has had its fair share of scares. The company has set about increasing its product mix, which will lift margins, and extending its geographical base, which will generate volume growth. With all this in place, the  1/2 per cent interest rate rise has failed to dent the optimism surrounding the company. The shares look cheap with a profits forecast of Pounds 50m and a p/e of 10.9.</p>

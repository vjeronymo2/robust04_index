			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown scorns 'hyped' recovery THE Conservatives were 'over-hyping' signs of economic recovery to win the Newbury by-election, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday, as the Tories sighted not just green shoots but 'a green branch'. Mr Ashdown later accused the Tories of reviving their general election campaign pledge of 'Vote for us on Thursday and the recovery will start on Friday'. He said the Tories' 'irresponsibility' in talking up the prospects for economic recovery could lead to a 'catastrophic decline in confidence' after the by-election on May 6. 'Britain may have been conned last April by the Conservatives saying the recovery would begin tomorrow. I don't believe Newbury will be conned twice,' Mr Ashdown said. Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate for the seat which the party held with a 12,000-plus majority in the election last April, urged the Liberal Democrats to 'look recovery in the face'. He said: 'It is not so much green shoots but a green branch which is currently coming forth.' Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, added: 'What is absolutely obvious is that as the recovery takes root and becomes a shoot and a branch then we are going to see real jobs, real increases in employment prospects.' Labour was quick to ridicule the upbeat Tory message. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, campaigning in support of Mr Steve Billcliffe, said unemployment figures published tomorrow would show that Britain was entering a summer jobs crisis. The Liberal Democrats did not deny there had been encouraging indicators but Mr David Rendel, their candidate, said signs that a recovery was on the way were 'not yet firmly established'.</p>

Martin Taylor, the youthful new chief executive, says in an interview with Banking World that he has given himself two years after he starts full time in January to make an impact. 'If at the end of two years - and two years is a deliberate timeframe - the business has no direction, then that will be my fault,' he says. Things will be fixed by '96?</p>

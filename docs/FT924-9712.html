			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: Broad customs union should be on Edinburgh agenda Sir, I hope you will continue to use your considerable influence to campaign for a Europe-wide customs union that would embrace the eastern European countries (leading article, 'Eastern vision', October 29). Such a customs union might also reach a trade agreement with the former Soviet republics, based on a payments union. Central and eastern Europe lost large parts of its trade following the collapse of Comecon - part, but not all, of which has been compensated for by increased trade with the European Community. From the safe ground of a Europe-wide customs union, natural trade patterns with the Comonwealth of Independent States could be re-established. The 'Europe Agreements' between the EC and Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic have been disappointing, since almost all the commodities in which these countries have a comparative advantage (steel, textiles, certain agricultural products) are restricted by quotas. The agreements are also, as you say in your leader, bilateral. The central and eastern Europeans are coping bravely with a steep fall in per capita gross domestic product, rising unemployment and spreading poverty. Their political and economic stability is vital to us. (The former Yugoslavia provides a grim lesson in the costs of disintegration.) The need for a customs union to replace the agreements is therefore urgent. The EC, and its British presidency, should put this issue on the agenda of the Edinburgh summit now.

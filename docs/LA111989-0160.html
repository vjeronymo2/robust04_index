			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS TRY TO BEAT BEAT-UP CARDINALS  </P> <P> One local football team stopped counting its bruises and started on its  blessings this week after swapping injury reports with the Phoenix Cardinals,  whose recent medical printouts stack up nicely next to the Congressional  Record.  </P> <P> The Rams sincerely apologize for this week's meager offering:  </P> <P>  -- Quarterback Jim Everett. His back is sore, but he will start. This week,  Everett had chiropractors cracking (the same guy who works on Vice President  Dan Quayle's back), trainers training and whirlpools whirling. Note: Everett  completed 18 consecutive passes with the same back last week. Suggestion: Take  two safeties deep and call us in the morning.  </P> <P> The Phoenix report, and stand back, please:  </P> <P>  -- Quarterbacks. Had one once. Name was Neil Lomax, and last year he diced up  the Rams for 517 total yards in a 41-27 victory. Lomax and his arthritic hip  haven't been seen since early training camp. That was 18 serious injuries to  Cardinal starters ago. Today, Phoenix Coach Gene Stallings mulls over retread  quarterback Gary Hogeboom and last week's savior, Tom Tupa, although the  coach's heart isn't in it. This isn't exactly Montana vs. Young.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make that much difference," is how Stallings put it.  </P> <P> Question: Will the Cardinals field a team against the Rams today?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes, if that well-placed classified advertisement works out.  </P> <P> Actually, the Cardinals made it through last week's 24-20 win over Dallas  without calling once for the stretcher, no small victory. Two weeks ago, the  Cardinals lost eight players in a home loss to the New York Giants.  </P> <P> The list of injured Cardinals starts with C for defensive tackle Bob Clasby  (knee surgery) and extends to Y for safety Lonnie Young (shoulder -- missed  weeks 2 through 7).  </P> <P> Phoenix has played at times this year without any of the skill players  projected to be starters in training camp: quarterback Lomax and/or Hogeboom  (week 6, elbow), running backs Earl Ferrell (week 2, ankle) and Stump Mitchell  (season-ending knee surgery) and receivers J.T. Smith (week 10, ankle) and Roy  Green (weeks 6 through 9, collarbone).  </P> <P> "It's just not the same offense at all as what we had," Stallings said. "And  every defensive linemen we've got has been hurt, every one of them."  </P> <P> Stallings has never seen anything like it. He has searched long and hard for  answers but found none that satisfy him.  </P> <P> "We've lost 19 players for four weeks or more," he said. "That's a lot of guys.  Several of them had broken bones -- you can't do anything about that. I'd say  the majority have been knees. I've tried to research it, talk about it. We've  discussed it. It seems like they've just been sort of freakish things."  </P> <P> How does a Cardinal fly with clipped wings? Amazingly, it can. Phoenix wobbles  into Anaheim Stadium at 5-5, only one game worse off than the Rams.  </P> <P> "I think they are a good football team that has had a lot of injury problems  that have staggered them," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "But they're 5-5, and  you have to admire them for that. I don't know that they've beaten anybody  great or anything, but they managed to get to 5-5. It sounds like the guy is  taking some heat, but he's a good coach."  </P> <P> Stallings is drawing fire from management, despite garnering overwhelming fan  support in recent public opinion polls.  </P> <P> Stallings will make the decision more difficult should he win coach-of-the-year  honors, and he will get some votes. A tough Texan who played for Bear Bryant  and for years coached side by side with Tom Landry, Stallings draws from his  football roots to pull him through the latest crisis.  </P> <P> "My whole football background has been with good people," Stallings said. "When  I was in high school, I played for Coach Berry, Raymond Berry's daddy. When I  was at Texas A&amp;M, I was playing for Coach Bryant, then I was on his staff,  and then with Coach Landry at Dallas.  </P> <P> "I've been around people where quitting, or giving up, was never an option.  That was never an option for me when I was playing. I've got a lot of faith.  But it's been a tough year, no question about that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Cornerback LeRoy Irvin's bruised foot is considerably better, but he's talking  as if the Rams are phasing him out in favor of Clifford Hicks. Irvin said the  coaches offered no clues as to how much playing time, if any, he will get  today. "When I first came into the league I was a wild stallion," the 10-year  veteran said. "I wouldn't let no one ride me. I'd buck everybody. Now they got  me tied to the post."  </P> <P> For what it's worth, Phoenix hasn't beaten a team with a winning record, having  defeated Dallas twice, Detroit, Seattle and Atlanta. . . . Another offering  from Coach John Robinson's reporter's notebook: The Rams have played the three  top teams in the NFC this year -- San Francisco, Minnesota and the New York  Giants -- and allowed only one touchdown in 12 quarters.  </P></p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Handelsbanken back to black as loan losses fall Svenska Handelsbanken yesterday confirmed its position as the most resilient of the Nordic region's crisis-hit banks, reporting a surge back into the black to an operating profit of SKr1.8bn (Dollars 230m) in 1993 from a loss in 1992 of SKr840m. A 12 per cent rise in operating income, to SKr14.14bn, and a 15 per cent fall in loan losses, to SKr6.8bn, produced the turnround. Combined with a SKr2.6bn rights issue last October, the profits strengthened the bank's capital adequacy ratio to 12.9 per cent, comfortably above the international minimum level of 8 per cent. Two Swedish banks, Nordbanken and Gota Bank, plunged below that level in 1992. Handelsbanken said it would pay its dividend, omitted last year, at SKr2 a share for both A and B shares. However, the Stockholm stock market, which long ago discounted a speedy recovery in the banking sector, was unimpressed. Analysts said the Handelsbanken result was at the low end of expectations, and its B shares fell SKr4 yesterday to close at SKr128. Handelsbanken said a 10 per cent rise in net interest income to SKr9.9bn, fuelled by lower market interest rates and a shift to Swedish kronor lending from foreign currency, helped push up total income. Commission income fell 3 per cent, to SKr2.8bn, as a 66 per cent rise in investment banking fees was offset by a crash in foreign currency-related fees, which were at record levels in 1992. The biggest increase in income, however, came from realised profits on investment bonds. These were SKr537m, against SKr150m last time. Income from property seized as collateral for bad loans also soared, to SKr313m from SKr59m. The SKr6.8bn in loan losses - most attributed to real estate  - amounted to 2.2 per cent of the total loan portfolio, down from 2.5 per cent, and significantly below the average in the Swedish banking sector. Problem loans after provisions for possible loan losses of SKr6.87bn were down 26 per cent at SKr9.7bn. Total expenses were up 2 per cent at SKr5.4bn. However, Handelsbanken attributed the rise to a SKr114m allocation made to a staff profit-sharing foundation. Under a long-standing agreement, this can take up to one-third of the value paid in dividends to shareholders if Handelsbanken's result is better than the average of other listed banks in Sweden.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk addressed the  Ukrainian people with New Year's greetings and congratulations.  He said in part:    [Begin Kravchuk recording in Ukrainian, fading into English  translation] The 1993 year was a difficult year for all of us.  However, we succeeded in preserving three priceless things:  peace, the integrity of our land, and democracy. Thanks to our  peace-loving policy, flexibility, and wisdom of our people, we  managed to preserve good neighbors and friends abroad. And now  we have every ground to say that peace reigns supreme under each  Ukrainian roof, in every Ukrainian home, throughout our great  Ukrainian land.    Although we cannot boast of much success in economic  reforms,  but [as heard] the first serious steps have been taken. For  instance, we succeeded in building the efficient armed forces  which are capable of defending our sovereign state. Serious  reforms have taken place in education, as well as in other  spheres of our life. The Ukrainian Government and the Verkhovna  Rada [Supreme Council] have done their best to stop the further  development of crisis in economy and policy.    In this connection I would like to call upon all the  Ukrainian people, political parties, and movements, as well as  the structures of executive and legislative power, to unite  their efforts for a successful settlement of the crucial  problems in our life.    First of all, we have to find a just solution to the nuclear  arms problem. We have to settle the issue concerning the Black  Sea Fleet, which prevents us from establishing good-neighborly  relations with Russia. I am sure that our northern neighbor  will have enough wisdom and goodwill to continue cooperation  with us in the name of the successful solution of these acute  problems.    Let's unite our efforts in our striving for peace,  democracy,  and friendship.    I wish every Ukrainian family strong health, happiness, and  well- being. Happy New Year! [end recording]    [Announcer] That was a New Year address to the people of  Ukraine made by President Leonid Kravchuk.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation. At that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, the economic analysis necessary to determine critical habitat was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still in progress. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reopened the public comment period until April 30, 1993, to allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service to consider any economic or biological information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously had not been submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Revisions to the October 3, 1991, Critical Habitat Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service published a revision to the October 3, 1991, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt on January 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 (59 FR 852). The revision was based primarily on information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, U.S. Fish and Wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service pers. comm., 1993). This information showed that in 1993, delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at least as far upstream as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> City of Sacramento and in tidally-influenced shallow freshwater sloughs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively large numbers of delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meng, pers. comm., 1993). The revised rule proposed to expand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional areas now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to constitute important spawning habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in an April 23, 1993, letter received during the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standards be considered in the Service's designation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat. The water quality standards were to apply to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco Bay and Delta of the State of California (Bay/Delta) pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As a result of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis respecting the number of days that low-salinity water was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historically located at three locations in the Estuary, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refined the description of the constituent elements for the delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed critical habitat was revised therefore to encompass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream spawning habitats and to better define constituent elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to protect those areas essential to the recovery of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. Comment on the revised proposal and its draft economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis was solicited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the same date that the Service published its revised critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat rule, the Service proposed the Sacramento splittail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pogonichthys macrolepidotus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as a threatened species and EPA published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its proposed rule to establish water quality standards for surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Delta pursuant to section 303 of the CWA. Those water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are meant to protect the estuary as a whole, and therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain more than the salinity criterion. EPA's water quality proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also includes salmon smolt survival criteria to protect fish migration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 6, 1994, rule, along with proposed striped bass spawning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of critical habitat at this time is part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated effort between the Service, EPA, National Marine Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service (NMFS), and the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) (collectively,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Club Fed'') to protect and recover the delta smelt and the Estuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service and EPA recognized that their proposed regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions (e.g., delta smelt critical habitat and EPA's water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards) overlapped biologically and economically. As such, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies worked closely to provide a comprehensive, ecosystem-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach for the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary. This coordination has resulted in regulatory actions that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated in both substance and timing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biologically, the critical habitat designation for the delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the salinity criteria within EPA's water quality standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly related. Specifically, salinities of 2 ppt in Suisun Bay were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified as a primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that salinities associated with the distribution of delta smelt may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by freshwater discharge from the Estuary (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Francisco Estuary Project 1993). Favorable conditions from February  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through June are important to the abundance and reproductive success of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Estuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because EPA's water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinities from February to June, its standards will address certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat (water quality) requirements for delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the text of the January, 6, 1994, proposed rule to designate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat for the delta smelt, the Service identified specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinity criteria required to maintain habitat for delta smelt through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its entire life cycle. These criteria had been determined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Subsequent to publication of the critical habitat proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, the Service received many comments objecting to the specificity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the salinity criteria. During numerous discussions with interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties (and in the following response to comments), Service staff have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that the detailed discussion within the text of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule was meant to clearly describe the need for including a water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality criterion specific to salinity as one primary constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element. The actual regulation that was proposed for publication in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code of Federal Regulations, however, was much less specific as to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad flexibility in implementation of the provisions of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, to clarify the Service's intent to preserve the flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in implementation of the section 7 regulations, the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of the primary constituent elements necessary to define delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt critical habitat, is general in scope. However, the Service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated carefully and extensively with EPA to ensure that EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule promulgating Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the State of California affords sufficient protection to further the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of the delta smelt. EPA's final rule is published in this same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in a separate part. In its proposed rule, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that specific comments be submitted on several issues,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the possibility of modifying the Sacramento River Index for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purposes of developing the salinity criteria, alternative approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the averaging period used in its proposed salinity criteria, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of the merits of the use of different forms of confidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals with the proposed criteria. In developing this final rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service has considered all such comments. These issues also were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed with EPA in regard to the development of its water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and the Service's section 7 consultation with EPA on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of these standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7 of the Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species or adversely modify designated critical habitat. EPA's action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in promulgating water quality standards must comply with the section 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

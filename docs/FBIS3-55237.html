			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The deputies' association "Belarus" stands for the  Republic's integration into the international community.  However, it sees as its top priority the establishment of  mutually beneficial relations with Belarusian neighbors, first  of all, with Russia as well as Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and  Latvia. This was declared by the largest legislative faction at  its meeting with a European Parliament delegation in charge of  cooperation with CIS states headed by Magdalene (Hoe). In the  words of Gennadiy Kozlov, "Belarus" acting coordinator, the  faction is intensively working on strengthening integration with  Russia proceeding from, as was emphasized, the sovereignty of  the Belarusian state, and perceives Germany as the main partner  in Europe.</p>

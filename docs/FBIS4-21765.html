			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has decided to divide Asyut Governorate into four zones,  each of which will be supervised by an officer with the rank of  major general.    The minister also decided to appoint two deputies to the  director of Asyut security to facilitate the issuance and  following up of decisions.    The decision falls within the context of the security  strategy pursued by the Interior Ministry in view of the  geographical terrain and social nature of Asyut Governorate.    The interior minister's decision also took care to bolster  the Asyut security directorate with a group of highly trained  officers to meet current security needs.    Minister al-Alfi met earlier today with the new commands  that  have moved to Asyut Governorate and instructed them on security  operations there.    The minister also issued a decision to set up four public  directorates in the prison authority and to upgrade the latter  into a department.    These directorates have been bolstered by commanding  officers  who enjoy a high level of security performance.</p>

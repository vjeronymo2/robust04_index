			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Salvador Perez Aleman, member of the Managua </F> Department Sandinist Assembly]    [Text] A recent Sandinist departmental assembly began  debating the reorganization of the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] in Managua. I would like to make a few remarks  that could serve as a backdrop to the discussion about the  reorganization of the FSLN now that it has approved by consensus  the constitutional reforms for holding talks with UNO [National  Opposition Union] and the government.    First of all, we must have a clear idea of the kind of  Sandinism that we want to organize. Sandinism is a broad  political front based on a revolutionary identity inherited from  our Heroes and Martyrs. We are patriots by calling and we  identify with the people because we are for social justice and  equitable national development that benefits all sectors.    We often hear people say: "I am a Sandinist but I do not  agree with this or that form of political action" or "I would  like to be involved this way." Sandinism is a party to which  people from all segments of society belong or with which they  identify, but this does not mean that there does not exist a  strong detachment of proven, reliable leaders.    Second, besides having a wide range of members, the FSLN  uses  methods of action that represent national, institutional, local,  sectorial, economic, trade-union, labor-union, humanitarian,  etc., interests.  <H5>  A Vehicle for Leadership </H5>   In each one of these struggles there are Sandinists who from  the rank and file lend it a combative, democratic, grass-roots  character. A reorganization must take into account this fact.  The FSLN has to be reorganized in a versatile manner.    The FSLN's devotion to the people and its potential for  governing oblige us to maintain smooth communications with  sectors that in keeping with our philosophy represent our  natural social base but that for various reasons have drifted  away from Sandinism: peasants from the highlands, ethnic groups,  young people, merchants, housewives, etc.    The reorganization of leadership, intermediate, and  rank-and-file structures must take into account the various  manifestations of Sandinism, and we must clearly realize that  these structures are vehicles for facilitating the exercise of  leadership and achieving the objectives of the various struggles.    We must bring about a revolution in opportunities for all  Sandinists and for the people in general, by expanding them for  those who already have them and by creating them for those who  do not (the unemployed, the illiterate, discrimination victims,  etc.).    National structures and local or sectorial leaders must  further Sandinist influence without blocking the ideas of the  rank and file, by combining individual initiative and creativity  with democratic consensus.    I lean towards a coordinating structure that does not  centralize decision-making, that combines experience with youth;  towards a social movement with comprehensive political  leadership and equality between men and women; one that  moderates rather than coerces; one that is more representative  of the social sectors than of nonfunctional structures; one that  promotes debate and organizes compliance with resolutions.    Among the rank and file we would set up regional, sectorial,  interest-group, or trade-union Sandinist assemblies with  executive committees. The plenum of such Sandinist assemblies  would be organized openly and broadly to serve as a conduit for  party life and would listen to individual and group opinions and  eventually forge a single collective thought.    The rank-and-file Sandinist assembly would meet at least  twice a year to make decisions. As for daily political work,  action would be taken by economic unit, trade union, social  sector, project, commission, symposium, or any other form of  organization.  <H5>  Scope and Rank-and-File Debate </H5>   The primary goal is to bring the people together to defend  their interests, to promote the comprehensive development of  society and the country, and to seek power in order to achieve  our political objectives.    A prerequisite for a successful reorganization of the FSLN  is  to abolish the difference between activist [militante] and  member [afiliado]. Under the current conditions of thorough FSLN  democratization there ought to be equal opportunities, duties,  and rights for all who are part of the Sandinist party  organization.    Even before the 1996 election campaign I would like to  support the idea of establishing minimum channels for partisan  political communication among Sandinists in electoral precincts.  Ultimately, it is at the ballot box that the party demonstrates  the organizational, political, and ideological strength and  depth that it possesses to implement its program for the people.    The FSLN must embody most of the interests and just  struggles  of the people. This mean supporting and making room for the  emerging sectors of society, especially the ones that wave  patriotic, revolutionary, and grass-roots banners.    This open debate must be carried to all Sandinists without  party membership cards as a first step towards reincorporating  them, reorganizing ourselves, and heading down the road to  electoral victory with an FSLN that is united amid its well  known diversity.</p>

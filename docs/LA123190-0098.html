			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> POLICE RESERVE UNIT CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY  </P> <P> Members of the 440th Military Police detachment based in Irvine are scheduled  to report for active duty at the Army Reserve Center at Los Alamitos on  Thursday to receive equipment and fill out paperwork before leaving for  training at Ft. Ord.  </P> <P> The 10-member 440th, which specializes in detaining prisoners of war, consists  mostly law enforcement officers who work for police departments in Orange  County.  </P> <P> As many as 2,000 reservists from California, Nevada and Arizona have been  called to active duty from the 63rd Army Reserve Command headquarters at Los  Alamitos since the Persian Gulf crisis erupted in early August.  </P> <P> Ted Bartimus, a spokesman for the 63rd Army Reserve Command, said the small,  Irvine-based unit was being called up "in support of Operation Desert Shield."  But he would not speculate on whether the detachment would be shipped to the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> But Bartimus did say it would be about a week before the unit would leave the  area for Ft. Ord in Northern California. GEORGE FRANK  </P></p>

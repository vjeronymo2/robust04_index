			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a ruling by the chief prosecutor's  office in Budapest, the Hungarist Movement cannot be registered  by the court under the prevailing law. The prosecutor's office  have informed the Budapest court about this in a letter. The  court is to decide on the movement's application for  registration in an extrajudicial procedure.    The prosecutor's office drew the court's attention to the  fact that the real aims of the Hungarist Movement are  demonstrated by its leaders' statements, from which it emerges  that they regard Ferenc Szalasi, the leader of the former Arrow  Cross movement, as their ideal, and even the name of their  organization is identical to the former fascist movement. In  the peace treaty concluded at the end of World War II, Hungary  undertook an obligation that it would not allow fascist  organizations to function.</p>

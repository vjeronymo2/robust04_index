			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Rate of job losses slows in France The increase in French unemployment slowed sharply during November, increasing by 3,200 to 3.29m, the labour ministry announced yesterday. The unemployment rate at the end of the month was stable at 12 per cent of the workforce. A ministry official welcomed the figures and said they showed the effects of government measures to encourage training schemes and part-time employment. But he said that the rate of unemployment was likely to increase further. This view was echoed by private sector economists. 'The rate of increase has slackened but we are likely to see further rises in unemployment until the second half of next year,' said Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at Morgan Guaranty. The slowing in the rise of unemployment in November partly reflected a reduced number of job losses in the services sector. Economists said that it also represented a correction from the sharp increase in October, when the rate jumped from 11.8 per cent to 12 per cent. November's unemployment figures are the latest in a series of statistics which suggest that the economy has endured the worst of its sharp recession. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, argues that the economy is now stabilising and is due to expand by about 1.4 per cent next year in terms of gross domestic product. Improved economic performance will, however, take time to curb the rate of joblessness, the most serious problem facing the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. 'There is a lag of a few quarters before growth feeds through into jobs,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers. The French environment minister, Mr Michel Barnier, yesterday called for an extraordinary EU meeting to review sea transport rules following the littering of France's western coast by explosives and pesticides which washed up on the shore, Reuter reports from Paris. Some 5,000 explosive detonators, believed to have been spilled by a Cypriot vessel in September, began washing up on French beaches on December 17. 'The current situation is unbearable and seriously endangers Europe's environment,' Mr Barnier said in a letter to his Greek counterpart, Mr Costas Laliotis, who would call such a meeting during his country's presidency of the EC starting next month. 'The measures which must be taken. . . to avoid such accidents becoming banal must be the product of international talks as a country cannot take action on sea transport on its own,' he added.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Aetna says storm claims will cut earnings by Dollars 27m AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers, said yesterday that the cost of claims from the winter storm that struck New York city and parts of the eastern seaboard in early December would reduce fourth-quarter after-tax earnings by about Dollars 27m, or 25 cents a share. So far, Aetna says it has received about 14,000 claims, and it expects the total to climb to about 18,000. The December storm - named Winter Storm Beth - was the second major weather catastrophe to affect US insurers last year. Claims from Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern Florida last summer, helped inflate third-quarter catastrophe losses at Aetna's property and casualty unit from Dollars 6m to Dollars 29m. Aetna is expected to report fourth-quarter results on February 10. In the fourth quarter last year, the company made a net profit of Dollars 93m.</p>

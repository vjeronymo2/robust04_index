			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Bank funding prepares for a heavy year THE Bank of England has been particularly active in plying the gilt-edged market with stock over the past fortnight. There was the Pounds 2.5bn auction on January 27, followed on the same day by the announcement of Pounds 550m of stock for sale. And then last week, the Bank offered a further Pounds 750m of conventional and index-linked stocks. Some economists calculate that the government may be fully funded already for the current financial year, so any further gilt issuance which takes place before March 31 may well go towards funding the very heavy borrowing requirement for 1993-1994. The big four gilt-edged marketmakers - BZW, Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged (GMGE), UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and SG Warburg Securities - have provided slightly different funding calculations, according to their respective estimates for the amount spent on defending sterling, National Savings sales, and bank and building society purchases of gilts. Mr Ifty Islam, economist at BZW, estimates that there is still some Pounds 1.7bn of gilt issuance to be done this year, based on an estimated public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 37bn, and gross official gilt sales of Pounds 32.35bn for full funding. 'We had been assuming that the costs of defending the pound on Black Wednesday would see underlying reserves fall by Pounds 12bn in 1992-1993,' says Mr Islam. However, he has since cut the estimate for the fall in underlying reserves to Pounds 10bn, and concludes that 'rather than being fully funded, the authorities have Pounds 1.7bn of gilt issuance remaining'. However, economists at the other three big market-makers estimate that the government has overfunded already. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at GMGE, believes the government has overfunded by about Pounds 2bn. This is based on a PSBR forecast of Pounds 39bn and estimates that the authorities have sold Pounds 32bn worth of gilts, Pounds 29bn of which count as funding. If National Savings receipts contribute Pounds 4bn to funding over the year, this leaves a required funding of Pounds 13bn. Mr Briscoe points out that the sterling proceeds of foreign exchange intervention to support the currency can be regarded as contributing to funding, although these proceeds will not necessarily count within any single financial year. 'If all intervention proceeds count as funding in this financial year, then based on our forecast of Pounds 15bn total currency intervention, the authorities are overfunded by Pounds 2bn,' he says. However, he points out that the Bank will probably use every available opportunity to sell gilts, given the heavy borrowing requirement for 1993-1994. In his view, the gilt market is likely to see another auction between the Budget on March 16 and the financial year-end, as well as some tranches of stock. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities, warns that 'while we are now fully funded, based on an estimated PSBR of Pounds 37bn, and are eating into next year, a smallish overshoot on the PSBR could wipe out the overfund. We could see some tranches and one more auction at the end of March, so we could end up with some Pounds 3bn or more overfunding.' At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, economist Mr Philip Tyson calculates that the overfund is in the region of Pounds 2bn so far, and that the Bank 'will take every opportunity (to fund) given the large increase in borrowing in the next financial year'. Economists forecast that in the 1993-1994 financial year the Bank will have to issue an average of Pounds 1bn of gilts a week to fund the PSBR. Hence, it makes sense for the Bank to try to forward fund as much as possible, even if a 'mere' Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn of forward funding looks rather insignificant against an estimated Pounds 50bn of total gilt funding.</p>

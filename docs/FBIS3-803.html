ANC regional monitoring co-ordinator  Roy Ainslie, charged that Section 61 of the Electoral Act had  been contravened. The section prohibits interference with free  political activity. "We are extremely concerned that this could  be a foretaste of what we can expect on election day unless  something is done about the nature of policing."    He charged police were unable to contain the situation.  Police could not be immediately reached for comment.    A tense standoff ensued earlier as thousands of ANC  supporters thronged the street leading to the King Zwelithini  Stadium, while about 500 metres away, several hundred IFP  supporters mobilised in the stadium. Police fortified the road  with armoured vehicles, and stood rifle at the ready, to prevent  any potential clashes.    Later police teargassed ANC supporters who were preparing to  leave shortly after an address by ANC National Chairman Thabo  Mbeki, Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe and Transkei ruler  Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa. Supporters scattered for cover, and a  volley of gunfire pierced the smoke-filled air. No one was  reported injured.    Within minutes the street where ANC supporters had cheered  on  their leaders, was empty, bar the piles of shoes left behind by  retreating men, women and children. Monitors on the scene  charged that police had lobbed teargas canisters first, forcing  fleeing supporters to fire. Minutes later, the stadium's  occupants left in the opposite direction.    In a telephonic interview later, IFP spokesman Ed Tillet  condoned the occupation of the stadium. He said the occupation  was a response to continued attacks on its members in Umlazi and  surrounding townships. "What's happened doesn't surprise me.  Under normal circumstances we would never condone this. The  extraordinary circumstances prevailing in the area have  culminated in this action. We believe the ANC has got their just  rewards. This is a taste of their own medicine." He added the  occupation was sanctioned by the SA [South African] Hostel  Dwellers Association and not the IFP. The association is  non-aligned but IFP-sympathetic.    Transitional Executive Council [TEC] member Pravin Gordhan  charged that police failure to remove IFP supporters from the  stadium showed its partiality to them. "There is also an  unwillingness by police to ensure the electoral act can be put  into place throughout the country," Mr Gordhan told SAPA.    Meanwhile in his address to the mass of supporters, Mr Mbeki  said: "The ANC are not cowards. If we were we would have  entered the stadium, but because of our nature we prefer not to  use violence." On a political note, Mr Mbeki charged IFP leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi was afraid to contest elections due to a  fractional support base. He said if Mr Buthelezi's claim to  have millions of IFP supporters were true, he should participate  in the April poll.    Gen Holomisa, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the  Military Council of Transkei, urged all homeland defence forces,  and private armies to be placed under the control of the TEC.  This would ensure that troop deployment would no longer be  undertaken by the National Party Government, he said.</p>

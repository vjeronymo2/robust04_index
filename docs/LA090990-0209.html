			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAND SCULPTORS LEND A HAND TO CHARITABLE CAUSES  </P> <P> As the team of amateur sculptors from Southern California Gas Co. tackled a  small mountain of hardened sand Saturday morning, Perry Hallman spelled out  their goal for the day.  </P> <P> "This year, hopefully, we will beat Disneyland," said Hallman, who was  overseeing creation of the gas company's sand sculpture, a boy beckoning to two  playful dolphins.  </P> <P> The entry, titled "Friends Helping Friends," was one of 51 entries in the  seventh annual Sandcastle Contest, sponsored by the United Way of Orange  County.  </P> <P> The contest that pitted corporate and nonprofit companies in friendly  competition marked the beginning of the United Way's yearlong campaign to raise  $22.5 million.  </P> <P> The money, said United Way spokesman Jeff Rocke, will go to fund a variety of  charitable programs, from the Red Cross to an array of programs dealing with  health care, child care, homelessness and other needs.  </P> <P> "We're trying hard to emphasize that although this is a day of fun and sun,"  Rocke said, "the real purpose of the United Way contest is to help people know  that we are there to help."  </P> <P> For four hours, while beach-goers and family cheerleaders looked on, teams of  amateur sand sculptors hunkered down to turn blocks of sand into towering  castles, detailed sculptures and free-form objects.  </P> <P> By the end of the day, neither the gas company nor Disneyland took home the  trophy for best sculpture.  </P> <P> Despite Disneyland's dazzling sculpture of characters from the motion picture  "The Little Mermaid," the top honor went to the the nonprofit organization Sand  Sculpture Coalition for its rendering of "Hobbit" creatures.  </P> <P> "It was darling," said United Way spokeswoman Dena Montiel.  </P> <P> Honors for the best sandcastle went to Chevron USA, whose fortress was  surrounded by a mermaid-eating dragon.  </P> <P> A special award went to Pacific Mutual for its sculpture of a homeless man and  his dog lying in the street. The free-form first-place award went to Kevin  Chung and Friends for their creation called "Waves."  </P> <P> The best first-time entry went to Texaco for its carving of seals on the beach.  The award for the most team spirit went to Lucky Market for a sculpture called  "At the Hop."  </P> <P> And the most humorous award went to Unocal for a sculpture called "Conserve  Water, Bathe with a Friend," in which a boy taking a bath is horrified to  discover an alligator swimming in the tub.  </P> <P> "Last year we did an offshore oil rig," said Unocal employee Marie Nixon. "That  didn't go over at all."  </P></p>

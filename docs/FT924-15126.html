			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Volatility in rates STERLING cash rates rose sharply yesterday morning after the pound slumped to a new historic low of DM2.3690 against the D-Mark, suggesting that another cut in UK base rates was unlikely to materialise. However, rates softened closer to the day's opening level in the afternoon as the pound rebounded by about 3 pfennigs to around DM2.39. The fall in world stockmarkets also suggested that the case for a rate cut may become stronger in Europe. In the morning, 3 month sterling cash rose to 9 3/8 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 9 1/8 per cent, while 1 month money was up at 9 1/2 per cent. Sterling futures also dipped sharply as dealers began to wonder whether the Conservatives might be forced into a rate rise to support the pound in the week of their party conference. The December short sterling contract fell 47 basis points to a low of 91.25 in the morning. However, in the afternoon, the case for a rate cut resurfaced. Three-month money closed at 9 3/16 per cent, while the 1-month closed at 9 7/16 per cent. One clearing bank dealer said that there was no market pressure for a base rate rise with period rates at these levels. The December contract closed at 91.69, 3 basis points down on the day. A discount house dealer said that the day's events had convinced him that there was an overwhelming case for a cut in UK base rates. He said that a rate rise could neither support sterling, the lira, nor most European currencies. The case for a rate cut was also underlined by the fall in the FT-SE index of 100 leading shares, which registered the largest one-day fall since Black Tuesday in 1987. 'Britain's politicians are living in Disneyworld,' he said. 'They should have cut rates by 2 per cent two weeks ago.' The Bank of England's operations were straightforward. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 347m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 97m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 910m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.55bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 206m of Band 1 bank bills.</p>

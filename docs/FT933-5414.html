			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: Caesar in a crowd THE FIRST, if obvious, comment on Peter Stein's production of Julius Caesar is that it is so very, very, German. This has nothing to do with the language. Shakespeare translates well into a tongue that has much in common with his own. It is a point about concepts. The Germans have a fatal habit of becoming hooked on a single big idea. The big idea in Stein's production is that there should be a very large crowd. Whereas a normal production of Julius Caesar might have a crowd of about 50, and often considerably less, Stein goes for a crowd of around 200, and very impressive it sometimes seems. Yet the size of the crowd immediately creates new problems. Only a very large space can accommodate it. In Edinburgh there are few large spaces available, so the search for Lebensraum led to the Royal Highland Exhibition Hall in Ingliston. The inside of the hall looks like a mixture of a huge aircraft hangar and a shipyard. Again, this may be a bonus. Certainly the crowd in Stein's Julius Caesar have a close resemblance to the shipyard workers who used to rebel in Gdansk. They seem the very model of an industrial proletariat. The technique of having the crowd stream in from all sides works once, possibly twice. Being German-directed, however, it is a very organised crowd and there is some danger of repetition. By the time the original crowd was doubling as helmeted soldiers running backwards and forwards with riot shields I began to laugh, which presumably is the last reaction Stein is looking for. There is a more serious objection to designing a play to fit a single concept. It arose when Robert LePage designed A Midsummer Night's Dream in a swamp in London last year. It seems a good idea for half an hour or so, but the trouble is that once you have introduced a swamp to the stage you are stuck with it to the end. So it is with Julius Caesar. Some scenes in Julius Caesar - between Caesear and his wife, for example, - are of great intimacy. They do not need the vast space created for 200 people. Not even Stein's controlled use of lighting can conceal the fact that a large part of his space is often distractingly empty. We are looking at a vacuum. Besides, the role of the crowd fades in the last third of the play. It becomes a battleground, but the best scenes are to do with personal confrontations and griefs, not fighting. Stein's approach seems to be that if you have 200 extras available, you might as well redeploy them as storm troopers. There is just a suggestion that this is what happened in the rise of Nazi Germany, but it does not really fit the rest of the production. By enlarging the cast list, Stein has diminished the play and also the art of theatre, which works by suggestion as well as action. A much smaller crowd, with faces that could be distinguished, would have been far more menacing - and more menaced. Martin Benrath's Caesar looks engagingly like Mikhael Gorbachev and there is a thoroughly tortured Brutus in Thomas Holtzmann. The best moment in the production is when he finally and reluctantly stabs a Caesar who is coming to him for support.</p>

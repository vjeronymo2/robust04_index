			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher The derating of Kingfisher's shares since the start of the year has been savage. From their high at the turn of the year the shares have fallen by some 25 per cent. In part that reflects an equally over-enthusiastic run up in the shares before Christmas. It is also a response to the disappointing Christmas trading statement in January and the persistent worry that there is something nasty in the Woolworths woodshed. Perhaps most serious is the concern that the religion of 'Everyday Low Pricing' preached by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, may not be working. The idea that a combination of lower margins, better ranges and improved service can generate sufficient market share gains to offset its costs and increase profits is seductive. But ELP is complex to operate and requires investment in sophisticated systems, an area in which Kingfisher lagged in the past. Adopting ELP certainly helped Kingfisher stop the guerrilla price war in do-it-yourself. It may also have been an attempt to pre-empt the arrival of US retailers like Home Depot in the UK. Still, it is not clear that Kingfisher has accepted the full implications and costs of the direction it has chosen. Mr Alan Smith was brought in as chief executive from Marks and Spencer a year ago, partly to help improve Kingfisher's systems and distribution. Little has seen of him since. If the market's faith in Sir Geoff's vision is to be restored, a clearer view is needed of how the ELP strategy is to be implemented. Outstanding questions include: how far and fast and into which of Kingfisther's businesses will ELP be introduced. The presentation of its full-year figures next month would seem as good an opportunity as any to provide the answers.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : LOVING DUKE MADLY AS BIRTHDAY APPROACHES; ANDY SIMPKINS BACK TO  THE BASS AFTER SURGERY  </P> <P> Duke Ellington, who died on May 24, 1974, would have been 90 this Saturday and  in memory of his birthday, numerous celebrations are scheduled that day around  the Southland. KUSC-FM (91.5) interrupts its usual 24-hour classical format to  present "My Sparkling Parade," a 90-minute audio portrait of the great  composer-bandleader-pianist.  </P> <P> Airing at 6 p.m., the program includes interviews with Los Angeles Philharmonic  Music Director Andre Previn, composer-author Gunther Schuller and Ellington  collaborator Maurice Peress. In his interview, Schuller, author of the recently  published "The Swing Era," places Ellington in the forefront of American  composers, in the company of Ives, Copland and Gershwin. The show's musical  examples will be drawn from previously unreleased Ellington symphonic sessions.  </P> <P> Special live-performance Ellington fetes include the Santa Barbara City College  Jazz Festival, where "A Birthday Tribute to Duke," featuring trumpeter Jon  Faddis, pianist Billy Mitchell and others, will be held at the Arlington  Theatre, 8 p.m.; and "Happy Birthday, Duke," at the Islander Cafe in  Mid-Wilshire, where singers Tom Briggs and Lisa Nobumoto offer a tribute in  song. No doubt Ellington tunes will be heard in other nightspots around town.  </P> <P> BOUNCING BACK: Andy Simpkins, the bassist for the last nine years with singer  Sarah Vaughan and a regular free-lancer in Los Angeles jazz clubs, is back to  active playing after undergoing a hip replacement in January.  </P> <P> After surgery, Simpkins -- who plays this Friday with the Gerald Wiggins trio  at the Loa in Santa Monica -- kept playing at home. But he really missed  getting out to clubs. "That was the worst part of my recuperation."  </P> <P> Now, "playing is great," he said. "Guys tell me the gig's over and I say, 'Hey,  we just got started.' " Simpkin's new solo LP, "Calamba" (Discovery), is due  out soon.  </P> <P> COOL CRUISE: The New American Orchestra, the locally based, symphonic jazz  orchestra, is sponsoring "Rhapsody on Wheels," a fund-raising bike ride along  the bike paths and beaches of Marina del Rey on May 7, beginning at 10 a.m. For  a $21 entry fee, riders receive a T-shirt, an LP, a concert at the end of the  ride and a chance to compete in a contest by identifying musical numbers,  played by New American Orchestra members at points along the 14-mile course.  Information: (213) 374-8990.  </P> <P> ***1/2 Bongo-Logic's "Cha-Cha-Charanga" (Rocky Peak) is the recording debut of  the local salsa/Latin-jazz band. Led by percussionist Brett Gollin and  featuring flutist Art Webb, violinist Harry Scorzo and pianist John Enrico  Douglas, the group goes with the spritely "Juguetes," the haunting "Didi's  Danzon" and a roaring version of Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps to Heaven. . . .  "In a Jazz Tradition" (EmArcy) finds guitarist Eric Gale heading up a combo --  which includes bassist Ron Carter and saxman Houston Person -- where "jazz  tradition" means "the blues." Gale -- who leans more toward the sparse, telling  phrasing of a B. B. King than the hard-swinging quality of a Wes Montgomery --  injects blues feeling into everything from "Eric's Gale," a medium cooker, to  Duke Jordan's classic "Jordu" and Tadd Dameron's "If You Could See Me Now."  </P> <P> Recordings are graded on a five-star system. Five stars (*****) means all but  indispensable for your jazz library, one star (*) means forget it.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE DAILEY GOES, TROUBLE WILL FOLLOW  </P> <P> Re: "Quintin Dailey Gets Another Chance," by Scott Howard-Cooper (Feb. 6):  </P> <P> I watched a great Loyola Marymount team recently embarrass the University of  San Francisco.  </P> <P> Not too long ago, before they discontinued their basketball program, partly due  to the Quintin Dailey affair, USF had one of the proudest traditions on the  West Coast -- if not the country. USF is still trying to dig out from under the  Dailey scandal. Dailey's stint with the Lakers was also an embarrassment to him  and the Lakers.  </P> <P> Quintin Dailey is a survivor, all right, but what he has left behind is nothing  to be proud of.  </P> <P> JOHN MALLOY (USF '65), Los Angeles  </P></p>

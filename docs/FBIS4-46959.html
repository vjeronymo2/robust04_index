			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Andreyev: "The Gordian Knot of the </F> Legendary Sudzhinbay"]    [Text]  <H5>  Origins </H5>   Three territorially isolated groups of clans (zhuz) have  been  clearly identified in the structure of the "country of the  Kazakhs" (and they are partly still noticeable at present): the  Senior Zhuz (southern Kazakhstan), the Middle Zhuz (the steppe  central rayons), and the Junior Zhuz (the west of the republic).    The history of the emergence of the Russian cities in  northern Kazakhstan shows that this territory cannot be called  Slavic in its origins. At the same time, the advocates of  Russia's historical possession of northern Kazakhstan have their  own arguments. After falling under the influence of Moscow  almost a century earlier than its southern oblasts, this region  was actively settled by Russian colonists, primarily Cossacks.  But the Kazakh clans bordering with Siberia and the Ural rayons,  experiencing a continuous threat on the part of the Dzungarian  Khanate, saw joining Russia as more of an advantageous  diplomatic step than "a natural desire..."    The dissatisfaction with the situation, developing among  Slavs of northern Kazakhstan, however, is also easily explained.  Many of them have been living on this land for more than one  generation, and they see it as a small part of Russia. Finding  themselves abroad in no time at all, it is difficult for them to  grasp the argument that several centuries ago the only masters  here were nomadic clans--the ancestors of the present-day  Kazakhs. But, it is necessary to understand the latter as well:  As a result of various kinds of migratory movements and numerous  "resettlements," the number of aborigines (indigenous people)  does not exceed 40 percent. But now, after the collapse of the  USSR, the Kazakhs, perhaps for the first time, have felt  themselves to be the masters of this very large former Soviet  republic that is second in size after Russia, and they are  striving to change the ethnic proportions that are unfavorable  for themselves. However, as before, the rates of the natural  growth of the native population remain very low, and the  "invitations" to countrymen from Mongolia, Iran, and even China  to return to the aboriginal homeland is also not changing the  situation. Therefore, one hears the popular slogan on the  streets of Kazakh cities more and more frequently: "If we cannot  be increased, then you must be decreased."    However, in the opinion of one of the Western correspondents  in Almaty, "...the local Russians are subordinating themselves  to the new 'Tatar yoke' with stunning readiness." This  observation was made, it is true, in the autumn of 1993, and it  characterized a "special period" in the development of  Kazakhstan--a "sovereignty euphoria" and a hope for maximum  "nationalization" as a panacea for all problems.  <H5>  `Boomerang' </H5>   In a word, only yesterday considering themselves "vassals of  Moscow," the Kazakhs in one way or another are trying today to  "cure" their old national complexes. For, to be a Kazakh is not  just to have slanting eyes and to speak in one of the Turkic  languages. Belonging to the people also denotes "participation"  in thousands of family ties--family and clan that, as before,  play an essential role, enveloping all of society with invisible  threads.    The Kazakhs succeeded over many years in establishing a  structure in which belonging to a specific social group right at  the moment of birth apparently determined the course of future  life. Dozens of concepts were "established" in the language and  expressions about mutual relations in the family and the place  of each in its hierarchy. But, inasmuch as a "taboo" against  marriages with members of other nations is observed more and  more of late, the fact becomes apparent of the creation--little  by little and not hurriedly--of a new, big, and closed clan that  is functioning on the level of an ethnic group.    Not everyone today can even get into a university. And marks  here do not have any real significance. It is important to be  "wellborn." One of the main points on a job application  questionnaire is something akin to the "fifth item." The  employer, as a rule, does not read beyond this item of the  submitted questionnaire--education or the possession of specific  professional skills are secondary "details."    ...Without blinking an eye, Tulenbek, a Kazakh lad with whom  I became acquainted, replied to the question of why he was  studying history, which he "does not like," that he was "not in  a position to enroll" in the prestigious juridical department.  But, he would soon certainly transfer there, for "the family  promised to help."    Knowledge of laws in significant measure was an opportunity  for him, after defending his diploma and arranging a "cushy  job," to return the money "invested in it" as quickly as  possible. Including also not without the help...of bribes. And  there is nothing surprising in this: "They take" everything.  Which, however, goes without saying, and it not only does not  evoke censure, but even the opposite--understanding and respect.  "Passing through" all of the "vital chains," bribes create their  own kind of second, unofficial monetary turnover.  <H5>  Exodus </H5>   Society was divided distinctly into two groups--"ours" and  "not ours," the antagonism between which was so strong that the  elements of communal life were practically obliterated. And,  although the "Concept of the Sociocultural Development of the  Republic of Kazakhstan" was published on 1 December 1993, which  not only noted "the unquestionable priority of Kazakh culture,"  but which also declared a ban on "oppressing citizens on the  basis of language and the guarantee of a broad space of language  goodwill"; nevertheless, both the Kazakhs and the Russians are  now two closed ethnic groups. In addition, they are mutually  accusing each other: The Kazakhs are accusing the Russians of  enslavement and the destruction of their eastern culture, and of  the forced inculcation of pseudo- Europeanization; the Russians  are accusing the Kazakhs of wildness and an unrestrained  character.    In a word, until now living in peace and harmony, neighbors  suddenly started "to quarrel with each other." And not only  through the "fault" of history; propaganda also plays a large  role. Although no one would probably even pay any particular  attention to it, if everyone lived more or less tolerably.    That is why in certain cases the demonstrative behavior of  representatives of Russian communities is the result not only of  "quiet" discrimination against them on the part of local  authorities, but also of the sharp worsening in the standard of  living. Especially after the unified "new ruble zone" departed  this life in October 1993, and, starting on 15 November, the  Kazakh national monetary unit--the tenge--was introduced.    But, it is not only economic necessity that compels Russians  to leave Kazakhstan (annually, about 100,000 leave just from  Almaty alone), or, let us say, Germans (300,000 persons out of  700,000 officially living in Kazakhstan did this in 1993 alone).  The reasons are far more important. For example, Konstantin  Erlikh, chairman of the republican society "German Revival"  (Deutsche Wiedergeburt), also explains the "great exit" with the  "country's Kazakh fixation," which does not promise national  minorities a political future.    With the adoption of the constitution of 28 January 1992,  Kazakh was officially declared the state language. Everyone who  would like to remain in the civil service must now speak Kazakh,  but there are very few such people among the local Russians and  Germans. And, as a consequence: In a short time, the number of  representatives of ethnic minorities was reduced noticeably in  the management structures and staff of the ministries. For,  according to the words of a former civil servant from Pavlodar,  Petr Kranzbueller, a German by nationality, not having  influential people "of your own kind" at the top, it is  unbelievably difficult to fight with all-powerful officials in a  corrupt swamp (we recall Tulenbek) in which God forbid that you  should utter a "foreign" word.    Moreover, up until the end of 1995, every "non-Kazakh" will  have to declare whether he wants to become a Kazakh citizen or  not. The one who makes a positive decision to acquire a Kazakh  passport should take into account that it will then be far more  difficult to leave the country. The one who makes a negative  decision will become a person without citizenship in Kazakhstan.  Germany, it is true, annually authorizes entry for a maximum of  230,000 persons of German origin from the former USSR (including  from Kazakhstan). But, simultaneously, Bonn is trying in some  way to hold back the continuously mounting wave of immigration,  in particular, by also rendering economic assistance to  Kazakhstan. Most of all for the development of an infrastructure  of rayons that are densely populated by Germans. Since 1990,  about 80 million German Marks have already gone there.  <H5>  Hope </H5>   At the same time, national minorities continue to rely on  President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who in one of his interviews  told the press on 4 January 1994 that the departure of every  person is an economic loss for the republic, assuring that  "...we do not want to divide our people into ours and theirs.  Kazakhstan is our common motherland, and it will see to it that  no one is harmed." Such statements are understandable: The  republic will hardly be able to do without the Russians and the  Germans. Thus, according to data from American sources, the  outflow of just the Russians from Kazakhstan will denote an  annual loss on the order of $24 billion during the next  seven-eight years, which inevitably will lead to the actual  bankruptcy of the republic. The departure of "only" 45,000  Russians in 1992 was a serious loss for it. Especially if the  fact is taken into account that a large part of the Russians  belong to the intelligentsia. But, to develop a new  professionally trained generation of specialists from the native  inhabitants cannot be accomplished in a day. Almaty also needs  the Germans--industrious craftsmen, disciplined workers, and  hard-working peasants.    However, the matter has not gone any further than official  declarations until now. The assistance being allocated "is  disappearing" somewhere in the depths of the local bureaucratic  apparatus. In December of last year, Kristian Keller, a  professor at Berlin's Humboldt University, told me that the  Goethe Institute has not been opened in Almaty to this day,  although the money for it was allocated a long time ago by the  German side.    ...The election on 7 March of this year of a new Kazakh  parliament, to all appearances, will also not introduce any  clarity to the question of national minorities. Since most  likely all of it will be loyal to the president (in the course  of the election campaign, 20 percent of its staff was actually  proposed according to "his" list, which roused the censure, in  particular, of the observers of the CSCE parliamentary assembly)  then, obviously, it will not be able to adopt the law on dual  citizenship for the Russians, because Nazarbayev himself is  against this idea. His words: More than 120 nationalities live  in the republic, and the priority of just the Russian minority  alone means an "infringement of the rights of the others." As  for the elections themselves, their standard, in the opinion of  the president, corresponded to the "standard of Kazakh  democracy, which has still not reached the European standard.  And, therefore, we have to be satisfied with what there is..."  <H5>  Economic Activity </H5>   Apparently, the Kazakh economy is also guided by the very  same "principle." For it stood on losing positions already at  the time that Stalin created a Union "raw materials appendage"  out of the republic. All of the minerals mined from the rich  deposits here went to Russia and to the other republics.  However, this had no significance in the united, "great state."    It is another matter now. It has been calculated that 94  percent of the commodities being produced in Kazakhstan are  connected with "Russian middlemen" up to the present time. But  this "foreign" state is already demanding hard currency for its  services, and not the ephemeral tenge, but it is exactly the  former that there is none of in Almaty. However, it also does  not have its own exits to the sea. And, this means that  expensive ground transport makes the export of Kazakhstan raw  material practically unprofitable.    In a word, it quickly became clear that one of the main  symbols of Kazakh independence--the tenge--is only a beautiful  piece of paper. But "capitalism" is developing in its most wild  form, in essence being a more modern form of yesterday's  speculation. Now proudly calling themselves businessmen,  speculators are driving in splendid cars that are in such  contrast to their "possessions"--shabby kiosks and booths filled  with Western "delicacies" (mainly alcohol and sweets) with  obviously fake firm trademarks.  <H5>  `Snickerization' </H5>   And this, however paradoxical it may seem, is yet another  one  of the characteristic features of today's Kazakh market. In  Almaty, for example, it is the practice to "translate" wages  into "candy bars" that are very popular here: The professor of a  higher educational institution, in particular, "earns" the  equivalent of 25, and a chambermaid, the equivalent of 11  "chocolate sticks..."    And, nevertheless, every newcomer here is surprised by the  practically ubiquitous opinion that "all the same, everything  will be better," and that "these are only the difficulties of  the transition period." Although there also are the pessimists  who maintain that the tenge--the basis of the stability of the  state-- will already fall this year. That all of Nazarbayev's  attempts to "create" a Eurasian community are doomed to failure.  And that, in the final analysis, the Kazakhs on their knees will  ask Moscow (an example of which is seen in Belarus and  Tajikistan) for a "new reunification with it." The optimists, of  course, give a longer period.    Meanwhile, the deep stratification of society, galloping  inflation, scarcity in the market, and, finally, the ethnic  tension, however, give one and the other more reason to think  that the question raised recently in the headline of the popular  Almaty weekly KARAVAN--"Will We Last Until Monday?"--is becoming  less and less rhetorical. Although, perhaps, the Kazakh Gordian  knot problem can be solved by the legendary Sudzhinbay, who is  depicted on the 3-tenge bill, and, in the opinion of informed  experts, is a direct ancestor of today's Kazakh leader. Who  knows?</p>

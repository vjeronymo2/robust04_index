			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 31 (TANJUG) -- A nonaligned ministerial  conference will open in Cairo on Tuesday and for the first time  since the foundation of the [Nonaligned] Movement [NAM] it will  not be attended by officials from Yugoslavia, one of its  founders and the host of its first summit. This is the result  of an arbitrary behaviour of the host of the conference, Egypt,  whose Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had decided "not to allow  Serbia" to participate in the meeting for two reasons: because  he does not recognize the right of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia to succession and because of what he described as  "Belgrade's involvement in Bosnia and Croatia."    Instead of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Egypt invited  to the conference Moslem officials from the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as those from Croatia  and Slovenia. Officials from Greece, Bulgaria and many  countries of the former Soviet Union and some West European  countries will be present as guests or observers. The agenda of  the conference, to be opened by Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak, will include the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  conflicts in Rwanda, Cambodia and Yemen, the Movement's future  in the light of the new world order and economic problems of the  member-countries.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Case not made about need for urgent action on CO emissions Sir, Preposterous is the only word for the column by Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's environment commissioner (Personal View: 'Why Rio must deliver', May 26). Far from being 'intransigent' the Bush administration went much too far  - in the view of many here - in seeking compromise with environmental extremists. The EC 'green chief' has not made the case that the welfare and survival of the planet requires urgent action to constrain CO emissions according to the diktat of an international plan. The consensus among coolheads is that a catastrophic global warming from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, while remotely possible, is highly unlikely. The models of future climate do not yet explain the actual climatic record of the past century properly, so their predictions of a future 3 deg C increase in global temperatures over the next century need to be taken with a large dose of salt. Clouds and other feed-back mechanisms may be offsetting much of the theoretically calculated warming effect of increasing greenhouse gases. Some of the warming this century - only about 0.5 deg C - may indeed be the result of an increase in the intensity of the sun, rather than of a greenhouse gas effect. Moreover, more CO and a warmer global climate might not be bad for the world, let alone a threat to 'the survival of the planet', to quote the EC commissioner's absurdly apocalyptic language. Plant growth would be enhanced by both. Rainfall would be increased. Of course there would be problems in coping with change, but according to a US National Academy of Sciences panel on global warming the world can successfully adapt to prospective climate change. By contrast, the heavy controls di Meana proposes on CO emissions would put immediate arbitrary ceilings on electricity generation, heavy industry and myriad other fossil fuel based activities. The costs of goods and services foregone in the effort to stave off global warming would almost certainly outweigh the possible distant costs of adapting to somewhat higher temperatures worldwide - if they eventuate, which is uncertain. Even before the climate change treaty is signed at Rio, the European commissioner is demanding new pressure on the US. His are the words of a silly zealot demanding mindless actions. We need more science, less zeal. Peter Samuel, editor, Greentrack News Service, Washington DC, US</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN STOCKS POST 8TH-BIGGEST GAIN  </P> <P> Stocks in Japan scored their eighth-biggest gain ever today as Japanese  investors returned from a long weekend to find that oil prices had dropped and  the yen had strengthened.  </P> <P> The Tokyo stock market's key 225-share Nikkei average surged 1,041.87 points,  or 4.54%, to 23,973.67.  </P> <P> The market was closed Monday for Emperor Akihito's enthronement.  </P> <P> The surge helped support advances elsewhere, with most major Asian stock  markets rising.  </P> <P> Tokyo's strength lasted through the day even though the yen fell a bit against  the dollar after advancing in New York on Monday on speculation that the  Federal Reserve would loosen interest rates after meeting today.  </P> <P> The dollar closed at 128.77 yen and 1.4755 marks after Monday's New York close  of 128.55 and 1.4765. Its rise against the yen today was on speculative buying,  dealers said.  </P></p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Constantia net profits rise 20% to Sch120m Constantia Industrieholding, the diversified Austrian packaging and board group, said net profits jumped 20 per cent in the first half to Sch120m (Dollars 11m), and forecast a similar rise in the full year. Turnover of the family-controlled group was up 8.3 per cent to Sch6.5bn. Constantia said its Iso division, covering building, sports and security systems, developed well in the first half. The packaging division enjoyed a pick-up in orders, although raw materials became more expensive in the second quarter. Constantia plans to unbundle into two groups in 1995 to improve transparency. For every three Constantia shares, investors will receive two shares in the Iso group and one in the packaging group.</p>

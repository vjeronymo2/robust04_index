			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Christie's houses bid for Bosnian peace INTERNATIONAL auction house Christie's yesterday became the backdrop for the latest efforts to negotiate peace for the embattled republic of Bosnia as talks shifted to London. Putting the press in the picture last night, Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia and also chairman of Christies International, did not hide the problems negotiators faced. 'I think the best thing that has happened today is that all three sides turned up. I don't think that would have happened 10 days ago,' he said. Moslem, Serbian and Croatian representatives met separately with Lord Carrington after he conceded it was unlikely all three factions could be brought to the same negotiating table.

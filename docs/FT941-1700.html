			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Watchdog urged to probe education adverts spending The government's spending watchdog is to be asked to investigate allegations that the Department for Education has 'misused' public funds in advertising its policies. Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the Commons' Public Accounts Committee, said he would ask the National Audit Office to investigate spending on publicity at the department following a complaint from Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary. Mrs Taylor has written to Mr Sheldon claiming that the department's annual expenditure on advertising had risen 8,000 per cent since the Conservatives came to power - from Pounds 103,800 in 1979-80 to Pounds 8.9m in 1991-92. 'Without exception, parents complain of money being wasted which could usefully be spent on schools,' Mrs Taylor said. A submission to the NAO is usually the first step in a parliamentary investigation of how public money is spent. If the watchdog agrees to produce an official report, the committee can investigate the matter, cross-examining ministers and officials. The Liberal Democrats yesterday joined the attack, arguing that officials at the department had broken their own code of practice in their recent advertising campaign for the promotion of grant maintained schools. Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, accused the department of issuing 'biased advertisements' which implied that only governors and head teachers of grant maintained schools had the power to make decisions on their own expenditure - and that local education authority school governors had no financial control. 'The adverts are a clear breach of practice in that the information is presented in such a way as to be hugely misleading,' said Mr Foster. 'Ministers have been contradicting each other in an attempt to defend them.' Mr Foster's complaint is being submitted to the parliamentary ombudsman.</p>

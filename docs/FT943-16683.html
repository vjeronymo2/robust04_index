			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Books: Blood ties that bind SHOT IN THE HEART: ONE FAMILY'S HISTORY IN MURDER by Mikal Gilmore Viking Pounds 16, 403 pages A FATHER'S STORY by Lionel Dahmer Little, Brown Pounds 15.99, 255 pages One day in late July 1976, Mikal Gilmore, a young music journalist, came across a headline in a newspaper: 'Gary Mark Gilmore, 35, was charged with the murders of two young clerks during the holdup of a service station and motel . . .' He read on dazed and confused, about how both of the two dead men were Mormons, about the same age as himself, both with a wife and children. He read all about the crimes of Gary Gilmore, his brother, and realised that he had become, suddenly, yet ineluctably, 'the brother of a man who murdered innocent men.' One day in late July 1991, Lionel Dahmer, a middle-aged Milwaukee chemist, turned on the eleven o'clock news and saw his son's face fill the screen. Jeffrey Dahmer was under arrest as a serial killer. Switching from channel to channel, he saw the same face flash before him, accompanied by reports of Jeffrey Dahmer's grisly crimes. He turned to his wife and said, 'Maybe some day this will all be over.' 'This,' she replied, 'will never be over.' He sensed that she was right: 'We were no longer merely parents,' he reflected, 'and we never would be again. We were the parents, and I, in particular, was the father of Jeffrey Dahmer.' Gary Gilmore and Jeffrey Dahmer became well-known for their inhumanity. Gilmore, cold, unrepentant and arrogantly resolute, became the most famous killer in America when, after being sentenced to death, he waived all rights of appeal and insisted that his execution be carried out. His case became an international news event, and he went to the firing squad with Norman Mailer signed up to write his story and the movie rights sold. Dahmer, withdrawn and aloof, sat impassively in court as his shocking crimes were discussed in excruciating detail: at least 17 murders; cannibalism; human body parts stored in the refrigerator; male genitalia kept preserved in formaldehyde; and a full human skeleton hanging in the wardrobe. From the start of his trial until the moment, several weeks later, when he was sentenced to 957 years in prison, he was never out of the news. Murder, as WH Auden said, is 'a negative creation.' Its impact is profound, forcing attention not merely on the killer and the victim but also on those they knew and lived with. Neither Mikal Gilmore nor Lionel Dahmer wanted - or expected - to be famous, yet both of them, because of the actions of others, blood relations, found themselves, their lives and their families changed almost beyond comprehension. Gilmore's remarkable, sensitively written Shot in the Heart, and Dahmer's less illuminating yet painfully compelling A Father's Story, tell the story of the intimate onlooker, the public story that neither man can escape from in private. The initial news of their unwitting involvement in a terrible event elicited a similar reaction from both men. Dahmer, a quiet man who prided himself on his calm, orderly, 'rational' life, felt disorientated and a growing sense of panic, alarmed that his son 'was taking me down with him, dragging me into the utter chaos that he had made of his life, and doing it publicly.' Gilmore felt a mixture of grief, anger and humiliation, suddenly 'stuck inside' his brother's notoriety. 'Our lives had overnight exploded in a way that we could never have imagined,' Gilmore recalls, 'and for a long nightmare season, our history, our sins, and our shame became part of a pageant that was headed inexorably toward a public death.' After the shock came the search for an explanation. Dahmer the scientist finds it difficult to avoid blaming genes, as though there is guilt in the simple fact of the bloodline itself. He remembers the first time he set eyes on his newly-born son ('I stared at him, astonished at how much he looked like me'), and half-forgotten childhood mischief, which once seemed so innocent, now assumes a sinister significance. Gilmore prefers a more speculative approach, exploring the ghosts and myths in his family's history, searching through the house 'where murder is born' in the hope of uncovering 'a key to unlock its secrets,' an event 'that might explain what produced so much loss and violence.' It is a painful, and seemingly endless, process of self-analysis, conjecture and confession for both men. Gilmore admits that part of his fear is the thought that he will never know the truth, while part is that he will find out more truth than he can possibly live with. Dahmer confesses that he remains 'in the grip of a great unknowing', both in terms of his son and of his 'effect upon him as a father, by omissions and commissions.' Although both men do their best to mourn the actual victims of the murders, and to come to terms with the murderer they once knew and loved, the thing that they both mourn most poignantly is the future that they are now unable to live.</p>

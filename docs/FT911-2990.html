			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): A spur from the chancellor - Personal Equity Plans / Access to EC markets will be helpful, but charges may still deter - Investment trusts THE INVESTMENT-trust sector did quite well out of the changes in Personal Equity Plans announced in the Budget. The chancellor agreed with one of the main proposals submitted by the Association of Investment Trust Companies - that Pep investments should no longer be confined primarily to the London market but extended to include the whole of the European Community. This change, which takes effect in the autumn, should make Peps less risky. One criticism has been that they are too dependent on the UK market. The freedom to enter a range of markets should help investment trusts in particular. They tend to be less concentrated than unit trusts, preferring to spread investments over a wider area. Many general investment trusts, which were unwilling to change their strategy just to please Pep investors, will now qualify under the Pep regulations. Michael Hart, chairman of the AITC, for example, said his company, Foreign &amp; Colonial, would now be able to offer Pep investment trusts. Several other companies will be able to broaden the range of trusts available to Pep investors. Mr Hart said the AITC had long been lobbying the government to include EC exchanges in the Pep scheme. The chancellor made another concession that will mainly benefit investment trusts, rather than unit trusts: the decision to raise from Pounds 900 to Pounds 1,500 the amount that can be put into a 'non-qualifying' trust - that is, a fund that fails to comply with the rule that at least 50 per cent of its investments should be in the UK (EC from the autumn) market. This is good news for investment-trust companies, which are prepared to deal in fairly modest amounts at low charges, unlike the unit-trust groups which don't want to bother with such small sums. On the other hand, the chancellor closed a small loophole, available to investment-trust Peps exclusively: the freedom to use their status as a quoted company to make unlimited rights issues, thereby increasing the amount that could be invested well over the permitted maximum. But he left open the other, more widely used, loophole, again confined to investment trusts as quoted shares, of launching new issues, where the investor can subscribe Pounds 6,000 instead of being restricted to the normal Pounds 3,000 maximum investment for investment and unit trusts. However, there was disappointment that he ignored pleas from both investment- and unit-trust companies that investors be allowed to put all their Pep money into a collective investment fund, rather than just Pounds 3,000. In fact, a step has been taken in the opposite direction with the plan to allow a further Pounds 3,000 to be invested in a single-company Pep. This means that investors using the full Pounds 9,000 allowance will be able to put only one third into a collective investment fund - the safest vehicle  -while being encouraged to take the gamble of putting a similar amount into only one company. A professional adviser who recommended a similar strategy would quite rightly be rebuked by the regulatory authorities for failing to give 'best advice'. Mr Hart said that investment trusts seemed to be beating their heads against a brick wall, with the politicians arguing that the purpose of Peps was to encourage investment in industry, not in funds. Nevertheless, Peps are still seen as a good opportunity for investment trusts to attract new business, with the tax concessions as the lure. David Smith, of Flemings, welcomed all moves to widen share ownership. Robin Berrill, of Hendersons, said an 'enormous new marketplace' had opened up. Unfortunately, unit trusts have so far grabbed the lion's share of the Pep market. This is partly because the restrictions on Pep investments has made them unsuitable for most of the big general investment trusts, which like to spread their portfolios worldwide, and have therefore been unable or unwilling to become qualifying funds. The inclusion of the EC exchanges will lessen that problem. At the same time, while investment-trust charges may be lower than those of unit trusts, running a Pep does involve extra costs. This means that an investment trust's Pep is slightly more expensive than its regular savings scheme, which is undoubtedly the cheapest way to get into the stock market. So anyone considering investment trusts may well prefer to forget the Pep tax concessions and go for a savings scheme instead. Unit trusts adopt a different strategy, relying on marketing and promotion, paid for out of their existing higher charges, to achieve the volume of sales needed, so that they can sell Peps with no additional charges, absorbing the higher costs involved. Because of the restrictions on advertising shares, investment trusts have been unable to promote themselves in the same way as unit trusts, and this has affected their efforts to sell Peps. So has the fact that most do not pay commission to independent intermediaries, who are therefore reluctant to recommend their products. However, things are changing. The restrictions on advertising may soon be lifted, and several investment-trust groups are now paying commission. At the same time, intermediaries charging fees are increasingly recommending Pep investment trusts, which have special advantages. For example, the split-level trusts can offer Peps that provide a high income which makes the most of the tax-free dividends. With lower charges, and funds well suited to the small investor seeking a safe haven in the stock market, investment trusts should be in a powerful position to sell Peps strongly. The problem is in getting the message across.</p>

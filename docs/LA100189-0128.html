			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STIRLING STIRS ANGER  </P> <P> State Sen. Larry Stirling's antagonism toward Walter Zelman, state director of  Common Cause, is really not warranted. In the past decade, Dr. Zelman has  emerged as something of a treasure for the people of California. His  intelligence and drive, ability to communicate and fidelity to fair and honest  politics are a matter of public record. I think we all would be quite lucky if  Walter Zelman held a statewide public office.  </P> <P> Sen. Stirling's intemperate remarks were, in the end, a poor reflection on  himself alone, and only for that perhaps worth remembering.  </P> <P> GREG MOVSESYAN  </P> <P> Leucadia  </P></p>

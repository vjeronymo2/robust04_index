			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISLAND COOKING: THE FANTASY &amp; THE REALITY;  </P> <P> THE CULT OF THE TROPICS USED TO BE RUM DRINKS AND PUPU PLATERS; NOW IT'S  BROILED LOBSTER WITH FRIED LEEKS.  </P> <P> For generations, Americans have sighed for tropics, where all you ever have to  do (so goes the story) is reach up from your hammock once in a while and grab a  papaya.  </P> <P> Basically, the cult of the tropics reeks of the fantasies of people in cold  climates: easy manners, outdoor living, no snow to shovel. In a way it's just a  sweatier version of the usual Snow Belters' fantasy of California. It seems  strange that it ever had a hold on Californians themselves, but it certainly  did. Maybe it goes back to the Twenties, when Margaret Meade was advertising  Polynesia as a sexual paradise and everybody was playing the ukulele and  learning a dance called the hula-hula.  </P> <P> In the '40s and '50s the cult of the tropics spawned a thing called Polynesian  Cuisine, which was by nature sweet, alcoholic and served aflame: a mixture of  Cantonese appetizers, vaguely Indonesian entrees involving pineapple and  coconut, and savage rum drinks with names like Missionary's Downfall. The  cuisine has fallen into disrepute now, along with the idea of serving drinks  with little paper parasols in them, but for years Trader Vic's, Don the  Beachcomber's and their imitations were considered exceptionally classy places  to dine.  </P> <P> These days, the Tropics seem to have returned as a restaurant motif. Air travel  has made people a little too sophisticated for the old Polynesian Cuisine so  the new version stresses "light fresh flavors," but this is still not quite the  real story either.  </P> <P> In reality, the people of the Tropics tend to eat starchy food, both because of  their poverty and because of the hard work they do. It's not dull food, but  also not at all what you'd call light. There is some truth to the vision of  tropical cuisine full of exotic fruits and spices: In the Caribbean they often  use curry spices. On the other hand, Polynesia knew of no spices at all before  the 18th Century and is still cautious about using them. And as for fruits,  Polynesia never saw the pineapple, mango or papaya until the 19th Century.  </P> <P> Alas for the pupu platter, the flaming rum drinks and the vision of a little  grass shack. Today we know the reality of tropical cuisine. Fortunately, it's  more interesting than the fiction.  </P> <P> THE RECIPES: H10 CHARLES PERRY  </P></p>

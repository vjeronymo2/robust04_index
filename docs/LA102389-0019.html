			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV AND SOVIET REFORMS  </P> <P> In response to "A Step for World Safety, If East Bloc Is Serious," by Ernest  Conine, Op-Ed Page, Oct. 17:  </P> <P> Conine goes into all kinds of reasons that the Russians want to join with the  United States to fight international terrorism, something at which they have no  peer. However, "In view of the nationalist fervor now sweeping the Soviet Union  . . . " describes the true -- and sole -- reason for their sudden change of  heart towards terrorism.  </P> <P> The Russians will simply tag the term "terrorist" to describe nationalist  freedom fighters who want to free their once-independent countries from the  Russian stranglehold. Will the U.S. participate in helping the Russians put  down a fight for the independence these people have waited and fought for so  long? Will everyone who ever wanted to regain self-determination be  automatically labeled a "terrorist?"  </P> <P> I am certain that few freedom-striving people would want to spill their own  (and other people's) blood in the quest for independence, but they will if they  have to. Nothing comes easy, especially your freedom. Where will the U.S. stand  on this issue?  </P> <P> NORMAN MacPHERSON  </P> <P> Palos Verdes  </P></p>

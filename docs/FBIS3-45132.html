Motorola's high-capacity electronic mobile switching system  has been working well since Shanghai Posts and  Telecommunications Administration began trial operations last  month.    Shanghai is the first city in China to introduce such a  sophisticated mobile phone system. Beijing officials also  signed an agreement last year with Motorola to buy the system,  called EMX 2500.    Motorola, an American company has sold the cutting-edge  system to many countries.    More than 120 Chinese cities currently use cellular phone  switch systems made by Motorola.    The introduction of the larger-capacity system to Shanghai  will triple the possible number of mobile phone users in the  city.    Pertti Johanson, Vice President and General Manager of  Motorola's International Cellular Infrastructure Division, said  that the software of the EMX 2500 in operation in Shanghai has  been modified to better meet the requirements of China's  telecommunications networks.    He added the introduction of the large-capacity switch  system  in Shanghai will not only enhance call processing speed, but  also lay a solid foundation for the network and capacity to  expand.    According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,  China had about 638,000 mobile phone subscribers at the end of  last year, with many applicants waiting for phones.    The ministry plans to increase the total number of mobile  phone users to between 900,000 and 1 million by the end of this  year.    In another development, Motorola China Inc has decided to  invest nearly $200 million this year in the Tianjin Economic and  Technological Development Area (TEDA).    See Peng Hong, chief representative of Motorola China Inc,  said in Tianjin that he had full confidence in the areas  investment environment and China's economic reforms.    The company has now set up two factories in the Tianjin area  since March 1992. The first factory assembles pagers, making  about 40 percent of Motorola's digital radio pagers on the  Chinese market.</p>

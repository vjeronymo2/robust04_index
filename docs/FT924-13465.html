			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (14): The stakes are high - Private networks AS REGULATORY barriers in the international telecommunications marketplace are pushed aside, the pace of change in the provision of private network systems and services is increasing at an unprecedented rate. New strategic partnerships are being struck; new technologies developed; new signalling protocols and standards agreed; new products introduced; new operators licensed; new pricing structures published. The stakes are high and the revenue potential significant. The market research organisation, Frost &amp; Sullivan, estimates that the combined European telecom equipment and services market will be worth Dollars 200bn by 1996. The 25-extension plus private telephone switch market is on course to ship 6.6m extensions a year by 1995 to realise annual sales of Dollars 2.4bn, thereby consolidating its position as one of Europe's largest telecom equipment sectors with an installed based of just over 40m extensions. By 1996, Germany will have Europe's largest telecom equipment market (Dollars 11.69bn), and the UK the largest services market (Dollars 30.24bn). The pan-European value-added services sector is forecast to grow to Dollars 9.45bn by 1996. It is no longer simply a question of corporate customers deciding how many private circuits to install or even who should be the preferred supplier. The advent of digital technology and the new rules of competition has opened up a whole panoply of network, system, service and supplier options. Today, customers can cherry-pick the elements and vendors that will enable them to build and operate a fully-integrated, resilient network at an acceptable cost. The corporate network of the future will be flexible, adaptable and upgradeable, able to respond easily - and with minimum disruption - to changing business circumstances. It will make full use of private point-to-point links for high volume, high quality, non-stop and time and content-sensitive transmissions; and of dial-up bandwidth on demand services to support ad hoc, peak overloads, remote diagnostic, disaster recovery and private circuit backup transmissions. It will support integrated computing and telephony as well as the new applications such as video-conferencing, high-speed fax, Cad/Cam transmissions, voice and message mail, with Lans (local area networks), Wans (wide area networks) and Mans (metropolitan area networks) interlinked to form a seamless network capable of supporting office-based, home-based, remote and mobile users, both nationally and globally. Highlighting the trend towards resilient, distributed networks that can support high volume voice and data applications, information providers Dun &amp; Bradstreet have signed a Pounds 550,000 contract with Ericsson for the installation of an MD110 ISPDX digital network at its European head office. The system will be integrated with the company's existing global IDNX network and will be the first in the UK to incorporate Ericsson's Team voicemail processing system. Integrating networks is no easy task, says Charles McGregor of Fibernet, a UK company that designs, supplies and installs intelligent connectivity products for complex fibre networks within organisations that face demanding requirements in voice, data and video. The barriers are significant, not least because Lans are optimised for data transmission and peripheral sharing while Wans are designed primarily for telephony. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and Sonet (Synchronous Optical Network) are just two developments considered to be a large advantage in this respect. ATM combines the best features of multiplexing and cell switching to create a universal transfer method that will accommodate Lan and non-Lan data, voice and video. Sonet is deemed to be important for future wideband applications such as high volume video-conferencing and Cad/Cam graphics transmissions. Implemented with fibre optics, it is expected to save operations costs in a number of ways including, for example, fewer amplifiers and connection devices, far fewer lines for switching equipment to handle, and options like adding or dropping bandwidth with no on-site technician needed. Frame relay is another important development to the Lan-Wan interconnect solution because it uses high-speed packet switching technology to handle data traffic which has high peaks and requires high volume throughput between a number of geographical dispersed sites, both nationally and internationally. The parcel transport company, United Carriers, is one of the first beneficiaries of this technology. It has signed a Pounds 240,000 contract with Gandalf Digital Communications for the supply of a future-proof frame relay network to link its head office system with 20 depots, enabling available bandwidth to be used more effectively for image-processing applications and to carry X25 data traffic over a single KiloStream link. Not all companies wish to install and maintain equipment on their premises. The trend towards virtual private network (VPNs) and managed data network (MDNs) services is also growing apace. As an example, Mercury Communications has won an Pounds 11m, seven-year deal to provide the Chase Manhattan Bank with a totally managed non-stop voice communications network via Digital Centrex (central exchange), a service that provides all the facilities of advanced PBXs without the need for capital investment. A five-year contract worth Pounds 15m has also been signed by TSB Retail Banking and Insurance whereby Mercury will take over the management of the bank's corporate voice and data network as well as the network that provides services between 40 TSB main offices, thereby enabling the management to concentrate more effort on core activities. BT is winning business for its Global Network Services (GNS), a portfolio of managed data networking services that provides large national and international customers with a worldwide end-to-end communications service with a single point of contact. The addition of frame relay makes it particularly suited to the major stores groups requiring synchronous and asynchronous communications capabilities needed for modern electronic point of sale systems but which do not have the resources to update their old multiplexers. The future potential for such services can be gauged by the September 1992 London opening of the very first international Global Virtual Private Network (GVPN) centre. The new centre will co-ordinate order processing, worldwide dialling, plan design, and implementation and management of customers' multinational virtual networks, with staffing and funding provided by the GVPN member-carriers. Intelligent networks (see page 6) will also provide the ability automatically to respond to a range of situations, such as changing communications paths and facilities in the event of a failure, and will be able to support the new generation of services such as the Personal Communications Network (PCN). However, as John Rance, executive general manager of Racal-Datacom, cautions, the problem is that most users are too concerned with running their businesses to keep up with the hectic pace of networking development. 'What may be the most cost-efficient route one week can become an expensive liability the next,' he points out. Key indicators of the shifts and pressures in the marketplace are the introductions by BT of DualStreamplus, new Kilostream services and standard call charge reductions effective from November for multi-site corporate customers.</p>

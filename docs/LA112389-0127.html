			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: PACIFIC PALISADES;  </P> <P> HEIGHT LIMIT IMPOSED  </P> <P> At the urging of a neighborhood group, the Los Angeles City Council has voted  to restrict the height of new construction in a two-block-long stretch of  Adelaide Drive between Ocean Avenue and Entrada Drive.  </P> <P> "We're ecstatic," said Lauren Greene of the Adelaide Residents Assn., which  began pushing for the restriction three years ago after a property owner sought  to build a home that neighbors said disrupted their views of the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> In an area of historically significant homes, the street -- which separates the  Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles from Santa Monica -- is a favorite of  tourists and others for its views of the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> The new law outlaws construction above street level for property owners on the  sloping, Los Angeles side of Adelaide Drive, Greene said.  </P></p>

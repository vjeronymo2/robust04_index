			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Tory backbenchers protest government leasehold plans TORY backbenchers protested in the Commons yesterday that planned government legislation to give all leaseholders in England and Wales the right to buy the freehold of their property would penalise owners of houses in central London while enabling leaseholders to 'make a killing'. Mr William Benyon, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes, said it was a 'curious proposal' by Conservative ministers, while Mr Steve Norris, Conservative MP for Epping Forest, described it as 'an unConservative measure' involving the forced sale of assets. Mr Benyon said it would give 'an enormous immediate tax free capital gain' to leaseholders at the expense of the current freeholder. Questioning why residents in Eaton Square deserved so generous a 'windfall', Mr Benyon suggested that the dissolution of the monasteries provided the closest parallel to such an arbitrary transfer of property from one section of the population to another. Mr Norris, who declared his interest in Haven Services, a company which included sheltered accommodation among its 4,000 properties, urged the government to recognise that there were profound 'anti-libertarian' issues at stake.</p>

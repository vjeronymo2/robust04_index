			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: New cars boost Appleyard 'A healthier market', especially in new cars, helped Appleyard, the Yorkshire motor dealer, lift pre-tax profits 61 per cent in the first half. The rise from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds 4.2m was also underpinned by a sharp increase in the operating profits contribution to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 545,000) from a 50-50 joint venture with Barclays on the contract hire side. Group turnover rose 42 per cent to Pounds 251m (Pounds 177.2m), including Pounds 27m from acquisitions. Mr John Atkin, business development director, said that, excluding acquisitions, the group's sale of new vehicles was up 20 per cent, against a 14 per cent rise in the national market. The sale of used units grew 15 per cent to about 10,500. In the period, the group spent Pounds 18.3m on acquisitions, having raised Pounds 16.4m in a September 1993 rights issue. It now has 94 franchises - including five marques new to the group - on 62 sites. Earnings advanced to 4.5p (3.7p) per share and the interim dividend is 2.9p (2.6p).</p>

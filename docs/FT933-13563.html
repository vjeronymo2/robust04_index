			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Mould cracked but not yet broken - Liberal Democrats lose their majority for the first time since 1955 JAPAN is embarking on a period of political restructuring without precedent since the end of the second world war, when the merger of two pre-war parties gave birth to the Liberal Democratic party, which has ruled since 1955. The 1955 mould of post-war Japanese politics was not broken by yesterday's general election but it was cracked, possibly permanently. It is too early to say that the new conservative parties which were the main winners yesterday will provide the Japanese public with a new choice, as permanent alternatives to the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the socialist opposition. But the new parties - the Japan Renewal party, Japan New party and Harbinger party - did well enough to hold the balance of power in the next parliament, to press for political reforms and to lay the foundations for becoming an independent third force at subsequent elections. Their success reflects more than disaffection with the scandal-ridden LDP and disillusion with the impotence and ideologically hidebound nature of the older opposition parties. It stems from an appetite for change, which has not been entirely extinguished by the cynicism forced on voters by repeated political scandals. Younger, independent urban voters crave not just new party labels and leaders, but a more open style of politics, which deals in debate and ideas. Yet it is far from certain that is what they will get. Even though the LDP has lost its overall majority in the parliament's lower house, it delivered a telling display of electoral resilience. It maintained its strength in spite of its failure to introduce political reforms, the worst economic downturn for 20 years, a deeply unpopular prime minister, and rumbling scandals which are due to surface in court again this week. As Japan moves into a possibly extended period of coalition government, the LDP is likely to be the largest party and so the central building block for any coalition. The endless war within the party, between its factions for positions and patronage, will be complicated by jostling between the LDP and its potential coalition partners. The scope for Japanese politics being decided by shady deals in smoke-filled hotel rooms has probably grown as a result of this election, not diminished. Hopes that the election could set in train sweeping and lasting changes in the Japanese political system rest with two developments. First, the next government is almost certain to focus on political reforms. These are likely to include changes to the electoral system involving the introduction of proportional representation, designed to encourage more open debate about national policies and priorities. Political reform will throw the system into a protracted period of turmoil as parties adjust to the unfamiliar rules. This flux should be advantageous to the new conservatives who will enter the next election with more money and candidates. Second, much depends on the vision and determination of the new parties' leaders. They have established an impressive electoral beach-head, which will attract further supporters and donations from the business community. But to extend beyond that to become a viable alternative to the LDP will be long, hard work. The collapse of the socialists' support has probably robbed the Japan Renewal party of the hopes it had a month ago of leading an opposition coalition to dislodge the LDP. The LDP's resilience means the new conservatives can harbour few hopes of winning seats from the ruling party. They will grow quickest at the expense of their erstwhile partners, the ailing Social Democratic party. So this election could set the scene for an intensifying battle within the opposition, rather than between the opposition and the LDP. The balance of power within the opposition will have to shift, away from the left and towards the centre, before the LDP will face a credible challenge from an alternative coalition. Yet today the leaders of the new conservative parties will not be worrying over such distant doubts about their prospects. The LDP may not be turfed out of power; it will almost certainly have to share power for the first time for almost four decades. Flushed with their success the new conservatives know that in spite of the LDP's size, they will be setting the pace in Japanese politics.</p>

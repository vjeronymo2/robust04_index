			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: CSA adopts a new flight plan - The Czech airline is seeking a domestic partner Czechoslovak Airlines, the Czech Republic's loss-making national airline, is hoping an injection of government money and a new approach to future partnerships will help it ride out the most turbulent period in its 71-year history. CSA, majority-owned by Czech state institutions, has been tackling two problems - the search for new partner following the split with Air France, and the struggle to meet finance requirements on its Airbus leases. CSA split up with Air France, its strategic partner, in March, after the government paid Dollars 27m to buy out the French airline's stake. It has tried to forge another alliance with an airline, but without success. It has now adopted a new approach: the search is on for a Czech investor, such as a financial institution, willing to pump money into the airline. The Airbus leases that are at the core of CSA's problems were signed early in 1989 at the peak of the aircraft leasing boom and before the democratic revolution in the former Czechoslovakia. 'It has been clear for some time that CSA is not able to carry the cost of these leases,' says Mr Frantisek Slaby, the airline's executive vice-president for finance and planning. The Airbus lease represents about 10 per cent of CSA's total cost base, he adds. The carrier, however, is to receive an interest-free loan of Kcs586m (Dollars 21.3m) from the government to help it discharge immediate leasing payments on two Airbus A310-300s. In addition to the loan, the airline has managed to renegotiate the leases so that its annual repayments will be cut to Kcs600m a year from now until they expire in 2001. This will save it Kcs200m annually. The airline also leases five Boeing 737-500s and four ATR 72-200s, which it acquired in 1992 and which cost Kcs700m annually. CSA hopes the new lease arrangements will convince a local investor to come on board. It has held talks with several North American and east Asian airlines, but its financial woes and a lingering bitterness over Air France's withdrawal have forced it to abandon that route. Instead, Mr Slaby says, CSA is talking to Czech investors, one of which is likely to acquire some or all of the 48.99 per cent stake in the airline held by the National Property Fund, the Czech government body that owns companies being privatised. Mr Slaby says this investor would most likely be a Czech financial institution, and that a deal could be finalised next year. 'There are (Czech) institutions able and willing to be financial partners with CSA,' he says. A possible partner is Ceska Pojist'ovna, the partly privatised Czech insurance company that owns 4.5 per cent of CSA. CSA will, however, continue talks with other airlines on route-sharing, passenger incentives and catering services. Delta Airlines of the US has been touted as a likely partner in this area. However, Mr Slaby says his airline is talking to four or five parties. A third likely alliance would involve a technology and know-how agreement with another airline or service company. The final say on these developments rests with the government, whose anger at the Air France pull-out has been partly assuaged by CSA's improving financial performance. The company has reduced losses in the first nine months to Kcs215.2m, compared with a loss of Kcs738.3m in the same period last year. In fiscal 1993 CSA lost Kcs1.5bn after tax. Passenger numbers have been rising since March, ironically coinciding with the Air France pull-out, while capacity utilisation is also up on last year, peaking at nearly 75 per cent in August. By the end of the year CSA will have 20 aircraft. Six Russian Ilyushin Il 62Ms were withdrawn from service at the end of October, but in addition to the western-built aircraft it also has four Tupolev Tu 154Ms and three Tu 134As. It has recently taken delivery of two ATR 42s on operating leases for service on short-haul routes. In spite of lower losses, the leasing commitments make the need for CSA to find a new backer urgent. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was Air France's partner in the high-profile Dollars 60m investment in March 1992, says it will soldier on as a long-term investor, despite losing its board representation. The EBRD too must be hoping CSA's new plans will provide an early solution to the airline's problems.</p>

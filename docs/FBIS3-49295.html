			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Valentin Stoyanov, President Zhelev's </F> spokesman -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Valentin Stoyanov, the president's  spokesman, expressed his view on today's reports published by  some newspapers and related to the functions and prerogatives of  the president's military cabinet:    [Begin Stoyanov recording] Today a few Sofia dailies gave in  to the manipulations of certain political centers and groups  that are pursuing the goal of slandering the president of the  Republic of Bulgaria.    Referring to a letter the president wrote on 22 November  1993  to the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the  Bulgarian Army, some anonymous politicians and commentators are  trying to insinuate that the president's military cabinet is  either duplicating or substituting for the functions and  prerogatives of the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense.  Those gentlemen have evidently interpreted the letter in a  totally biased way, like the devil reading the Bible, because at  the very beginning of the letter it is stated as follows, and I  quote:    The president's military cabinet as a whole, its chief, and  the advisers on the different branches of service, have neither  command nor control functions over the Ministry of Defense and  the Bulgarian Army. It could not be stated more clearly than  that.    We should add that the text was approved by the Ministry of  Defense and by the chief of the General Staff and circulated  among all military units in the form of a special letter.    Even more preposterous are the allegations that the  president, by issuing Decree No. 269, intended to take over  direct command of the Army. We should first carefully read the  Constitution in order to understand the nature of the  president's decrees, and then to realize that the decree in  question is by no means secret and that whoever is interested in  it can read it.    I am talking about a document that determines the duties of  the military cabinet within the framework of the presidential  institution.    Item 1 of the decree in question reads as follows, and I  quote:    The military cabinet assists the president of the Republic  of  Bulgaria in exercising his functions as supreme commander in  chief, by collecting, analyzing, and summing up informative  data. The military cabinet has no leading or control functions  whatsoever over the Armed Forces as a whole, or over any of  their branches.    We feel obliged to confirm our impression that any step  adopted by the president in connection with settling mutual  relations among the country's public institutions is treated  with extreme hostility by certain political parties or civil  servants.    The present attack is only part of a more extensive campaign  aimed at discrediting the head of state.    Nevertheless, everyone should realize that if the president  of the Republic of Bulgaria would have transgressed his  prerogatives in any sphere whatsoever, if he had committed any  act whatsoever in violating the Constitution, the authors of  today's scenarios would have seriously demanded his resignation,  as stipulated by the Constitution, rather than engaging in  devious political machinations as they are doing today.    One of the goals of the current campaign is to introduce a  split between the president, as commander in chief, and the  Bulgarian Army. This is an attempt of undermining the  foundations of the country's national security. Those who  consider themselves good Bulgarian politicians could win public  confidence by engaging in useful patriotic activities, rather  than in futile plots and machinations, because all attempts at  slandering other people are usually counterproductive.    It is high time to introduce a more civilized spirit into  Bulgarian political life, because slanders and attempts at  discrediting one's fellow citizens are placing Bulgaria in an  awkward situation in the eyes of our own people and are making  our country appear ridiculous in the eyes of the world.    The political plotters could engage in some more serious  tasks serving Bulgaria's interests. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has announced that a  heightened struggle will be waged against crime throughout the  country in response to attacks on National Civilian Police [PNC]  members. According to Cristiani, the attacks are in response to  the PNC's ongoing battle against organized crime.    The president said: With these attacks "criminals are trying  to intimidate agents so they abandon the fight," but he warned  that both the PNC and the government will continue the war  against organized crime with greater vigor. Cristiani made this  announcement at noon yesterday, just after he presided over a  ceremony to commemorate the Santa Ana centennial, which was  officially named a "Heroic City."    The government has said authorities "have taken steps to  fight the gangs of kidnappers" who have spread terror throughout  the Santa Ana region. As was previously reported, gangs of men  dressed in olive green and armed with heavy weapons have set up  various camps at the base of the Santa Ana volcano and continue  to kidnap and extort money from farmers. A self-proclaimed  "Commander Oscar" even sent threatening letters announcing the  beginning of a new war in this area. According to Cristiani,  the PNC has taken note of the complaints and begun  investigations, and he added that the Army has begun patrolling  the area.    Meanwhile, Cristiani also denied external pressure was  exerted to reform the Constitution, as some jurists have  claimed. According to the president, the reforms being made by  the assembly are designed to modernize the state and modify the  government's administration, specifically within the Supreme  Court of Justice and the Arbitration Court.    On the other hand, Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado, who was  consulted  yesterday in Santa Ana, believes "the Legislative Assembly is  once again making the mistake it made in 1991." Our Constitution  is being hastily reformed because of foreign pressure, while  national interests are being neglected. Salgado charged that  many decisions which hurt the people "are being adopted in a  foreign embassy, which is bad."    On another subject, President Cristiani said he will meet  with his Central American counterparts in San Jose, Costa Rica,  on 8 May at President Jose Figueres' inauguration. There they  will decide when they will hold the next summit, which Dr.  Armando Calderon Sol will probably attend as president of El  Salvador.</p>

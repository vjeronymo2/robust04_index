			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Three senior Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) legislators, widely dubbed the "YKK trio"  by the media, decided to create a new policy study group free  from faction ties, LDP sources said Tuesday [10 May].    The three vocal legislators are former Construction Minister  Taku Yamazaki, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato and  former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Junichiro Koizumi.  The name, "YKK trio," is based on the initials of their family  names.    The trio plans to bring together liberal legislators from  both the main opposition LDP and non-LDP political parties,  with an eye to the possibility of a major reconfiguration of  alliances within the political community in the near future,  they said.    The political community is rife with speculation over the  imminence of such restructuring if the LDP succeeds in mustering  the support of the second largest opposition Social Democratic  Party in passing a no-confidence motion against the minority  government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata through the Diet.    Yamazaki, a longtime backer of former Foreign Minister  Michio  Watanabe, said the new group will seek to "reform the LDP even  at the risk of disbanding the party." Yamazaki also said the  new group will seek to release legislators from the customary  obligations and bonds of LDP factions to which they belong.    Kato said the new group will try to be the driving spirit  behind deregulation and other policies.    The trio is lobbying other legislators from various factions  to bolster the size of the new group to the order of 50, they  said. The group will convene its first meeting early next week  to decide on its formal name.    The trio has been deemed as the critics of the current LDP  leadership led by LDP president Yohei Kono. Kato dismissed  speculation that the new group is seeking to form an alliance  with Watanabe, whose threat to splinter from the LDP plunged the  party into a serious quandary last month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Admiral Mario Flores,  Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) minister-chief, today  confirmed the existence of the report disseminated by O ESTADO  DE SAO PAULO on activities by the Landless People's Movement  (MST). The confirmation was made during a nearly two-hour  meeting with Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) [Workers Party --  Sao Paulo], PT deputies and representatives, and MST leaders.  The admiral showed the report but did not permit anyone present  to touch it. He read parts of it to confirm his guarantees that  the content did not have any ideological or electoral biases.    The minister stressed that the government has been  internally  hurt by the leak of the report. Another top-level government  official said there has been a decision to find the person who  leaked the document. According to PT attorney Luiz Eduardo  Greenhalgh, who also participated in the meeting, Flores  emphasized that the SAE is not interested in meddling in  electoral problems because it is a consultation body for the  president of the Republic.    Flores denied that the movement has been given the dimension  of a guerrilla movement and attributed the section of the  document claiming there was a paramilitary training camp in  Ranch Ipojuca, in Pernambuco, to obsolete evidence. He also made  clear that the references made about the ranch were based on  "reports" (unconfirmed facts) of something that occurred in the  past. The minister characterized the press' dissemination of the  report as "inflationary paranoia."    Minister Flores told Landless Movement representatives that  the SAE had the legal obligation to write reports on social  movements such as the MST for the president. The document's  dissemination forced Flores to explain the matter to the  president the day after the document's first part appeared in  the press.    Gilmar Gerardo Mauro, one of the MST leaders, said that  during the meeting Flores explained that the document only  contained an explanation of the organization and its area of  influence. Gilmar Mauro said at the meeting's end that he was  convinced the MST "has nothing to do" with what it was  attributed to them in the document. For him, the dissemination  of that type of information "only increases tensions in rural  areas." The MST leader also said he invited Minister Flores to  visit Cacador University, which, according to him, is a training  center where all types of courses and currents, including  pastoral politics, are taught.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Jobs: Putting personality tests to the test - Adrian Furnham considers the attractions of the psychological approach to personnel selection After 20 years of ostracism and cynicism, personality and ability testing has become popular, even mandatory, in many organisations. A recent survey of The Times 1,000 companies indicated that between a quarter and a third used psychological tests and that the number was increasing. However, academic psychologists remain highly sceptical about the predictive validity of any, or all, personality tests, particularly in the marketplace of work. A little of this scepticism - even cynicism - has rubbed off on personnel and human resources directors but many remain eager to buy and apply such tests to selection and related organisational issues. It is not difficult to see why businesspeople are attracted to the idea of testing. Establishing an accurate, fair and sensitive process of selection and appraisal is far from easy. Everyone has experienced the awkward, or inadequate, or lazy, or irresponsible, or inefficient colleague whom somebody selected and nobody can sack. As a result some use tests specifically to select out, rather than select in  -to warn about people who may prove problematic, rather than highlight potential high-flyers. It is difficult to obtain all relevant information about people, compare them with others and make judgments on their future success only by referring to CVs and interviewing them, so it is no surprise that managers turn to personality tests which are apparently scientific, seem to provide useful material on a whole range of personality traits and give normative data for the population as a whole. On the other hand, there are those who believe that with sufficient experience and a modicum of common sense they can easily select the right person. Tests are not for them. They might argue that just as intelligence tests do not measure intelligence, so personality tests can hardly measure something as complex, subtle and varied as personality. After all, people have one thing in common - they are all different; so some feel it offensive to reduce people to sets of 16 numbers on a computer-generated profile. In fact as more and more personality tests come on to the market cynics have had to rehearse their arguments more frequently. Common objections are: Many of these tests can be faked. People may lie to put themselves in a good light and achieve high scores but this does not reflect their real personality. Some people do not have sufficient self-insight to report on their own feelings and behaviour. Some cannot, rather than will not, give accurate answers about themselves. Tests are unreliable in that all sorts of temporary factors such as anxiety, boredom, weariness or ill health can lead people to give different answers on different occasions. Tests, like the psychologists who invent them, are unstable. Most importantly, tests are invalid as they do not measure what they purport to measure and, equally, the scores do not predict performance in business over time. Many tests have this Achilles heel and are lamentably short of robust proof of their validity. Tests might be able to measure all sort of dimensions of behaviour but not those crucial to the organisation such as trustworthiness and likelihood of absenteeism. Buying personality tests is like having a set menu; what many managers want is the a la carte, where they can select what they want. People have to be sufficiently literate or articulate to do the tests and be sufficiently familiar with North American jargon. Many organisations believe their workforce could not do them properly, it would take up too much time or would cause embarrassment. There are no good norms, at least for the populations companies want to test; comparing them with north American samples, mostly white undergraduates, is dangerously misleading. That is, there are no benchmark statistics against which to measure employees. The tests are unfair and biased in favour of the white middle class so white males tend to do better or show more attractive profiles and so get selected. Many tests are the product of middle class, middlebrow, middle-aged, middle Americans and are not appropriate for those from other groups. Interpretation of the tests takes skill, insight and experience which may be too expensive or not available. In the wrong hands, tests are dangerous because profiles are given inaccurate or too literal interpretations. Organisations can become consultant dependent, which is a very expensive addiction. Freedom of information legislation may mean that candidates can see and perhaps challenge the scores themselves, their interpretation or the decisions made on them. This may lead to extreme embarrassment or, worse, litigation. As tests of both ability and personality become well known, people could buy copies and practice so that they know the correct or most desirable answers. This happens extensively with US ability testing and results could be seen to have more to do with preparation and practice than actual ability. These 11 criticisms are frequently heard. In some instances, and considering some tests, they are more than justified. They make a useful list with which to confront a testing enthusiast. But old hands know most of the answers and can provide impressive statistics on norms, reliability and so on. In addition to answering the criticisms they may also in fact present a strong case for testing. Examples are: Tests provide numeric information which means individuals can more easily be compared on the same criteria. Different questions are asked of different candidates during interviews and the answers often forgotten. Testing is an empirical, scientific operation. With data-based records a person's development can be traced over time. Test results in an individual's file can actually demonstrate if, and by how much, the tests were predictive of later work-related behaviour. Tests give explicit and specific results on temperament and ability rather than the vague, ambiguous, coded platitudes so often found in references. A percentage score - provided of course that it is valid - makes for much clearer thinking about personal characteristics than terms such as satisfactory, sufficient or high-flyer. Tests are fair because they eliminate corruption and stop favouritism or old boy, masonic or Oxbridge networks from self perpetuating. That is, if a person does not have the ability or a 'dangerous' profile they will not be chose irrespective of their other 'assets'. Tests are comprehensive in that they cover all the basic dimensions of personality and ability from which other behaviour patterns derive. Most, but not all, tests tap into the agreed three crucial facets of human personality which are extraversion, stability, tough-mindedness. Tests are scientific in that they are soundly empirically based on proven theoretical foundations - that is, they are reliable, valid and able to discriminate the good from the mediocre and the average from the bad. Many have a wealth of studies in their support 'proving' that personality/ability scores relate to occupational behaviour. As an academic I like to feel impartial, disinterested and fair when approaching the topic of testing. This desire for balance (or is it fence-sitting?) leads me to teach two quite difference courses. One, A Which? Guide to Testing, is for business people and personnel officers and is aimed at helping to appreciate which are the discerning, critical and crucial questions to ask of test salesmen. One motive is to help them choose, or develop for themselves, the best test for their particular needs. The other course, Introductory Psychometrics, is an attempt to persuade my sometimes cynical, critical and capricious students of the benefits (indeed necessity) of measuring individual differences and, more importantly, how to do it properly. Few people from either group come to the topic without a store of strong opinions in spite of the fact that their knowledge-base of the pitfalls and advantages is pretty tabula rasa. Perhaps a Which? report with little black and red boxes showing strengths and weaknesses is exactly what is required.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Knesset Member Hayim Ramon, </F> secretary general-elect of the Histadrut labor federation, by  Ya'el Dan; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dan] Mr. Ramon, is the way  paved for a coalition between your list and Labor in the  Histadrut labor federation?    [Ramon] I hope so. We told the voters that we hope to  establish a coalition with Labor. I also said as much to the  Labor party chairman. This position is shared by all members of  our list. I hope negotiations with the Labor party chairman --  who is also the prime minister -- start very soon. I hope Labor  party leaders in the Histadrut transfer power in an orderly way.  We must remember that there has been no upheaval in the  Histadrut since its establishment more than 70 years ago, so  there is no experience in power changes in this organization. I  sincerely hope that they intend to implement this changeover in  the most orderly and smoothest way possible, thus enabling us to  start working.    The way for cooperation with Labor in this issue is paved. I  assume that I will meet with the prime minister in the very near  future. For me the most important thing is that the basis for  such a coalition be our platform, as we promised to the voters.  Incidentally, large segments of this platform are included in  Labor's platform for the Knesset elections. The antiquated  Histadrut bureaucracy, however, prevented the prime minister  from fulfilling his promises. The best example for this is the  national health bill; another important example is the national  pension bill. [passage omitted]</p>

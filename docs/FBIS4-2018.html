			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Denial By GATT Wouldn't Be Fatal, Moftec </F> Official Says"]    [Text] With or without access to GATT, China will emerge  as a powerful global competitor, a senior Chinese trade official  asserts.    "Without GATT membership, our open policy and reform would  continue," said Li Zhongzhou, Deputy Director General for  International Relations at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Co-operation (Moftec).    Li made his remarks last week at an international seminar,  "China Business Summit," that came about two weeks before China  was to send a high-level delegation to Morocco to sign the final  agreements of the Uruguay round of GATT talks.    During the 16th session of the GATT Working Party on China  held in Geneva last month, most member nations showed support  for China's early re-entry. Among the exceptions was the United  States.    Li admitted that denial of membership in GATT would likely  have a negative effect on trade expansion and slow down the pace  of reform in China.    "However," he said, "a passive return to import substitution  (a measure to restrict imports) in parallel with continued  investment incentives may actually encourage greater foreign  investment (in China) because local production would then be  favoured over imports.    "The world trade community has a choice between accepting  China as an equal trading partner by granting it GATT  membership, or competing for access to the Chinese market on a  reciprocal basis," he said.    The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) prefers  multilateralism to bilateralism.    Li said China has made a high profile effort to regain GATT  member status, but does not want membership at any cost.    "The bottom line is equal treatment," Li said. "China hopes  to obtain unconditional most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment  equivalent to that accorded to all other contracting parties by  participating in GATT. It is important to point out that this  is the fundamental international principle applied universally,  not a privilege as claimed by certain political arguments."    The United States has insisted that it will renew MFN for  China on the condition that the Chinese Government "makes  progress on human rights" and other issues, an approach that  China maintains runs counter to the spirit of GATT.    "The entry into GATT is a crucial step to integrate the  Chinese economy with the international community. It injects a  dynamic factor into the world economic growth. However, this  purely economic issue has been complicated by non-economic  factors and the negotiation has been delayed for an unwarranted  long period," Li said.    He added that the market-based pricing system has been in  place in China, which is one of the fundamental demands of GATT.    He noted that certain major trading partners are taking  advantage of China's negotiations for GATT membership to extract  unreasonable concessions that are beyond China's ability.    For example, some partners demand that China eliminate all  non- tariff measures while they themselves maintain quantitative  restrictions on thousands of items such as textiles and  clothing, agricultural products, consumer goods, steel and  footwear.    In some of these sectors China has comparative advantages.    "In the case of increased protection against Chinese  products," Li asserted, "China will be forced to reduce imports  in order to balance its foreign trade.    This return to import controls, Li said, would be the second  best choice for China if it is kept out of the world's  multilateral trading system.</p>

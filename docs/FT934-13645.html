			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Ireland in row with Brussels over aid THE IRISH government and the European Commission yesterday clashed over regional aid, in what officials on both sides fear could be a widening row spreading into next week's EC summit in Brussels. Dublin fears it will not now get the IPounds 7.8bn (Pounds 7.5bn) in structural aid it believes it was promised after negotiations in July, when Ireland threatened to veto the EC's regional aid programme totalling Ecu157bn (Pounds 122bn) for 1994-99. The Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, flew to Brussels last night for urgent talks about the issue. Mr Spring's mission - he was meeting Commission president Jacques Delors and other officials - was understood to have been given the go-ahead after high-level contacts throughout yesterday between Dublin and EC officials. Irish officials claim Mr Delors is going back on the pledge he gave to Mr Spring in the early hours of July 20, when Dublin lifted its veto on the regional aid programme. But Mr Delors responded angrily yesterday, telling RTE, Irish Television: 'I always have the custom of fulfilling my promises; this is a lie.' The Commission meets in special session this morning to decide on a proposal from Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy, which would give Ireland only between IPounds 7.1bn and IPounds 7.2bn. A decision was delayed at yesterday's weekly meeting of the EC executive, when Ireland's commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn, invoked a rarely used internal Commission regulation to demand a postponement. Mr Flynn said yesterday that the lower payment was 'not in accordance with the agreement between Ireland and the Commission'. One Irish source described the dispute as 'the biggest political row in 20 years of (Irish) membership of the Community' and forecast an 'untidy' EC summit next week.</p>

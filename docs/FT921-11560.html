			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Lloyd's counters forecast of losses THE dispute between Lloyd's of London and Chatset, the independent analysis company, over the insurance market's 1990 and 1991 results deepened yesterday. On Wednesday Chatset published its own forecast and estimated that Lloyd's faces losses of Pounds 1bn for its 1990 underwriting year and Pounds 750m for last year. Lloyd's will report the results in June next year and the year after. A number of underwriters disputed the projections and yesterday Lloyd's issued its own estimates. They are derived from individual forecasts given by a market group of managing agents representing about 40 per cent of the market. Lloyd's claim that the market will register a loss of Pounds 390.5m for 1990 and a profit of Pounds 424.5m for last year. The figures exclude investment income, expenses and the reinsurance to close that individual underwriters will decide when closing their accounts. They also exclude the impact of further claims emerging from business underwritten before 1990. Chatset estimates that such claims might cost at least Pounds 400m a year, although the figure is disputed by Lloyd's. Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, described Chatset's figures as 'unnecessarily pessimistic and alarmist'. The House of Lords yesterday gave Lloyd's leave to appeal on a preliminary issue in the legal case being brought against the corporation by 33 Names who were members of insurance syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan managing agency, now in liquidation. The Names - the individuals who pledge their wealth to back the market  - say their losses were due to the failure of the Lloyd's Corporation, which provides market back-up and regulatory services, to regulate the market properly. Lloyd's wants the issue of whether it owes Names a legal duty of care to be heard on technical grounds outside the facts of the case. It appealed to the lords after losing on the same issue in the appeal court last September.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Mandela woos old financial enemies: Johannesburg brokers applaud ANC president The faces of the affluent white males in the glass-enclosed trading floor of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday looked as relieved as if the Springbok rugby team had just scored a try. Bemused expressions became smiles as they broke into applause when Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, ended his maiden speech to the exchange. Mr Mandela at times struggled to make himself heard over the chants of 'Amandla' (power) coming from the black office workers and cleaners who had gathered in the large atrium outside to celebrate the presence of their leader. When he had finished, one broker voiced the feelings of most of the gathered businessmen. 'He was quite impressive, wasn't he?' The financial community might have been forgiven for fearing the worst from Mr Mandela. 'A casino', the ANC used to sniff dismissively about the institution not so long ago. Policy documents repeatedly called for 'state intervention and regulation' and highlighted the need to 'rationalise and restructure the financial sector'. But Mr Mandela came across as a technocrat pledging greater co-operation between government and the private sector. 'The stock exchange,' he said without a trace of irony, 'has an important role in the reconstruction and development of our country.' Stressing his faith in 'sound market principles', Mr Mandela was at pains to emphasise the 'critical role of business in building our economy'. He cited the ANC's proposed Reconstruction and Development Programme, worth R39bn (Pounds 7.27bn) over five years, which will fund black development projects, as an example of government trying to set a framework to help business. It may have taken four years of hard lobbying by the local and international business community, but Mr Mandela's speech was taken by nervous businessmen as final proof that the ANC seems to have learned that the local stock market, the 11th biggest in the world by capitalisation, will have to play a key role in developing a healthy economy and setting the tone for potential foreign investors. Demonstrating the ANC's new-found sensitivity to market sentiment, Mr Mandela was at pains to reassure dealers about the election itself next week, dismissing the 'prophets of doom' who suggested that blacks would run riot in celebration afterwards. Instead, he suggested, the prospect of a legitimate, democratic government would 'bring the stability needed for international investment'. His farewell waves to black workers showed he still knew who his natural political constituency was, but his audience was reassured. As another broker put it: 'I would be surprised if anyone here voted for him, but I'm a lot more relaxed about him being president.' And as Mr Mandela walked away clutching a memento of his first encounter with unchained capitalism - a set of gold cufflinks embossed with the JSE logo - the real reward for his visit was evident on the floor. Following his talk, the market began to rise on a healthy mix of foreign and domestic buying, and the industrial index finished the day 22 points up at 5,985.

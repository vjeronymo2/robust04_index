			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The Augustinian virtues we need Simple horror at the size of prospective UK budget deficits is not a sufficient reason for adopting restrictive fiscal policies this year. Horror of government deficits was never the reason why I abandoned card-carrying Keynesianism - that is the doctrine of stoking up demand until some full employment target is achieved. The budget of a country is not the same as that of an individual or a company, despite some partial analogies. A so-called theorem, frequently put forward, is that, whenever the real rate of interest exceeds a country's real growth rate, any primary budget deficit must, if continued, cause the burden of interest payments to explode. (By 'primary' is simply meant the deficit excluding interest payments.) It is this argument that lies behind the fear of a debt trap and the Maastricht criterion limiting permissible budget deficits (not clearly defined) to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. The seven UK 'wise men', who have just reported to the Treasury, range in their projections of the UK public sector borrowing requirement over the next couple of years from Pounds 32bn to Pounds 60bn, or 4.9 to 8.2 per cent of GDP. The remarks of the seven economists on the overall functioning of the economy are, however, more interesting than their best guesses about the level of various indicators in the next couple of years. Indeed I was delighted to find some common ground with Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge in his arguments against an early tax rise or public spending curb. The view that prospective UK budgets are explosive, and will have to be curbed soon, would be reasonable if the economy were operating at the normal rate of utilisation possible without accelerating inflation, and growing at its trend rate. But this is not the case. Even if some modest recovery has begun, UK growth is well below its 2-3 per cent trend rate; and the Bank of England, in its Inflation Report, puts the output gap - the degree to which demand increases could readily be absorbed by producers without adding inflationary pressures - at between 2 1/2 per cent and 7 per cent of GDP. This is equivalent to between one and three years' normal growth. The 'theorem' about the debt trap applies in full only if the level of output is independent of budgetary policy. If higher public spending or lower taxes cause output to grow more quickly, then the theorem does not hold. Debt interest rises, but so does the real national income and government revenues with it. In a mathematical appendix, composed with a colleague, Prof Bob Rowthorn, Godley demonstrates that, on certain strong assumptions 'so long as there is no supply constraint of any kind, an addition to public expenditure would eventually add enough to national output to generate enough tax revenue - at given tax rates - to cover not only the initial addition to public expenditure, but also the interest payments which have been generated by the additional public sector debt'. Left to myself, I would merely say, as I did in this column on January 28, that, even if there is any increase in the transfer burden from servicing the national debt, this must be balanced against the welfare gains from higher output and employment. Godley also has a less abstract argument. The surpluses and deficits of the various sectors must add up to zero. Let us assume, as a worst case, a PSBR equivalent to 9 per cent of GDP and a current balance of payments deficit of 4 per cent. Then the arithmetical implication is that of a private sector surplus of 5 per cent of GDP. Yet surpluses of this kind have only been approached in the past in periods of very high inflation such as the 1970s. The only reason for expecting them now is that corporate and personal saving will for several years remain exceptionally high relative to investment to work off the debt overhang. Meanwhile, 'it would be perverse in the extreme to respond to this exceptionally low private spending relative to income by fiscal restriction'. No one who remembers Godley's previous doom warnings on fiscal imbalance will expect him to grant British taxpayers an indefinite reprieve. But the Godley point with which I agree is that the time for restrictive fiscal measures will come when the economy is up against some constraint such as the balance of payments, accelerating inflation or a shortage of capacity or labour. I would, however, go much further than Godley in collapsing these three constraints into one - that of accelerating inflation. Operationally we would know we were up against a balance of payments constraint if the exchange rate fell intolerably or interest rates had to be raised sharply to prevent this happening. But the only reason for worrying about the exchange rate is that it is part of the inflationary transmission mechanism. As far as capacity is concerned, the relevant constraints are not purely physical, but signs that domestic pressures are pushing up pay and prices. As the very wide range in the Bank of England's output gap estimate demonstrates, we cannot know beforehand what the safety limits are. In the past inflation has started to accelerate even when unemployment has been in the low millions. I would not reject out of hand Prof Patrick Minford's view that, because of the Thatcher government's supply side improvements, the equilibrium level of unemployment is now down to 1m. But nor would I bank on it in advance. What would be the main grounds for rejecting the Augustinian view of the UK fiscal balance - 'God make me chaste, but not just yet'? There is the extreme neo-classical view that, whatever the chancellor does, tax increases will be expected by businessmen and consumers and they will adjust their savings upwards accordingly. In that case delaying tax increases would do no good, but no harm either. There is also the ultra-monetarist view that only monetary policy - in practice interest rates - and not fiscal policy matters for demand management. But we would have to be extremely confident that only money matters to disregard the effects of fiscal tightening altogether, especially when business and consumer confidence remain so fragile. Another consideration is the anxiety mentioned by the Bank of England that future deficits might be financed by excessive borrowing from the banking system and thus stoke up inflation. Fears that fiscal tightening will not take place when the right time comes cast their shadows in front of them. Examples are high bond yields and a low sterling exchange rate. To forestall such fears, Mr Lamont would be well advised to give unorthodox advance warning of the direction of likely future tax increases and expenditure curbs. The final bogey is the 1981 Budget, which raised the tax burden in a recession, which in turn provoked a protest by 364 economists, but for which Conservatives active in the period are fighting to claim credit. Because the economy was, in any case, about to revive substantially the 1981 Budget did little harm, but little good either. Can one be sufficiently confident of expansion prospects this time - or the feasibility of further large interest rate cuts - to risk an early dose of fiscal restriction this time round?  ----------------------------------------------------------------                     THE WISE MEN'S FORECASTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage changes on a year earlier unless otherwise stated  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                                   Range                                 Average       Low       high  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP          1993              1.1       0.2       2.0                   1994              2.7       1.4       3.4 Unemployment (m)  1993 Q4           3.2       3.1       3.4                   1994 Q4           3.1       2.7       3.6 RPI exc mortgage  1993 Q4           3.9       3.1       4.8 interest payments 1994 Q4           3.5       1.0       4.9 Current account (Pounds bn)       1993          -15 1/2       -20    -7 1/2                   1994          -15 1/2       -22        -6 PSBR (Pounds bn)  1993-94            47        40        55                   1994-95            45    32 1/2        60  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Report of the Panel of Independent Forecasters, Treasury  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

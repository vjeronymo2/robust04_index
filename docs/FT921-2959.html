			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market in confusion as price sets 5 3/4 -year low CONFUSION REIGNED in the gold market yesterday as the price in London dropped at one stage to Dollars 341 a troy ounce, the lowest since June 1986. It closed at Dollars 342.20, down Dollars 3.80 from Friday's close. On the New York Commodity Exchange the most-active April contract crashed through all remaining technical barriers to Dollars 342.10 an ounce and at midday seemed set to test new lows. Some analysts said there was now nothing to stop spot gold falling below Dollars 300. One recalled that the last time that happened, in 1985, the price took a year to climb back to Dollars 340. Dealers said yesterday's selling started at the morning 'fix' in London and came from several quarters. Some suggested selling seemed to be related to a specific deal or deals somewhere in the market's shadowy background, rather than being caused by any fundamental reason. Some said the fall was associated with uncertainties about the South African referendum. Whatever the reason, the drop in London triggered more selling by computer-driven US funds. 'With Middle East players effectively out of the market because of (the fasting month of) Ramadan, there were no buyers when people began baling out. The price could just keep going down,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez group. Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg Securities financial services group, said: 'It is very worrying because chartists say there is no real support for the price below Dollars 342. The price could go all the way down to Dollars 325 and I can't see what would push it back over Dollars 350 in the near term'.</p>

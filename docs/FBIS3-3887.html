Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- Acting to ease the  soaring demand for construction workers in northern Taiwan,  local contractory increased the pace with which they hired  foreign laborers last year, the Taipei city government's  Department of Labor reported.    According to statistics released recently by the department,  5,830 overseas laborers were imported to Taiwan last year, up  from the 2,300 recruited in 1992. The number of construction  firms that applied for imported labor jumped to 38 from 17  during the same period.    Of the 5,830 imports, 5,500, or 95 percent were from  Thailand, 252 from the Philippines, 18 from Indonesia, and 11  from Malaysia, Council of Labor Affairs officials said.    The officials attributed the increased demand to the ongoing  construction of Taipei's mass rapid transit system and a booming  housing market islandwide.    Council tallies show that 75,700 foreign laborers have been  imported to Taiwan through legal channels, but if illegal  laborers are included, that figure is thought to be more than  130,000.    Although foreign laborers have been indispensable to the  local labor market, their existence has also promoted social  concerns. For example, 26 foreign workers returned to their  countries last year without completing contracts with their  Taiwan employers, a sign that the foreign laborers are having  trouble adjusting to life here.    In addition, some private foreign workers service centers  are  reportedly offering sex services at fees as low as NT$50 (US$2)  to NT$300, with many of the women employed in this line of work  entering Taiwan through clandestine transportation networks.</p>

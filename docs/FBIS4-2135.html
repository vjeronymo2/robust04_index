			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (AFP) -- Friends of Tong Yi, the  secretary of China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng,  expressed concern Wednesday that she had been detained, saying  she had been missing for two days.    Tong has been out of contact since Monday afternoon, when  police searched Wei's office here and took away many documents  following the detention of the 43-year-old veteran dissident for  interrogation about "suspected" new crimes since being released  from prison in September.    "I'm worried she's been detained because I've heard nothing  from here since the police came to Wei's office," Wei's sister,  Wei Ling, said by phone, adding Tong usually went to the office  daily.    Hong Kong radio quoted a public security official as saying  that Tong had been taken in for questioning. Beijing public  security bureau officials Wednesday denied any knowledge of the  reported detention.    Tong has maintained contact with foreign journalists since  Wei's nearly 30-hour detention in early March following a  controversial meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State for  Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck. The dissident subsequently  left the capital for a four-week "vacation" in northeast China  and was picked up by police again as he tried to return to  Beijing Friday.    The Beijing Public Security Department said Tuesday Wei had  "violated the law on many occasions and is suspected of having  committed new crimes when he was deprived of his political  rights and on parole."    Wei was released on parole in September, six months short of  a 15-year prison term for his "counter-revolutionary" role in  the 1978-1979 Democracy Wall movement.    Since his release, he has met frequently with foreign  journalists and remained outspoken in his advocation of  democracy.</p>

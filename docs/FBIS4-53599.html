			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 19 KYODO -- The United States  sounded cautiously optimistic about mending troubled trade ties  with Japan Thursday [19 May] as senior Japanese and U.S.  officials opened a fresh round of exploratory talks on how to  salvage a market-opening agreement between the two countries.    "We had a good start," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor told reporters after emerging from a 40-minute opening  session with the Japanese delegation.    Officials from the two sides huddled for several hours  behind  closed doors at the office of the U.S. trade representative as  they weighed terms and conditions for resuming stalled trade  talks under the so-called "framework" agreement concluded last  July.    Japanese and U.S. officials taking part in the talks, which  are expected to stretch over into Friday, maintained a virtual  news blackout on what transpired across the negotiating table.    Kantor said the two sides "had an exchange of detailed  ideas," but declined to shed any light on what the Japanese  officials are offering for resumption of the framework talks.    The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access  to the Japanese market and reducing Japan's vast trade surplus,  broke down in February after Tokyo rejected U.S.-proposed  yardsticks to measure Japanese imports.    Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in talks with President  Bill Clinton over the phone shortly after he took office in late  April, has promised to work to get the talks back on track.    Tokyo dispatched two senior officials -- Sozaburo Okamatsu,  vice trade minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki  Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs -- for the  exploratory talks after Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa held  another round of telephone conversations with Kantor last week.    "The fact that the foreign minister and the prime minister  directed these officials to come here ... for discussion is at  least a potentially hopeful sign," Kantor told a congressional  subcommittee Thursday.    While Kantor says the U.S. has set no "time limit" for a  deal, one obvious deadline is June 30 when the U.S. Government  is due to decide whether to cite Japan for discriminating  against U.S. firms on government procurement of medical and  telecommunications equipment.    Both industry sectors are among the priority areas covered  under the framework negotiations.    Meanwhile, in an television interview Thursday, U.S.  Commerce  Secretary Ron Brown reiterated that Washington will insist on  "measurable, monitorable results" in fashioning a trade  agreement with Tokyo.    Brown, speaking after fresh trade data showed that the U.S.  trade deficit with Japan jumped 25.4 percent to 5.80 billion  dollars in March, warned that sanctions against Japan remain an  option if there is no improvement in trade ties.    "You have vehicles such as (Super 301 trade sanctions) to  use  when necessary. That is not said in any kind of threatening  way. We have not made any decisions as to whether use that but  that is certainly an option available," Brown said in the  interview.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine ready to meet challenge of consolation prize IF Mr Michael Heseltine must finally abandon any ambition to lead his party, the chance to put a powerful Department of Trade and Industry back at the centre of government offers him an exciting consolation prize. Mr Heseltine has long had his eye on the top job at the DTI, where 20 years ago he served briefly as minister for aerospace. Although he has kept his own counsel since returning to the cabinet, he holds clear, controversial views on the proper role for his new department. During his period in ministerial exile, as the DTI was increasingly emasculated, Mr Heseltine produced reams of ideas for empowering a beefed-up industry department. At times, he sounded more in line with Labour thinking on the need for an industrial strategy than with his own party. Some of his ambitions for the DTI run the risk of conflict with other departments, not least the Treasury - which he believes has too great an influence on industrial policy - and the Foreign Office, which he thinks should play a much greater role in promoting British industry. Mr Heseltine may also have some home truths for the business community's representative bodies, such as the Confederation of British Industry and the chambers of commerce, which he believes could be organised more effectively. He may wish to stir a debate on the need for institutions to take a longer-term view towards investment in industry. He could also want to take a look at the narrow parameters which dictate the policy on takeovers, an area of activity not always perceived to be in the best interests of British industry. Another item on his checklist for action could be trying to devise a more effective role for the National Economic Development Office, which was effectively ignored under Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Heseltine will, in any case, begin with far broader responsibilities than Mr Peter Lilley, his predecessor. He will take charge of energy policy in a government committed to privatising the coal industry, to reducing the retail monopoly of British Gas and to reviewing the future of the nuclear industry. The DTI will also take over the Department of Employment's responsibility for small businesses, an area which is has been of particular interest to Mr Heseltine. Mr Heseltine's stewardship of the DTI will be in marked contrast to that of Mr Lilley, who promoted a comparatively narrow role for his department. This was focused on limiting the burden of bureaucracy on business and on creating a political environment which, Mr Lilley said, left companies 'free to get on with doing what they do best - encouraged and unimpeded'. Mr Lilley, above all, was accused of presiding over a department which had no real clout in government and which placed too much reliance on the mechanisms of the market place. The new incumbent sees things very differently - Mr Heseltine has described as short-sighted the 'averted gaze' of government in respect to industry. Some changes at the DTI may amount to little more than a different tone; Mr Heseltine may appear more understanding and concerned, although he will be as hard-pressed as his predecessors to win more cash. He inherits a Pounds 1bn departmental budget, primarily aimed at stimulating the process of longer-term wealth creation through innovation and research and development - areas which he will be keen to expand further. Mr Heseltine will also place renewed emphasis on the need to stimulate industrial development within the regions. Although he is not an interventionist in the sense that he has any time for central planning, his two spells as environment secretary demonstrated an enthusiastic advocacy of 'active government'. He believes passionately in the need for government to have 'a view from the centre' about how British industry should develop and prosper. He wrote recently: 'All the trappings of a continuous relationship between government and industry are there. What is missing is the conviction, the consistency and the machinery to work together with a coherent industrial strategy.' Mr Heseltine wants the DTI to have greater cabinet seniority than in the past, something which his own appointment will help bring about. But he also wants to see the DTI given overall responsibility for government relations with industry. During the 1980s, he viewed with dismay the endless changes at the top of the DTI, which enabled critics to claim that the government gave low priority to the problems and demands of British industry. As he put it five years ago: 'The views of the City are in the mainstream of policy; those of industry are frequently dismissed as little more than special pleading.' It is that culture which he now sets out to change. Mr Heseltine becomes the eighth trade and industry secretary in nine years and shows every sign of relishing the challenge. He will find it hard to complain, however, if he has to spend most of the next five years at the DTI.</p>

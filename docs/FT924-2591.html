			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Topdanmark to press on with issue terms TOPDANMARK, the insurance company, will proceed with the issue of 90,000 shares on December 16 at market price with no preferential rights for existing shareholders, the company said yesterday. Earlier this month, Top announced that its profits for the year would be lower than expected as a result of heavy fire indemnity calls caused by the dry summer, and turbulence in financial markets. Top's share price is currently DKr645 (Dollars 106). At this price the group's issue will raise DKr58m. The issue will take the share capital at face value to DKr285m.</p>

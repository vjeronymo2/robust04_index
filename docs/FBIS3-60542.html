At a meeting with the Danish Slaughterhouse Association on  Friday [29 October] Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh (Social  Democrat) maintained that for the sake of consumers he will not  relax the action plan to combat salmonella bacteria in pig herds  and in processed products from slaughterhouses.    On the other hand the minister regards the slaughterhouse  group's fear that up to one-fifth of the 1,500 medium-sized pig  herds will come under public supervision by Christmas as greatly  exaggerated.    Only five out of the 50 medium-sized herds in which analysis  has been completed so far have such a high incidence of  salmonella that they have come under supervision. This  corresponds to 10 percent and not the 20 percent the swine  sector fears might be the result of the action plan.    ``If the tendency holds expenses for the sector will be less  than 150 million kroner,'' said the minister, referring to the  slaughterhouse association's own estimate that the cost would be  more than twice that amount.    After the meeting the chairman of the Danish Slaughterhouse  Association, Bent Sloth, said he was glad that there is  apparently less of a problem in herds than they had feared. But  he stuck to his criticism of the action plan and expressed  disappointment that the swine sector did not meet with the  necessary sympathy from Westh.    But the group did get a number of concrete concessions from  the meeting. The minister said among other things that he is  prepared to discuss conditions for producers of small pigs, who  have had problems with the plan, that it may be possible to  reduce testing costs and that the authorities can help  slaughterhouses find the most efficient methods of slaughtering  salmonella-infected pigs.    ``I well understand that with swine prices at the current  low  level farmers find it almost unbearable to have this additional  problem. But it is no use complaining, we must try to get  through it,'' the minister said.</p>

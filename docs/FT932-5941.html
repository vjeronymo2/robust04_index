			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg tumbles into the red TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, fell heavily into the red in the first four months after being hit by depressed metals prices and losses from associated companies. It made a loss of SKr427m (Dollars 58m) after financial items, compared with SKr187m profit in the same 1992 period, as operating income slipped to SKr7.80bn from SKr7.95bn. The group warned it would suffer another 'severe deficit' in 1993, after last year's SKr1.56bn loss, because of weak business conditions and its US dollar hedging. 'The first four months were characterised by record low metal prices and continued decline in the building market,' the company said. Business conditions in Sweden and Europe remained weak, while the US market had not shown any sign of an upturn. The result was aggravated by a SKr121m loss from associated companies, against a SKr134m profit last year, while exchange gains at SKr7m were SKr215m less than a year ago. There was a loss after depreciation of SKr13m, against a SKr103m profit in 1992.</p>

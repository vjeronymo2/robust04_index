The group, which has been  pressing the government for increased public sector wages beyond  a 20 percent increase awarded last year, announced the new date  after heavy rains washed out plans for the protest last Friday.    TUC, in collaboration with the Guyana Consumers Association,  has also led opposition to increased electricity charges,  including a planned 400 Guyana dollars (one Guyana dollar =  approx. 0.78 U.S. cents) minimum charge which has since been  scrapped by the power company.    The Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC) has, however, gone  ahead with a 25-percent hike in electricity rates as of January,  and a further 25-percent hike is proposed from July.    Thursday's rally at the John Ford Car Park in central  Georgetown will be addressed by TUC president Lincoln Lewis,  Public Service Union (PSU) general secretary Susan Moore, and  National Association of Agricultural, Commercial, and Industrial  Employees (NAACIE) advisor N.K. Gopaul.</p>

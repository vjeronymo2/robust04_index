			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Telecoms ministers in deregulation talks Europe's domestic telephone users could soon have access to an alternative universal telephone service if ambitious European Commission proposals to liberalise mobile telecommunications and cable infrastructure networks succeed. The plans amount to the creeping deregulation of voice telephony for households well ahead of 1998, the date set by the EU for the break-up of monopoly control over the continent's public telephone services. These and other issues will be discussed at a meeting of telecoms ministers in Brussels today, amid growing impatience from Europe's leading electronics companies that liberalisation is not proceeding quickly enough. Last month the commission published a green paper on mobile communications intended to open the development of the mobile sector towards the personal communications mass market. Europe has only about 8m subscribers to mobile cellular telephones, but this figure could rise sharply if the opening up of the mobiles sector is accompanied by liberalisation of other telecommunications infrastructures, such as cable TV networks. In a deregulated market there would be nothing to stop mobile and cable operators joining forces to offer - particularly in highly cabled countries such as Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands - an alternative to the existing universal domestic telephone service. Although senior commission officials privately acknowledge that telecommunications markets are overtaking the agreed EU timetable for dismantling barriers in European telecoms markets, they are not prepared to expend the political capital that would be required to dismantle the 1998 deadline. But in a report to be presented to telecoms minsters at today's council meeting, heads of Europe's leading electronics companies are expected to argue that the EU should set precise targets for speeding liberalisation. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, has publicly thrown his weight behind a full and speedy liberalisation of Europe's cable television infrastructure. However, his plans may be scuppered by those member states wary of the political impact of early deregulation. The companies behind the report - Siemens, ICL, Philips Electronics, IBM Europe and Cie des Machines Bull - are part of an EU advisory group on information highways. They have been charged with proposing a strategy for developing pan-European computer and telecommunications networks as part of the EU's broader effort to boost economic growth. The report is likely to intensify debate before the summit in Corfu next month, when Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, is due to present it to heads of state.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Bilateral accords 'vital for Mideast progress' A political breakthrough in bilateral negotiations with Israel is vital for a wider discussion on the Middle East ecnomy to make progress, a Palestinian delegation said yesterday after a two-day session of the 35-nation working party on regional co-operation. Professor Youssef Sayigh, the Beirut-based leader of the Palestinian delegation, criticised Israel for not attending the meeting because Palestinian representation was not confined to those from the West Bank and Gaza.  The EC, which chaired the working party, made the same criticism to Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister. The Brussels meeting was also boycotted by Syria and Lebanon, which are first demanding progress in their bilateral talks with Israel.  Another Palestinian delegate, Mr Khalil Hindi said he understood the attitude of the Arab absentee countries, by 'the pros of attending outweight the cons'.  All participants agreed that the multilateral discussions on regional co-operation would only blossom if and when there was a political breakthrough in bilateral Arab-Israeli talks. Mr Samir Hulaileh, a Jerusalem economist, admitted Palestinian disorganisation was partly to blame for not taking more advantage of the EC scheme to promote Palestinian fruit and vegetable exports to the Community.  Israel was also frustrating such exports with systematic searches of Palestinians farm trucks.</p>

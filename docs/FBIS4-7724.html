			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, April 4 (TANJUG)--Bosnian Moslems are  continuing to attack on most fronts, with the brunt of the  offensive directed against the areas of Teslic, Mt. Ozren and  Doboj in the north, Bosnian Serb army sources said late on  Monday.    The Moslems have intensified attacks on the Serb positions  in  northern Bosnia as part of an all-out offensive, launched with  the object of taking the Sava River valley and cutting off a  corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian  Serb republic.    The Bosnian Serb army command in Banja Luka reported the  worst fighting to be in the Teslic area, where infantry attacks  on the southern and southeastern sectors of the front were  preceded by heavy artillery shellings.    Moslem forces have stepped up operations also on the  southwestern sector of the Ozren front and on the southern  slopes of Mt. Ozren, in an effort to break through the Serb  defence lines, the source said.    Heavy artillery and infantry operations were reported also  on  the Doboj front, with the Moslems dropping several shells on the  town of Doboj itself. There were no casualties, the report  said.</p>

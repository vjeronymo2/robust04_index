			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Meidyatama Suryodiningrat] </F>   [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali (JP) -- The second Senior Official  Meeting (SOM) of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  began here yesterday with a call to narrow the economic gap  between the developed and developing member nations.    "It is crucial for the developing economies in APEC to  achieve a rate of development that will allow them to reduce the  gap between themselves and their high industrialized partners,"  Director General for Foreign Economic Relations Wisber Luis said  at the opening the three-day meeting.    Wisber said that for this reason, it is important the four  fields of cooperation in the APEC framework -- human resources  development, promotion of small and medium scale industries,  private sector participation an improvement of infrastructures  -- should be prioritized.    The meeting is the second of four SOMs to held in  preparation  for the sixth APEC Ministerial Meeting due to be held in Jakarta  in November.    Over 250 officials from the 17-member states are attending  the meeting at the Bali International Convention Center at Nusa  Dua's complex of luxury hotels.    APEC, currently presided over by Indonesia, is comprised of  Canada, the United States, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong  Kong South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia,  Singapore, lndonesia, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, Australia and  New Zealand.    Wisber explained that, as chairman, Indonesia hopes the  current SOM will try to broaden and intensify the four fields of  cooperation. He said the recently signed Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade negotiations in Marrakech, Morocco, will have  a positive impact on APEC.    "The newly concluded Round may provide a fresh impetus for  APEC member to work towards a more liberalized trade and  investment regime in the region," he said.    Talking to reporters following the first session of  yesterday's meeting, Wisber said many of the delegates were  delighted that Bali was chosen as the venue of the SOM.    "They have commended Indonesia for the selection of the  site," he said. "Of course I didn't tell them that it added  costs," he added modestly.    Wisber would not reveal much about the contents of the  first-day's meeting but said that the provisional agenda for the  SOM had been approved. He added that participants were  reviewing the reports of the various working groups and  committees which had meetings a week In advance.    At the conclusion of yesterday's events, several delegates  explained that much of the proceedings dealt with the works of  the Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI).    Among the most important items discussed was the adoption of  an APEC Investment Principal, which included such issues as  non-discrimination and free movement of assets.    With the United States and Australia as the main initiators,  it was agreed that the latter would be responsible for producing  a draft of the Investment Principals.    Another topic on the agenda was the issue of promotion of  small and medium scale enterprises. Apparently no concrete  results have been yielded except for the fact that Taiwan will  be responsible for drawing-up a draft proposal.    Among the issues to be discussed in today's meeting will be  the creation of a Pacific Business Forum which will be an  assembly of business persons throughout the Asia Pacific region.    The delegates have also proposed that two persons represent  each country in the first meeting of the business forum  scheduled to be held in Singapore from June 10 to June 11.    At this point, Indonesia and Japan have already announced  their representatives. Indonesia will be represented by eminent  businessman A.R. Ramli and a former minister of cooperatives,  Bustanil Arifin. Japan has selected the president and vice  president of Itochu their representatives -- Minoru Morohushi  and Nobuo Tateishi, respectively.</p>

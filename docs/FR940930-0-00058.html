L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (the 1992 Act). Section 516 of the 1992 Act amends sections 204, 207, 220 and 221(g), of the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of HUD to pay virtually any mortgage insurance claim in book entry or other form of debentures an well as in the current certificated registered form. Section 508 of the 1992 Act establishes a 6-year statute of limitation on the payment of distributive shares from the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Authority To Pay Mortgage Insurance Claims With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Book Entry and Other Forms of Debentures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule amends parts 200, 203, 207, 220, 221, 235, 236, 237, 241 and 242 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations to authorize payment of mortgage insurance claims with book entry or other forms of debentures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under HUD's mortgage insurance programs, when a mortgage goes into default, the mortgagee is entitled to receive insurance benefits that are payable in cash or debentures. HUD currently pays most, but not all, claims in cash. One notable exception is that, under section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act, holders of single family mortgages insured under section 221 that are current after 20 years from final endorsement may assign the mortgages to HUD and receive debentures in exchange. Holders of current section 221 multifamily mortgages may likewise assign such mortgages to HUD in exchange for debentures if the mortgage is not sold through the auction process mandated by section 221(g)(4)(C). HUD also issues debentures for the difference between the amount of redeemed debentures and the amount of the mortgage insurance premium due, when mortgagees pay their MIP and then exercise their right to send in the debentures for redemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since 1938, the Department of the Treasury has acted as Fiscal Agent for the Federal Housing Administration and HUD with respect to debentures, and has carried out debenture processing functions on FHA's and HUD's behalf. Since 1988, Treasury has delegated much of the debenture processing functions to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (FRBP) acting in its capacity as Fiscal Agent of the United States. The computer system used by FRBP is designed to accommodate use of book entry, as well as certificated debentures. Processing book entry debentures is considerably less costly than processing certificated debentures. Section 516 of the 1992 Act provides explicit statutory authority for HUD to convert to a book entry system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

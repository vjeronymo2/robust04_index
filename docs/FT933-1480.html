			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on Russian calm THE DOLLAR yesterday gave up much of the ground it had won against the D-Mark in the immediate aftermath of the Russian crisis, as dealers took the view that events in Moscow would not unsettle western nations or financial markets, writes James Blitz. The immediate market response to President Yeltsin's announcement on Tuesday that he was suspending parliament and ruling by direct decree was to push the dollar higher as a safe haven currency. It peaked at DM1.6475 against a D-Mark which was weak against most European currencies as well. But the dollar buying reversed yesterday. Dealers may have been becalmed by the absence of blood on the streets of Moscow, and by signs that army leaders were firmly backing Mr Yeltsin, rather than splitting into different factions. Some dealers appeared concerned that the crisis could flare up at any moment with severe consequences for the west. But one London dealer wondered whether events in Russia, even if they exploded into civil war, would have any long-term impact on Europe and the US. As he put it, if a little crudely: 'The complete collapse of the Russian economy has taken place and has been priced into the market. It is hard to see how things could get a whole lot worse.' The fall in the dollar may also have been due to profit-taking by calmer heads in the market. The US currency closed at DM1.6285 in London. It finished in New York at DM1.6300, after Tuesday's DM1.6385 close. The French franc was confined to narrow range trading, ending at FFr3.483 from a previous FFr3.487. Sterling closed firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.4750, up from DM2.4675. The Finnish markka and the Swedish krona were more seriously hit because of their countries' trade links with the region. They fell to lows of FM3.6300 and SKr5.0504 per D-Mark but later recovered. Mr Stephen King, international economist at James Capel in London, believes the Russian events are unlikely to have a long term impact. He recalls that even the surge in the dollar that accompanied President Gorbachev's temporary ousting on August 19, 1991, was short-lived. The US currency was at DM1.75 at the start of that month, peaked at DM1.81 and settled back to DM1.74 by the beginning of September. But he also thinks that, if elections are scheduled to be held in December in Russia, the uncertainty could give the dollar a better tone. 'In that situation, dealers could be more inclined to look at developments that are positive for the dollar, such as declining German interest rates,' he said. Dollar/yen trading was sidelined. The Japanese currency had weakened to around Y107.50 against the dollar on the Russian events, but later appreciated to finish at Y106.45.</p>

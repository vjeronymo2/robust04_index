			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MARQUES JOHNSON, BACK FROM INJURIES, MAKES WARRIOR LINEUP  </P> <P> Golden State Warriors coach Don Nelson has announced that five-time All-Star  forward Marques Johnson, after a two-year layoff, has made the team as a backup  power forward.  </P> <P> "No question he's made the team," Nelson said Wednesday as the Warriors  prepared for tonight's NBA opener at Phoenix.  </P> <P> The 6-7, 33-year-old Johnson suffered a back injury in the 1986-87 season when  he was a Los Angeles Clipper and never returned to the court. Last month he  joined the Warriors in an attempt to make the team.  </P> <P> "Marques turned out to be a terrific pickup for us," Nelson said. "He's been  the veteran type of guy we needed. He's really helped working with the younger  guys, and there's no question he can still play.  </P> <P> "He obviously had to earn a spot on the team, but he's done that, no question,  and I'm very, very proud of him."  </P> <P> Johnson, drafted out of UCLA by Nelson when he was the coach of the Milwaukee  Bucks, will be in the power forward slot with Rod Higgins and, in December, Jim  Peterson.  </P> <P> In discussing his comeback, Johnson said, "It was a hard process, going through  the soreness and the fatigue and not playing at a level where I wanted to be."  </P></p>

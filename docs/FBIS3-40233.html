Scientists around the world are in their final dash to  replace the present TV sets in your home with magic boxes,  called high-definition television (HDTV).    China, with most of its 800 million TV viewers still  watching  black-and-white, also has mapped out an ambitious plan, vowing  to open its first experimental HDTV station by the turn of the  century.    If what scientists predict comes true, this new generation  of  television will eliminate most of the shortcomings of the old  set, including some things you may not have noticed.    As signals processed, transmitted and received are all  digital, the loss of fidelity can be reduced to nothing  theoretically or, at least, to an acceptable level, said Ma  Changhua, technical adviser of the Ministry of Broadcasting,  Film and Television.    The picture tube of HDTV will scan twice the number of lines  current television can provide, so its fidelity can be as high  as 35-millimetre film, said Ma, who is also in charge of the  HDTV research project.    That means, when you stand at a distance of three times the  screen height from the television, the picture is exactly the  same as you can see at the real site, Ma added.    Therefore, the screen can be much larger than current ones.  A  common HDTV screen will be 32-or-36-inches.    It also changes the aspect ratio of the TV screen from the  current 4:3 to 16:9, because a wide screen is much more  comfortable on one's eyes.    As for your ears, the scientists have designed a so-called  ``5.1-channel sound system'' to both comfort and shock viewers.    There are six different multi-directional sound channels.    Using digital technology, the new TV will be able to avoid  most interference in the current television from both  inside--signals in the same and adjacent channels--and  outside--buildings, cars or vacuums.    Furthermore, with some technologies, one's home computer can  also be linked to an HDTV monitor, greatly expanding the  functions of the computer.    As TIME magazine reported, it can become an ``interactive  home information appliance'' linked by fibre optics, made easy  to use by software and driven by powerful computer chips.    The future of the multimedia industry, though not  guaranteed,  means the HDTV system may bring virtual reality into one's  living room.  <H5>  China </H5>   China's science circles are going all out to keep pace with  the developed world on HDTV, which is advancing at a very rapid  rate.    Japan is broadcasting an 8-hour HDTV programme each day  through satellite. The U.S. is expected to open its first  experimental HDTV station in 1996.    It is a must for China to develop HDTV technologies, said He  Zuoxiu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.    ``The so-called HDTV issue is not only a matter of  television, but also related to a wide range of other social  questions,'' He said.    The technologies of digital processing, transmission,  storage  and display can be widely used in publications, medicine, the  military, research, education, visual communication as well as  other cultural and entertainment sectors, said the senior  scientist.    With the great improvement in TV resolution, the movie  industry in the future may not necessarily shoot a ``film'' with  film, but tape, so that the cost can be greatly reduced, He said.    ``China must master these technologies if it does not want  to  always follow others in the high-tech field,'' he said.    He also believes that the huge future HDTV market, both  domestic and international, promises large profits.    An HDTV Strategy Research Group was organized in last April  with authoritative scientists and officials from the State  Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), the Chinese Academy of  Sciences and China's top authorities in radio, film and  television, the electronics industry, and post and  telecommunications and the space industry.    According to the group's plan, now waiting for central  government approval, China will post its HDTV system standards  in 1997.    China so far has only a few computer-simulated HDTV systems  in Ma Changhua's laboratory. These can display strikingly clear  pictures.    China plans to establish a model HDTV system within two  years. Scientists will actively prepare from now on the opening  of the country's first experimental HDTV station around 2000,  while developing its own HDTV industry.    The main task for China's HDTV development includes  developing some key technologies and an industry to produce HDTV  receivers, said Feng Jichun, an official with the State Science  and Technology Commission (SSTC).    ``This is the highest priority,'' he stressed.    China expects to start commercial production of HDTV  receivers by the turn of the century, he said.    The United States plans to stop broadcasting its current  common television in 15 years.    The process of replacing the current television system with  a  high definition one will be 5 to 10 years longer in China than  in the U.S., according to the ``most optimistic prediction'' by  Feng Jichun.    This is such a sophisticated project that it needs the close  co-operation of all concerned government departments, industrial  circles and research institutes, Feng said.  <H5>  Technology </H5>   China is not capable of independently developing all the  technologies related to HDTV, for which Japan, the European  Community and the US have, or plan to, pour billions of dollars,  Feng said.    The key HDTV technologies roughly can be classified as:     -  Professional equipment, including cameras and recording  and broadcasting equipment;    -  16:9 wide-screen monitors and receivers, especially picture  tubes and the chips inside;    -  Source encoding, compression and decoding;    -  Transmission systems;    -  Others.       Some technologies are still in the early research stage by  scientists around the world. And none has so far been mastered  by China.    ``We will be seeking broad international co-operation,''  said  the official.    The technology for the signal encoding, compression and  decoding is one of the key fields the Chinese scientists are  studying, he added.    China has focused sharply on the production of home-use HDTV  receivers for they are comparatively easy to make as well as  highly profitable.    Research on HDTV picture tubes has started in some  electronics companies through co-operation with foreign firms.    Some scientists also have paid great attention to the design  and manufacture of the special chips -- the brain of digital  HDTV.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The EPA requests comment on the appropriate timing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shipbuilding and ship repair facility's applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, and on whether all facilities, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their past emissions or HAP usage, should be eligible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify as area sources under the HAP usage limits. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency also seeks comment on whether a facility that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially determined to be subject to the rule should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able subsequently to escape applicability, and if so, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Affected Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For purposes of this rulemaking, the affected source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be considered the aggregate of all operations at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipbuilding facility. A new operation at a shipbuilding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility would not be considered a new source. Instead, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may qualify as a modification of the existing source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed standards would limit VOHAP emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indoor and outdoor coating operations. The VOHAP emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result largely from solvent evaporation from the coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These emissions occur during application and drying/curing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the size of ships and their components, most coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are applied outdoors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed standards would also reduce VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from handling, transfer, use, and storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOHAP-containing materials through work practice measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These emissions also occur as a result of solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B. Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed standards would be the same for new and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing facilities. (See section VII.B. for discussion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis for the standards.) The proposed standards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose limits on the VOHAP content of 23 types of coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used at shipbuilding facilities. (See section VII.C. for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of the proposed limits.) The limits would be stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of mass of VOHAP per volume of coating less water and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less negligibly photochemically reactive (exempt) compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance with the VOHAP limits must be demonstrated on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed standards would allow for an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of compliance other than using compliant coatings, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed standards would also require that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling and transfer of VOHAP containing materials to and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from containers, tanks, vats, vessels, and piping systems be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in a manner that minimizes spills and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors leading to emissions. In addition, containers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thinning solvent or waste that hold any VOHAP must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally closed (to minimize evaporation) unless materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are being added to or removed from them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Compliance Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule would require compliance for existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources within 1 year after the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule. An existing unaffected area source that increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its HAP emissions (or potential to emit) such that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes a major source would be required to comply within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 year after becoming a major source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Any new or reconstructed sources would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adhere to the compliance schedule in the General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;63.6(b) of subpart A without any modification. For new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or reconstructed affected sources whose startup date is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the effective date of the rule, the compliance date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the effective date of the rule. For new or reconstructed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources whose startup date is after the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the rule, the compliance date is the startup date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new unaffected area source that increases its emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or potential to emit) such that it becomes a major source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to comply immediately upon becoming a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> D. Compliance Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule would allow affected sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose among five options for demonstrating compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VOHAP standards. Their choice will be influenced by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perceived need to add ``thinning'' solvent (thinner) to alter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the viscosity of the coating in order to spray effectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (For the purposes of this proposed regulation, thinner is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as any liquid material added to a coating.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the option(s) chosen, affected sources would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first be required to determine the coating category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., general use, air flask, antenna, etc.), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable VOHAP limit, and the VOC content for each batch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of coating received from the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

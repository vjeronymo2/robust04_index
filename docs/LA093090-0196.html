Southwest College 12 -- Southwest had two scoring  opportunities in the second half, but fell victim to dropped passes, poor line  play and penalties in a Western State Conference game.  </P> <P> "We had our opportunities to win this football game," Southwest Coach Henry  Washington said.

Both of the scoring passes were  to Robert Avery, who had three receptions for 74 yards. HEATHER HAFNER  </P></p>

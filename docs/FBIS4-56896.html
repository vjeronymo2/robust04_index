			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>   [Text] While the majority of Cubans seek the most suitable  way to increase productivity and efficiency, and while the  government seeks to reorganize the country's financial system, a  small number of people aim to enrich themselves at the expense  of the material needs of the people. During times of crisis,  the government is obliged to protect the fair distribution of  material goods. Some citizens, however, illegally procure goods  and raw materials from state-owned stores and later sell them on  the black market at astronomical prices.    As a result of theft, speculation, shady deals, and other  practices common in an underground economy, a limited number of  citizens have accumulated wealth and goods, which they have even  ostentatiously displayed to most of their countrymen who, today,  are forced to live in austerity. Other people, who also shun  honest work, buy or make articles that they later sell to people  at high prices, taking advantage of the needs of those suffering  the effects of the economic crisis caused by external forces.    This small group of citizens is rejected by most Cubans, who  by making great sacrifices resist the attacks of the U.S.  blockade and the devastating effects of the loss of the  country's trading partners who belonged to the vanished  socialist camp.    At the 80,000 assemblies convoked by the unions early in the  year, more than 3 million workers demanded that the state adopt  strong measures to confiscate the goods and incomes of persons  who enrich themselves illegally. During the recently concluded  special session of the Cuban parliament, the deputies echoed the  peoples' categorical rejection of the unscrupulous activities of  those who unlawfully amass fortunes at the expense of the needs  of the majority of Cubans.    Because it is a national necessity and is of social interest  and to the benefit of the public, the National Assembly of the  People's Government entrusted the Council of State and the  government with adopting measures, including extraordinary  measures upheld by the Constitution, to eradicate the  aforementioned aberrations.    This week, Decree-Law No. 149, which involves the  confiscation of goods and income obtained through illegal  enrichment and supports energetic actions by the authorities,  was disclosed.    As it did at the beginning of the Revolution, the Cuban  State  is acting against a minority of citizens who have hoarded goods  and money illegally, in brazen and demoralizing defiance of the  principles of social justice that prevail in the country.</p>

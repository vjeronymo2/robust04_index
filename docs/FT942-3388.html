			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Consumers' Association staff start pay strike About a fifth of the workforce of the Consumers' Association, the publisher of Which? and several other magazines, started a three-day strike yesterday, Lisa Wood writes. 'Pay is the central issue, but morale at the CA has been low for some time,' said MSF, the science and technical union which along with the National Union of Journalists represents about 160 of the organisation's 500 staff. The unions had submitted a claim for a rise in basic wage rates of 5.4 per cent. About 300 employees accepted a 2.5 per cent offer while talks with the unions broke down in May. MSF said: 'There has been a recent history of redundancies, restructuring and abandoning of costly projects that had shaken staff's confidence in management. 'The ballot for industrial action produced a vote that was 80 per cent in favour of a strike.' The CA said that publication of its magazines would not be disrupted by the action.</p>

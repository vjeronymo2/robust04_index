			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (2): Gap between leaders and led - Domestic Politics MR Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, elected leader of the Social Democratic Party last April after a leadership contest, has succeeded in irritating his political adversaries by calling for a public debate on the subject of political and business ethics. The 48-year-old party leader's point in playing the the ethical card is that he thinks there is a crisis of confidence in relationships between the politicians and the voters and that an emphasis on morality is necessary to restore a relationship of trust and understanding between the two. As leader of the Social Democratic Party he has a particular problem, because voting in the referendum on the Maastricht treaty in June demonstrated a particularly wide gap between the party leadership, which campaigned for a Yes, and the party's supporters, of whom at least 60 per cent voted No. He has somehow to establish a new sense of understanding between the party and its supporters. The electorate's rejection of the Maastricht treaty, after the Folketing had approved it by 130 votes to 25, is only one aspect of a gap between leaders and led, however, and it goes beyond politics. The colossal losses sustained by the financial sector and the summary dismissal of some of the best-known names in the local financial world - Mr Per Villum, Hansen Hafnia's chief executive officer, in April, and Mr Steen Rasborg, Unibank's chief, in August, to name only two - has started a debate on the ethics of the business world. Many people, Mr Rasmussen among them, are offended by the fact that managers who have lost large sums of shareholders' money have received substantial (by Danish standards) 'golden handshakes.' Mr Rasmussen has given a party-political edge to the ethical debate, painting the Conservative-Liberal coalition government as being, morally speaking, slightly frayed around the edges after 10 consecutive years in office. The charge relates more especially to an affair known as the Tamil scandal, a running sore on the body politic which may lead to the collapse of the government this winter. The Tamil scandal began in 1987 when the then minister of justice, who has since resigned, ordered postponement of permission for the relatives in Sri Lanka of Tamil refugees in Denmark to join their families in Denmark. This infringed the legal right, under Danish law, of the Tamil refugees to bring their close relatives to Denmark. Ministry of Justice civil servants connived at the minister's act of maladministration, which has caused a collapse of political confidence in the ministry. In the spring of 1989, Mr Poul Schluter, the Conservative Party leader who celebrated his 10th anniversary as his country's leader on September 10, made a report to the Folketing on the Tamil issue in which he assured the Folketing that 'nothing has been swept under the carpet.' For more than a year a judicial inquiry led by a High Court judge has taken evidence to establish whether there is a case for impeaching any of the implicated ministers. It is expected that the report will be published late this autumn, but no date has been set yet. The issue in Mr Schluter's case is what he knew and when he knew it, and did he, in order to protect the reputation of his minister of justice, mislead the Folketing in his 'carpet' speech. If the report criticises the prime minister, who, say colleagues, is absolutely convinced that he acted in good faith all along, there is little doubt that the small centre parties - the Radical Liberals, Centre Democrats and the Christian People's Party - will pull the carpet out from under him. 'In other times, criticism might not have been taken so seriously, but the ethical climate caused by the crisis of confidence between people and politicians will affect the outcome of the Tamil case,' predicted Mr Herbert Pundik, editor-in-chief of the respected Copenhagen daily newspaper Politiken. If the Tamil scandal does not help Mr Rasmussen into office - and Mr Schluter has made it clear that he will not go without calling an election - Mr Rasmussen's way to power may not be easy. In his 10 years in office, Mr Schluter has always headed minority governments and often - on more than 100 occasions - had to accept defeats in the Folketing. But he has remained in office because there has not so far been a majority in favour of a Social Democratic government. Mr Schluter's governments have put the economy back on an even keel, which is in itself a considerable achievement, but when it comes to such Conservative and Liberal dreams as lowering taxes, actually reducing public expenditure (as opposed to slowing the rise) and weaning the individual from reliance on the welfare state, little has been achieved. This, however, seems to be the way in which the agenda for the 1990s is shaping up, and it is an agenda which Mr Rasmussen's Social Democrats may have to accept if they want to return to power. It is significant that the Radical Liberal Party, which holds the swing vote between left and right in the Folketing, shares this general attitude. 'Danes with a problem automatically assume that the commune (local council) will solve it. They can't stand on their own legs any more. This has got to change,' said Mrs Marianne Jelved, Radical leader. Some of Mrs Jelved's requirements for the 1990s include making the labour market, instead of the state, finance the unemployment benefit system; halting cash welfare benefits to under-25s; an end to subsidies to almost everyone through the housing system; and reductions in income taxes. 'We have got to loosen up the over-gearing of the welfare state. If the Social Democrats won't do so, they can forget about being the next government,' said Mrs Jelved. The Social Democrats cannot form a government without Radical support - and unfortunately for Mr Rasmussen, the other party whose support he needs, the left-wing Socialist People's Party, is not sympathetic to Mrs Jelved's brand of liberal reform. In government, Mr Rasmussen would go for 'a controlled loosening' of fiscal policy in order to increase domestic demand and create more jobs, but he aims to maintain the present government's low-inflation policy and will stick to the fixed exchange through membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, he says. Lower taxes are not on his agenda, which seems very much like a traditional Social Democratic programme with heavy reliance on large public spending programmes. Among highlights of his party's programme are substantial new spending on infrastructure investment in roads, railways and ports; subsidies for urban renewal programmes; and ambitious programmes to provide job opportunities through job rotation and activating the unemployed by providing places in training and educational courses.</p>

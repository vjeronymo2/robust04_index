			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Heseltine undermines travel industry rules NEW REGULATIONS for the package travel industry were in disarray yesterday after it emerged that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had told an Oxford-based holiday company it did not have to protect customers' money because it allowed them to specify what ferry service they wished to use. The company, SFV Holidays which went into liquidation last Friday, had taken 800 bookings for French self-catering accommodation this summer. The company is unbonded. Mr John Cullom, managing director, said yesterday he hoped to announce early next week that the company had been sold and that customers' holidays were safe. He said SVF had believed that, under a European Community directive, it was obliged to ensure that travellers' deposits and payments could be returned. He said Mr Heseltine's view - set out in two letters to Mr John Patten, the education secretary and MP for Oxford - that the company did not have to comply 'surprised us enormously'. Mr Stephen Hickman, acting head of the consumer section of the Oxfordshire Trading Standards department, said trading standards officers had told the company that if it sold ferry crossings as well as holidays it had to comply with the regulations. Mr Cullom said 95 per cent of its customers bought travel and accommodation. The EC directive applies if a company provides a pre-arranged combination of accommodation and transport at an inclusive price. Companies can arrange a bond through an organisation such as the Association of British Travel Agents or the Association of Independent Tour Operators, take out an insurance policy, or hold customer deposits in separate accounts. SFV's application to join Aito was rejected last October. Aito said yesterday the company 'did not have the right profile'. It is believed Aito had come across several complaints about SFV. SFV wrote to Mr Patten in January and March last year saying it was having difficulty complying with the regulations as it had been refused Aito membership and could not get quotations from insurance companies. In letters dated January 18 and May 5 Mr Heseltine said the company did not need to comply with the regulations. 'This is because the customer is required himself to specify what ferry service he wishes to use, without advice or assistance from the company selling the holiday.' Mr Noel Josephides, Aito chairman, said if Mr Heseltine's argument were accepted, 'most of our members wouldn't require bonding'. He said virtually every company selling French holidays allowed customers to choose the ferry crossing they wanted. Abta said Mr Heseltine's advice would create a 'huge problem' for consumers. 'The DTI has been telling consumers that they're protected, but there's nobody there to enforce that. We've said all along that it's only a matter of time before a tour operator collapses and people lose their holidays,' it said.</p>

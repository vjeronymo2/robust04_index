			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV warns of fall into loss YORKSHIRE-Tyne Tees Television, the big ITV contractor, warned yesterday that it was likely to report a loss for the year to September 30. The formal announcement, which led to a 4p drop in the share price to 172p, confirmed persistent rumours that the advertising revenue for the year would be lower than previously expected. It is clear that Yorkshire's airtime has been sold in a way that tries to pull forward revenue into the 1992-93 financial year by offering discounts. At a board meeting on Tuesday it was decided that as much as Pounds 8.5m in revenue should not be counted towards the 1992-93 revenues. At the same time its share of total ITV advertising revenue has dropped from 11.2 per cent to about 10.3 per cent. The target had been to boost it above 12 per cent, but this was always seen as very ambitious. The pressure on Yorkshire has been on since the beginning of the year when the combined group started paying its bid price of Pounds 53.3m a year to the Treasury. Ms Katherine Pelly, television analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson who issued a 'sell' notice on Yorkshire on October 19, called yesterday for managerial changes at the top and said it would be 'impossible' for the company to pay a final dividend. There was no immediate sign yesterday that Mr Clive Leach, chairman and chief executive, planned to step down but there was still uncertainty over his long-term position. The formal statement from Yorkshire, where Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a significant stake, said that the lower than expected advertising revenue and exceptional costs relating to previously announced closures 'is likely to result in the group reporting a loss' for the year. Some City estimates of the loss head towards Pounds 20m although it is likely that Yorkshire has made a good trading profit and that pre-tax losses are unlikely to be higher than Pounds 5m. The pressure to disclose the shortfall in advertising revenue flowed from the replacement of the Yorkshire advertising sales house, Media and Airtime Sales, with Laser, which took over formally on October 1. Laser is a wholly owned subsidiary of London Weekend Television which earlier this year bought a stake in Yorkshire. It is believed that Mr Greg Dyke, the LWT chief executive and a Yorkshire director refused to accept the additional revenue for the 1992-93 accounts. The Yorkshire admission raises serious questions about how television advertising is sold in the UK and how the price is set. Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the advertising sales house representing Central, Anglia and Ulster, said of Yorkshire's announcement: 'This is horrific news in terms of the credibility of ITV as a whole. We are absolutely not in this position regarding any of our companies.'</p>

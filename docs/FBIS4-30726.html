			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodia's current account shortfall for 1993 is  estimated to stand at U.S. $124.1 million, an increase of U.S.  $29.7 million from the previous year's deficit.    According to the National Bank of Cambodia's [NBC's]  Economic  and Statistics Review for March, the breakdown of the deficit  balances are U.S. $195.7 million for goods, U.S. $36.1 million  for services and U.S. $42.6 million for the income account.    The trade deficit in 1993 marked an increase of U.S. $16.8  million over the 1992 deficit, attributable to an 8 per cent  increase in imports offset by a 7 per cent increase in exports.    Imports were estimated at U.S. $479.3 million while exports  stood at U.S. $283.6 million for 1993. Sixty four per cent of  all exports were reported to be re-exports of imported goods to  countries in the region while timber exports accounted for 29.8  per cent of total exports and rubber for 5 per cent.    It is clear that Cambodia would benefit from preferential  trading status with the U.S., which has yet to be granted. This  would attract companies from the region to set up their  labour-intensive operations here to take advantage of  concessions not normally available in their own country.    For example some observers suggest that Thai textile firms  might set up manufacturing operations here.    Currently, cloth and textiles amount to 16.3 per cent of  total imports, thus adding to the burden of the trade deficit,  which has to be improved, as increased exports of goods are a  valuable source of much needed hard currency.    The Cambodia Investment Board, the operating arm of the  dormant Cambodia Development Council, has identified increase of  exports as the primary "objectives of national and economic  importance."    The Cambodian Tobacco Company, to cite an example of a local  firm, exports its products to South Vietnam, but cannot compete  with the larger and more established foreign tobacco companies  operating in the region, which are propped up by huge  advertising budgets.    Imported cigarettes amounted to 13.5 per cent of total  imports, according to NBC estimates. Foreign tobacco companies  use offshore media services to market their products, although a  joint venture between a Cambodian media company and Singaporean  media consultancy firm will fork out some of the profits to the  resident owners of the service.    Net travel services was put at U.S. $44.3 million, a  decrease  of 11 per cent from the previous year -- a result of the  reduction in tourist arrivals for the first half of 1993 --  according to the NBC report.    Construction materials chalked up 5.7 per cent of total  imports of goods.    In the services sector, the deficit was largely a result of  imported construction services, standing at U.S. $57.3 million.    According to the NBC report, this was "principally payments  for infrastructure repairs carried out by non-resident  contractors.    A net surplus in current transfers helped offset the total  deficit balance. The NBC estimates that the net surplus stands  at U.S. $150.2 million, although it cautions that the figures  are "estimates and that the accuracy and completeness of the  information on which they are based is very variable."    Furthermore, for statistical purposes, all payments made to  non-residents by donor agencies are considered as having first  being paid to the government, which then on paper, disburses  this to non-residents. Such an arrangement places all  non-residents working with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations]  and other international organisations as government employees.    These payments, mobilised as funds for the government in the  first place, are included in the category of current transfers.    The economy is still highly leveraged by transactions  "reflecting international aid donations to the Government of  Cambodia in the form of goods, short-term technical assistance  and project aid" as well as capital project aid, under a  separate account, which when combined with current transfers,  amounts to U.S. $325.7 millions for 1993.</p>

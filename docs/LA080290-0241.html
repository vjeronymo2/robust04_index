			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN MAINTAINS TRADE SHELTERS DESPITE SURPLUSES, GATT SAYS  </P> <P> Japan, despite running huge annual trade surpluses, still shelters a wide range  of farm products and some industrial goods from foreign competition, the world  commerce watchdog GATT said today.  </P> <P> While Tokyo has made tangible progress in opening its markets in recent years,  a hard core of high protection remains, a review of Japanese trade policies by  the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said.  </P> <P> Rice is the most deep-rooted example among farm products, with imports  virtually banned to keep the country self-sufficient in this staple, the report  said.  </P> <P> Tariff duties on sugar, beverages, liquor and dairy products were higher than  the average rate of 12.1% for agricultural imports, and some dairy and fish  products were subject to import quotas.  </P> <P> Although industrial tariffs were generally low, averaging 5.3% in 1989, many  goods of particular export interest to developing countries faced duties as  high as 60%.  </P></p>

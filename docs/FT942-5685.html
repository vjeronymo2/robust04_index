			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Risk-capital list launched A national database designed to bring together private investors or business angels - and unlisted companies requiring risk capital was launched in London yesterday. Enterprise Adventure, the private company which is launching Venturelist, will join a number of other UK introduction services trying to marry investors and companies. Similar agencies have attempted to launch national databases before, but Venturelist is the first attempt to provide the service electronically, allowing angels to access the system through a personal computer. Inclusion on Venturelist will be free until 500 angels and 250 businesses have been included on the system. Mr Paul Coleman, Enterprise Adventure's managing director, hopes to have 2,000 angels - from a potential population of 50,000 informal investors it says exist in the UK - and 1,000 companies on the system within a year. The success of the venture will depend on whether it can attract enough private investors to use the database as a marketplace for information, observers say. Almost none of the other UK introduction services have survived without some form of subsidy. Enterprise Adventure hopes to get intermediaries such as accounting firms, Business Link organisations, and local training and development bodies to provide lists of companies seeking funds and angels prepared to invest. These so-called champions will be charged Pounds 1,000 and the investors will also pay a fee for logging on. Individual investors who want access to the database will be charged Pounds 500 a year. Entrepreneurs seeking equity will pay a Pounds 250 fee for an assessment by consultants who will 'rigorously vet' the quality of the information companies supply. Companies will also pay Pounds 50 to be included on the database.</p>

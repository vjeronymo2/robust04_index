			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KITCHEN CABINET: OIL-FREE NON-STICK PANS MAY BE STICKING AROUND  </P> <P> We may be stuck with non-stick cookware forever, now that health-conscious  individuals are finding low-cholesterol, low-calorie benefits in no-oil food  preparation.  </P> <P> However, the biggest disappointment with ordinary non-stick cookware is that  the marriage of the coating to the pan is far from a long-lasting bond.  </P> <P> Peter Liu, marketing director for Le Cook's-Ware, Inc. in San Francisco, blames  the short-lived performance to "the everyday abrasion of cooking utensils that  wears out the non-stick coating."  </P> <P> Enter Anolon cookware from Le Cook's-Ware, introduced for the first time  worldwide last week in Los Angeles. This black cookware with a tempered glass  lid combines the world's toughest cookware surface, called hard-anodized (which  is twice as hard as stainless steel), with Du Pont's SilverStone Supra, one of  the most durable non-stick coatings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sauteing Without Oil  </P> <P> Anolon is amazing. Touch its super-smooth interior surface and you can guess  what's in store for you. Testing the little 7-inch skillet ($19.99) with no  oil, I toasted cheese to "death" until it was crusty and browned and cooked a  whole egg until it was picture-perfect. In the 11-inch stir-fry pan ($59.99), I  sauteed (remember, no oil) Oriental egg noodles and shrimp, made fried rice,  and browned julienned chicken breast, beef and pork. And I didn't forget fish  either, another problem food. Nothing stuck to the pan. The surface was smooth  and cooked evenly all the way through with no spatters. Cleaning was a cinch,  of course.  </P> <P> How long will this non-sticking last? Gary Wright, L.A. regional sales manager  for Le Cook's-Ware said: "We've run some aging cycle tests with the skillet --  50,000 cycles, which is equivalent to 35 years of use -- and we ended up with  just a few pan scratches. We also used a metal spatula and put the pan in the  dishwasher."  </P> <P> To achieve good heat conduction and retention, aluminum is used in Anolon. When  questioned about public concern in using aluminum, Liu explained: "The tempered  anodizing process changes the molecular structure of the pan's surface into an  electrochemically hardened surface that keeps the food from interacting with  the aluminum core. It becomes a double protection with the SilverStone Supra (a  three-coat system that is forced into the anodized cavities of the metal)."  </P> <P> Forthcoming in the Anolon line is a good-size oval fish pan that's perfect for  whole fish. I like the stir-fry pan, which is almost as deep as a wok but  offers an excellent weight. There is a seven-piece set ($219), which makes a  nice starter collection and is appropriate for a bridal gift. This includes a 1  1/2-quart milk pan with lips, 10-inch open fry pan, an 8 1/2-inch open French  skillet, a 2-quart covered saucepan and a 6-quart covered stockpot.  </P> <P> Another item that isn't showing signs of being phased out of the kitchen is the  slow cooker or Crock-Pot. It's surprising how many people still swear by this  seemingly old-fashioned electric cooking unit for a no-fuss meal.  </P> <P> In the actual sense, as Rival Manufacturing Co. says, it's "slow cooking for  fast times." Working parents can start the cooker in the morning by putting in,  for instance, a pot roast, and coming home to a moist and tender meat entree.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Latest Entry  </P> <P> Brand new in the market, Rival Crock-Pot with Corning Ware ($58.95) is quickly  gaining consumer approval not just for its pretty looks but for its  versatility. This slow cooker includes a 3-quart Corning Ware casserole insert  that can be used for table or buffet serving, for refrigerator or freezer  storage as well as for microwave reheating or cooking.  </P> <P> Available are two designs, featuring the popular Shadow Iris with purplish-blue  irises and green leaves, and the Country Cornflower with blue and red blossoms  in beribboned yellow basket. The concept uses the same low-watt "blanket of  heat" as the original crock pot to produce even cooking. If desired, the meat  can be browned in the Corning Ware on the stove top or in the microwave before  placing in the cooker.  </P> <P> Sid Korob, direct sales manager for Rival in Los Angeles, said: "It's historic.  This is the first time that Corning Ware has ventured with another company." He  added that "the possibilities to the consumer are unlimited, and if they  already have the 3-quart Corning piece, they could use it as an extra pot for  the cooker."  </P> <P>  The Anolon Anodized Non-Stick Cookware is exclusively available at Bullock's.  </P> <P>  The Rival Crock-Pot with Corning Ware is available at May Co., Broadway, Fedco  and most stores carrying Rival products.  </P></p>

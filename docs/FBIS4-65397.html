			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  foreign ministers gave their formal and unanimous endorsement  here Monday [16 May] to a new U.S.-Russian-EU effort to end the  two-year war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The decision followed an agreement in Geneva on Saturday  between the United States, Russia and five EU countries --  France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Greece -- to push for a  four-month ceasefire and new negotiations.    "We all believe it will be a reasonable basis for ending the  war," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said.    Meanwhile, EU mediator Lord Owen and his UN counterpart,  Thorvald Stoltenberg, left Geneva for Belgrade for discussions  with Serb leaders.    And diplomats said the contact group for Bosnia --  comprising  Americans, Russians, Germans, French and Britons -- would meet  in Washington for two days this week to prepare for negotiations  to implement the Geneva initiative.    Both Moslem and Serb leaders in Bosnia gave a chilly initial  reception to the initiative, which would give a proposed  Moslem-Croat federation 51 percent of Bosnia, and the Serbs 49  percent, down from the 70 percent they currently hold.    The Moslems and Croats are claiming this is not enough. They  want 58 percent, on the grounds that together the two groups  make up 61 percent of the population. However, the Serbs want  to be left with more than 49 percent.    But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that the Geneva  initiative was the only realistic solution to the Bosnian  conflict and that the EU had a duty to keep pressing the  combatants towards a negotiated settlement.    "If there is an accord, and if the Bosnian Serbs make the  necessary territorial concessions, the EU is disposed to phasing  out economic sanctions against Serbia," the French minister said.    Hurd added: "If there is an agreement, there will have to be  a substantial Serb withdrawal" from areas it has captured in  Bosnia.    Special Russian envoy on ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly Churkhin said  in Belgrade that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was ready  for a ceasefire.    The Geneva initiative offers little that is new in  comparison  with an accord between the warring parties negotiated in  November 1993, which subsequently fell apart.    But diplomats here reported intense relief among EU leaders  that the United States and Russia had this time accepted the  principle of a 51-49 percent division of Bosnia.    The EU foreign ministers also agreed on 32 million ECU (37  million dollar) in aid this year to finance the temporary  administration of the southern Bosnian city of Mostar.    Fighting between Croats and Moslems there has eased off over  the past two months as the two sides negotiated a Moslem-Croat  federation in Bosnia, brokered by the United States.    The EU-appointed administrator of Mostar, former Bremen  mayor  Hans Koschnik, said he hoped to leave for the town next month  with a team of up to 40 people.    Their mission, Koschnik said, was to help Mostar residents  organise themselves to overcome the effects of the Bosnian civil  war.    Asked about their chances of success, he told journalists:  "It is still a better answer than letting people kill each  other."    But Koschnik warned that a "cold war" situation of mistrust  still existed between the Croats and Moslems of Mostar.</p>

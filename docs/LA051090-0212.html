			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MAGNOLIA BOUNCES BREA TO STAY IN RACE  </P> <P> The race for the Orange League baseball championship remained unsettled  Wednesday because Magnolia upset Brea-Olinda, 7-2, by capitalizing on four  errors.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda (16-7-1, 10-3-1 in league) appeared to be headed toward a  title-clinching victory. The Wildcats had a 2-0 lead after three innings and  starter Pat Simec (3-4) had retired the first nine batters he faced.  </P> <P> But Magnolia (12-9, 10-4) scored five runs on four hits and three errors in the  fourth inning to take a 5-2 lead and win its fifth consecutive game.  </P> <P> Pitcher Chad Phillips (6-1) allowed an unearned run in the first inning and a  bases-empty home run by Brea's John Toro in the third. But the right-hander  retired the last 15 batters he faced, striking out seven and allowing three  hits.  </P> <P> Magnolia, which still has a slim chance to win the title, concludes its season  Friday against Anaheim. Brea concludes its season against Valencia, a team it  has beaten twice this season.  </P> <P> "It (winning the league) is still in our hands," said Steve Hiskey, Brea's  coach. "Obviously, we would have liked to have taken care of it today. We made  some mistakes and they got going. We gave them too many free bases."  </P> <P> Kevin Schlect had the big hit for Magnolia in the fourth inning, a two-run  double that Brea outfielder Mike Ryan had trouble fielding. Magnolia added an  unearned run in the fifth.  </P> <P> "I thought we were a little overanxious at the start, but we settled down and  showed we're a good hitting team," said John Sharp, Magnolia's first-year  coach. "I told the kids before the game that they're as good as they want to  be.  </P> <P> "I still think we can win the league title, but we're going to need some help  from Valencia on Friday. Either way, we're in the playoffs."  </P> <P> In another Orange League game:  </P> <P> Anaheim 4, Savanna 0 -- Sammy Serna had a hit, an RBI and scored a run and  Robert Fernandez (3-7) pitched his second shutout, a three-hitter, with six  strikeouts and two walks to lead host Anaheim (14-9-1, 8-5-1).  </P> <P> In Angelus League baseball:  </P> <P> Bishop Amat 5, Servite 3 -- Visiting Servite (16-9, 5-6) scored its three runs  in the first inning with Ed Crippen and Chad Rolish hitting RBI singles.  </P> <P> In Empire League baseball:  </P> <P> Cypress 5, Loara 0 -- Ray Bridges (2-5) pitched a two-hitter, striking three  and walking one to lead host Cypress (5-20, 2-12).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY  [RENMIN RIBAO], China's leading national newspaper, carries a  commentary today marking the seventh anniversary of the signing  of the joint declaration on the question of Macao between China  and Portugal.    The occasion coincides with the current visit to China by  Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who signed the  document in 1987.    The commentary describes the joint declaration as a  historical document of great significance. "It has set a good  example for solutions to historical problems between countries,"  it explains.    The signing of the pact boosted Sino-Portuguese relations to  a new stage, it says.    In March 1993 the Basic Law of the Macao Special  Administrative Zone of the People's Republic of China was passed  at the first session of the Eighth National People's Congress  (NPC).    As the fundamental law of Macao, the commentary continues,  the Basic Law puts forward the basic principles of the Chinese  Government in the joint declaration into a legal form with  concrete regulations on the basic systems of society, politics,  economy and culture in Macao.    The law has won wide support from the Macao people, it says.    In the seven years since the signing, the friendly relations  and co-operation between China and Portugal have made smooth  progress.    Exchanges of visits between high-ranking leaders of the two  countries have pushed forward the bilateral relations and  promoted friendly cooperation on Macao issue between the two  countries.    It says the two countries have abided by and faithfully  implemented the declaration and conducted effective co-operation  on the issue.    The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group have held 19 plenary  meetings and a number of experts' conferences on the issue.    The two countries have achieved progress in solving problems  in the transition period such as those concerning language, the  civil service and Macao joining international organizations.    They have succeeded in solving problems concerning funds and  aviation in the construction of the Macao International Airport.    The commentary says the completion of major construction  projects in recent years has injected new energy into the  economic development of Macao.    It noted that the sincerity and friendly co-operation  between  the two countries in implementation of the joint declaration is  the guarantee of Macao's stability and development.    It is in the common interest of the two countries to  implement the joint declaration and realize the stable  transition and smooth return of Macao to Chinese sovereignty in  1999, the commentary notes.    Experience has proved that co-operation is not only  beneficial to both China and Portugal but also to Macao, the  commentary says.    It notes that as long as the two countries take the whole  situation into account, persist in close consultation and  strengthen co-operation, any problem arising during the  transition can be solved, so as to create conducive conditions  for the stable transition and smooth return of Macao's  sovereignty to China.</p>

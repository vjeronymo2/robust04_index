			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Karcher Ordered to Stand Trial: Hamburger baron Carl N. Karcher has been  ordered to stand trial June 6 on charges of insider trading, but lawyers  indicated a settlement still might be reached. The trial date was set by U.S.  District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles after Karcher's lawyers were  unable to win a guarantee from the Justice Department that Karcher, founder of  the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, would not be the target of a future criminal  prosecution.  </P></p>

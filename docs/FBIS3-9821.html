			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 29 March (TANJUG) -- Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic today received special Libyan  envoy 'Ali 'Abd-al-Salam al-Turyaki, who handed him a message  from Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    Their talks focused on the further improvement of the  already  successful and friendly cooperation between the two countries,  both in the bilateral and international fields. They paid  particular attention to some aspects of economic cooperation.    Speaking about the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, President  Lilic  expressed the hope that we are not far from peace, which he said  was a condition for stability in the entire region. President  Lilic stressed that the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] has  nothing against the Muslim-Croat federation, provided that it is  not to the detriment of the Serb side; he also said there would  be neither a solution nor peace in this former Yugoslav republic  without an equitable agreement reached between all three sides  and the observance of the right of each of the nations to  self-determination.    As regards the FRY, it will continue to strive in a  persistent, active, and constructive way toward reaching a  permanent and just resolution of the crisis on the territory of  former Yugoslavia, as it has done since the very outset of the  crisis, President Lilic concluded.</p>

Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu attended and  delivered a speech in which he emphatically stated: Under the  new circumstances, we should build the party in accordance with  the party's basic line and political line as well. Party  organization work should submit to and serve the party's basic  line and political line. This year, China's deep-going reform  is expected to enter a crucial stage marked with comprehensive  progress and earthshaking breakthroughs. At the moment, the  party is undergoing another major strategic transformation since  the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  namely, a shift from a planned economic structure to a socialist  market economic structure, this being a significant change  foretelling a new round of national rejuvenation and development.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: Under the current circumstances  and at such an important historical juncture, we should make  redoubled efforts to step up party building, this being the key  to all our work. The party's work should closely focus on such  key aspects as emancipating the mind, grasping each and every  opportunity, furthering in-depth reform, pushing forward  development, and maintaining stability. Party building work  should first and foremost submit to and serve these key work  aspects. Insofar as guiding ideology is concerned, we should  shift the focus of party organization work from cadre management  to overall party building. Insofar as work style and methods are  concerned, we should shift the focus of the party organization  work from such routine matters as selecting, promoting,  appointing, and removing from office cadres to overall party  building. To this end, we should concentrate on resolving all  major contradictions and strive for tangible results in party  organization work.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu maintained: We should strive to  accomplish the following three major party building tasks over  the next two years:    1. To attach primary importance to the party's ideological  and theory building;    2. To arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics;    3. To step up leading organ building at all levels with an  eye to making them capable of emancipating the mind, seeking  truth from facts, persisting in reform and opening up,  conducting fruitful work, opening up new vistas for overall  party work, adhering to democratic centralism and the party  spirit, broadening people's horizons, being broad-minded,  uniting the broad masses of people, fighting battles,  maintaining close ties with the broad masses of people,  conducting in-depth investigations and study, adopting a strong  sense of the masses, conducting work in a down-to-earth manner,  showing concern for the overall interests, making selfless  contributions, submitting to and serving the party's overall  interests, as well as persistently and whole-heartedly serving  the people.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu asserted: In building leading party  organs at all levels across the province, we should closely  follow the above mentioned criteria and requirements, make  persistent efforts, and strive to achieve tangible results. In  order to improve party style, Pu Chaozhu added, it is imperative  to persistently further the on-going anti-corruption struggle  while building socialism with Chinese characteristics at the  same time. It is also imperative to reinforce and successfully  build grass-roots party organizations with forceful measures.</p>

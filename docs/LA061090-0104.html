			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PAPER GUY TO CALL HER OWN;  </P> <P> REACHING TIN RIVER BY THEA ASTLEY (G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $18.95; 224 PP.;  0-399-13532-4)  </P> <P> There is no landscape like the landscape of childhood, terrain at once vivid  and terrifyingly vague. Thea Astley understands this well, how the sounds of  teacups being refilled, a grandfather's mumbled comments, or the smell of a  handful of gum leaves remain fixed in the brain years later as if they were the  most important moments in one's life, the strongest memory of love.  </P> <P> At first, "Reaching Tin River" seems as if it's going to be a novel about this  -- a childhood in the magical kingdom of Queensland, North Australia. Not that  life is idyllic there on the burnt, raw land. "I want love," her small heroine,  Belle, sobs, and we think it's because she's been uprooted from her beloved  home and sent to a boarding school; also because she's a fatherless child,  reared by aging grandparents, a daffy drum-banging mother and a piano-playing  aunt who form an all-women's band, a duo "welded into a partnership stronger  than marriage, a kind of twinhood sanctified and integrated by cornball  rhythms," much more concerned with thumping out "sugar-candy tunes" than  attending to a small girl's needs.  </P> <P> The novel ends up being about a much different thing, however, namely the adult  Belle's obsessive search for a "center," a quest that causes her to go off the  emotional deep end and adopt a "paper lover," a figure out of history named  Gaden Lockyer whose face she first discovers in the archives of a library where  she works. Yet the childhood that failed little Belle out on Perjury Plains  (the telling name of the family property) in the final analysis seems immutably  connected to her fractured, distressed adulthood. For one thing, she never  stops looking for love.  </P> <P> Thea Astley -- three-time winner of the Miles Franklin Award, Australia's  highest literary honor, and author of 10 previous novels and a collection of  short stories -- is a most original writer whose sentences seem charged with  incendiary power and whose insight into social mores -- especially the  relations between men and women -- have a dead-on rightness. Reading her last  book to appear here, "Two by Astley," a volume containing two novellas  originally published in Australia in the 1970s, one couldn't help being deeply  impressed by the energy and intelligence of her writing. The first novella: "A  Kindness Cup," the story of an aboriginal massacre and its effect years later  on the inhabitants of a small town, seemed the better work, though it was in  "The Acolyte" that Astley's social wit and her pyrotechnic flare for language  was most evident.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, neither talent -- not the story-telling ability nor the  beautifully charged language -- is employed with the same success in "Reaching  Tin River." The novel feels hurried, as if written in a rush. Its tone is  rather conversational.  </P> <P> Not that Astley is capable of writing badly. The wit, the unerring social  observations, still come through, and the novel has wonderful vignettes -- a  girl in a bathing suit tantalizing an older man; a mother weaving "red setter"  place mats out of her dog's hair. But the well-crafted plot of "A Kindness  Cup," the controlled character revelations found in "The Acolyte" -- these have  been scrapped for a breezier, faster sort of book about the obsessional Belle,  a character who at the book's end has gone to extremes that don't make sense.  </P> <P> Belle's American serviceman father, Huck, knew her mother, Bonnie, only long  enough to conceive a child and take her off to San Diego for a few months  before Bonnie packed up and headed back to Queensland, though why the marriage  didn't work is never clear. The legacy of the brief union is Belle. When Belle  marries a fellow librarian named Seb, she gains little more man than she lost  in her father. Seb's a self-inflated bore, and worse, he cheats on her. By the  time Belle realizes her marriage is done for, she has already latched onto her  next lover, Mr. Gaden Lockyer.  </P> <P> Gaden Lockyer -- no flesh-and-blood man -- is a figure out of history, a  banker, farmer and politician who lived in Queensland at the end of the last  century. Not handsome, but compelling in looks, he so intrigues Belle that she  must know everything about him. Her obsession with Gaden grows, until she is  fully engaged in "reconstructing or revivifying him."  </P> <P> She has a huge photographic blowup made of his picture so that she can talk to  him at night alone in her room and insert herself into the "picture" by  obliterating the image of his wife. Belle sets off to track down places where  he's lived, assuming a variety of identities until, Belle in tardy pursuit, he  finally reached Tin River, Gaden's last abode.  </P> <P> What she's really searching for is a "center." That much she makes clear. But  what kind of a center? One within, or one without? She hopes such a center  won't revolve around men, and maybe by creating a "paper" man Astley feels  she's liberating her heroine, at least giving her a stepping stone.  </P> <P> "Philosophically, I suppose," Belle muses, "there is little difference between  the human center that I seek and the abstract. Modern self-indulgent psychology  proposes that one's self is one's center, but I find the theory unsatisfying. I  need a center in which I can merge. An alter-ego center. Isn't that what we all  look for?"  </P> <P> It's an interesting idea -- using the novel to ask this question: Where is the  center? But the answers, the whole investigation, is too diffused here; some  underlying fascination with Euclidean geometry is favored over an obligation to  real emotional depth in characters.  </P> <P> When Belle finally tracks down her long-lost father, making a hasty trip to the  States to meet him in New York, their reunion is described in such a way that  the players seem artificial. And later when Belle tells her mother she's  located her father, there's hardly an indication of a reaction on her mother's  part.  </P> <P> Surely such a reunion would matter to both women -- matter deeply -- and a  reader can't help but long for the emotional truth at such moments.  </P></p>

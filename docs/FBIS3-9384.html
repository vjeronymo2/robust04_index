It did not elaborate.  Two roads leading out of Sarajevo are due to re-open Wednesday:  one leading to central Bosnia, one to the south. The bridge  linking the city to the Serb-held suburb of Grbavica is also due  to open, as is a road between two Serb-held suburbs, Lukavica et  Ilidza. The routes were to be opened for limited civilian  traffic. But UN Protection Force [United Nations Protection  Force] spokesman Major Simon MacDowell said unspecified problems  were threatening the moves. The "difficulties are coming from  both sides," he said, giving no further details.    The nearly two-year Serb siege of the city eased last month  when the Serbs gave in to a NATO ultimatum and removed many  heavy weapons that had been ringing Sarajevo. But on Monday, UN  forces found Serb heavy weapons including tanks, anti-aircraft  guns and mortars inside the NATO-imposed exclusion zone around  Sarajevo. MacDowell said the find made by Canadian troops late  Sunday was a "big violation" of the NATO demilitarization plan.  MacDowell said Tuesday that civilian affairs representative  Diyan Milov met Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic Tuesday  evening, and subsequently travelled to Lukavica.</p>

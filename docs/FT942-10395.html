			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Losers assail US lobby in telecom deal Canadian and European telecommunications equipment suppliers which lost out to AT&amp;T of the US in a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) Saudi contract on Monday claim political pressure by the Clinton administration cost them the business. The Saudi contract, one of the largest awarded in telecoms, provides for wholesale upgrading of the kingdom's telecoms network over the next seven years, including 1.5m new telephone lines and a new digital mobile cellular network. AT&amp;T hailed the contract as 'a big boost to our globalisation efforts'. It is a staging post in the attainment of the company's goal of increasing the non-US share of its equipment supply business from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of total turnover by the end of the decade. The contract was bitterly fought between AT&amp;T and Siemens of Germany, Alcatel of France, Ericsson of Sweden, and Northern Telecom of Canada. All four non-US companies are believed to be aggrieved at the extent of lobbying by Washington on AT&amp;T's behalf. Yesterday Ericsson claimed political factors had been 'decisive'. The group said its offer had been lower than its competitors, although it declined to be specific. It noted AT&amp;T's eventual order at 1.5m lines was bigger than specified in the original tender. Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive, complained last year Ericsson was losing orders because of its lack of political clout: 'We could easily double our revenues today if we had the same political and financial muscle as our competitors.' Stockholm analysts said the US role in the Gulf War and President Clinton's intervention in the contract talks had almost certainly helped AT&amp;T to clinch the order. But they believed Ericsson was well placed to recover from the setback, particularly when a new batch of cellular mobile licences is auctioned in the US later this year. The group played down the impact of the loss on its overall business. 'The value of this order corresponds to roughly 2 per cent of our yearly order intake; the volume of 200,000 lines per year should be compared to Ericsson's annual deliveries of around 10m lines,' said Mr Bo Landin, a senior vice-president. Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, cited the contract as a prime example of the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's promotion of US business.</p>

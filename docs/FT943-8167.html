			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder EGM call Dissident shareholders who control less than 20 per cent of Goodman Fielder, Australia's largest food company, said they had demanded an extraordinary general meeting to review the composition of the board, Reuter reports from Sydney. The shareholders include Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP), the New South Wales State Authorities Superannuation Board, Bankers Trust Australia, and Agrifood Australia, which is owned by Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne businessman. The requisition proposes that the meeting consider the removal of seven directors, including chairman Mr John Studdy, by separate resolutions so that the position of each can be considered separately. It also proposes the appointment of four directors. On Tuesday, the rebellious shareholders rejected a plan by Goodman directors to reshape its board as part of an effort to get the struggling company back on track. Goodman's plan included the appointment of two additional non-executive board members and for Mr Studdy to stand down once an external successor had been found.</p>

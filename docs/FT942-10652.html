			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Incomes in northern counties 'among poorest in Europe' Income for households in northern England is Pounds 36 a week less than that of the average British household, a report said today. A Low Pay Unit report, commissioned by the NUCPS public service union, found that incomes in the region, which covers Tyne and Wear, Cleveland, County Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland, were among the poorest in Europe, 14 per cent below the European average. The report said more than a third of people working full- time in the north earned less than the Council of Europe's decency threshold. Low pay rates, however, had not led the region to attract jobs, the report said. It still had the highest unemployment rate in Britain. The report says the problem has been made worse by the collapse of manufacturing, costing 100,000 jobs. Average pay in the northern region, says the report, is Pounds 288.60, 9 per cent lower than the national average. It has been steadily falling behind since 1984 when it was 6 per cent below the national figure.</p>

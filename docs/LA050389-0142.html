			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PORN CHARGES DROPPED; NO OFFENSE TO L.A.'S MORALS;  </P> <P> AREA TOO DIVERSE, JUDGE SAYS  </P> <P> In a setback for the federal government's campaign against major distributors  of pornography, a judge today dismissed racketeering charges against a Woodland  Hills video distributor, saying he could not find that the graphic films he  sold violated community standards.  </P> <P> Granting an acquittal in the only Los Angeles case brought in the Justice  Department's crackdown on obscenity, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said  he could not conclude that films such as "Kneel Before Me" and "Beyond DeSade"  were "patently offensive" in an area as diverse as Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The great majority of people in this town would be incensed by this," the  judge stated in his oral decision. "I just do not believe that unless you have  positive evidence of what the entire community believes in this area, that any  judge could say what goes on in the so-called edge of this area, whether it's  obscene, or (merely) pornographic."  </P> <P> Defense lawyers said the decision may make it more difficult for prosecutors to  bring obscenity cases in metropolitan areas. "In a way, what the court did,  which is of nationwide significance, is call into question the Supreme Court's  assumption that you can tell if material is patently offensive just by looking  at it," defense attorney Stanley Fleishman said. "The historic fact as I see it  is that in America today, the American people tolerate virtually any sexual  material."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4th Case in Nation  </P> <P> The case against Rubin Gottesman, owner of X-Citement Video Inc. and R. G.  Sales Co. in Van Nuys, was the fourth obscenity case in the nation to be filed  under federal racketeering laws, which allow prosecutors to seize the assets of  distributors.  </P> <P> Under the statute, prosecutors had sought to seize Gottesman's Woodland Hills  home, his stock and ownership interests in both companies, his personal and  corporate bank accounts and office furniture and equipment.  </P> <P> The indictment was one of a series returned in a campaign prompted in part by  the 1986 report of a Justice Department commission that found a link between  some sexually explicit material and violence.  </P> <P> The four films alleged to be obscene in this case included graphic depictions  of group sex, oral sex, beatings and bondage. One included a gang rape scene in  a mental hospital.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court has held that only materials that are "patently offensive"  when measured against community standards and that appeal primarily to  "prurient interests" can be adjudged obscene. But the defense argued that in  metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, it is virtually impossible to determine  what may be offensive to the entire community.  </P> <P> Prosecutors presented one expert witness who testified that materials such as  those cited in the indictment are not readily available on video shelves in Los  Angeles, an indication, perhaps, that even regular purveyors of pornography  consider them outside the scope of most films. But Kenyon said that may only  indicate that distributors " would say it's not worth the risk" of potential  prosecution.  </P></p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB soars to Pounds 177m as subscribers increase British Sky Broadcasting, the UK satellite broadcasting venture, yesterday announced a continuing rise in both subscribers and profits in the year to June 30. Profits for shareholders jumped from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 176.8m, which includes external interest payments but not interest due on loan stock held by shareholders. Amid speculation that the rate of increase in the number of subscribers had been levelling off, BSkyB said that during the year the number of paying subscribers had increased from 2.35m to 3.45m and the upward trend was continuing. The company said the number of subscribers to the BSkyB movie channels had now reached 2.6m, with 2.5m subscribing to the Sports Channel. More than 88 per cent of all subscribers were paying for at least one premium channel. The results were announced as the company plans to add four new programme services to the existing 12 channels in Sky TV's multi-channel basic package on top of a second sports service at weekends. The four range from the 24 hours a day music channel, VH-1, to the Learning Channel, broadcasting for seven hours a day, a 12-hour Travel Channel and four hours a day during the week of the Romance Channel - devoted to soap opera. The introduction of the new package of channels could presage an increase in the cost of the basic subscription package. Mr Richard Brooke, chief financial officer, would only say yesterday: 'Pricing is something we look at as we add value to the package.' BSkyB returned Pounds 620m to shareholders during the year, Pounds 120m from operating cash and Pounds 500m in loans raised from a syndicate of banks. Mr Brooke said he expected to pay a further Pounds 200m this year towards the Pounds 1.25bn still outstanding on their investment. The main BSkyB shareholders are News Corporation with 50 per cent, Pearson, the media and information group which owns the Financial Times, and Chargeurs, the French transportation and media group, with 17.5 per cent each and Granada Group with 13.5 per cent. Mr David Chance, deputy managing director of BSkyB, said he was confident that the current upward trends in satellite dish sales and subscriptions would continue. 'In the last five weeks dish sales have increased from 11,000 to 17,000 a week and that's before the autumn promotion,' he said. He added that 'churn' - the industry term for subscribers who have switched off - had been cut from 15 per cent in 1992-93 to 12 per cent this year. Turnover increased from Pounds 379.8m to Pounds 550.5m with operating costs rising from Pounds 318.3m to Pounds 380.4m. Operating profits of Pounds 170.1m (Pounds 61.5m) were boosted by a Pounds 20m profit on the sale of the second Marcopolo satellite which used to broadcast BSB services before the merger with Sky. Losses of Pounds 4.3m from associated companies related to the start-up cost of the 50 per cent-owned Nickelodeon children's channel.</p>

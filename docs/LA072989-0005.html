			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIKUD PARTY'S PEACE PROCESS  </P> <P> It has been quite the spectacle. Nothing to match the chariot race in "Ben  Hur," to be sure, but it is not every day -- as it was in the aftermath of the  decidedly internal wrangling within Israel's Likud party over the terms of the  peace process Israel launched two months ago -- that ostensibly seasoned  political observers the world over greet purely internal posturings within a  political party with the aplomb of men about to have their thumbnails snatched  out.  </P> <P> Within Israel, of course, the resolutions passed by the Likud caused some  concern, most of it now obviously premature, regarding its readiness to adhere  to the terms of its coalition agreement with the Labor alignment. Some even  sensed in Likud's pronunciamentos the impending death-knell of the Israeli  initiative and, consequently, of the national unity government. Others, fueled  largely by an inherent malice toward the Jewish state, went so far as to insist  that the terrorist commandering and subsequent wrecking of an Israeli civilian  bus on the Tel Aviv/Jerusalem highway, which resulted in scores of civilian  dead and wounded, was directly attributable (this despite the fact that this  act of terror turned out to have long been in the planning) to the Likud's  alleged reneging on its initially publicized terms.  </P> <P> This, anyway, was the contention of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, his aides Abu  Iyad and Abu Sharif, and some lamentably prominent American political  cartoonists and editorialists, all of whom have been understandably loath to  point out that the peace plan the Likud had allegedly "torpedoed" was one that  neither the PLO nor a single Palestinian Arab leader welcomed for a minute to  begin with.  </P> <P> The fact of the matter, however, is that despite the appearance of backtracking  by the Likud, that party's resolutions merely formalized positions which are  not -- not for a moment -- binding on the government of which it is a part.  Indeed, it has been widely recognized that significant differences do exist  between Labor and the Likud with respect to a number of issues related to the  peace process, as well they might given the democratic nature of the state of  Israel and the challenges it faces to its existence. The critical point,  however, is not the position adopted by a single party or individual leaders,  but, rather, the policies that formally have been agreed upon by the Israeli  government. In that sense, the four-point Israeli initiative has not been  abrogated or amended and continues to be the policy of Israel until such time  as the government acts to change it or dissolve itself.  </P> <P> And at this juncture -- and both Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Israeli  foreign minister Moshe Arens have conveyed this to the Bush Administration and  the State Department -- the only binding position on the government of Israel  remains the proposal adopted by it on May 14, and subsequently presented to the  United States by the premier himself. This was, in fact, understood by the  State Department after some initial misgivings, and recently, Richard Boucher,  its spokesman, reiterated that the United States regards the Shamir plan as the  most promising route to a just solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and  called upon the Palestinians to accept the election proposal and to "enter into  a dialogue with the Israelis to flesh out the details of the initiative, and to  make elections and negotiations work."  </P> <P> Israel stands unswerving in its readiness to pursue a dialogue with the  Palestinian people and the warring Arab states of the Middle East based upon  free and democratic elections for the occupants of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza  district in an atmosphere devoid of violence, threats and terror.  </P> <P> It stands ready, as it did when it signed the Camp David Accords with Egypt and  the United States in 1978, to end the state of war between itself and its  neighbors, and to participate in an international effort to resolve the Arab  refugee problem. It is prepared to negotiate over the fate of the territories  under its control since it was attacked in 1967 without preconditions.  </P> <P> If the Palestinians remain convinced that this is a ploy -- that Israel is, as  they have argued, eminently comfortable with the prospects of a Palestinian  rejection of these terms -- they really ought to put the Jewish state to the  test and agree to the Israeli initiative in its original form. If they do not,  the train they derail this time may well be their own. A shame, really --  they've missed so many of them before.  </P> <P> ILAN MOR  </P> <P> Israeli Consul for Press &amp; Information  </P> <P> Consul General of Israel  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

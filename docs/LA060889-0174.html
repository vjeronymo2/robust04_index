			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE COUPLE RETURNED BEFORE CHINA'S ERUPTION;  </P> <P> TRAVELERS SAW THE UPHEAVAL SIMMERING  </P> <P> From airplanes, tour buses and trains that took them on an 18-day tour, Joyce  and Edward Johnson of Garden Grove had front-row seats on the early scenes of  what has become a drama of democracy and repression in China.  </P> <P> The Johnsons returned from their China trip May 26, but they saw more than just  a glimpse of the tension between demonstrators and the government -- which was  to turn into a massacre a few days after they left.  </P> <P> The couple -- he is retired and she is a trustee in the Garden Grove Unified  School District -- were touring the country, a nation they had not yet visited.  </P> <P> What they remember most are the countless people demonstrating, and their quiet  way of doing it. A few days after they left, the quiet turned into an uproar.  </P> <P> The Johnsons were in Bejing's Tian An Men Square when Soviet leader Mikhail S.  Gorbachev visited, when the throngs of students demonstrating in the giant  plaza were newly arrived.  </P> <P> "If you looked in that square, there were over 1 million people there," Edward  Johnson said. "If you have ever seen a million people at one time, it is  something that's fantastic. . . . I saw nothing but heads everywhere. It sure  is overwhelming."  </P> <P> Joyce Johnson said knots of students -- 10 or 12 -- would gather at utility  poles to read the signs that were posted often with news from other  demonstration points.  </P> <P> The couple first flew to Hong Kong, then made their way by train and boat to  several cities in China.  </P> <P> "We saw a lot of protesters in Shanghai," she said. "The students were all  over. They were protesting at different places -- downtown, in the city  squares, where there would be shops and different places, wherever you had  universities, and there were universities everywhere.  </P> <P> "They were quiet, but the numbers -- they were just really protesting en masse,  with their actual bodies, being there.  </P> <P> "When we reached Shanghai, there were rumors that students that had been  fasting, that some of them had died, or so it was said," she said.  </P> <P> "The students we saw protesting had made floral wreaths out of paper, and they  were wearing black armbands and marching in the street.  </P> <P> "And yet, they were quiet and still didn't do anything but block the streets  and be there in their numbers," she said.  </P></p>

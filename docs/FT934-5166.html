			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Cool, creative and connected: Viacom's MTV cable network is eyeing Europe and Asia for growth Their names are Beavis and Butt-head, and they are cartoon characters with their own show on MTV, the American pop music cable television channel that is the jewel in the crown of Viacom, the media conglomerate which is struggling to conclude a Dollars 9.5bn friendly bid for Paramount. They are foul-mouthed, petty thieving, layabouts with a taste for pyromania, torturing animals, jeering at the elderly and making crude comments about women. They are also America's most popular teenage anti-heroes. Sitting on a TV couch, they pass judgment on pop videos with a sniggering laugh and a moronically limited vocabulary: anything good is 'cool'; anything bad 'sucks'. But while Beavis and Butt-head seem puerile to sane adults over the age of 30, they have struck a chord among young Americans. The show is MTV's most popular, while T-shirts featuring the duo are selling strongly, and movie spin-offs are in the works. 'Never underestimate America's fascination with the under-achiever,' laughs Mr Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, the cable group to which MTV belongs. The show underscores MTV's ability to set, or stay abreast of, fashion trends among the young - a capacity which has helped turn it into one of America's most successful cable channels and a growing global presence. It now reaches more than 233m homes in over 77 countries, with six separately packaged regional services. The latest is MTV Latino, a 24 hour-a-day Spanish language network for Latin America launched with over 2m subscribers early last month. MTV is one of four channels making up MTV Networks. The others are trying to follow in its international footsteps. Nickelodeon, the most popular children's network in the US, made its first foray abroad in September when it launched a joint venture in the UK with British Sky Broadcasting - the first stage in what Viacom hopes will be a global expansion similar to MTV's. The two other channels will be launched in the UK early next year: Nick at Nite, a channel which specialises in re-runs of classic television comedies, and VH-1, which concentrates on pop music for the baby boomer age group. MTV Networks' growing global reach is a factor in the Dollars 9.5bn battle being fought by Viacom over Paramount Communications, the US film and publishing group. For it gives some credence to Viacom's argument that a merger agreed by the two would create a media business able to compete internationally. QVC Network, the cable television shopping channel launching a rival, hostile offer for Paramount, makes similar claims as the battle moves towards a final courtroom showdown. Last Wednesday the Delaware chancery court ruled in favour of QVC by overturning a poison pill arrangement designed to protect Viacom's agreed bid for Paramount. An appeal against the ruling by both Viacom and Paramount is due to be heard on December 9. Whether Viacom wins or loses, continued strong growth seems certain at MTV Networks, which recently reported a 44 per cent jump in third-quarter operating earnings and is expected to make Dollars 230m-Dollars 240m in 1993. Its revenues come largely from advertisers and fees from cable and broadcasting service companies carrying the programmes. In the US, about 65 per cent come from advertising, while the figure is about 90 per cent in Europe. MTV Networks' success thus depends on attracting the viewers advertisers want to reach, which it does by combining three classic marketing skills: careful branding; keeping close to the customer; and 'thinking globally, while acting locally'. Each channel has a strong brand image. This is partly because they are cable networks, able to target a narrower audience than broadcast networks which have to appeal to a wide range of viewers. But MTV's success is due mainly to its knack of maintaining a distinctive feel for each of its channels. 'Our strategy is to be a small niche player, so to prosper and survive it is key we have the loyalty of our viewers. They have to feel this is a place for them, that it speaks their language, that it resonates with them,' says Mr Freston, a leading member of the team which set up the MTV music channel in the US in 1981. Broadcast into more than 57m American homes, it has become one of the most important arbiters of pop culture. In recent years, MTV has helped reinforce its identity by supplementing its basic diet of pop videos (provided virtually free by record companies) with original programmes, such as Beavis and Butt-head. These now fill about 20 per cent of its air time, giving it the feel of an 'alternative' youth channel. Similarly, Nickelodeon, which reaches about 60m US homes and accounts for about 30 per cent of the children's television pie, owes its success to a viewpoint which permeates its programmes - that the channel belongs to its young audience, rather than the alien world of adults. It likes to deflate pretentious grown-ups, particularly by showering them with green slime. 'We had a big idea. Let's look at stuff from the kids' point of view, that they are the consumer,' says Ms Geraldine Laybourne, channel head. Rugrats, an award-winning cartoon series about babies, exaggerates sizes and shapes to reflect a child's perspective. Clarissa Explains It All is a situation comedy which examines the world through the eyes of a 14-year-old girl. MTV and Nickelodeon keep in close touch with customers. Each has a panel of viewers, linked to the networks by computer, which can give instant feed back on new shows. The group's commitment to thinking globally, but tailoring its product to local markets, is underscored in Europe, where the MTV music channel began broadcasting in 1987 and recently went into profit. It reaches 55m homes across the continent - Germany is the largest market - with a service put together in London, which uses the English language but is pan-European in tone. For example, some 40 per cent of the videos it shows are from countries other than the UK and US, and its current affairs programmes have tackled issues such as neo-fascism. 'An 18-year-old in Prague has more in common with an 18-year-old in Paris than they do with their own parents,' argues Mr Bill Roedy, MTV Europe's chief executive. MTV Networks sees its strongest growth in Europe, where it still has many homes to penetrate, and in the emerging Asian market. It is developing its first feature film, an MTV spin-off called Joe's Apartment, with Geffen Pictures, while Nickelodeon is developing video and audio products with Sony. This year Nickelodeon expects to sell 8m dollops of Gak, a slimy, kneading plaything made under licence by toy-maker Mattel. Longer term, the fast-developing world of interactive multi-media, which promises to put hundreds of channels into people's homes, should help the company, since its networks can be easily sub-divided to reach ever more closely targeted audiences. MTV, for example, is planning to test market two new MTV channels, dedicated to different music formats. However, the multi-media world, with its added channel capacity, will also mean intensified competition. Nickelodeon already faces a tussle for viewers with the likes of Walt Disney's (advertisement free) children's channel. MTV faces no immediate threat to its dominance of the pop market, although Bertelsmann of Germany and Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable operator, recently announced unspecific plans for a new, interactive pop music and shopping channel. In a world where viewers have a bewildering multitude of choices, the key to MTV's continued success will be maintaining its individuality and customer loyalty. And that, for better or worse, is likely to spawn plenty of successors to Beavis and Butt-head, when their fickle young fans decide eventually that they, too, 'suck'.</p>

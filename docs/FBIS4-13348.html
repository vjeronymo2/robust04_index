			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has said that  President Mubarak's visit to the Sultanate of Oman is within the  framework of consultations on all the issues that concern the  two countries as well as the Arab nation. He said that Egypt is  playing a candid and objective role in resolving the Yemeni  crisis, noting that an Egyptian envoy has conveyed messages from  President Mubarak to the Yemeni leaders. He said that the envoy  is holding talks in Sanaa and Aden in a bid to achieve Yemeni  reconciliation. [passage omitted]    At a news conference today, Musa said that President  Mubarak's visit to the PRC has important political and economic  dimensions. He pointed out that the PRC is a major power, plays  an important role in world policy, and has historic ties with  Egypt. Both countries have ancient civilizations and have had  close ties in the modern age. Egypt, he noted, was the first  Arab and African country to recognize the PRC in 1956. He said  that special ties link President Mubarak and the PRC leadership.  He said that the PRC's industrial progress prompts both  countries to expand their cooperation. He noted that efforts  should be made to increase Egyptian exports to the PRC. He said  that exports to the PRC do not exceed $5 million, whereas the  trade volume between the two countries totals $200 million.  [passage omitted]    On the Iraqi information minister's statement that his  country has given up its claim on Kuwait, Musa said that Iraq  must make a clear and definite declaration stating that Kuwait  is an independent and sovereign state and must end all talk of  its being the 19th governorate or province of Iraq. This is  Egypt's position, he stated. [passage omitted].</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "Windshield Testing by </F> Infrared Thermography"]    [Text] Thermal imaging displays the distribution of  temperatures.    Testing the performance of integrated deicing systems in  certain types of portholes, windshields, and glass enclosures,  is part of the total quality assurance of the products  manufactured by Lucas Aerospace's Department of Engineering and  Heating Systems. Whether made of pure glass, acrylic, or  polycarbonate, or of acrylic glass, deiceable transparencies  must respond to various stresses that necessitate in-process  testing during manufacture.    To test the electric heating systems--a thin layer of gold  and or indium oxide applied by vacuum deposition on the surface  of the glass or other "plastic" material--of the windshields  that it manufactures, Lucas uses Agema's thermal imaging system  Thermovision 870, by means of which the temperature distribution  over the heated surfaces can be displayed. The testing procedure  consists of placing the windshield, with its heating element  activated, in front of the infrared system. Without making  contact, the Thermovision 870 equipment senses and measures the  radiation emitted by the windshield. The resulting image is  displayed on the monitor screen and compared with the  thermographic pattern of a standard reference windshield. It  takes less than two minutes to test the windshield in its  entirety, with precision and without slowing the production rate.    The infrared testing technology replaces the thermocouples  method, which required that 30, and up to 40, thermocouples be  positioned on each windshield to obtain a plausible image of the  temperature distribution, the Lucas company explains. And in any  case, the thermocouples method was, at best, incapable of a high  degree of reproducibility and could even generate an abstraction  of what is actually a very localized zone. Another advantage of  the Thermovision 870 system is that it permits the archiving of  40,000 referenced thermal images on disk or magnetic tape.</p>

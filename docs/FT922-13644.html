			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Dr Pepper/Seven-Up plans share flotation DR Pepper/Seven-Up Com-panies, the third largest producer of soft drinks in the US, is planning to float its shares on the stock market. The Dallas-based company said yesterday that in two weeks it intended to file the necessary registration statement for an 'initial public offering' (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog. The proceeds of the offer, which is expected to involve the issue of new shares in the company, would be used to reduce debt and retire preferred stock. The company was formed through the merger of the Dr Pepper holding company and Seven-Up in 1988. The combination created a third force to compete with the two giants of the soft drinks industry, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Dr Pepper and Seven-Up were both purchased in 1986 by separate investment groups, led by the same Dallas-based investment firm. Even prior to the merger, management of the businesses was integrated to some extent, and production was centralised. Dr Pepper/Seven-Up currently employs around 905 people and has its production operations in St Louis. Its corporate headquarters is in Dallas. The company's turnover last year increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 600.9m, while operating profits advanced to Dollars 138.2m, up 12 per cent on 1990.</p>

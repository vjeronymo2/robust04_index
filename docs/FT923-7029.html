			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Bears find some opposition in Milan - Some analysts say it is time to buy while others remain cautious With many Italian blue chips trading at a fraction of their former levels, some of the country's equity analysts are sticking their heads above the parapets and saying the time is now right to buy. Historically, the prices seem cheap. The Comit index, which rose 0.41 to 401.18 yesterday, is now less than half its May 1986 peak of 908.2, and Fiat's ordinary stock, at around L4,100 (Dollars 3.70), stands at just above a quarter of its record high on an adjusted basis. Encouraged by the unexpected resolve of the new government in tackling the huge budget deficit, some analysts claim that such bargains cannot last. The success of Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, in confronting the scala mobile wage indexation system and bloated pension provisions has been impressive. In the six weeks since taking office, the new government has achieved more than some predecessors in as many years. Crucial decree laws have been proposed to cut spending, while the L30,000bn emergency budget won parliamentary approval in record time. Privatisation is now under way in earnest, and the Treasury has transformed the country's four biggest public sector groups into joint stock companies as a first step towards flotation. Such changes have come as a tonic to the optimists searching for a ray of hope amid the gloom surrounding the economy and the lira after two months of rising interest rates and devaluation fears. Recent figures from the New York-based Institutional Brokers Estimate System (IBES) show the consensus of Italian analysts predicting a rise of 12 per cent in corporate earnings this year. Coupling this with recent political successes, some houses are awash with buy recommendations. Such advice should be treated with caution. The consensus earnings forecasts 'are still dangerously high', according to one analyst. Gemina-Credit Lyonnais Sim expects earnings to drop by 8 per cent this year, and attributes the bullish IBES numbers to updating delays. 'Saying share prices are attractively low is fine as long as you do not own them,' says one observer. 'This year's upbeat earnings forecasts are a rerun of 1991, when estimates were consistently too high. Talking about bargain hunting is dangerous.' 'Looking at historical values is meaningless,' agrees a colleague. 'At the market's peak in 1986, Italian companies had everything going for them.' Earnings were rising, largely thanks to cost-cutting; the economy was growing strongly, having emerged relatively late from the 1981-83 recession; there was political stability under the Craxi government; and inflation and interest rates were falling fast. Today's scene is different. Domestic growth is slowing, many export markets are in recession, Italian interest rates are high and the lira is pegged to the narrow band of the European Monetary System. The yield gap between the bond and equity markets lies at the core of the arguments in favour of caution. 'Historically, shares may seem cheap, but measured against bonds they look very expensive,' says one economist. With yields of 13 to 14 per cent on government bonds and an earnings yield of 8 per cent at best on shares, 'equities have to be incredibly attractive' in view of the risks. Such caution is reinforced by the far greater liquidity of the bond market compared with current daily volumes of L50bn to L60bn on the bourse. Only when interest rates fall substantially will equities become attractive. The immediate outlook is for rates to stay high, or even to rise should the lira come under renewed pressure. Not even rumours of devaluation alter the prognosis. Analysts say that devaluation would be interpreted as a sign of failure, which would keep the pressure on the currency. Lower interest rates depend on the government's ability to get a grip on fiscal policy and tackle the deficit. So far, ministers have shown admirable resolve in making previously unthinkable spending cuts, while Mr Amato has used the tacit threat of new elections, unpopular in parliament, to push through tough decree laws. But with much deeper spending curbs ahead, the government's true test, and the decisive signal for the stock market, will come in September when ministers draw up their 1993 budget plans.</p>

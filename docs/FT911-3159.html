			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / British team to help Chernobyl clean-up A British industrial consortium has been invited to help the Soviet Union clean up radioactive contamination in rural areas. The Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded five years ago today. SAC Hitech, part of the Ricardo engineering group, is heading a consortium which includes Ove Arup and AEA Technology, in a Pounds 600,000 pre-feasibility study of fallout in the Russian Federation, about 250km from Chernobyl. It is the first phase of a four-phase programme involving about 110,000 people who may have to be moved to other areas because they are still receiving too much radiation. The problem is the radio-isotope caesium-137 in the nuclear fuel ejected in the explosion, and washed out by rain over large tracts of the Russia. The fallout emits gamma-rays and fine particles can contaminate people directly by its radiation, and by being ingested with food or breathed into the lungs. SAC Hitech has been negotiating with the Moscow authorities for over a year, since the Russian Federation first revealed the extent of its fallout problem, said Mr Mark Ryan, project manager. The engineers brought in the AEA Technology's environment and energy activity at Harwell for its radiological experience, and Ove Arup to help plan new accommodation and work for affected people. The Russians are providing Pounds 100,000 in hard currency, but SAC Hitech is adding a further Pounds 500,000 as an investment in what it believes could yield major engineering business for the UK, Mr Ryan said. He plans a project office in Moscow alongside a Soviet team, with much of the local expense expected to be met in roubles. The pre-feasibility study will take seven months or more and help define what is currently seen as a Pounds 2m feasibility study. The main objective is to minimise disruption and improve 'quality of life' for the affected Soviet citizens. The complete programme could take as long as ten years, Mr Ryan said. AEA Environment and Energy will be advising on ways to reduce the radiation dose to people, said Dr Alan Eggleton of Harwell. He said Soviet assessment of fallout in Russia had been fairly crude and the project's first step would be a comprehensive radiological assessment.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Ruling party in Sri Lanka facespoll challenge Sri Lanka's ruling United National Party, which has governed for 17 years, faces its toughest-ever electoral test in tomorrow's general election. The party is braced for losing considerable support to a nine-party alliance led by Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the ageing former prime minister, and her 49-year-old daughter Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the alliance's candidate for prime minister. However, with opinion polls showing wildly differing results, it was not clear yesterday whether the opposition could capture enough seats to take power. In the last Parliament, the UNP had 125 out of 225 seats. Mrs Kumaratunga has been attracting large crowds with her eloquence, energy and populist promises of rises in welfare handouts. But even some supporters are concerned at her reluctance to give details. Nevertheless, many Sri Lankans believe change is in the air. At the central bus station in Colombo yesterday hundreds of people were preparing to leave to vote in their home towns and villages. Mr UN Dasantha, a fertiliser salesman, said: 'People are cautious because they don't know Chandrika's policies. But we think it's time for a change.' The UNP has focused on the the economic policies of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the leader of the opposition alliance, which promoted socialism with disastrous results when it was last in power in the early 1970s. Pictures of food queues adorn UNP posters, with a warning about the danger of voting SLFP. The opposition has found it hard to hit back directly. IMF-backed pro-market reforms have brought sustained growth in output, exports and foreign investment, with GDP up 5.7 per cent last year. Mrs Kumaratunga says she will continue with reform but wants future restructuring to have 'a human face.' She also wants to stop corruption, which she says is widespread in the UNP. The contestants have trod warily around the continuing civil war in the north between the army and the Tamil Tigers fighting for a separate homeland for the island's Tamil minority. Mr D B Wijetunga, the president, has taken a tough line with the Tigers whereas Mrs Kumaratunga has called for a compromise.</p>

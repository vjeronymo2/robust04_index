			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Mandela wants S Africa to join Lome pact MR NELSON MANDELA, the African National Congress leader, yesterday asked the European Community to allow a democratic South Africa to join the Lome Convention governing trade, aid and co-operation between the EC and 69 developing countries. At talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Manuel Marin, EC development commissioner, Mr Mandela is understood to have expressed a preference for accession to the Lome accord, rather than other options for EC-South African relations. The ANC president won EC pledges to help build a new civil service, army and police force, and Community support to prepare voters for multiracial elections next April. Mr Mandela said that while South African membership of Lome was under discussion, the republic's mixture of pockets of wealth surrounded by backwardness meant it should be regarded as an economy in transition, rather like the central European economies. The EC has progressive market access and substantial aid agreements with east and central Europe. But current thinking in Brussels favours a relationship with South Africa as part of a more integrated bloc of nations in southern Africa. This is based on the premise that Pretoria would join the Southern Africa Development Community, which South Africa already dominates economically by the strength of its trade and industrial links. EC officials are uncomfortable with the idea that South Africa, with comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture, a developed financial system, industrial capacity, and advanced transport and communications infrastructure, should be slotted into a format such as Lome designed to aid much less developed former colonies. Meanwhile in New York, the UN General Assembly yesterday agreed to end most economic sanctions against South Africa, two weeks after Mr Mandela, in an address to the world body, proposed lifting the restrictions However, the oil embargo will remain in place until the Transitional Executive Council agreed last month becomes operational, probably around the end of the year. In South Africa the government was yesterday criticised by the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress for an early morning raid on a home in Umtata, Transkei in which five people died. The PAC denied that the house was used by its military wing. Meanwhile, conservatives have formed the Freedom Alliance, grouping former members of the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) - Bophutatswana, Ciskei, Inkatha, the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront. At the same time, Bophutatswana and Ciskei withdrew from the negotiating council - the forum for multi-party talks - and ended all meetings with the government and ANC. The Alliance's short-term aim is to present a single, united negotiating team which will seek concessions on federalism from the ANC. In the longer term, it seeks to displace the National Party as the country's second largest political group behind the ANC.</p>

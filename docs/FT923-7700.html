			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Battle for Salzburg's soul: A more modern festival is emerging You can still pay up to Dollars 350 (Pounds 183) for an opera performance in Salzburg this summer, but the choice may be Janacek or Messiaen rather than Mozart and Strauss. You can still dress in black tie or put on your favourite tiara, but don't be surprised to find scruffy students and tourists in the same block of seats. Salzburg is undergoing an identity crisis. Gone is the extravagant conservatism of the past quarter-century, when Herbert von Karajan - the conductor and Salzburg's most famous son after Mozart - presided over its world-renowned festival. In its place comes a bolder, more contemporary creed preached by Gerard Mortier, a loquacious, idealistic Belgian who - as incoming artistic director - wants to transform the festival's character and bring in a new public. You can already sense the difference: the atmosphere is less formal, the audience looks younger. There are fewer stars than before and more empty seats. No one doubted the need for change. Critics and commentators believed the festival had become too elitist and money-oriented. But Salzburg has got more than it bargained for. Mortier, who made his name with adventurous opera programming in Brussels, has introduced new and unfamiliar works - to which Salzburg's traditional audiences have proved resistant. He has engaged stage directors like Peter Sellars and the Herrmanns, whose radical style is anathema to the festival's older supporters. He has laid particular emphasis on the younger generation, awarding the prestigious opening concert to the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra and handing out tickets to students for as little as Dollars 9. Mortier couches his programme in lofty philosophical terms, proclaiming Salzburg as a 'utopia of the new Europe', a cradle of aesthetic internationalism - a far cry from the pure Germanic tradition on which the festival once thrived. Coming from an outsider, this kind of talk makes locals nervous. For much of the year Salzburg is little more than a quiet, provincial, Austrian town. In the postwar era it prospered from the festival's up-market status and its ability to attract swarms of summer visitors. It is suspicious of anyone trying to graft an alien personality on to its contented Austrian face. Many festival-goers are prepared to allow Mortier a honeymoon, and some of his innovations have been enthusiastically received. The appointment of Peter Stein as drama director, for example, allowed spoken theatre to resume the central role it had when Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Max Reinhardt founded the festival in the 1920s. Stein's production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar was the popular hit of the opening week this summer, and there will be a wider selection of drama next year. Mortier's contemporary music programme is another welcome contrast to the Karajan years, when living composers received little more than a token nod. And Salzburg is at last able to hear the baroque and classical repertoire in state-of-the-art performances by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, William Christie and other period-instrument specialists. Harnoncourt, an internationally-renowned Austrian whom Karajan excluded from the festival, made his debut two weeks ago with a revelatory Missa Solemnis, and will conduct a Monteverdi opera next year. Despite these gains - and the continued presence of Solti, Abbado and other leading conductors - there is a strong undercurrent of resistance to the new regime. What irks Mortier's opponents is not just the substance of his programme - the feeling that he is trying to do too much too soon - but also his outspoken style. In a series of press interviews, he has trodden on local sensibilities and alienated sections of the music industry. He accused the major record companies of using 'mafia tactics' to influence casting during the Karajan era, and spoke of 'evil people' who exploited their relationship with the conductor to his dying day. The Karajan estate promptly threatened legal action, and the mayor of Salzburg called an emergency meeting of the festival's supervisory body, saying Mortier's statements could cause irreparable damage. Mortier has also had a run-in with the local business community. Reacting to claims that his programme had caused a drop in trade, he told Salzburg's shopkeepers and hoteliers it was time they started doing something for the festival 'instead of always milking it'. He also lectured councillors on how to make better year-round use of Salzburg's facilities, and called on the city to co-operate with Brussels-based cultural programmes promoted by the European Community. Mortier cannot afford to alienate too many people. Ten days before the start of the festival, Riccardo Muti stormed out of a new production of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, claiming the staging by Karl-Ernst and Ursel Herrmann was an offence to Mozart's music. Although Muti was by no means blameless, the Tito fracas has been billed as a struggle between the old and the new at Salzburg. The Italian star conductor has been a festival favourite since 1971: he owns a house in the community where Karajan lived, and talks of the need to respect festival traditions established by great conductors of the past. Muti's supporters include the Vienna Philharmonic, one of the festival's main power-brokers and a guarantor of its musical standards. So far the orchestra has co-operated with Mortier, but it has voiced misgivings about the quality of some guest orchestras he has invited. Sponsors must also be kept happy: Mortier has signed a five-year agreement with Nestle, Asea Brown-Boveri and Allianz, who will provide Dollars 2m each year. And the festival's Friends Organisation must be restocked, after the defection of rich Karajan loyalists. Several of the most important events of Mortier's opening season take place in the final two weeks, beginning tonight with the first of six Boulez concerts. Monday sees the premiere of Sellars' staging of Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise. Modern interpretations of Strauss and Mozart operas follow later in the week. Mortier is hoping these will provide a popular mandate for change and silence his conservative critics. A battle for the soul of the festival is under way.</p>

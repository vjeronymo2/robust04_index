In his speech, Chen Bangzhu called on all provincial  departments and bureaus to conscientiously study, implement, and  carry out the newly promulgated revenue system, study problems  cropping up in the course of the new revenue system enforcement,  and strive to promote a sustained and rapid provincial economic  growth.    Provincial Vice Governor Zhou Bohua also attended the  meeting  chaired by provincial Executive Vice Governor Wang Keying.    The meeting pointed out: Since being officially enacted on 1  January, 1994, the new revenue system has been smoothly enforced  in Hunan Province. Nonetheless, a number of problems have also  been encountered in this process, including lack of adequate  measures, uneven tax burdens, and lack of circulating funds  among enterprises, and so on.    In view of the above-mentioned situation, Chen Bangzhu  stated: In order to secure efficient new revenue system  enforcement and smooth convergence between the new revenue  system and the old revenue system, leaders at all levels,  especially leaders of revenue departments at all levels, should  exert their utmost to grasp and digest the main spirit of the  new revenue system, this being a crucial link in providing  services to enterprises.    Chen Bangzhu called on all departments and bureaus concerned  to set up ad hoc groups that will conscientiously investigate  and study problems cropping up in the course of the new revenue  system enforcement and report their findings to the  administrative departments at higher levels so as to minimize  friction and collisions in the process of converging the new  revenue system with the old one.    Chen Bangzhu emphatically urged the provincial revenue  bureau  to start publicizing the PRC Revenue Law on a large scale, and  take the initiative to join other provincial departments and  bureaus concerned in studying and resolving problems in this  regard.    Chen Bangzhu finally called on all trades and professions  across the province to waste no time in collecting taxes and  work hard to fulfill revenue quotas upon schedule.</p>

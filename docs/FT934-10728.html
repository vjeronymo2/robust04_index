			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan wants anti-dumping unit expanded THE European Community's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is pressing for the Commission's anti-dumping unit to be doubled in size to help improve the speed and efficiency of investigations into unfair trade. Proposals for increasing staff, shortening inquiry deadlines and restructuring the anti-dumping department will be voted on today by his fellow commissioners. However, trade lawyers in Brussels fear they will not improve the transparency of anti-dumping investigations and will make it more difficult for companies accused of dumping to respond to Commission findings. 'Even if they publish decisions which are twice as long as they are today, the real reasons for the decisions will always remain to some extent secret,' said one lawyer. Commission officials hope plans for improving efficiency will please all member states, even though there is deadlock over the more sensitive question of whether to give Brussels more power to push through anti-dumping duties. They also believe the improvements will reassure those southern member states reluctant to abolish national import quotas unless the EC sharpens its trade weapons. The plea for more personnel was issued yesterday in the Commission report on anti-dumping activities for 1992, the first to appear under Sir Leon's stewardship. The report argues that the Community anti-dumping services are 'critically understaffed' compared with those in the US, Canada or Australia. Sir Leon is proposing that all anti-dumping investigations be concluded within 15 months, and that provisional duties should be imposed, if necessary, within nine months of the start of an inquiry. He is also planning to strengthen the involvement of consumer organisations in inquiries, and split the anti-dumping department into units investigating dumping and injury, as in the US. According to the 1992 report there were 158 anti-dumping duties in force at the end of last year.</p>

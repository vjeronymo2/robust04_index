			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> HERE'S AN ALL-STAR TEAM FOR THE UNHERALDED  </P> <P> Every year, deserving players are left off the National Basketball Association  All-Star team. So with that in mind, let's shift focus and honor five players  who are having solid, quiet seasons for improving teams.  </P> <P> Forward, Larry Krystkowiak, Milwaukee -- Like the second 'k' in his name,  Milwaukee's power forward from Montana is a silent, overlooked presence on the  league's most surprising team. He's a dependable scorer (11.7 points per game)  and rebounder (7.1), but his true value is on defense, where he routinely  guards the opposition's scoring forward. If you've been checking box scores,  you know the opposition's big scorers rarely reach their average against the  Bucks.  </P> <P> Forward, Thurl Bailey, Utah -- A 6-11 version of Lakers small forward James  Worthy, goggles and all. Playing alongside three All-Stars (Karl Malone, John  Stockton, Mark Eaton), Bailey might be the least known 20-point scorer in the  game. He's also a capable rebounder and shot-blocker who, paired with Malone,  creates matchup problems for opposing front lines.  </P> <P> Center, Mark West, Phoenix -- Despite playing 24 minutes a game, West is ninth  in the league in blocked shots. While on the floor, he serves the same  defensive purpose as the Knicks' Patrick Ewing -- as a backstop for a team with  a daring, wide-open style. There's no way Phoenix would have made the Larry  Nance trade with Cleveland if West had not been included. Not a constant  offensive threat, but his 65.3 percent field-goal shooting would lead the  league if he had enough attempts to qualify.  </P> <P> Guard, Lester Conner, New Jersey -- Not even Harry Weltman, who made sure to  include Conner in the Joe Barry Carroll deal, could have imagined Conner would  become the Nets' most valuable player. In the past week, Conner had his first  two career triple-doubles -- both against Seattle -- and is the only point  guard besides Denver's Fat Lever with more than 100 steals, 200 rebounds and  300 assists.  </P> <P> Guard, Winston Garland, Golden State -- Chris Mullin and Mitch Richmond have  received most of the publicity, but the second-year guard has been instrumental  in the Warriors' stunning about-face. Garland, who was waived twice as a  rookie, leads the team in assists and steals while averaging more than 15  points and just 2.5 turnovers.  </P> <P> Pearl Washington is having so much trouble keeping his weight down that Miami  Heat public relations men should consider changing his name to Pearl Harbor.  </P> <P> Washington, who has been hobbled by a groin pull for most of the season,  apparently is healthy enough to resume playing. But Miami's coaches won't  reactivate him until he gets his weight down to an acceptable level.  </P> <P> The former Syracuse star is listed officially as 200 pounds, but he was tipping  the scales at 213 last week and is still seven to 10 pounds overweight. So he  remains on the injured list. Washington missed 10 games with the groin injury  in December. After returning for five games, he reinjured it and has missed 17  games since.  </P> <P> "It's a major concern," said Miami Coach Ron Rothstein, "because if he's not at  the prescribed weight, he's only going to get hurt again. It's a very tender  situation for him. Weight has always been a problem, and if he's going to do  anything, he has to learn. What's the sense of putting him out on the floor  with the extra weight so he can pull his groin again?"  </P> <P> Washington is in the final year of the original three-year deal he signed with  the Nets. He's also in the final year of a sneaker contract, and his future  never has seemed cloudier.  </P> <P> Losing to the Nets sure brings out the worst in a team. After Seattle lost at  the Meadowlands Tuesday night -- the Sonics' second loss to the Nets in eight  days -- Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel got into a shouting match that caused  Coach Bernie Bickerstaff to close the locker room to reporters.  </P> <P> McDaniel said he took exception to comments Ellis had made about his teammates  after the 109-99 loss.  </P> <P> "I wasn't speaking for myself, I was speaking for me and my teammates,"  McDaniel explained. "When someone says his teammates don't have heart, that  they're sissies, he's singling himself out from the team, as if he's the only  one who has heart and is the only one out there winning.  </P> <P> "Yes, he's scoring a lot of points," McDaniel said of Ellis, the NBA's  third-leading scorer, "but if people like me don't set picks and rebound, he  doesn't get those points. ... I just don't think another player should say  anything like that. It's putting me down and putting the rest of the players  down."  </P> <P> This hasn't been an easy season for McDaniel. A year ago at this time, he was  averaging 24.3 points and 7.7 rebounds, shooting 51.8 percent from the floor  and heading for the All-Star Game for the first time. But he injured his knee  soon after, slumped badly the rest of the season and became a sixth man this  season.  </P> <P> With his playing time reduced to 28 minutes, he's averaging only 18.6 points  and 5.3 rebounds on 46.9 percent shooting. And Ellis has supplanted him as  Seattle's All-Star representative.  </P> <P> McDaniel: "I accepted the position, and there's nothing else I can do."  </P> <P> Golden State's Manute Bol was shooting 27.8 percent (5 for 18) from three-point  land, a better percentage than Chris Mullin (19.1 percent), Isiah Thomas  (25.0), Gerald Wilkins (25.3) and Michael Jordan (25.0).  </P></p>

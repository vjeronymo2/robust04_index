			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italy banks discuss takeover CREDITO Commerciale, a leading north Italian regional bank controlled by the Sienna-based Monte dei Paschi group, may be taken over by a big northern savings bank. Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza, the public-sector savings bank covering the two cities, has offered L6,400 a share for the 64 per cent stake in Credito Commerciale held by Monte dei Paschi. After an obligatory tender offer for the minorities, the deal is set to cost the buyer about L435bn (Dollars 260.6m). The offer is almost three times Credito Commerciale's suspension price of L2,340. Credito Commerciale, which specialises in trade finance, had total deposits of L5,494bn at the end of last year. However, earnings have plunged because of heavy provisions. Net profits in 1992 were just L3bn, while its first-half 1993 loss was about L50bn. If the deal goes through, it will mark the second attempted consolidation of Italy's patchwork of regional banks in a matter of weeks. Earler this month, Banca Popolare di Verona, a listed regional bank, launched a hostile bid for Modena's big Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero. After being rejected by the Modena bank's board, the Verona bank this week increased its offer by L20,000 to L200,000 a share.</p>

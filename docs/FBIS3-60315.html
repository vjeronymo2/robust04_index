			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brice Lalonde Recommends Creation </F> of Environment Council for GATT"]    [Text] Charged by Edouard Balladur with a "study and  proposal assignment," related to the Uruguay Round negotiations,  on "the relationship between trade and the environment," the  chairman of the Generation Ecologie [Ecological Generation]  party Brice Lalonde submitted a report to the prime minister on  Thursday, December 9 entitled "Injecting an Ecological Aspect  Into the Rules of International Trade."    In this document, the Generation Ecologie chairman first  states that GATT "does not intend making environmental  protection its watchword, but is instead interested in it  because it might upset trade. This negative approach ... is not  acceptable. GATT must recognize that it is a legitimate cause  to want to protect the environment and to examine how trade can  harm or contribute to this protection."    In this context, Brice Lalonde recommends that "an  environmental council be created" for GATT, "or for its  successor, the world trade organization." With a view to  creating this new council, his report proposes that "whatever  the outcome of the Uruguay Round on 15 December," negotiators  should "remain at the negotiating table to ensure that the  signatory states take a decision (or make a statement)  concerning the launch of a working program for the environment."  He continued: "This decision or declaration must be made when  the agreement is officially signed in Marrakesh in April. It  should therefore be ready, together with its working program, by  this date."    The former environment minister defined a 10-point working  program built on the following principles: Begin studies into  the environmental impact of the trade agreements; codify the  environmental protection measures which affect trade; draw up  procedures for the establishment or acceptance of standards;  define the ecological limits of fair competition; authorize  preferential agreements that favor ecology; and organize, when  the environment is threatened, the legal examination and  settlement of disputes within a strengthened institution.    When he presented his report to the press, Brice Lalonde  made  it clear that the prime minister had agreed with the idea of  creating an environment council.</p>

Ivan Rybkin is  visiting Finland at the head of a Russian parliamentary  delegation.    During the discussion the two sides expressed concern over  mounting tensions in Bosnia and voiced their common viewpoint  view that the conflict in former Yugoslavia must be settled  through negotiations and not through the use of force. Ivan  Rybkin stressed that any use of military force can only be  permitted with UN approval and following mandatory consultations  with all permanent members of the UN Security Council.

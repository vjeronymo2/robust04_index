			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Late Tuesday [12  April] Izetbegovic questioned Rose's assertion that Moslem  soldiers inside Gorazde had shelled Bosnian Serb positions.    "We have sufficient reasons to doubt the reliability of  General Rose's sources," the Bosnian president said in a  statement.    He also criticised the fact that Rose had not specified  whether the Moslem mortar fire had been in response to a Serb  attack or a defensive manoeuvre.    Izetbegovic said UNPROFOR had "systematically... denied"  Bosnian reports on the serious nature of the Serb offensive  against Gorazde, adding that the NATO air strikes had been  launched too late and that their "limited and selective nature  has only encouraged the enemy."    Serb shells had killed 23 people in Gorazde Monday, he said.    Izetbegovic said he was willing to return to the negotiating  table provided Serbs withdrew from all areas of the eastern  Bosnian enclave they had conquered and a political solution was  found which did not legitimise "the occupation of Bosnia."</p>

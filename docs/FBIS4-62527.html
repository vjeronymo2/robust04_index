			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 92 (582): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The head of state Eduard Shevardnadze has turned  down the accusations of the opposition which saw encroachments  on the territorial integrity of Georgia in the Georgian-Abkhaz  agreement signed last Saturday [14 May] in Moscow. He said  there is not a word about the sovereignty or state system of  Abkhazia in the document.    He said the problem would be resolved later and Abkhazia  would get a new political status, but within integral Georgia.    Shevardnadze also denied the speculations of his opponents  in  parliaments claiming that Russia wants to send its troops to the  conflict zone to secure the independence of Abkhazia and its  separation from Georgia. He declared that divided Georgia is  not in the interests of Russia and expressed confidence that in  the near future Abkhazia would be returned.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: At the talks that ended in Moscow on 14  May the Georgian and Abkhaz delegations agreed on the separation  of troops and deployment of a CIS peace-keeping force on the  confrontation line. Under the agreement, the formations of the  two sides should withdraw 12 km from the Inguri river thus  forming a 24 km buffer zone that will be occupied by the  peace-keepers.    According to a member of the Abkhazian delegation, a special  envoy of the chairman of the Abkhaz parliament Andrey Jergenia,  Russia troops are most likely to become the separating force.  He said that the deployment of the peace-keeping force should  be completed by the end of May. There will be a total of 2500  to 3000 peace-keepers. Russian units stationed in Abkhazia will  be used among others. Jergenia said the Georgian side insisted  on including in the agreement a provision on the patrolling of  Kodor canyon in Abkhazia by peace-keepers.    In an interview with local television Shevardnadze also said  that if the Georgian delegation had refused to sign the  cease-fire agreement in Moscow on which Georgian MP's insisted,  it would mean that Georgia was giving up a peaceful settlement  and opting for a military solution. Shevardnadze is convinced  that Georgia could not afford that either morally or from the  viewpoint of its possibilities.    IF Note: The decision of parliament prohibiting the Georgian  delegation to sign any documents in Moscow had no legal force  because in making it the parliament exceeded its powers. Under  acting legislation, the head of state has the right to hold  talks and sign any documents on behalf of the country. The  powers were given to Shevardnadze by the parliament.    In an interview with INTERFAX the opposition leader Boris  Kakubava said that the disregard for the decision of parliament  means complete arbitrariness of the authorities. He believes it  is impossible to speak of any democracy in Georgia after the  binding agreement was signed in Moscow.    Speaking of the essence of the agreement Kakubava declared  that it allowed the Abkhazian side to legalize the genocide of  Georgians and wrote off thousands of lost lives. He said:"Our  organization, the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia that  represents the interests of the overwhelming majority of  refugees from Abkhazia cannot agree to that. We have our own  road back to Abkhazia."    At the press center of the Georgian Defence Ministry  INTERFAX  was told that the armed forces will carry out any orders from  the head of state and Supreme Commander Eduard Shevardnadze.  Troops and military hardware will be withdrawn from the Inguri  river and a buffer zone will be formed that will be occupied by  a peace-making force, a press center official said.    In a traditional Monday radio interview Shevardnadze called  the Moscow agreement a practical foundation for the return of  refugees to Abkhazia. He said the process would not be long.    Shevardnadze said a plan of sending a peace-keeping force to  the conflict zone is being made which gives an especially active  role to Russia. In the nearest future the plan is going to be  discussed by the UN Security Council and the CIS Collective  Security Council. The Georgian leader hoped for support from  both organizations.    Shevardnadze described the activities of parliament as  confrontational and said that different political groups are  demanding early parliamentary elections. He said the question  is raised by the opposition as well as the Union of Georgian  Citizens he heads. "The question is open so far. My stand is  going to largely depend on the degree of constructiveness of the  parliament," Shevardnadze said.    According to the Georgian leader, certain social groups,  intellectuals in particular, demand stronger executive power  with the purpose of restoring order in the country.  Shevardnadze said that today he favors greater toughness and  responsibility.    On the coming visit to Tbilisi by the president of  Azerbaijan  Shevardnadze said that the talks will center mainly around the  situation in the Caucasus and ways of resolving local problems  as well as bilateral relations which he said are developing  perfectly.    "I think that a dialogue on the situation in the Caucasus  should become regular between the leaders of Georgia, Armenia,  Azerbaijan and Russia," Shevardnadze said.</p>

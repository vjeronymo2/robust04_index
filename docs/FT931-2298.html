			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The Long View: Living Pounds 1,000 beyond our means THIS WEEK the Budget Red Book truly lived up to its unofficial name, showing projected deficits on a scale not seen since the 1970s. The government that was once committed to a balanced budget is set to borrow Pounds 50bn (some 8 per cent of gross domestic product) in the coming financial year and on its central projection will still be borrowing at the rate of Pounds 30bn a year (nearly 4 per cent of GDP) in 1997-98. Whereas last year, just before the election, the Treasury projected a return to medium-term balance on the basis of incredible economic growth assumptions, this time the growth looks more plausible but the borrowing is unbelievable. In practice it will all work out some other way, and that certainly appeared to be the assumption in the gilt-edged market which scarcely batted an eyelid this week at the prospect of perhaps Pounds 140bn of net new issues being unloaded on to it over the next four years, doubling the volume of outstanding paper. Perhaps, indeed, the adjustment will take place through deep cuts in public spending, or extension of VAT to newspapers, children's clothing and a lot more, or by some other means which gilt holders would also view enthusiastically. But there are darker possibilities. Taken literally, the prediction of a 2 per cent inflation rate at the end of the 1990s implies that the government proposes to borrow at a real rate of some 6 per cent when it issues fixed income gilts (although it can get away with about 3 1/2 per cent on index-linkers). When a country borrows at a real interest rate greater than the rate of economic growth the burden of the debt will keep on growing even if the budget returns to balance. Debt is rarely repaid on any scale, so in these circumstances eventual default is almost inevitable, usually achieved behind the smokescreen of restructuring or inflation. This week Norman Lamont required future generations of British taxpayers to assume the burden of the nearly Pounds 1,000 a head by which we propose, as a nation, to live beyond our means in 1993-94. Those future taxpayers have not had the opportunity to give their consent, and they may decline to pay. True, some unexpected bonus, such as a surge of economic growth, may yet retrieve the situation. The budget deficit melted away in the late 1980s, in an unpredicted way. The overall debt burden does not yet compare with that of, say, Italy. Those sturdy British citizens of the next millennium may grit their teeth and dutifully pay the postponed taxes of the wretched victims of the 1990s depression. It is more likely, however, that we will face some kind of capital market discontinuity, of which there are two excellent examples in recent British history. One was in 1976 when Denis Healey as Labour chancellor was manfully attempting to run deficits which would offset the vast surpluses of the oil-producing countries. The 1975-76 budget deficit reached Pounds 10.3bn, or 9 per cent of GDP, and the first estimate of the borrowing requirement for 1976-77 was Pounds 12bn (the equivalent of Pounds 60bn in relation to the UK's current money GDP). The trade deficit appeared to be running at 1.5 per cent of GDP (actually less than the near 3 per cent current account deficit now officially forecast for 1993). In the end the markets concluded that the strategy was unbelievable. Gilt-edged investors went on strike, the stock market went into free fall and sterling collapsed. By September Healey had to call in the IMF. The irony of it all was that the figures were hopelessly pessimistic; in the end the PSBR was little more than Pounds 8bn and the trade gap was less than 1 per cent of GDP. The other example came only last year when the UK's position within the European exchange rate mechanism became unsustainable. To hold sterling's parity against the D-Mark interest rates needed to be very high, but the British economy was not strong enough to cope. An attempt to raise rates then became, once again, unbelievable. At that time the crisis revolved around short-term interest rates and the foreign exchange market. The future problem would centre upon long-term rates and the debt market, but might be essentially similar in its nature: investors would require higher rates in order to take up the ever-mounting debt, but the future burden of higher borrowing costs would appear impossible for a sluggish economy to sustain. The positive aspect of all this is that out of crisis can come common sense. In 1976 and 1992 the collapse of confidence in the financial markets forced the politicians to abandon dangerous policies. Norman Lamont,too, might need to be forced into prudence. In late 1976 and early 1977 there was an astonishing turnround in sentiment as the markets responded to the spending cuts required by the IMF. In 1993 the markets are assuming, quite reasonably, that the Red Book projections imply that eventual corrective action will be triggered. However, in certain respects Lamont, burdened by 3m unemployed and an elusive recovery, is worse off than Healey, who had to contend only with just 1.3m jobless (though this was a high figure at the time) and who - whatever the environment of financial crisis - luxuriated in an economic growth rate of 3.7 per cent for calendar 1976. Might a future chancellor, like Lamont last year, be tempted or even forced to break out of his straitjacket? He would do it this time by suspending the full funding rule entirely, inflating the money supply and going for growth on the basis of a weakening exchange rate. He would no doubt be idolised by the tabloid press, which this week viewed Lamont's tax increases, deferred though they were, with grotesque alarm. But he would still need to borrow and could never escape the grip of the markets. The Red Book is surely overdoing the red ink.

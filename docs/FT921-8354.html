			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (8): Crucial strategic connection - The Northern Development Company THE connection between Northumbrian Spring Water and Nissan may not be immediately obvious, but it is strategic and has proved crucial to the reconstruction of Tyne and Wear's economy. The water is a local bottled brand and is what Dr John Bridge offers from the fridge in his Newcastle office to visitors who feel in need of a Perrier. Dr Bridge is chief executive of the Northern Development Company (NDC). Inward investment is his main business. Inward investment is itself about import substitution, which in turn concerns not only large items such as cars and the factories that make them, but everything needed to make the inward investment work: labour, professional services, components, and office or canteen supplies, including bottled water. Hence the link. Its importance, however, is that it is no accident, but the result of a deliberate policy prosecuted vigorously by the NDC. 'Local sourcing is critical to developing the local economy and maximising the numbers of jobs generated by any inward investment,' Dr Bridge says. 'We are not just pushing sites and factories, but making sure a local supplier network is in place when inward investment comes in.' The NDC evolved from the North of England Development Council (NEDC) in the wake of Nissan's arrival. The NEDC, regional agency for the government-backed Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB), worked closely with local authorities to win Nissan. The impressive display of teamwork was one of the reasons why Nissan chose Tyne and Wear rather than competing areas where local unity was less apparent. By 1987, the government was encouraging the formation of the NDC as the archetypal development agency it wanted to see for an English region, with core funding from the IBB to market abroad, plus additional financial support from county and borough councils and private sector subscribers . That the experiment has worked is apparent all over a northern economic region covering Tyne and Wear, Teesside, Northumberland, Durham and Cumbria  -the NDC's territory. Two strategic investments in four years  - Nissan in Tyne and Wear and Fujitsu in County Durham - have been followed or accompanied by a substantial filling-in of the regional economy to service them. The number of Japanese companies in north-east England is approaching 50. Dr Bridge puts the value of their investment at Pounds 1.7bn and 12,000 direct jobs so far. 'We have our mechanism for attracting inward investment pretty well established and generating results,' he says. 'Now we are putting more resources into Korea and Taiwan and this is bearing fruit. 'This region needs one really strategic investment every four or five years. We had Nissan in 1986, Fujitsu in 1990. We are now looking for Pounds 500m and 1,000 jobs by about 1994.' It is the coherence of its strategic economic overview and the generally enthusiastic support for its policies from local authorities, industry and commerce that marks the NDC out from similar bodies in England. It is not all about inward investment: the NDC encouraged a local supplier network for an indigenous and burgeoning offshore industry that has created several thousand jobs in Tyne and Wear alone. It has also pulled together local chambers of commerce and academics to produce a reasonably accurate quarterly survey of regional economic trends. About 400 private sector companies pay as much as Pounds 200 a year each to the NDC. Sponsorship by some of them of individual events, promotions, conferences and seminars has dropped off in the recession, but the base of monetary and moral support is intact. The total budget of about Pounds 4.5m comes mainly from the government via the IBB and local authorities. Not everything is smooth: Sunderland recently sent its own civic delegation to the Far East and a sub-committee has since concluded the NDC's regionwide, broad brush approach makes the town too passive in trying to win new jobs, so that it is not automatically included on every potential investor's shortlist. Sunderland is therefore considering 'enhancing our competitiveness by intervening more directly in the inward investment market.' This looks like a breaking of the ranks that have given the north real clout in a competitive international market, but Dr Bridge is unfazed. His experience is that working the Far East in particular is costly, requiring continuous effort by permanent staff in established offices. 'If a local authority has the resources and wants to send some councillors and their wives on a trip, that's fine,' he says. Economies of scale will almost certainly decide the issue, especially since the NDC is an economy of scale in itself. For example, it has two civil servants from the Department of Trade and Industry based in Great North House, the NDC headquarters. 'We are trying to make sure we all avoid duplication of effort,' Dr Bridge says.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lessons at Lloyd's There will be no flood of corporate capital to fill the vacuum caused by Lloyd's ruinous losses. By reducing the expected underwriting capacity in the second half of the decade, its business plan recognises as much. If the target 20 per cent rate of return on incorporated capital can be achieved, though, corporate members will doubtless come forward. The overdue cost-cutting and centralisation proposed yesterday should give underwriters a better chance of delivering on that score. But Lloyd's cannot hope to attract much capital of any variety until past pollution and liability risks have been ring-fenced. That will entail a full audit of liabilities and reserves right across the market. Tax and regulatory hurdles must then be overcome before the new holding company can be set up. Even then, the security of the ring-fence will turn on the unpredictable level of awards made by US courts. All but the most speculative providers of capital will take time to convince. Insurance companies which already write international risks - using their own underwriters - may anyway see few advantages in Lloyd's membership. Selling a Lloyd's unit trust will hardly be easy against the sorry backdrop of losses and litigation. Specialist providers of risk capital and private equity funds are thus more likely sources. Most pension funds devote a small portion of their assets to such high-risk ventures. But, if the mistakes of the 1980s are not to be repeated, some scarcity of capital is a good thing. The ability of Lloyd's executive to ration the inflow of capital may ultimately be the most important innovation of all.</p>

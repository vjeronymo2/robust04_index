			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / MPs fault sale of bus company THE GOVERNMENT may have sold parts of the state-owned National Bus Company too cheaply and should have done more to ensure competition, according to a report published yesterday by the House of Commons public accounts committee, writes Neil Buckley. The report says the taxpayer may not have received full benefit from the sale of National Bus, which controlled 50 per cent of bus mileage in England and Wales before it was privatised as 72 subsidiaries after the government's deregulation of bus routes in 1985. Some subsidiaries were sold to single bidders without valuations being carried out.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vo Tran Chi, member of the Political Bureau </F> and secretary of Ho Chi Minh City party committee, by SAIGON  GIAI PHONG correspondent Van Dinh on "political stability as the  preliminary condition for socioeconomic development" -- place  and date not given]    [Text] [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: The mid-term national  party congress has pointed out four dangers. How does the city  view these dangers?    [Vo Tran Chi] All four dangers raise issues of equal  importance and are interrelated. Therefore, concentrated  efforts must be made to overcome them. Given the  characteristics of the city, however, top priority must be given  to efforts to overcome the danger posed by the peaceful  evolution scheme. Hostile forces are implementing their  peaceful evolution scheme on a nationwide basis. Ho Chi Minh  City, however, is regarded as a key target because it has all  the conditions for the enemy to undermine our political,  economic, cultural, ideological, and organizational structures.    Furthermore, it is the objective of the peaceful evolution  scheme to cause political instability. Meanwhile, political  stability is the preliminary condition for socioeconomic  development. Only when political stability is maintained can  people throughout the country have a sense of security while  engaging in business activities and accelerating socioeconomic  development. Political stability is also the preliminary  condition for encouraging foreign countries to make bold  investments.    [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: That is the preliminary condition.  Are there any other conditions?    [Vo Tran Chi] It is necessary to build a sound socioeconomic  infrastructure. Socioeconomic infrastructure here means  policies, laws, discipline, management mechanisms, and personnel  who are competent and highly qualified for the overall  development on the socioeconomic and political fronts.    [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: What should the city do to overcome  the danger of being left farther behind economically?    [Vo Tran Chi] Intensive efforts must be made to effect  economic restructuring based on the need for industrialization  and modernization. Ours is an industrial city, but there still  remains much room for improvement. In my opinion, as far as the  1994-95 period is concerned, drastic efforts must be made to  improve technology, increase production output, and enhance  economic efficiency. It is necessary to take practical measures  to effect agricultural industrialization, thereby creating  enough strength to promote socioeconomic development in the  entire city and in surrounding areas.    [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: To this end, what is the most  decisive factor for success?    [Vo Tran Chi] First of all, it is necessary to strengthen  and  enhance the leading role of the city party organization and the  efficiency of state management agencies. Past experiences show  that correct policies trigger quick responses from the masses  and help rally the people around the party and make them act  according to party policies and lines. Those policies guarantee  both the common interests of the collective and the personal  interests of each member of society.    In addition to correct policies, it is necessary to conduct  propaganda activities, organize implementation, draw  experiences, and make amendments to keep those policies more  consistent with real life situations.    Furthermore, it is very important for the party  organization,  cadres, and party members to maintain firmly their political  qualifications and socialist orientations. Therefore, it is  necessary to consolidate grassroots party organizations and make  them pure, firm, and strong so they can assume an overall  leadership role in the new stage.    [Van Dinh] Thank you, comrade.</p>

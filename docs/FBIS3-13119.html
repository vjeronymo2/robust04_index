			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F> Tunis by Mehmet Ali Birand-- live; from the 32d program, in  English with simultaneous translation into Turkish]    [Text] [Birand] Mr. Chairman, thank you for sparing your  time tonight for us. We have seen very horrible pictures from  the occupied territories. Now, does that mean that this is the  end of the negotiations with Israel, the end of the peace  process?    ['Arafat] Firstly, with all efforts with the Arabs, with the  Muslims, with the nonaligned movement, with the Europeans, we  want to have a strong resolution in the Security Council.  Eleven days have passed without being able to achieve this  result. I ask: Why? Because there is U.S. opposition, and U.S.  support now of the Israeli point of view, especially concerning  Jerusalem and concerning the international protection, the  mechanism of this international protection.    [Birand] Mr. Chairman, will you be going back to the  negotiating table after this resolution?    ['Arafat] I was informed by Mr. Christopher about the  invitation which was offered to us by President Clinton. We are  not against it, but first of all we have to protect our people.  We have to give them tranquillity and security.    [Birand] Yes, so if I understand correctly, you need from  the Israeli side protection.    ['Arafat] From the international, not only from the Israeli  side.    [Birand] And then you will start again negotiations, after  you achieve this protection and after the UN Security Council  passes a resolution? Is that correct?    ['Arafat] Not only that. Are we going only to take pictures  like the last time, or will we implement what has been agreed  upon? Everyone is informed about the maneuvering of the  Israelis. Till now they did not.... [pauses] They are trying  to make time and not to implement what has been agreed upon and  what has been signed in the White House.    [Birand] Palestinians are accusing you of naively believing  the Zionists.    ['Arafat] This is not a personal matter. Of course, we all  have opposition, and we are proud of our democracy, and  everybody has the right to express openly his point of view  against our will. As [name indistinct] has mentioned, God bless  he who criticizes me.    [Birand] Do you think that the peace process might again be  revived, or do you think that it is over now?    ['Arafat] You see, what is important now is that we are in  need of international involvement, especially from the [word  indistinct] Russia and the United States; from the European  Union; and from our brothers, the Muslims; from our brothers,  the Arabs; from our brothers, the Nonaligned Movement; from all  our friends all over the world. We need their support, their  strong and complete support so that our people can feel safe,  secure, and the tranquillity of the peace process will be [word  indistinct].    [Birand] Thank you very much.</p>

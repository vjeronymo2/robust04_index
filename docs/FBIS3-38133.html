			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] At Saint-Ouen, site since last Tuesday [18  January] of the 28th Congress of the French Communist Party, a  new generation has taken over. The National Committee has made  its choice, and as Alain Bocquet, MP [member of parliament] for  the Nord [department] has just announced, it chose Robert Hue.  Many people think that there will be no change. Robert Hue is  known as a man of the Party apparatus, whose rise is relatively  recent. [passage omitted] Robert Hue had been a member of the  political bureau since the last Party congress in 1990. He is;  nevertheless, an old communist, having joined the Party at 18,  in 1964. [passage omitted] He is mayor of  Montigny-les-Cormeilles [in the Val d'Oise department].</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhong Weiguang, (0112 4850 0342), Chinese </F> scholar in Germany: "Thaw Literature Struggles To Break Free  From Ideology"]    [Text] Forty years of CPC rule on the mainland has  destroyed more than cultural relics, physical landscape, and  material production. Most catastrophic is the destruction it has  wrought on China's fine tradition, more accurately, the best  things in human tradition: Sound moral values and a robust  ability to distinguish truth from falsehood. What makes it worse  is that these statements apply not only to the masses, but also  to intellectuals, and not just conservative intellectuals, but  so-called advanced and radical intellectuals as well. Communist  rule totally stripped almost two entire generations of  intellectuals of a moral sense of honor and disgrace. This is  precisely why the sins of the party remain unforgivable even  after a thousand years.    As far as the mainland intellectual is concerned, upon  re-entering the world following the political thaw, his foremost  mission is to do some self-examination, regain his ability to  think properly, and return to the right starting point. However,  the developments in the past decade have not been totally  satisfactory. What really accounts for this state of affairs? In  my opinion, the most important reason is that people have lost  their spirit of honest self-examination. The overwhelming  majority of mainland intellectuals have grown accustomed to the  dogmatic self-righteous Marxist way of criticizing the world. We  cannot expect Chinese intellectuals to regain on their own the  self-doubting spirit of the modern theory of knowledge  overnight. Moreover, the mainland having been isolated for  years, not only was there a lack of communication with the  outside world, but the two generations of intellectuals have  completely lost their foreign linguistic abilities. In the early  days of openness, therefore, the mainland was a society with an  extremely limited capacity for interacting with the rest of the  world. Having said that, China is a vast country with much  living space for the above-mentioned intellectuals. Moreover,  eventually the world must wake up to China's existence. In a  sense, therefore, international exchange had a negative result  in that it encourages parochial arrogance, complacency, and  conservatism among Chinese intellectuals. Third, because they  speak the same language and with their capacity for healthy  change that comes from being part of the world, Chinese  intellectuals in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas should have  been a powerful driving force and catalyst for change in the  intellectual world on the mainland during this brief  transitional period. That, however, has turned out to be wishful  thinking. Instead, it is Hong Kong and Taiwan which are being  engulfed in a wave of "mainland fever." Only a handful of  insightful scholars have pointed out, politely, the errors of  mainland intellectuals. But even they fail to understand why  mainland intellectuals could have made such obvious mistakes. In  reality, "mainland fever" points up some of the problems in Hong  Kong, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese community.    "Mainland fever" has directly contributed to the apathy and  arrogance of some mainland intellectuals. Even as the diehard  faction of the CPC forced them out with guns following the  collapse of the democracy movement in 1989, they still have not  done any soul-searching or established any serious contacts with  Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese scholars during their  visits to Taiwan and other countries in order to find out how  the latter approach or research an issue. They remain engrossed  in expansive specious arguments about the masculine principle  and other stuff. Compare them to the human rights movement in  Eastern Europe, to intellectuals like Havel and you see a most  striking difference.    Ma Yueran [7456 1878 3544], a Swedish Sinologist, told  Taiwan  LIAN HE PAO reporters in October 1986 that no Chinese has ever  won a Nobel Prize for literature primarily because of a  translation problem. Ever since then, the confidence of mainland  writers has been on the rise on a daily basis. Just about  everyone believes he is world-class. How pertinent are Ma  Yueran's comments? Or do they merely show that he still lacks a  genuine feel for the Chinese language, that as a Sinologist he  is on shaky ground as soon as he starts talking about poetry and  literature? Be that as it may, because of his unique standing,  his remarks had a big impact on the literary community in  mainland China. What he said also raises such questions as: How  should we look at mainland literature today? How should we  interpret literature? I would like to discuss these questions by  comparing contemporary Chinese literature to that of Eastern  Europe because the new generation of writers and poets on the  mainland that I know well, represented by TODAY, as well as  myself have been deeply influenced by the thaw literature of  Eastern Europe, especially the Soviet Union, as we were growing  up in the early 1970's. Relying on nothing more than the  translations of a handful of Eastern and Western European works  that were supposedly for internal reference only, they slowly  completed a major change in life, becoming in the process a more  healthy force of the mainland intelligentsia in the 1980's.    If literature embodies the pursuit of man, great literature  can come about even under centralized communist rule. This kind  of literature also sheds light on the pursuit of eternity. It  reveals for all to see the conflicts between man and society in  this environment, the tragedy of human nature, and the price man  pays for his conscience and ideals. Certainly, it takes courage  and resolve to produce this kind of literature. The writer must  be able to withstand the many forms of oppression, corrosion,  and enslavement by the communist ideology, to the extent of  sacrificing his own well-being and perhaps even his life. This  is precisely the attribute of the current generation of Soviet  writers. Without their suffering, their indomitable will, their  efforts on behalf of the preservation of humanity, the Soviet  Union could never have produced thaw literature, a great  literature that transcends time and space. The glory of thaw  literature is that it keeps alive and continues a great literary  tradition and preserves the true pursuit of man. It has  profoundly influenced not only contemporary Soviet society but  also Soviet literature in the 1970's and 1980's, as well as the  pursuit of human rights, democracy, and ideals by the Soviet  people. Face to face with such literature, how can we not  overflow with respect? How can we not examine our conscience? To  defend our timidity in front of such literature only proves our  own insignificance.  <H5>  The Thawing of Chinese Literature </H5>   Yet the same communist system, the same Marxist ideology has  produced a very different literature and art on mainland China  vis-a-vis that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Instead  of ignoring it, we should think long and hard about this  distinction.    The foremost distinction between the mainland, on the one  hand, and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, on the other, is  that there has simply been no genuinely creative art and  literature on the mainland since 1949. Set aside our sentimental  ties to modern writers and survey the scene from a historical  perspective level-headedly, and we can see that just about all  literary works of this era are the mark of shame of their  creators, the very proof of their servility, the aid they have  given to the tyrant to do evil, and their ignorance. Even those  so-called artists who were denounced and persecuted because of  infighting within the CPC could not hide this kind of shame.    Since 1949 everything on the mainland--literature, painting,  music, movies--has been thoroughly ideologized. Just about every  work became a form of propaganda publicizing the dogmatic  principles of the communist ideology. The "theme first" rule did  nothing more than give pride of place to a bunch of dogmatic  principles. All human impulses were suppressed and stifled. An  artist or writer might change his method of creation, choosing  between realism and romanticism, but he must subordinate himself  to the dogma. In the course of subordinating himself to the  dogma, romanticism was looked upon less favorably than realism.  Yet modernist art has never successfully found a foothold for  itself in any communist nation because its core conflicts with  the dogmatic principles. Not that the dogma is immutable, of  course. In the 1950's, it was the Great Leap Forward and  "socialism is good." In the 1960's, it was the anti-right  tendency and class struggle. In the 1970's, it was "criticize  Lin Biao [2651 1735] and Confucius" and the "Cultural Revolution  is good." In the 1980's, it was reform and the open policy.  While some principles are mutually contradictory, it does not  mean that they are not ideologized works. Highly representative  in this aspect are Zhang Yinliang [1728 6343 0081], the  so-called famous mainland writer, and Xie Jin [6200 2516], the  film director. Neither scar literature nor a majority of works  of the 1980's which advocated reform and opening up basically  broke free from this mold.    Existing side by side with this kind of propaganda were the  subservience and shameless obsequiousness of writers and artists  to the CPC and a handful of CPC leaders. Their ingratiation  pervaded almost all their so-called artistic works, their  humanity and dignity utterly lost. They sang the praise of Mao  Zedong and CPC in the 1950's and added Lin Biao and the Cultural  Revolution to the list in the 1960's. In the 1970's they lauded  Zhou Enlai and, in the 1980's, Deng Xiaoping and the reform  faction. From writers who rode high such as Guo Meiruo [6753  3106 5387], Mao Dun [5403 4163], and Cao Yu [2580 4417] to those  who were persecuted to death like Ding Ling [0002 3781], Tian  Han [3944 3352] and Lao She [5071 5287], they all behaved in a  revolting manner.    To explain this phenomenon, we need to do more than compare  the relative brutality of different communist parties. This is  because it is hard to prove who was more brutal, Stalin, Mao  Zedong, or Deng Xiaoping. When good rises one foot, evil rises  ten feet. Others say, when evil rises one foot, good rises ten  feet. There are uniquely Chinese factors behind this phenomenon.  I think the foremost reason is that the Chinese literary  tradition is still highly fragile. Although it has produced a  number of writers of a high caliber since the 1920's and 1930's,  in overall qualitative and quantitative terms Chinese literature  is no match for its Soviet and Eastern European counterparts.  Judging from the way they deal with the pursuit of man at a  deeper level from a modern angle, only a tiny handful of Chinese  writers such as Lu Xun [7627 3065] are in the same league as  great Russian writers with a pioneering spirit. The pain and  impulses of the majority of writers are still not intense or  profound enough. In a certain sense, the very fact that many  intellectuals sided in the 1930's and 1940's points up their  weak foundation. All this explains why the artistic and literary  community utterly failed to stand up to bad Stalinist literature  after 1949.    Another important reason the literary and artistic thought  of  Stalin, Zhdanov, and Mao Zedong managed to march straight into  China and ride roughshod over it is that the older generation of  intellectuals did not have a firm philosophy of life or moral  values. Besides the writers mentioned above, also guilty were  Zang Kejia [5258 0344 1367], Feng Xuefeng [7458 7185 1496] and  even Wang Meng [3769 5536]. A tiniest handful of writers with  the least bit of conscience either stopped writing or did some  translation, there being no other choice. Even then they were  criticized and persecuted to death. One example was Mr. Fu Lei  [0265 7191]. The ideologization off literature on the mainland  went totally unchallenged and true literature and the true  pursuit of man almost vanished without a trace.    One of the most insidious consequences of the ideologization  of literature is that it rendered almost two generations  essentially ignorant of true literature. For three full decades,  art and literature on the mainland were fully ideologized,  people lost their ability to distinguish between truth and  falsehood, good and evil, and all human impulses and pursuits  were ideologized. Herein lies one reason why human nature on the  mainland has been distorted, something which many people have  found it hard to understand. A much-discussed topic in recent  years is the "impotence" of mainland intellectuals. In reality  the problem with the current generation of writers and artists  is "castration," not just "impotence." And this brings us to the  second major distinction between the mainland and Eastern  Europe: While the thawing of literature has produced a great  thaw literature in Eastern Europe, the thawing of literature on  the mainland only means that literature is being removed from  politics and ideology and enters a transition to true literature.    The break from the intra-party line struggle and the pursuit  of the liberation of man first began on the Democracy Wall at  Xidan in Beijing in 1979. A handful of young literary and  artistic workers represented by TODAY and the "Xingxing" art  show introduced a breath of fresh air into China's literary  world. A break was made with the past three decades and a new  exploration was on. This process can be traced all the way to  the early 1970's. At that time the CPC was playing tricks left  and right with no attempt at all to cover up its deception. For  their part, the writers were in the midst of their transition  from adolescence, having gone through the frustration of being  sent to work in the countryside and mountain areas. It was in  that culturally barren era that they stumbled upon a host of  translated works intended for internal criticism, the so-called  "yellow books" and "grey books." (The covers of these titles  were either yellow, in the case of works on art and literature,  or grey, in the case of books on politics, economics, history,  and philosophy.) Among them were modern Western classics by such  writers as Sartre and Jia Miu [0502 6208] along with a large  collection of so-called revisionist writings and other works of  thaw literature from Eastern Europe. As they read and copied the  new literature, the writers gradually found a new direction. It  is undeniable of course that three decades of CPC education had  left a deep scar and created many shortcomings that cannot be  corrected.  <H5>  Inherent Weaknesses Of Mainland Writers </H5>   Energized by the new literature, the world of letters on the  mainland showed a trace of life in the early 1980's. However,  except for a handful of works by some writers typified by TODAY,  the so-called introspection writings remained ideologized. The  only thing that had changed was the title. In sharp contrast to  the thaw literature of the Soviet Union, which demonstrated an  individualism, personal rebellion and the pursuit of the  liberation of man, most works limited themselves to criticizing  so-called bad elements in the party and waxed nostalgic for the  other ideology of the CPC. This is true of many works celebrated  in literary circles both at home and abroad, for example,  "Mid-Life Crisis" by Chen Rong [6186 1369] and "Man, O Man" by  Dai Houying [2071 0624 5391]. Mr. Bai Yang [2672 2799] praised  Chen Rong's "Mid-Life Crisis" but a Polish writer read it and  made this pertinent comment, "It is the communist party. Chen  Rong wrote his novel the way he did to execute the CPC's current  party policy on intellectuals." (Bai Yang, "Dueling Words,"  Linbai Chubanshe, Taiwan, 1990, p 185) Another good example is  Mr. Liu Binyan [0491 6333 7159]. Maybe we should say Mr. Liu  Binyan is a better representative of this generation of writers.  Let us just cite one instance to illustrate this generation's  misunderstanding of literature. In the mid-1980's, Mr. Liu  Binyan more than once criticized the pursuit by young writers of  pure art, denouncing the anti-political tendency among young  people and their literature-for-literature's-sake attitude and  urging them to orient themselves to reality and society. His  criticisms, we must say, were way off the mark. Literature for  the sake of literature was precisely a sign of the loathing for  and resistance to the politicization and ideologization of  literature by the CPC. As such it presented progress. There is  an essential difference between socially concerned writers, on  the one hand, and politicians, propagandists, and agitators, on  the other. Writers are interested in human concerns, in the  human spirit and soul, at a deeper level. When the new literary  tradition takes shape and finds its place into our hearts, every  faction of the CPC would lose its appeal and every form of  dictatorship and every kind of enslavement of humanity would run  into stiff resistance. The bias of Liu Binyan and other writers  of the older generation precisely reflect how the CPC has  distorted the human spirit. What is said about Liu Binyan can be  applied to Liu Zaifu [0491 0375 1788], the other well-known  literary critic on the mainland. Despite his sharp verbal  exchanges with conservative literary theorists and despite some  new terminology, he had yet to make a clean break with the  Marxist ideology, judging from his cooperative style of writing,  his writing techniques, his line of reasoning, and his methods  of verifying an argument. Be that as it may, we were overwhelmed  with respect for them because they gave their heart and soul to  the struggle with the conservatives. It was this internal  vehement resistance, along with the open policy, that gradually  gave rise to new true literary works. Through the cracks of  intra-party struggles a new literature and true humanity slowly  matured. The literary and artistic front, we should say, is the  most promising territory for the mainland intelligentsia. In the  late 1980's a healthy literary trend gradually took shape on the  mainland. Nevertheless, because of the generation gap created by  CPC rule and the inherent weaknesses of several generations, the  new literature may not achieve overnight success. The eagerness  for quick success and instant gains and the craving for the  grandiose and pompous derived from a shallow foundation and  parochial arrogance and self-righteousness, both the byproducts  of CPC-imposed cultural isolation, continue to make themselves  felt often, preventing people from facing the world honestly and  examining themselves truly and deeply.    Even as the mainland began its pursuit of true art and  literature starting in the mid-1980's, non-literary and  non-artistic tendencies could be found everywhere. Imitation was  omnipresent, from literary genre to the way a writer carried  himself. There was no individuality, no real depth. You may say  imitation is quite harmless; coupled with arrogance, however, it  becomes downright dangerous. This phenomenon pervaded the world  of letters on the mainland in the 1980's. Zhang Zhengzhi [1728  2110 1807], for instance, imitated Aitematov but fell short. As  for writers in the Wang Shuo [3769 2592] mold, the Soviet Union  produced Akeksiaonov over 20 years ago. Those Chinese writers  searching for their roots were imitating black American writers.  "The person who writes expansively," a fashionable term used by  Bai Hua [4101 2901] and others, was lifted from a line in the  poem "Man" by the Soviet poet Meierlatelumu [phonetic],  translated from Russian in the 1960's and published for internal  circulation. Everybody was quietly influenced by it, even the  style of the illustrations in the "Stepping Into the Future"  series, but China could offer nothing that matches its  profundity. As for people like Zhang Yinliang, they are still  mired in ideology and formulism, still a long way from producing  anything that resembles true literature. Whatever the mainland  produces, we can say, others have produced a long time ago and  of a higher quality too. Mr. Li Oufan [2621 2962 2753] hit the  nail on the head when he said in late 1988, "We have yet to  produce truly moving works. Look what happened elsewhere. The  way Kundera, the exiled Czech writer, described the party and  revolution in his fiction, the reportages by Normal Mailer, the  American writer, during the Vietnam War... That sort of thing is  still a no-no in China today. I have always argued that China  does not lack the materials for great works. What it does lack  is writers of insight, courage, conscience, and artistic  talents. It all boils down to a question of vision and language.    The long years from the anti-right struggle to the Cultural  Revolution and the shadow upon shadow it cast on the psychology  of the Chinese people have left behind scars and, underneath  them, guilt. The foibles and blemishes of the Chinese national  character were fully revealed. Why hasn't a single writer so far  laid bare this big scar thoroughly and mercilessly? Following  the Holocaust, Jews produced countess literary works. Just about  everyone of them both chronicled historical facts and delved  into human feelings. In their soul-searching, the Chinese have  not made their way back to the Cultural Revolution, instead just  talking loosely about "feudal residues." To me that is escaping  one's responsibility. China's traditional culture has its  convoluted and dark aspects, but the new psychological residues  created in the 30 years after liberation should not be allowed  to take shelter behind something sweepingly called "feudalism  and tradition." (JIUSHI NIANDAI, No 12, 1986, p 81)    These non-literary and non-artistic tendencies also  exhibited  themselves in music and movies. Since 1980, the musical world on  the mainland has become increasingly interested in and even  obsessed with their rankings in a variety of international  musical competitions, both vocal and instrumental. In 1988 they  even took out a whole-page ad on the back cover of the  Chinese-language magazine ZHISHI FENZI published in the United  States. In the ad they characterized a coming concert in the  United States featuring mainland musicians as a challenge by  Chinese music to the West. This tendency worried none other than  the great violinist, Yehudi Menuhin, who wrote to his Chinese  friends, "The danger lies in trying too hard to develop  top-notch musical talent of an international caliber too  quickly. They want their musicians to excel the way their  athletes overpower their opponents at international sporting  events. But great musical performances are not like athletic  competitions. Music is unique, individual. It cannot be  quantified in terms of distance, speed, force, or weight. There  can be no Olympic champion in music. Our goal is not to defeat  others in world competitions, but to wholeheartedly demonstrate  the art we have learned." Indeed, if music is not just a hobby  but an echo of our pursuit of life, if we still remember great  maestros such as Beethoven, then slogans like Chinese music is  challenging the West is musical blasphemy.    Something similar is happening in the movie industry. From  the beginning, the younger generation of directors such as Zhang  Yimou [1728 5669 6180] has been driven precisely by a desire to  win awards in international competitions. To the extent that  this involves a departure from and resistance to past formulism  and ideologization, it is not a bad thing; at a minimum it  represents a big improvement upon those who stick to old ways  and refuse to change. But in terms of art for art's sake, we  think the spirit of an artist is missing from this generation of  directors. So in just about every literary and artistic arena  countless people are desperately searching for or resorting to  new formats. Others make much of China's national conditions and  customs, things not found elsewhere. But in philosophical and  emotional intensity and scope, they still are a far cry from art  and literature in Eastern Europe. We now have decent works and  even prize-winning works, but we have yet to produce writers and  works that really have depth. This is a fact of life today.    There is a mix of reasons why we have thus far failed to  produce works and writers that have real depth. The foremost  explanation is that we lack individuals who have an artist's  spirit. In real life it is difficult to really hide oneself  totally. Compare the works of mainland writers to those of their  Eastern European counterparts like Havel and Kundera and the  former always comes up short, whether we are looking at their  portrayal of daily life, description of political turmoil, or  their sheer powerfulness.    Another important reason why the mainland has not produced  some truly profound works and writers is that Chinese writers  have inherent weaknesses. The old educational system and  cultural environment on the mainland predetermine their  narrowness of vision and inadequate literary training. They lack  a knowledge of history, a sense of history. They either have  trouble understanding original philosophical texts or simply  have never read them. They lack linguistic skills, whether  Chinese or foreign, relying solely on translated works, which  severely limits their access to other literary works and the  nurturing derived therefrom. Given these circumstances, they  could not but find it hard to transcend their environment. This  is another reason why the current generation of writers is no  match for the generation of poets and writers represented by Xu  Zhimo [1776 1807 2302], Dai Wangshu [2071 2598 5289], Shen  Congwen [3088 1783 2429], and Lu Xun. In the era of the thaw  literature, current Chinese writers perhaps need to go back to  the 1930's to obtain a true understanding of the history of  Chinese literature and art. We have no justifiable excuses but  we do have shameful facts. We must start from ground zero in  earnest.</p>

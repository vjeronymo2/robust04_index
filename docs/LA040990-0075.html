			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON ARRAIGNMENT SET TODAY ON OIL SPILL CRIMINAL CHARGES  </P> <P> Exxon through its lawyers is due to appear in federal court this afternoon for  arraignment on criminal charges in connection with last year's disastrous Exxon  Valdez oil spill.  </P> <P> "We plan to defend ourselves vigorously," Exxon Shipping Co. attorney James  Neal said from his Nashville law office before flying to Anchorage for the U.S.  District Court arraignment.  </P> <P> Exxon Corp., which is being represented by O'Melveny &amp; Myers of Los  Angeles, and Exxon Shipping Co. were expected to plead innocent to five charges  against each firm contained in a Feb. 27 federal grand jury indictment.  </P> <P> Convictions could bring fines of more than $700 million, based on damage  estimates of the 11-million-gallon spill of March 24, 1989, according to the  Department of Justice. In addition, Exxon could be ordered to pay restitution.  </P> <P> Exxon had sought to avoid criminal charges in secret negotiations with the  Justice Department. But the talks fell apart when Alaska officials publicly  decried the process and criticized the Bush Administration's handling of the  case.  </P> <P> As a result, the two Exxon companies were indicted for five environmental  crimes -- violating the Clean Water Act, the Refuse Act, the Migratory Bird  Act, the Ports and Waterways Safety Act and the Dangerous Cargo Act.  </P> <P> In the indictment, the Justice Department said Exxon was responsible for its  skipper's actions -- for taking the tanker out of shipping lanes and then  leaving the bridge to an "unqualified" mate and an "incompetent" helmsman.  </P> <P> The tanker broke open on Bligh Reef, spewing oil into Prince William Sound and  the Gulf of Alaska and affecting wildlife and fishing. Crude oil hit 1,200  miles of shoreline, including seven national parks and wildlife refuges. The  spill was the worst in U.S. history.  </P> <P> Exxon Shipping's attorney, Neal, 60, was a U.S. attorney in Tennessee in the  1960s and prosecuted Teamster leader James R. Hoffa. A decade later he served  as chief trial counsel for the Watergate special prosecutor's office.  </P> <P> As a private defense lawyer, Neal won acquittals for Elvis Presley's doctor on  drug-related charges, the Ford Motor Co. in the Pinto crash case, Louisiana  Gov. Edwin W. Edwards on corruption charges and John Landis on charges arising  out of the Twilight Zone movie crash deaths.  </P></p>

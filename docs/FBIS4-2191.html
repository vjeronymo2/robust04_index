			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The task force in charge  of cracking down on smuggling across China recently held its  third meeting, proposing: The tasks of China's antismuggling  drive in 1994 follow: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and of the party's basic line, we should further  implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and the national antismuggling work  meeting in 1993, consolidate and develop based on past  achievements, persistently and unwaveringly keep up our efforts,  strengthen administration in an all-around manner, and  resolutely and steadfastly intensify the antismuggling drive.    Li Lanqing, standing committee member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, State Council Vice Premier, and head  of the task force in charge of cracking down on smuggling across  China, chaired the meeting.    The meeting held: Since August 1993, various localities  across China have conducted a large-scale antismuggling drive.  Party and government leaders at various levels, customs, public  security, the administration for industry and commerce, and  judicial departments have earnestly implemented the instructions  of the party Central Committee and the State Council; have  unified common understandings; strengthened leadership; have  coordinated concerted actions; reinforced discipline; and upheld  the policy of "arresting culprits at sea, blocking them on land,  checking them in ports, controlling them at markets, and  severely punishing them." We have taken concerted antismuggling  actions; have integrated joint efforts to crack down on  smuggling with improved comprehensive administration over the  antismuggling drive; have stopped rampant smuggling activities  in some localities; have screened and rectified markets of  smuggled goods; and have penalized a group of smugglers.  Consequently, the antismuggling drive has yielded interim  results. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six  months China has uncovered 10,062 cases involving smuggling and  sales of smuggled goods amounting to 2.64 billion yuan.    The meeting proposed: While conducting the nationwide  antismuggling drive in 1994, we should further improve our  understanding of the important significance in the antismuggling  drive and should strengthen leadership in organizing work in  this regard. We should promptly and specifically launch special  antismuggling campaigns in accordance with popular issues in  smuggling activities to prevent another new wave of smuggling  activities from recurring. We should strictly prevent car-  smuggling, which has already been stopped, from recurring; and  should severely crack down on illegal activities at sea,  including smuggling of cigarettes and home electric appliances.  We should further intensify the investigation and handling of  major and important smuggling cases; should severely penalize  smugglers according to law; should strictly enforce the law,  supervise, and inspect; and strengthen the development of  antismuggling personnel.    Li Lanqing said in his speech: The antismuggling drive is a  protracted and arduous struggle. It yielded interim results  after we have worked hard for more than six months. However, we  definitely cannot lower our guard against the serious situation  facing the antismuggling drive, and future antismuggling tasks  are still quite arduous. He stressed: In 1994, we must  realistically improve the understanding of leaders at various  levels that the antismuggling drive is a protracted and arduous  struggle; further improve our self-consciousness to carry out  the antismuggling drive and regard the drive as an important  component of the anticorruption struggle; and persistently and  unwaveringly keep up the efforts so as to accomplish greater  achievements.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Markheath hit by property write-downs PRE-TAX losses at Markheath, the property group 61 per cent-owned by the Australian Adelaide Steamship Group, increased sharply from Pounds 4.08m to Pounds 22.7m in the year to March 31. The increase stemmed from a jump in exceptional provisions from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 21.6m. The final dividend is omitted, leaving shareholders with 0.5p for the year. Last year's final of 2p made a 4p total. Mr Michael Rendle, who a year ago replaced Mr John Spalvins as Markheath chairman, said that the now refinanced Adsteam was 'fully supportive' of the dividend move and that it was an advantage to have a stable shareholder. Turning to Markheath, Mr Rendle said: 'This has been a difficult year.' However, the company had rearranged its revolving credit facilities 'on satisfactory terms', and bank covenants had not been breached. During the year net borrowings fell from Pounds 95.4m to Pounds 72.9m, though net assets also fell to Pounds 55m (Pounds 78.9m) - equivalent to 45.1p (64.6p) per share. Mr Rendle said that Markheath's balance sheet and cashflow were 'now under control' and the aim was further to reduce borrowings through asset disposals and more cuts in operating overheads. Over the past two years staff numbers have been cut from 145 to 33, mostly from the construction side. Of the exceptional charges, Pounds 15.5m related to property write-downs and Pounds 4.98m to a provision for the 295p (390p) carrying value of the 13 per cent stake in Frogmore Estates, which had a market price yesterday of 264p. Turnover tumbled to Pounds 4.25m (Pounds 34.1m), because the company was now 'not forced into making distress sales'. Rental income was flat at Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 2.9m) and while the net interest cost was Pounds 7.9m (Pounds 13.6m), Pounds 5.5m was capitalised - 'a sensible amount in today's market'  -leaving Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 7m) charged to the profit and loss account. Losses per share increased to 18.86p (3.21p).</p>

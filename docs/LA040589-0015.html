			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I commend you on the closing portion of your editorial on the assault weapons  controversy. As you point out, the federal government has already had great  success in limiting the magazine capacity of certain firearms used in hunting  federally protected waterfowl. Since the only practical difference between the  modern military-style self-loader and its commercial cousin is magazine  capacity, and since both the locally enacted and state proposed laws define  "assault weapons" by magazine capacity, it would seem both reasonable and  practical simply to ban either general ownership or possession in public of  magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of center-fire rifle  cartridges. Enactment at the state level would encourage parallel federal  legislation, as well as providing an effective tool for local law enforcement.  </P> <P> Such a law would, I believe, be a compromise acceptable to all but the most  extreme on both sides of the argument. To have a significant long-term impact  upon criminal misuse of firearms, however, such a law, and any law in this  area, must be supported by legislation banning firearms ownership by such  classes as those convicted of violent misdemeanors, those under a restraining  order based upon findings of potential harm or harassment, etc.  </P> <P> Additionally, the forthcoming change in California drivers' licenses, making  them much harder to forge and encoding more information on them, offers this  state an opportunity to join the U.S. Department of Justice in its  congressionally mandated assignment of developing a method of verifying the  identity and qualification of firearms purchasers at the point of sale.  </P> <P> SHERWIN COGAN  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

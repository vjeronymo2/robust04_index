			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: State sell-off gives Viag energy to expand - Bavaria's Bayernwerk stake sale appears to favour the buyer THE decision last weekend by the German state of Bavaria to sell its majority stake in Bayernwerk, the country's third-largest utility, to the Viag energy-based conglomerate, finally cements the close relationship between the two companies. Until now, Viag has held 39 per cent of Bayernwerk, and Bayernwerk, a 24.9 per cent stake in Viag. As part of the Bavarian government's privatisation plans, it will now swap its stake in Bayernwerk for a 25.1 per cent stake in Viag, plus DM1bn (Dollars 585m). Viag will move its headquarters from Bonn to Munich. The merger appears to favour Viag, which has been trying to obtain the Bayernwerk stake for some time. It ends, for instance, the the cross-share structure which created some uncertainty in the markets. When the announcement was made last Friday, Viag's shares climbed more than 1 per cent, by DM6 to DM392.50. It also gives Viag access to Bayernwerk's energy base. Until now Viag's energy division depended on Bayernwerk supplies for as much as 60 per cent of needs. This ratio is expected to rise to 80 per cent once the merger is completed. Viag could also use the merger to expand its energy base into eastern Germany. Bayernwerk, along with the country's two largest utilities, RWE Energie, and PreussenElektra, the 100 per cent-owned electricity division of Veba, the country's other large energy-based conglomerate, are already investing heavily in power generation in eastern Germany. These three utilities monopolise Veag, eastern Germany's biggest utility, which controls the high-voltage grid in the region. Along with the country's smaller five utilities, they are now bidding for Veag, which is being sold by the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry. They are also engaged in buying out their 51 per cent stakes in eastern Germany's 15 regional utilities, which the Treuhand is privatising. The deal with Bayernwerk gives Viag the potential to compete with RWE Energie and Veba, one analyst said. However, he added that the close, consensual relationship among Germany's utilities 'does not encourage competition'. It depends on what Mr Jochen Holzer, chairman of Viag and Bayernwerk, chooses to do with the acquisition, he said. Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, Viag's management board chairman, said Bayernwerk would be responsible for all energy-related activities, and Viag would run the other sectors. News of the merger comes at a time when Viag's aluminium and steel divisions are at a cyclical low. Last year, Viag's turnover was DM24.3bn, and Bayernwerk's, DM6.64bn. However, some analysts question why Viag is planning to raise its nominal capital by one-third instead of paying cash for Bayernwerk. Viag has cash of more than DM2.92bn on its balance sheet, and debt and loans totalling DM3.56bn. Bayernwerk has cash on its balance sheet of over DM2.5bn, and debt of only DM400m. Bayernwerk and the state of Bavaria will reap some benefits from this merger. The utilities company will have access to a more diverse conglomerate, and the merger will effectively remove Bayernwerk from the state sector. Through this first large-scale privatisation, Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's prime minister, has confirmed his determination to press ahead with unshackling Bavarian business. Further privatisations of between DM2bn and DM3bn are expected. In doing so, he hopes to attract to Bavaria diverse and large conglomerates, such as Viag, and use them to restructure the state's industrial base.</p>

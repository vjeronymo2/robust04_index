			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Walter Veltroni: "Bad Signs for Berlusconi"] </F>   [Text] The spectacular vote by the European Parliament, the  sign of an unease that must not be underestimated, was merely  the last episode in what was a difficult day for the Right that  won the elections. Something is changing in the subdued  atmosphere that has surrounded the government majority's first  steps. The bulldozer thrust which began immediately after the  elections seems to have suddenly ended, and a sinister creaking  seems to be emerging from the leaderships of the majority  parties. It should be assessed for what it is, without  dismissing it and without any pointless optimism.    [Northern League Secretary] Bossi called for a pause for  reflection in the negotiations. [Prime Minister-Designate]  Berlusconi replied to him curtly, "I will continue." Bossi  demanded the Interior Ministry. [National Alliance leader] Fini  sent him the following message, via the press agencies: "I  would not grant the Interior Ministry to the League." Bossi  demanded, like others in the consultations, a separation of  powers between the prime ministership and ownership of economic,  financial, and media concerns. Berlusconi replied by appointing  three watchdogs, which even such a moderate as Sergio Romano  described as "a false step: It is as though a `defendant' had  the right to choose `his own judge.'" I believe that even Bossi  knows that he cannot continue indefinitely to make loud protests  while at the same time reaching petty agreements. His electoral  strength has already been greatly reduced. And he really does  risk finding himself in the government as an irksome and  subordinate ally, rather like some of the nonconfessional  parties in the old five-party coalition.    Meanwhile, the prime minister, who is striving to project an  image of "prudence and moderation," is having to take account of  the broadsides coming from several directions. Including the  most unexpected ones. When someone yesterday brought to his  attention the critical interview given by prospective foreign  minister Antonio Martino, Berlusconi replied confidently: "I  have not read the interview; I will certainly find expressions  of respect and esteem in it." Let us mention some of Martino's  expressions of "esteem" in his regard: "Berlusconi has been  infected by the virus of politics more seriously than you can  even imagine." And, asked by the interviewer for his opinion  about the meetings with the social partners, he replied: "I do  not approve of them at all. How could I deny it?"    Then there are [Northern League Senate floor leader]  Speroni's attack on Martino, the MSI's [Italian Social Movement]  questioning of the Osimo Treaty, and the Christian Democratic  Center raising its voice. And [Radical leader] Pannella, who is  constantly losing ground. He was foreign minister, then justice  minister. Now there is talk of an Environment Ministry post for  Emma Bonina -- maybe. Really. Meanwhile the demands that  Berlusconi should have expected are coming from both at home and  abroad. Berlusconi assured Professor Modigliani "that there  will be no fascist ministers in the government." We shall see.  When the prime minister announced his own candidacy in the  European elections, as a joke, he received a deluge of  criticisms. As though to secure guarantees of Europeanism,  Kohl's party asked "Forza Italia" to join the Christian  Democratic group in Europe. And the Socialist parties have  announced that they will not attend European meetings with  fascist ministers.    A fine mess, in other words. Domestic problems and natural  tensions and anxieties abroad. It is fortunate that everything  started under the banner of speed, decisiveness, lack of  negotiations, and the new republic. There is no need to point  out that, in the process of forming his government, Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi displayed much greater autonomy than has been  seen at the "majority summit meetings." Everything resembles  the old games, a return to the old Cencelli manual [supposed  rules for spoils sharing], to cunning, and to tactical, affected  games. This is the situation just over a month after the  victory of the right-wing forces. And we must wait and see what  will happen when Berlusconi is in government and has to meet the  expectations, hopes, and promises -- often very conflicting --  which he created during the election campaign and which granted  him victory.    A major scope for initiative could open up for the  opposition. This, on condition that it makes itself heard at  once. As long as it shows that it has understood that in the  new political system a new kind of opposition is necessary too.  New, because, for the first time since the war, it finds itself  confronted with a genuinely right-wing government. And because,  more than ever before, it will have the task of waging a tough  battle while at the same time indicating feasible and  alternative solutions. There will be several oppositions,  including one of the center. It is by no means a bad thing that  it expresses itself with an identity of its own. It is in the  battles of the months ahead that the various tendencies of  Italian democrats will make themselves known and will be able to  identify, through opposition, whatever convergences and progress  they can achieve together. Meanwhile, on the Left, we should,  as I have already said, put an end to the endless talk about  possible leaderships and also to the boring litany of tears.  This, because we must feel a duty. That of meeting the  expectations of a million Italians who voted for the progressive  forces. The intermission is over. Now we must start the race.  And it is a new, difficult, and fascinating one.</p>

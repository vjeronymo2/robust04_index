			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister  Francois Leotard called Thursday [7 April] for air strikes  against Serb forces attacking the Bosnian Moslem enclave of  Gorazde, saying the means to launch them were already in place.    "The planes are there, the pilots are there, it is perfectly  possible, technically," he told a small group of journalists,  saying that UN Security Council Resolution 824 could be invoked,  if the "political will" existed.    The resolution, agreed on May 6 last year, allows for use of  force in case of attacks on UN-designated safe areas in Bosnia,  of which Gorazde is one of six. "I have made it known that we  should enforce Resolution 824," he said.    Leotard said air strikes "are technically feasible, weather  permitting," and stressed the importance of "enforcing all  resolutions of the UN."    Fighting around the eastern Bosnian enclave has killed 64  and  left 301 wounded in the last nine days, according to Radio  Sarajevo. It said Thursday that Serb forces were regrouping and  that fighting was less intense.    Earlier Thursday a team of 11 UN observers and liaison  officers reached the besieged enclave, after being held up en  route by Serb forces at Rogatica, around 40 kilometres (25  miles) from the enclave.    U.S. authorities, who have been reluctant to threaten the  use  of airpower over the situation in Gorazde, said Wednesday that  they did not rule out the possibility of air strikes there.</p>

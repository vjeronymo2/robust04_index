			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Vote eases way for Macedonia THE GREEK government survived a censure motion in parliament yesterday on the issue of recognising Macedonia, but Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, prime minister, has not yet managed to quash objections by hardliners in his New Democracy party, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The 152-145 vote clears the way for the government to give a positive response to a UN Security Council resolution that calls for admitting Macedonia to the UN under a temporary name, pending international arbitration between Athens and Skopje on a permanent one. However, dissension remains in the party ranks underlined by the decision of Mr George Rallis, a former prime minster, to resign his parliamentary seat in protest at the government's handling of the question. The government also appears to have last-minute worries that if it accepts the UN resolution, the Macedonian flag, carrying an ancient Greek emblem, will be immediately raised outside the UN building in New York. Changes to the flag is an issue to be decided by UN arbitration.</p>

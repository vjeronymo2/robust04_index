			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Australian investment in UK soars Australian investment in Britain has risen more than tenfold, to almost ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7.4bn) since Australia lifted exchange controls a decade ago. This makes Britain the biggest single offshore home for Australian investment. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, 'Australia sends about 35 per cent of its offshore direct investment to Britain, which is eight times more than could be expected from the size of the UK economy.' Australia is also the fourth largest overseas investor in the UK. The report finds Britain is the second largest investor in Australia, although only 7 per cent of its offshore direct investment goes in this direction. The strength of investment ties is surprising, given the shift in Australian trade flows towards Asia and Britain's, toward Europe. The report points out that the wave of Australian investment in Britain over the past decade is largely accounted for by just 16 companies - among them, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which nows owns the Pearl and London Life insurance companies, and Foster's, the brewing company which takes in Courage.</p>

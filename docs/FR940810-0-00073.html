			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In sum, OSHA believes data specific to the building, contractor and employees is helpful in predicting exposures when the same variables apply. The lack of such data should require additional precautions. Additionally, unless there is a ``negative exposure assessment,'' the employer must continue to conduct periodic monitoring. Periodic monitoring, in a change from the 1986 construction standard, now is required within the regulated areas of Class I and Class II asbestos jobs and for Class III asbestos work where the initial assessment projects that the PEL is reasonably likely to be exceeded. In these operations the employer is to perform daily monitoring representative of the exposure of each workers performing these tasks. The provisions allowing discontinuance of monitoring, additional monitoring, observation of monitoring are unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not a remanded issue, several participants discussed the subject of a clearance fiber level to determine when a regulated area could be reoccupied following asbestos operations. Some supported use of a clearance level with aggressive sampling and analysis in accredited laboratories (Ex. 141, 143). Most who supported a clearance level stated support for the AHERA level of 0.01 f/cc or background fiber level (40 CFR 736.90). A representative of the US Navy felt that measurement of the quality of abatement_a clearance level_was needed, but that it should not be considered to be a ``health standard'' (Ex. 7&hyph;52). In a similar vein, the Resilient Floor Covering Institute (Ex. 147, Tr. 279) and a representative of the American Paper Institute pointed out that a permissible exposure limit and a clearance level are not the same and should not be confused; the former is health-based and the latter a measure of cleanliness (Ex. 7&hyph;74). Mr. Churchill an asbestos consultant, supported a clearance requirement and felt that the person performing this measurement should be an independent entity (Ex. 7&hyph;95). As mentioned earlier, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee recommended adoption of a clearance level of 0.04 f/cc measured non-aggressively (Ex. 7&hyph;77). The submission of the Monsanto Company expressed their desire that OSHA not adopt a clearance requirement (Ex. 7&hyph;125).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has not included a provision for a specific ``clearance level'' in these revised standards. In reviewing the record, there is no clear evidence of a linkage between such a requirement and subsequent lessening of worker exposure. Clearly, regulated areas must be cleaned following asbestos work. However, designation of a specific fiber level which must be attained before an area can be reoccupied does not appear to be necessary for worker health when all other provisions of the standard are complied with. Meeting the requirements of the standards will protect workers and bystander employees and will prevent the migration of fibers from the work area. The docket contains some data indicating that attainment of a clearance level (either background or 0.01 f/cc) does not conclusively predict fiber levels which will occur in formerly regulated areas (Ex. 1&hyph;23, 162&hyph;19). Therefore, OSHA has not included a quantitative cutoff to determine whether a work area has been adequately cleaned to allow re-entry, rather the standards now require that the information regarding the final monitoring of the prior work be provided to those reoccupying the area. However, OSHA recognizes the need for adequate cleaning of the worksite following disturbance/removal of asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Methods of Compliance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f) General Industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA proposed several changes to the methods of compliance provisions. One was to require specific work practice and engineering controls for brake and clutch repair; another was to regulate the maintenance of asbestos-containing flooring by prohibiting certain kinds of work practices and requiring others; the third was to require that engineering and work practice controls to achieve the newly reduced PEL of 0.1 f/cc be phased-in to coincide with the imposition of the EPA ban for various industrial sectors which manufacture asbestos containing material (see 55 FR 29721&hyph;29726). The final general industry standard retains the conceptual outline of these proposed changes; however the details differ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Setback for Hindu party The Bharatiya Janata party, India's Hindu militant opposition party, whose supporters last year stormed the Ayodhya mosque, yesterday looked set for its third defeat in six state elections held last month. With counting virtually complete, the BJP seemed set to lose control of the central state of Madhya Pradesh to the ruling Congress (I) party. The BJP has previously conceded defeat to Congress in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. In Uttar Pradesh it faces defeat at the hands of a coalition led by the Samajwadi party and the Bhagan Samaj party, a populist alliance. The BJP is likely to retain control of Rajasthan and has won a clear victory in the city of Delhi. Counting in the small state of Mizoram in the north-east has yet to start. The results are a serious setback for the BJP, which had hoped the Ayodhya mosque's destruction last December would help the cause of Hindu nationalism. Instead voters have deserted the party, partly in protest at the violence and unrest which the sacking of the mosque provoked and partly because of the administrative performance of BJP state governments.

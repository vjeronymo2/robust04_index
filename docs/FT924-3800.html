			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Difficult birth for son of poll tax: The council tax is an improvement on its predecessor, but will people accept it? The usual weekly meetings with electors this weekend will give Tory MPs their first opportunity to judge whether the council tax represents a calm after the storm produced by the poll tax, or whether it promises more of the same. There is no sign - so far - that the drama of the poll tax will be repeated. But while there will be no rioting in the streets, there is unlikely to be any dancing either. Individual valuations putting each of England's 20m properties into one of the eight bands for the new tax landed with local authorities this week, amid predictions of a renewed political storm over local taxation. Last week, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced the government's spending plans for local councils next year. This has led to a series of estimates of likely council tax bills which allow most people to make a reasonable guess about how much they will be paying from April 1993. These developments have brought local finance back into the news from the obscurity into which it had faded since the days of poll tax riots in Trafalgar Square and mass resignations of Tory councillors in deepest Oxfordshire. It is already clear that in introducing the new tax, ministers have learnt several lessons from the poll tax debacle. The structure of the council tax, the limits on local government spending and the arrangements for moving from one system to the next have all been informed by the traumas that wracked the government and contributed to the then Mrs Thatcher's downfall. On structure, the most important lesson learnt was the need for the new tax to be seen as fair. The poll tax was a flat-rate charge on almost all adults, designed to make local government more accountable to the electors. But instead it was widely seen as unfair, bearing no relation to ability to pay - hence its unpopularity. The council tax takes local taxation back to a property base. The size of the bill will depend on the value of the home, which acts as a proxy for ability to pay. And each home will receive only one bill which, because it is linked to property rather than people, will be harder to evade. Cunningly, the council tax also avoids some of the difficulties associated with the system of rates, the property tax which preceded the poll tax. The most important criticism of rates was that they took no account of the number of adults in a household. The widow living on her own paid the same as the two-earner household next door. With the council tax, single householders will be entitled to a 25 per cent discount on their council tax bills. The allocation of each home to one of eight valuation bands restricts the ability of spendthrift councils to milk better-off home-owners, as some did under the old rating system. The tax to be levied on a home in the top band is three times that on the bottom band. 'The council tax is better than the rates for single people, and many people think it better than the community charge (poll tax) because obviously it is in part related to people's wealth through their property,' Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, says. Even so, some Tories are worried about the impact on traditionally Conservative single pensioners living in southern England, whose fixed incomes are not related to the value of their homes. Labour's spokesman, Mr Doug Henderson, acknowledges that 'it's not as bad as the poll tax', and Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle-upon-Tyne council and chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, says: 'We will make the council tax work, though it's not without its difficulties.' Chief among these difficulties, according to Mr Beecham, will be making sure that the 25 per cent deduction for single-adult homes is not abused. While there will be no register of adults living in every household, some form of checking will be needed. And the tax is getting very complicated in order to be fair to everyone, says Ms Elizabeth Anson, chairman of the Conservative-controlled Association of District Councils. 'There are exemptions for students, for example, and student nurses. Bills will have to be adjusted to take account of the transitional relief which means that the extra people will pay with the new tax is limited. The end result will be very confusing.' Whatever the worries about the new tax, however, there is near-unanimity among local government leaders of all political complexions that the council tax is an improvement on the poll tax. There is also a realisation that, if it does not work, there may be little future for independent local government with its own tax base. But selling the council tax to the voters does not just depend on whether its structure seems fair and workable. It is vital that April's bills should be kept at what ministers call 'realistic' levels to avoid the steep rises that accompanied the poll tax, for which the government was blamed. The rises were so steep that the government was ultimately forced to increase VAT by 2.5 percentage points to take Pounds 140 off each bill. Ministers are relying on last week's toughening of the government's limits on local spending to hold down April's council tax bills. Some of the councils which will feel the tightest squeeze are loyal Tory district councils. Mr Redwood calls the settlement 'tight but deliverable'. His optimism is shared by Mr Bill Dixon Smith, chairman of the Association of County Councils: 'Given the very tight controls by the government on local government spending, there should not be massive increases in bills for most people.' There remains, however, a very real possibility that ministers will have to 'cap' the budgets of shire districts that have been Tory since elections began. And if there is any single point at which the introduction of the council tax could come unstuck over the next few months, it will be over the Commons vote on capping. Councils begin setting their budgets in January, and those provisionally selected for capping are announced in early April. After councils have a further opportunity to make representations, MPs debate capping in late May. There is likely to be a Tory revolt on the issue in the Commons: its success will depend on how far councils press their local MPs. In addition to the structure of the new tax and the level of next April's bills, another threat may lie in the organisation of the changeover. The launch of the poll tax was marred by foul-ups in the computer software and systems installed to collect it. This is unlikely to be repeated with the council tax, according to Ms Moira Lee, of the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation, the professional body for the local authority staff who must make the new system work. 'The poll tax experience was a steep learning curve, and our members now have a much better idea of what computer companies can do. So far, the indications are that all is going well and the tax will be introduced on schedule.' Another problem with the introduction of the poll tax sprang from predictions of average bills which turned out to be over-optimistic in most parts of the country. Ministers are anxious to avoid the same mistake this time round, and have resolutely avoided making predictions about average or typical levels. They are assisted in this resolve by the banding system, since it is by no means clear what a typical or average value is. Even the valuation process - tipped by many as a stumbling block - does not appear to have caused an upsurge of ill-will so far. The main worry for many critics was that the valuations, based on prices in April 1991, would be seen as unrealistically high by householders whose property values had plummeted since then. The valuers, however, seem to have produced lower values than most commentators had expected. As Mr Redwood is fond of pointing out, a quarter of householders will have no cause to complain about their valuation, since they have been put in the lowest band. Appeals may be deterred by the probable need for a professional valuation, costing anything up to Pounds 150, to challenge the April 1991 assessment. Even in London, where prices have fallen sharply and valuations are high in comparison with the rest of the country, Tories believe they can live with the bandings that have emerged. 'The worry about valuations is still there,' says Mr Richard Tracey, chairman of London Tory MPs, 'though there is some evidence that the average valuation for the boroughs is better than one thought.' London Tories are also concerned about the timing of transitional relief which will ensure that no one, even in the most highly valued property, should face an increase in their local taxation bill of more than Pounds 182. While they welcome the way it has been designed, they are concerned about how quickly it will be phased out, and what the bills for 1994-95 will look like. They are particularly worried about the impact on London borough elections in spring 1994. Mr Redwood offers a glimmer of hope, pointing out that the transitional relief is for a minimum of two years. 'If people say that that's too rapid, we will have to see whether we can do it over a longer period,' he says. 'We'll make final decisions in the light of the settlement next year.' But despite all these positive portents for the new tax, the government is by no means home and dry. Labour believes that there is enough unfairness in the system to make it worth keeping up the sniping. 'The rich do well, single rich people do well and middle-income people in an ordinary house in London do badly,' says Mr Henderson. And in the long term, the council tax will do nothing to solve the problems of local finance. The tax will still raise only the paltry 15 per cent of council spending budgeted for next year. Most people involved in local government believe that this is too small a proportion. They argue that the council tax will therefore need to rise to provide an adequate tax base for local government. However, the number of changes in local government finance, plus the reorganisation and the rolling programme of elections means that it is hard to find a good time to raise bills. 'I don't see how anyone with commonsense can be happy about it, but we've got to make it work,' one southern Tory backbencher said. It may not be much, but even a mood of grim determination is better than the reckless hostility that sealed the fate of the poll tax.  ------------------------------------------------------ COUNCIL TAX: WHO FOOTS THE BILL  ------------------------------------------------------ Projected average council tax bills in England  ------------------------------------------------------               Property                      % of homes Band       value (Pounds)   Bill (Pounds)  in this band  ------------------------------------------------------ A           Up to 40,000        329             26 B          40,000-52,000        384             19 C          52,000-68,000        439             22 D          68,000-88,000        494             15 E          88,000-120,000       604              9 F         120,000-160,000       713              5 G         160,000-320,000       823              4 H            Over 320,000       988              1  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

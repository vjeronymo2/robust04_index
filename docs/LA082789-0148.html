			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRONT NOT ONLY TALKED OF HARMONY, BUT LIVED IT  </P> <P> Rabbi Henri E. Front, who died Wednesday, was much more than just the spiritual  head of Temple Beth David in Westminster. He was a champion of the underdog,  guardian of human rights and community leader. His loss will be felt throughout  Orange County.  </P> <P> Front, a former Navy chaplain, was, at his death, a member of the Orange County  Human Relations Commission, where he put his caring and commitment into action.  He loved people and recognized early the county's growing ethnic diversity.  With a deep respect for human rights, Front not only emphasized the  similarities between various ethnic and religious groups, but showed a keen  understanding of and respect for their differences. He was, noted Rusty  Kennedy, executive director of the Human Relations Commission, a bridge for  bringing people together.  </P> <P> In 1985, before Arab rights leader Alex Odeh was killed by a bomb planted in  his Santa Ana office, Front had been working with him, planning a conference to  help promote more Arab-Jewish dialogue. At the same time, he was seeking out  other Arab leaders in the county. Front received death threats because of his  attempts to bring the two groups closer together. He ignored them and continued  his unifying efforts.  </P> <P> He also helped bring together Korean and Anglo-Christian clergymen to work out  the problems being faced by the small Korean congregations. And he recently was  active in promoting closer contact between the black and Jewish communities.  </P> <P> Front did not just preach harmony and peace, justice and equality. He lived it.  He did not just exhort others to help those less fortunate. He went into the  community and put his beliefs into everyday practice. His example of  warmhearted activism leaves a void in Orange County that will be difficult to  fill.  </P></p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Topdanmark in the red but holds payout TOPDANMARK, the Danish insurer, made a DKr273m (Dollars 43.4m) loss in 1991 compared with a 1990 profit of just DKr8m. An unchanged DKr10 per share dividend is proposed. Steps have been taken to improve performance, said the preliminary statement, which forecast a profit of not less than DKr200m in 1992, rising to DKr300m to DKr400m in 1993. The 1991 result consisted of a loss of DKr347m on primary operations and a gain of DKr74m from the adjustment for the value of securities. The poor result was blamed on non-recurring events, including heavy loan loss provisions at Aktivbanken, the banking subsidiary, and DKr200m restructuring costs.</p>

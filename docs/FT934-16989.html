			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Russian Crisis: Voices on fringe rise to a roar APART from being holed up in the White House, a monarchist priest, an unemployed Communist, and a black-shirted fascist had one thing in common yesterday morning: unwavering certainty in their victory over the 'Yeltsin regime'. Victor, a priest in black robes with a monarchist flag pinned on to his chest, explained that he was opposed to the forces of evil represented by Mr Yeltsin. Young men with fascist insignia on their camouflage uniforms guarded the offices of parliamentary leaders. Yuri, an unemployed dancer signed up with the Cossacks paramilitary force, was watching a demonstration on how to operate an automatic weapon in the parliament's coat-room. 'What unites us is a desire to make Russia a good, rich, just country.' The fact that Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, and Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi came to be defended by society's 'loony fringe' only added to the apparent hopelessness of their cause. But by evening, after a blockade of thousands of troops and police around the parliament was overrun by demonstrators who took over the mayor's office and the television station, their desperate conviction had turned into shocking prophecy. Earlier in the day, Mr Rutskoi, installed as acting president by parliament two weeks ago, said: 'The only possible compromise is for Yeltsin to resign . . . If we do not win, we will condemn Russia to a century of dictatorship.' He poured scorn on Russia's mainstream politicians who had deserted him, and said there was nothing wrong with the National Salvation Front which had rallied to his defence. Mr Rutskoi also attacked the army's high command for its 'so-called neutrality', the media for their biased coverage, and the intelligentsia for 'remaining silent'. Asked whether he was not worried by threats from Mr Rutskoi to punish troops and police who supported Mr Yeltsin's coup, a police captain parked outside the parliament building replied with a smile: 'We are all part of the same nation. Nothing will happen to us, we'll just go on working as usual just like we did after the last coup.'</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US airlines push for more UK slots American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers, are urging the Washington administration to renounce the bilateral aviation agreement between the US and the UK unless the UK grants greater access to US carriers into London's Heathrow airport. They are also urging the withdrawal of British Airways' ticket code sharing rights with USAir. Failure to reach a compromise agreement by March 17, the deadline for the renewal of BA's existing code sharing rights with its US partner, USAir, risks provoking severe trade tensions between the two countries. The UK has already warned the US it would consider limiting some US airline flights into Heathrow if the BA code sharing rights were not renewed. In turn, this is likely to lead to US retaliation against flights by BA and other UK carriers into the US market. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, yesterday renewed his attack on what he considers the UK's 'protectionist' stance towards BA. 'The US should renounce the bilateral agreement to get a balanced solution. The US should not allow European carriers to participate in our market, by far the world's biggest, unless we get equal economic opportunities in their markets,' he said in London. Apart from more access into Heathrow, Mr Crandall wants the right to fly into Heathrow from the US and then into other international destinations. He also argued that scarce take-off and landing slots at Heathrow should be auctioned in the same way as they are bought and sold at Chicago. Mr Crandall also attacked BA's ticket code sharing arrangement with USAir as 'nothing but a matter of consumer deception'. Under the code sharing deal, BA and USAir can market each other's flights under the same ticketing code. Through the code sharing system, BA was able to market under its own ticket code more than 20,000 combinations of different destinations from which his airline was excluded because of the UK government's unwillingness to give American Airlines broad operating rights at Heathrow, he argued. In a document filed with the US Department of Transportation, Delta said the UK government 'has been on notice for at least one year that the continued renewal of the code sharing authority was dependent upon material progress on liberalisation in the bilateral negotiations'. However, United Airlines, the largest US carrier, has opposed a confrontation with the UK government and disassociated itself from the intense lobbying efforts by the other two big US airlines. The UK government and BA have both rejected the US demands. BA said it wanted its agreement with USAir, in which it holds a 24 per cent stake, approved in full by the US government but 'not at any price'. Although the UK carrier favoured 'open skies', Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, told the British American Chamber of Commerce last week: 'If, however, the US strategy remains geared to the notion that their airlines should be allowed to have free pickings in our British market while theirs remains closed, I can summon up reserves of any amount of patience.' Sir Colin disclosed that talks between the two governments had taken place in Washington last month.</p>

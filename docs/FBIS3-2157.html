The meeting has further promoted mutual understanding and  friendship among the participants from 15 countries including  China after their discussions on issues of population and  development and women's position and role.    Fukusaburo Maeda, chairman of the Asian population and  development association, described the two-day meeting as  significant.    He said that in September this year, the Third International  Conference on Population and Development will be held in Cairo,  at which a policy on population is expected to be approved.    He expressed the hope that this policy will become a program  for actions of all countries in the next 20 years.    Hao Yichun, deputy head of the delegation of China's  National  People's Congress (NPC) and vice-chairman of the NPC Education,  Science, Culture and Public Health Committee, said with the  common efforts by the Asian parliamentarians, the meeting has  achieved a complete success.    Noting that Asia is the most populous region in the world,  Hao said the solution of the Asian population problem will be of  great importance to peace, prosperity and development of Asia  and the rest of the world.    She said many Asian countries have already adopted proper  measures to reduce the birth rate and have achieved significant  results.    However, Hao said the trend of rapid population growth has  not yet been checked and the task of improving the quality of  human resources is still arduous.    The solution of population problems requires the common  efforts from Asian parliaments, governments, non-governmental  organizations as well as the people from every Asian country,  she added.    After the meeting Fukusaburo Maeda and leaders from the  Asian  forum and the UN Population Fund gave a press conference and  answered questions on cooperation between China and the UN  Population Fund.</p>

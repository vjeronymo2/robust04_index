			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / Call for joint action on R&amp;D A JOINT EFFORT by government, academia and industry is needed to boost investment in engineering research and development, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers urges in a report today. The proposal for a forum to co-ordinate action is one of 10 recommendations by the institution in a report highlighting the lack of investment in UK engineering R&amp;D compared with countries such as Germany and Japan. The institution, which represents more than 78,000 engineers, says investment in R&amp;D is of critical importance in the coming decade and beyond for improving the inadequate performance of manufacturing industry. It says the UK's R&amp;D total expenditure in the period leading to the 1989 Cabinet Office R&amp;D Review was about 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product. Civil R&amp;D spending was only about 1.6 per cent of GDP, compared with about 2.8 per cent in Japan. This is compounded, says the report, by a falling proportion of UK government funding available for civil R&amp;D from around 0.7 per cent of GDP in 1981 to about 0.5 per cent in 1989. 'These statistics all point to a reduction in the nation's R&amp;D effort,' says the report. 'It is belived this has an ultimate relationship to the commercial exploitation of technology and consequently is at least partially responsible for the slippage of the UK in the international scene.' Among other concerns raised by the report are the recent limitation of funding for the Science and Engineering Research Council and lack of substantive support for small and medium-sized firms in securing European R&amp;D funds. The current support for 'pre-competitive' research and lack of funding for 'near-market' projects also affects engineering research particularly adversely, says the report. Apart from proposing an Engineering Research Forum to help develop coherent R&amp;D funding policies and actions, the institution also wants industry to make a commitment to increase R&amp;D funding. It says government funding for R&amp;D and training sponsored through the Department of Trade and Industry and SERC should be increased, while consideration should be given to consolidating engineering R&amp;D grants under one body. The report also says the Government should promote and fund specific programmes to support R&amp;D in small companies, where that R&amp;D is directed towards innovative products. In addition, industry bodies are urged to set up and support a unit to help small companies approach the EC for R&amp;D funding.

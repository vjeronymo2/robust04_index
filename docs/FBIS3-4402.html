China Labour News reported over the weekend that they will  face trial. Seven other technicians and officials concerned  have also been dismissed from their official posts.    The explosion killed dozens of coal miners and caused  damages  of 4.5 million yuan ($517,000). The main factors in the  mishap-which caused the northeastern provinces biggest death  toll from mining since 1949--were poor management and violations  of the Safety Law in Mines and other rules on safety in mines.    Labour officials blamed the frequent accidents in this  industry on the mishandling or shielding of those at fault.</p>

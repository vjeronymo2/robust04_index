			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The Nigerian Embassy denied on  Thursday the information that Nigerian ministries had attempted  to transfer millions of dollars to the accounts of Gdansk  institutions.    PAP reported on Wednesday that two Nigerian federal  ministries of industry and trade, and of national defence  approached customers of one of the Gdansk banks and asked them  to have the money transfered on their accounts in return for 30  per cent of the transferred amount. A similar proposal made  allegedly by the Nigerian Construction Ministry and the Nigerian  Oil Corporation was reported in the "DZIENNIK BALTYCKI" daily  quoted by the PAP.    The embassy states in its communique sent to PAP on Thursday  that all these "so-called federal ministries are fake" and adds  that "the letters reportedly circulating among some banks in  Gdansk have not emanated from federal government ministries or  any federal government corporation."    The embassy claims that such letters are "handiwork of  fraudsters using fictitious names and titles, and aimed at  duping unwary and greedy foreign businessmen."    The embassy reported on similar cases in its recent regular  news bulletin of February 1994 and warned the Polish business  community to be on alert. The embassy advised recepients of  such letters to report to the embassy but the banks in Gdansk  chose to ignore this advise, reads the communique.</p>

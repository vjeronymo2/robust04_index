			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO YOU WANT TO BE IN PICTURES?;  </P> <P> HARDER FOR SOME PEOPLE THAN OTHERS; ENTER NOW DISNEY STUDIOS  </P> <P> For the Walt Disney Studios, it's no Mickey Mouse move. The Burbank company is  launching an ambitious new program with special emphasis on developing more  minority and women writers into "first-rate screenwriters."  </P> <P> This step in the right direction may open up creative opportunities behind the  camera to minority writers who feel shut out of the system because of sex or  ethnicity. Disney's commitment is the biggest by any Hollywood studio to date.  Let's hope other studios will followsuit.  </P> <P> The Walt Disney Fellowship Program begins next month. The first participants  will include 27 aspiring screenwriters -- most of them African-American,  Latino, Asian-American and female writers ranging in age from 20 to 46. They  will participate in a yearlong program, earning an annual salary of $30,000.  They will work and train on developing film and television projects for four  Disney production units: Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Walt Disney  Pictures and Walt Disney Productions.  </P> <P> Disney's move was not entirely altruistic. The company ranked at the bottom in  surveys of job opportunities for minority writers conducted by the Writers  Guild of America West in 1987 and 1989.  </P> <P> But Disney's effort is unprecedented in the number of writers and length of  commitment. Studios generally have employed minority writers only sporadically.  Last month, the Beverly Hills/Hollywood Chapter of the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People issued a report noting there were fewer  opportunities for blacks in Hollywood executive suites now than 10 years ago.  </P> <P> Disney's program is likely to earn kudos from civil rights groups and the  Writers Guild. The hiring and training of minority and women writers will  create greater diversity behind and before the camera. They will add a new  perspective in both product and roles. If they help to eliminate stereotypical  Hollywood characterizations of minorities, Disney will again have helped make  Hollywood history.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA PUENTE;  </P> <P> POLLUTION HEARINGS PLEDGED  </P> <P> U. S. Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), who has been elected chairman of  the House Small Business Committee's subcommittee on environment and labor,  said one of his first steps will be to hold hearings on ground-water pollution  in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Torres said the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has been "very slow" to  deal with the contamination of water wells. He said he intends to summon agency  officials to "explain to the subcommittee and the people of the San Gabriel  Valley why the EPA has been dragging its feet when we have known about the  contaminated ground water for almost 10 years."  </P> <P> Dozens of San Gabriel Valley wells have been closed since the end of 1979, when  officials discovered that industrial chemicals had invaded ground water. Since  then, the EPA has placed four large areas of the ground-water basin on its  Superfund cleanup list, conducted extensive studies and undertaken water  treatment projects in El Monte and the Whittier Narrows area, but has not yet  produced a comprehensive cleanup program.  </P></p>

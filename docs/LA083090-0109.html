			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GARDENA WOMAN SAYS GEORGIA FIRM TOOK MONEY, KEPT 'PRIZE'  </P> <P> A Gardena woman has filed a fraud complaint alleging that a telephone sales  company took $698 from her but failed to give her a promised $10,000 prize.  </P> <P> Gardena detectives investigating Kathryn Hansen's fraud complaint said she is  one of more than 4,000 people nationwide who may have been defrauded by  Republic Distribution Corp. of Atlanta.  </P> <P> Georgia state officials have shut down telephone operations at the company in  response to hundreds of complaints from irate consumers.  </P> <P> Investigators who served a search warrant on the company said they found  records indicating that as many as 4,200 people may have been defrauded of  thousands of dollars each in the high-pressure scam, Gardena Detective Ed  Burnett said.  </P> <P> According to Hansen's police report, a salesman from Republic Distribution  called the 71-year-old woman on July 3 and told her that she had been selected  to receive a $10,000 bonus in a few weeks if she invested $698 in the company  now.  </P> <P> Over a 90-minute period, Hansen told police, two salesmen assured her that she  would receive $10,000 if she cooperated. However, they told her to tell a third  salesman -- who tape-recorded only his conversation with her -- that no such  promise had been made.  </P> <P> Several weeks after Hansen sent a check by Federal Express, she received a box  of 350 pens and a notice that she could collect a diamond-and-sapphire jewelry  set if she sent in a $99 handling fee, Burnett said.  </P> <P> Since Hansen filed her complaint, the Gardena Police Department has received  calls from at least four other South Bay residents complaining about the  company, Burnett said. Those callers were told to contact the Atlanta Police  Department directly.  </P> <P> Republic Distribution officials referred telephone calls seeking comment to an  Atlanta attorney, who did not return the calls.  </P></p>

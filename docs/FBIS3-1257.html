			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Lessees of some hotel industry and  bakery-related commercial establishments, as well as tenants of  houses in the city of Manica, have spoken out against the  measure taken recently by provincial trade authorities to return  to the alleged owner of the former Manica Commercial Company the  property they have exploited since nationalization in 1976.    Speaking to the NOTICIAS reporter in that part of the  country, they described as "absurd" the decision that has been  made by the provincial trade authorities and have demanded  "serious and plausible explanations" from those responsible.    In addition to demanding high indemnification for the  maintenance, rehabilitation, and restoration work done to those  buildings over the course of the years, they questioned the  legality of the measures being taken by the state.    In that context, they wondered how it was possible that the  state, which is now selling houses, should take measures whereby  such buildings are returned to people turning up claiming to be  their rightful owners.    They also accused some Trade Ministry workers of forging  documents without the knowledge of their superiors for the  benefit of those who left the country for political and other  reasons after independence but who, now that the war is over,  are back and claiming ownership.    In the opinion of those economic agents, documents  authorizing the return of such buildings to their former owners  are not produced in accordance with legal procedures but arise,  rather, from devious procedures. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Trade Director's Response </H5>   When he was approached by our reporter, Manica Provincial  Trade Director Jose Gabriel Cuna said that "the whole process  concerning the handing over of the buildings in question was  authorized by Prime Minister Mario Machungo. The other dispatch  came from the Trade Ministry."    Referring specifically to the dispatch by the Trade  Ministry,  Jose Cuna noted that that document contains instructions that  must be followed when buildings are returned so that there is no  friction with their current lessees.    He admitted that the first documents dealing with the case  had not come via official routes, but he stated that "the whole  process is being carried out in accordance with the law so as  not to harm current occupants who have invested a great deal of  money to maintain those buildings." He added that the  implementation of the process to return that company had begun  long ago, but he failed to provide the date or the year when it  had begun. [passage omitted]</p>

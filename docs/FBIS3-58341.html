			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European critic Manfred Brunner by Bettina </F> Baeumlisberger, Ottmar Berbalk, and Eugen-Georg Schwarz; place  and date not given: "The Parties Are Ripe for a Museum"]    [Text] [FOCUS] On 23 January, you will found a new party  in Weimar. Will you thus contribute to Weimar-like conditions  in Germany?    [Brunner] We see Weimar as something positive. Weimar is  the town of Goethe and Schiller, the town of humanism. In  addition, Weimar is located on the territory of the former GDR.  This is important for us.    [FOCUS] Weimar is also a synonym for a fragmented party  landscape.    [Brunner] Of course, as a result of the shock of the Third  Reich, one has developed a negative attitude toward the Weimar  Republic. It perished because it was a democracy without  democrats. In our election law, the danger of a fragmentation of  the party landscape is prevented by the 5-percent clause.    [FOCUS] What will be the name of your new party?    [Brunner] A committee to has been established to find a  name. We are thinking of something involving the term "citizen."  However, whether it will be called "Federation of Free  Citizens" or "Citizens' Ticket" or "Citizens' Movement" will be  decided in Weimar.    [FOCUS] Where will be the headquarters of your party?    [Brunner] It must be in Berlin. I am always in favor of the  capital city.    [FOCUS] Can your party become a collection pond for failed  politicians?    [Brunner] No. We do not want people who want to become  something, but people who are something. We take a very close  look at those who come to us. For instance, on principle, we do  not accept any former Republikaner or other former members of  parties that are to be counted among the extreme parties.    [FOCUS] Which parties are these?    [Brunner] Quite certainly the unconstitutional Party of  Democratic Socialism. However, whoever was a member of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany at the time of the GDR without  having committed any legal or moral offenses should be able to  participate in our party from the viewpoint of national  reconciliation.    [FOCUS] How far does your identification with Joerg Haider,  chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], whom many  consider to be a right-wing extremist, go?    [Brunner] We establish a party in Germany. It cannot be our  goal to found a subsidiary of other parties.    Of course, Haider is not right-wing extremist. His new book  has just received very positive reviews from NEUE ZUERCHER  ZEITUNG, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and WELT AM SONNTAG. For me,  the issue of Haider is an issue involving a sense of justice and  the refusal to submit to the rules of a leftist German taboo  society. I have known Haider for many years and I, as a person,  vouch for Joerg Haider, the democrat and reformer. He is a  sensible man with interesting ideas.    [FOCUS] Do you think that Haider's statement about Hitler's  employment policy can just be misinterpreted or is it incorrect?    [Brunner] The problem with this answer by Haider to  instigating interjections is that it is correct and incorrect at  the same time. It is correct, as the historians say, including  renowned Sebastian Haffner, that the employment policy in the  Third Reich was very successful at the beginning. Nevertheless,  I think that this statement is incorrect as a political  statement. I do not say about a mass murderer that he is a good  driver, either. In making an overall judgment of a person or an  era there are situations where individual positive aspects  become so unimportant compared with the negative aspects that  even mentioning them is incorrect -- not only tactically  incorrect, but also incorrect in terms of substance.    [FOCUS] Do you not fear that you will be pushed into the  right corner?    [Brunner] The people on our ticket are really above any  suspicion. Of course, the keyboard of taboos will be played to  exhaustion. Certain circles try to push everybody who is not a  leftists into the right corner.    From the letters that I receive I do not conclude that the  citizens are impressed by that. In Germany, 2,000 politicians  are playing Monopoly with 2,000 journalists. And, for a long  time, these 4,000 people could believe that they represent  public opinion. This is no longer the case.    [FOCUS] Is this a motive of your fellow-fighters to join the  party?    [Brunner] Particular in the current period there are many  citizens who no longer see the republic as a service company and  are against a social democratization of our society, and  citizens who are against the European policy of the established  parties and think that there must be a positive counterprogram  to that. This is what we have. We are not a party that is  against something, we are a positive party, we are for something.    [FOCUS] For what?    [Brunner] In European policy for a confederation, that is, a  federation instead of a federal state, for democratic  legitimation instead of a rule by councils, for an all-European  approach instead of the West Europe of the Cold War.    [FOCUS] You want a Europe without a unified currency and  also one without a common foreign, security, and economic policy?    [Brunner] Our Europe develops from the idea of competition  -- political and economic competition. Everything that goes  beyond the single market can be integrated in the community only  if everyone agrees. Before making this decision, the national  governments must get a binding vote by their parliaments. Let  me give you an example: The Yugoslav crisis. The majority of  the EC states wanted to support the old Yugoslavia and also give  aid to the Serbs. According to the Maastricht Treaty, the  majority would have the possibility to enforce this. I think  this is completely unacceptable.    [FOCUS] Thus, you are in favor of a competition of opinions.  What about the competition of the systems?    [Brunner] This refers primarily to economic systems. A  state-economy approach in the Romance member states can  certainly be in competition with a free-trade approach in the  German or British-Nordic member states. However, different  models of state, constitution, and election law can also  compete. By the way, it is not true that I will never accept a  unified currency. A unified currency between Germany, Austria,  and Switzerland would indeed be conceivable, because economic  capacity and order policy coincide. This is our different  approach to Maastricht: Communization can only be the result of  concurrence in terms of substance, it must not be forced by  political acts of power.    [FOCUS] You expect to get 35 percent at the European  elections. Where do you take this breathtaking optimism from?    [Brunner] We talked to opinion researches, who said: You  have to get away from your old ideas about the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP] and about its percentages. A total of 85  percent of the Germans reject the ECU. All established parties,  however, are for the ECU.    [FOCUS] Still, there may be a difference between having  sympathetic feelings and making a cross on the ballot sheet?    [Brunner] The party system, as we know it today, will be  just as much a museum piece in a few years as the GDR's party  system of 1988 is now. The Christian Democratic Union is just a  structure in the wings of the national theater. If you knock  it, the whole thing collapses.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. After the first Contract year, the owner of a Contract may withdraw an amount, free of Sales Charge, equal to 10% of the sum of all purchase payments made to the Contract at the time of withdrawal less any purchase payments previously withdrawn that were subject to a Sales Charge. This privilege is noncumulative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. An annual Contract maintenance charge of $30 is deducted from the value of the Contract. Additionally, an administration charge equal on an annual basis to 0.05% of the daily net asset value of the Account is deducted from the value of the Contract. This administration charge is deducted during both the accumulation and the annuity phases of the Contract. Applicants represent that Financial Horizons estimates that the annual administration charge of 0.05% for expenses will yield an amount considerably less than the current and projected future administrative costs of Financial Horizons, even when this charge is added to the $30 annual Contract maintenance charge. Applicants state that they will rely on Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act in deducting both charges and that both charges are guaranteed not to increase. Applicants further state that Financial Horizons will monitor to ensure that the charges do not exceed expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Financial Horizons will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets of the Account to compensate Financial Horizons for assuming certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. Approximately .80% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .45% is attributable to expense risk. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risk, Financial Horizons will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to Financial Horizons. If Financial Horizons realizes a profit from the charge, the profit will become part of the general account of Financial Horizons and may be used in its discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Financial Horizons consists of: (a) The risk of guaranteeing to make monthly payments for the lifetime of the annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant may live; and (b) the risk of promising to pay a death benefit upon the death of the designated annuitant prior to the annuity commencement date even where the investment experience in the Account has eroded the purchase payments made by the Contract owner. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Financial Horizons is the guarantee that the Contract maintenance charge and the administration charge will never increase regardless of actual expense incurred by Financial Horizons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally preformed by the bank itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Financial Horizons under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Financial Horizons is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon the analysis by Financial Horizons of publicly available information relative to other insurance companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar products. Applicants represent that Financial Horizons will maintain a memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. Financial Horizons also maintains a supporting actuarial memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, demonstrating the reasonableness of the mortality and expense risk charge given the risks assumed under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants represent that Financial Horizons has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Financial Horizons and will be made available to the Commission upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants represent that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of such company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

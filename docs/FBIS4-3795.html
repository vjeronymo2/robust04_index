			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher told American television viewers today  the progress of Serbian withdrawal from around Gorazde is  "encouraging."    Speaking at the American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) "This  Week With David Brinkley," Christopher said latest reports from  the scene indicate that the withdrawal is taking place.    The ultimatum issued by the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) on Friday [22 April] seems to be working, he  said, adding that "We've been disappointed before, but so far  today, it's encouraging."    NATO ordered the Bosnian Serbs to immediately stop their  assault and pull out their heavy weapons before 12:01 A.M. local  time today from a two miles radius from the center of Gorazde.    It also demanded that the Serbs allow United Nations  peacekeepers and medical personnel into Gorazde, one of the six  U.N.-designated "safe areas" for Muslim refugees.    Had the Serbs failed to respond, the ultimatum threatened,  they would risk NATO air strikes.    The United States is "very carefully" monitoring the  situation at the enclave, which had been under intensive Serb  attacks in recent weeks, Christopher said.    Before making the remarks, the U.S. state secretary talked  several times this morning with the chairman of the U.S. joint  chiefs of staff and received reports from Bosnia.    Despite small arms fire, there has been no shelling in  Gorazde today. Some 140 U.N. peacekeepers are already in the  city and about 500 more are expected to arrive this afternoon.    British and French helicopters, meanwhile, are evacuating  the  wounded from the former Yugoslav Republic. And they hope to  bring out between 200 to 300 people today.</p>

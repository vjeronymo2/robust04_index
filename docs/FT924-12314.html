			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Focus on Germany HINTS OF an early cut in German money market rates and a slightly stronger pound influenced the easing of UK inter-bank rates yesterday. The cash rate for three-month money dropped to 7 3/4 per cent from 8 1/16 per cent on Monday, suggesting further monetary relaxation soon after Christmas. The main interest yesterday was in Germany where the Bundesbank announced it would conduct today's repurchase agreement at a variable, rather than a fixed rate, to 'test the equilibrium of the market'. Dealers took this as a sign that the Bundesbank no longer intends to stand in the way of a market-led move to lower interest rates. Recently the market has been pushing for easier rates through lower German call money rates which were yesterday quoted at between 8.85 per cent and 8.95 per cent compared with 8.95 per cent on Monday. But for the last two weeks the Bundesbank has offered banks securities repurchase funds at 8.90 per cent. Under a variable rate tender, the banks bid the rates themselves, but the Bundesbank sets a cut-off point, below which it is not prepared to accept offers. The extent to which the German central bank is happy to see money rates ease, will be known this morning after the tender is announced. The rate at which repurchase agreements are tendered should now become the key figure to watch for enlightenment on German monetary policy. 'In an era of falling rates the ceiling, or Lombard rate, becomes much less important than the rates on repurchase agreements,' said Mr Nick Parsons of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 'The Bundesbank prefers a clear gap between the repo rates and the Lombard rate.' The sterling futures market moved to discount monetary easing by the UK authorities, even more aggressively than on Monday. The December contract closed at 93.07. The day's shortage was Pounds 1.75bn. Bank of England operations included three repurchase agreements without which, according to one dealer, the Bank would have been unable to relieve the shortage. It provided late assistance of Pounds 655m.</p>

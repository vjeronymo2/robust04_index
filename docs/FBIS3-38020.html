The attorneys of some of them told Interfax that the  investigators explained the delay by saying that the State Duma  decision to declare amnesty on February 23 had to be first  published in newspapers. Only then will they show the text to  the accused and ask if they accept the amnesty.    Numerous attorneys do not rule out the possibility that some  of the detainees who do not feel they are guilty of organizing  riots will reject the offer of release. Under the existing  legislation those charged with criminal offenses are pardoned by  the state but are not rehabilitated for their activities which  are regarded as criminal by the investigators.    Larisa Dementyeva, the attorney of Aleksandr Barkashov,  leader of the Russian National Unity, said that her client would  most probably agree to be pardoned. She emphasized Barkashov  was in poor health following several surgeries for a wound he  had received last December. He is now in the medical ward of  Matrosskaya Tishina investigating prison and will most probably  be hospitalized Friday.    Dmitry Shteinberg, the attorney of former security minister  Viktor Barannikov, told Interfax that his client had left the  hospital for home. He had undertaken not to leave the city.  The doctors insist that he is too sick to be questioned.    Meanwhile, the Izvestiya daily reports that Vyacheslav  Kostikov, Russian president's press secretary, said outside the  Federal Assembly hall Thursday that nobody will leave Lefortovo  or Matrosskaya Tishina prisons in the coming weeks, if not  months. He described the amnesty as immoral because the  detainees had blood on their hands.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (10): Well worth the cost - User view, Health authority / Maintaining plans of premises can be as labour-intensive and error-prone as updating maps. St Martin's Hospital in Canterbury is using a GIS for efficient estates management Estate management is as much a problem for hospitals as it is for any large organisation with buildings to maintain. Expanding departments, new equipment, and constantly changing regulations mean that the carpenter's van and the concrete mixer are common sights in the hospital car park. Keeping track of alterations is the job of the estate management and technical services department within the Canterbury and Thanet Community Healthcare Trust. At one hospital, St Martin's in Canterbury, the facilities directorate has been using a geographical information system for several months as a way of keeping all the estates information in step. It was the duty of Bob Taylor, the estates information manager, to provide information about the clinics, small hospitals, health centres and mental health units in the area to planners, architects and engineers. With a paper-based system, it was difficult to tell whether the plans were up to date. Taylor wanted something that would dovetail the information from the NHS WIMS asset database with architectural drawings done in AutoCAD. 'We wanted centralised information on one property or building: an all-embracing system that would have the CAD facilities as well as the database, so that we could bring in word processing files, drawings, files and photos. The trouble was, no one could really define exactly what they wanted.' He found few packages available under Macintosh, but was sold on the GeoNavigator product at its first demonstration by Pax. 'It all happened very quickly,' he says. 'It was installed by DataPro ABS, the system integrator who planned the link with the asset register. The scanning facilities mean we can read in pictures of buildings for valuation, and photos of large equipment, for example, a laundry machine.' The scanning facility has also been used to read in rights of way and other information relating to the property held by the hospital. The system is running on a Macintosh IIci with a 150MB drive, 8MB of RAM, and a ProNitron 21' colour workstation, using MacPlot on a Calcomp DesignMate, all acquired 18 months ago at a cost comparable with setting up an AutoCAD seat. The entire contract with Datapro ABS, including software, hardware and training, cost about Pounds 15,000. Now that all the plans are on the system it is possible to perform 'what if' experiments with the sizing and allocation of room space. It is also possible to show managers exactly what space they have available - one of the most useful business benefits, according to Mr Taylor. 'The Peter Principle tends to operate: people expand to fill the space available. With the GIS we can show a nursing officer what rooms he or she 'owns' or pays for: they can decide 'we don't need that cupboard', for instance. We're also collecting information about cubic capacity, to tell us the cost of heating. Eventually the system will give a complete representation of what people are doing - and where.' It is a long job to enter all the details, a task which justifies the employment of a trained surveyor who works full time entering data from CAD and DOS files. 'It doesn't mean fewer staff; it means more effective staff. They can spend time on new, worthwhile work, not checking old details. 'We're talking about highly trained people - surveyors and engineers - supplied with accurate information for the first time.' According to Mr Taylor, the GIS has been well worth the investment, and he is full of examples. 'It saves time and filing space: the only drawing is the up-to-date one. We don't waste time, money, and effort establishing which drawing to use. We had to redraw an entire unit, to turn it round on the plot of land: the architect was amazed it took us two hours to re-plot instead of two days. And when it comes to doing the returns at the end of the year, it's a matter of pressing a button.' The latest effort has been a space-utilisation study in the new office block, an exercise which showed there was plenty of extra capacity if offices were re-organised. Other possibilities include planning and personnel users, who are looking at multimedia applications. See also Geo/Navigator application by Leeds City Council: report, page 13</p>

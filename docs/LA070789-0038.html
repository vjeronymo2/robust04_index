			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLUMLORD WON'T PAY PENALTY IN JAIL TIME  </P> <P> A San Pedro slumlord who was late in paying $16,000 to help his tenants  relocate will not have to spend extra time in jail for his tardiness, a San  Pedro Municipal Court judge has ruled.  </P> <P> Judge Roy Ferkich on Wednesday declined a prosecutor's request that he lengthen  the sentence of landlord Martin Canter, whom health inspectors said operated a  rat- and cockroach-infested apartment with a leaky roof and faulty wiring.  </P> <P> The judge told Canter in March that he would have to serve only 45 days of a  six-month sentence if he sold his building and paid his tenants' relocation  costs.  </P> <P> Canter promised four tenants $4,000 each if they agreed to move out in March,  but it was not until a sentencing hearing June 27 that the landlord's lawyer  turned over a check. When the check bounced, Judge Ferkich said he would  consider ordering a longer jail sentence for Canter.  </P> <P> A second check delivered Monday was covered by sufficient funds, tenants'  lawyer David Salisbury of the Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach told the judge  on Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow forges ahead on fresh data Wall Street US stocks surged yesterday afternoon after a regional economic survey helped to dispel the market's worst fears on inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 58.55 higher at 3,953.88, its best closing level since February 3, the day before the Federal Reserve's shift to a more restrictive monetary policy. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 6.01 stronger at 474.81 as advances on the Big Board swamped declines by 1,539 to 604. New York SE volume was an impressive 281m shares, even though many investors were sidelined in observance of Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. A powerful advance by technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq composite up 10.05, or 1.31 per cent, to 778.66. The welcome suggestion on inflation was contained in the monthly survey of business conditions conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. In the report, indices measuring the prices paid and received by manufacturers showed sharp declines, in a surprising reversal of the trend which surfaced in the latest survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The Treasury market seized on the report as a positive indication of the direction of prices in the coming months. But bonds across the board showed only moderate improvement, as traders waited for today's data on industrial production and capacity utilisation before committing themselves. For equity investors, the Philadelphia report seemed to restore much of the confidence undermined last week by news of a big upturn in August producer prices. Stocks began slowly but steadily built up momentum as the session unfolded. By late afternoon the market had gained enough forward momentum to trigger a wave of computer-guided buy programs, sending the Dow to within 25 points of its record closing high. Caterpillar, a bellwether cyclical stock, climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 . In other stocks closely linked to the economic cycle, Deere gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 73 1/4 and International Paper advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 76 1/4 . One of the most active NYSE issues was ITT, which fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 80 1/8 on heavy volume of 3.5m shares. The trading followed the disclosure that the company was planning to sell some of its financial services businesses to finance a strategic push into media and entertainment. The prospect of such a move prompted Goldman Sachs to downgrade the issue. Tektronix, an electronics manufacturer, jumped Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 38 1/4 . Late on Wednesday the company said net income in its fiscal first quarter rose 64 per cent on strong sales of colour computer printers. Parametric Technology, a software designer, climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 30 15/16 after Salomon Brothers boosted its estimate of the company's 1995 earnings. Canada Toronto staged a good advance in fairly heavy trading, with strong performances seen in paper, forestry, metal and industrial stocks. The TSE 300 index closed 40.43 up at 4,385.46, with rises outpacing falls by 446 to 319 after volume of 66m shares. Metal and mineral stocks were said to be on a roll, with a number trading at or near 52-week highs. Analysts said the stocks are being bid up by expectations of earnings gains and higher prices for base metals as the business cycle matures. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo ended 3.4 per cent lower, dragged down by unconfirmed rumours that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's vice-presidential running mate, Mr Marco Maciel, received illegal funding for his campaign. The Bovespa index receded 1,889 to 52,875. Volume reached a record RDollars 1.02bn (Dollars 1.19bn), due to huge option operations carried out by a major investment bank. The option deals, known as 'box' deals, are a combination of two calls and two puts, and involved power utility Eletrobras options. The preferred shares dropped 3.6 per cent to RDollars 374. Brokers said the market was also concerned about a four-day-old metalworkers' strike, which could threaten the government's anti-inflation plan.</p>

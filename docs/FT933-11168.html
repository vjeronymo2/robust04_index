			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco earnings hit by US cigarette price war RJR NABISCO, the large US food and tobacco group, yesterday announced an 11 per cent decline in second-quarter net income to Dollars 77m as a fierce cigarette price war in the US continued to take its toll on earnings. Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The extremely competitive domestic tobacco environment led to a significant decline in our earnings.' Annually, RJR's US cigarette business accounts for more than half group operating profits. The price war began in April when Philip Morris, RJR's biggest US rival, cut the prices of its flagship Marlboro brand in an attempt to halt the growing popularity of discount brands. Later in the same month, RJR announced it was lowering prices of its top Winston and Camel brands. Mr Harper issued a warning yesterday about the group's earnings prospects, saying that RJR expected to incur 'significant expenses' as it adjusted to the changing business environment. 'Those expenses, along with lower domestic tobacco revenues, will further depress our financial results through year-end,' he said. The warning, and the lower profits, hit RJR's shares, which closed Dollars 1/8 lower at Dollars 5 1/8 (a 52-week low) on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR's second-quarter profits would have been higher but for an after-tax charge of Dollars 65m related to the repurchase and retirement of debt. RJR's results in the same quarter a year ago were affected by a charge. Excluding the special items, RJR's earnings in the latest quarter were 32 per cent lower than in the same three months of 1992. Operating income in the quarter fell 24 per cent to Dollars 582m, and net sales dropped 7 per cent to Dollars 3.72bn. Net Sales in RJR's worldwide tobacco business fell 13 per cent to Dollars 2.03bn following a 20 per cent drop in domestic sales. The company said, however, that the recent price cuts and increased promotional activities should lead to improved sales of its top brands. The food businesses reported a modest improvement in second-quarter sales to Dollars 1.69bn, a performance that the company said reflected stronger US and international biscuit volumes, costs savings from productivity initiatives and the contribution of recent acquisitions. The news of RJR's falling profits comes a month after the group abandoned plans to raise Dollars 1.5bn through an offering of shares pegged to the performance of its food division because of a general weakness in the market for food company shares.</p>

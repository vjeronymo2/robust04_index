			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Dutch budget deficit below expectations Unexpectedly strong tax receipts allowed the new Dutch cabinet to submit a budget for 1995 yesterday that manages to keep the country's budget deficit well below the projections made last month when the coalition government took office. The rise in tax receipts, fuelled by a resurgence in economic growth, means that the 1995 deficit will represent 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with the government's own ceiling of 3.3 per cent set in August. The 1994 deficit, which was also originally expected to stand at 3.3 per cent of GDP, is also now expected to come in at 3 per cent. The buoyancy of the Dutch economy was underlined yesterday when the Central Planning Office forecast that GDP would grow by 3 per cent rise in 1995, the sharpest rate in the 1990s. It also revised its forecast for growth in the current year to 2 per cent, double the 1 per cent forecast released in the spring. Government spending will rise to Fl 233.3bn (Pounds 86bn) in 1995 from Fl 200.2bn this year, reflecting a large, one-off payment of subsidies to public housing co-operatives. Tax revenue is projected to rise to Fl 153.5bn from Fl 150.4bn in 1994, which is itself Fl 2.3bn higher than originally forecast. Despite the better than expected economic and fiscal outlook for 1994 and 1995, the new left-right coalition government led by Mr Wim Kok, the Labour leader, said it aimed to tackle structural problems in the Dutch economy, such as stubbornly high unemployment and the country's big public debt. 'You can't allow yourself to be blinded by short-term economic recovery,' Mr Kok said. Mr Gerrit Zalm, the finance minister, said that the cabinet's budgetary policies, drawn up in August, had been purposely based on cautious economic assumptions so that the government would not have to modify spending plans if it encountered economic setbacks. The government previously set a deficit ceiling of 2.9 per cent for 1998, the final year of its four-year term. Yesterday, it said it would use any further tax windfalls to reduce this to 2.7 per cent. If there is any money remaining, the government will also seek to earmark up to Fl 100m for extra spending on policing.</p>

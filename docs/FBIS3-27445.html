			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- China's Vice-Premier  Zhu Rongji today renewed the government's resolve to push  forward the reform drive this year in a bid to lay a solid  groundwork for a socialist market economy.    In a speech to a gathering of 1,000 leading Japanese  businessmen, Zhu warned that China's economic development would  lag much behind and the nation would miss a chance to modernize  itself if the reform efforts failed.    China made "brilliant achievements" in its economic reform  and modernization program during 1993, which saw a growth of 13  percent in its gross national product (GNP) after a continuously  speedy rise for more than 10 years, he said.    The GNP in 1993 trippled that in 1978 when China began to  pursue its policy of opening up, Zhu said in his speech entitled  "China's Reform and Development in 1994."    During the last 15 years, China has achieved great progress  in carrying out reform and developing the economy.    "We have successfully avoided radical ups and downs and  maintained social and political stability while great changes  have taken place in the country's economic system and social  structure," Zhu said.    He dispelled concerns that China's economy would overheat  and  the current development speed would not last long.    While admitting some overheating symptoms caused by derailed  stock deals, real estate speculation and an overabundance of  investment projects during the first half of last year, Zhu  stressed that the Chinese Government had taken effective  macro-economic control measures since last June to maintain a  sustained, speedy and healthy development of the national  economy.    "The trend of a possible economic overheating has been now  brought under control, the monetary supply order and the  circulation order have been improved, and some exciting  achievements have been achieved," he said.    He dismissed overseas reports that China's credit policy had  failed and explained that the government's decision to tighten  credit made last year was designed to orient investment to the  needs of key state construction projects.    "In short, we took macro-economic control measures in  accordance with the reality of the Chinese economy. This is in  keeping with the laws of market economy as well as the actual  situation in China," he said.    One of the successes in macro management, he said, was a  rise  in the country's foreign currency reserves last year despite the  registration of a 10-billion U.S. dollar trade deficit.    Zhu told the gathering that this year was a crucial stage  for  China in transforming the economic system while keeping the  current development momentum.    To this end, the Chinese Government launched complex reforms  at the beginning of this year on finance, taxation, monetary  supply, exchange rates and state enterprises and has been  implementing them smoothly since then.    Zhu, however, pointed to some problems that could undermine  the reform efforts if not solved.    He cited last November's steep rise in grain prices, and  panic buying of electronic appliances triggered by  misunderstanding of the reform bills and fears of a possible  rekindling of the high inflation that prevailed in 1988 and 1989.    "The price turbulence signaled clearly that we still need to  keep vigilance on the economic situation, for reform embraces  risks," he said.    Dismissing arguments that it is immature to proceed with  all-round reforms at this moment, Zhu said, "I believe it is  the very right time to completely push forward the drive."    The vice-premier explained that this was because the  government's reform policy was deeply rooted within the hearts  of the Chinese people.    Secondly, he said, the government had accumulated  experiences  on reform over the past 15 years and had already mapped out a  blueprint and an action program on reform for the next few years  in line with a consensus arrived at among Chinese leaders.    Thirdly, the rapid economic development and the resulting  improvements in the living standard had enabled the Chinese  people to bear, both economically and psychologically, possible  pain brought about by reform, he said.    "If we fail to overcome difficulties in the economic  restructuring in the next few years and well solve all kinds of  problems that will crop up on way of development, we might delay  the proceeding of the modernization of our nation and miss a  historical opportunity of enlivening the nation and making the  state powerful," he said.    He said he was confident that China would manage to tide  over  the hardship in the years to come. He predicted that China  would establish a socialist market economy by the end of 1996.    The Chinese reform, which he called "a great, new  century-oriented reform project," would promote the economic  prosperity and social stability not only in China, but also in  East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, he said.    The prospect for China's economic growth would remain bright  because the Chinese Government would never weaken its  determination to build up the nation and improve the living  standard of the people, Zhu said in conclusion.</p>

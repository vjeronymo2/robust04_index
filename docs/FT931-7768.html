			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Senior GMTV executive resigns MS LIS HOWELL, director of programmes at GMTV, yesterday became a casualty of the commercial breakfast company's disappointing performance in the ratings. Her resignation comes less than two months after GMTV took over the franchise from TV-am. It follows the appointment of Mr Greg Dyke, former chief executive of London Weekend Television, as non-executive chairman. Ms Howell will be replaced by Mr Peter McHugh, a former head of current affairs at Tyne Tees television. The latest ratings show that GMTV is not very far ahead of its two rivals, BBC Breakfast News, and Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. GMTV has been getting a weekday peak audience of 1.7m with a 1.1m average, 15 per cent below its expected audience. The BBC, which has a harder news format, has a peak of 1.3m viewers and an average of 850,000. The big surprise has been the low-budget success of The Big Breakfast which has been winning a peak audience of 1.2m and an average figure of 650,000. The Big Breakfast has an annual budget of about Pounds 8m compared with annual programme costs of around Pounds 30m at GMTV. On Friday Mr Dyke emphasised there was no crisis comparable with the early days of TV-am. Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director, said then that there was 'plentiful demand for advertising'. GMTV, jointly owned by Carlton Communications, LWT (Holdings), Scottish TV, Walt Disney and The Guardian and Manchester Evening News, took or booked more than Pounds 50m in advertising revenue before it went on air on January 1.</p>

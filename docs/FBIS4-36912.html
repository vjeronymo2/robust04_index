			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Khayrallah Khayrallah in London, Sulayman Nimr </F> and Faysal Makram in Sanaa, Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden, and  Raghidah Dirgham in New York: "'Ali Salih Tells AL-HAYAH: With  Saudi Arabia's Help We Can Achieve a Satisfactory Solution to  the Yemeni Crisis"]    [Excerpt] In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Yemeni Presidential  Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali Abdallah Salih said:  "We seek understanding with our neighbors. Our neighbors,  especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, are the closest to us  and, with their help and cooperation, we can achieve a  satisfactory solution to the Yemeni crisis."    In a telephone statement to AL-HAYAH which called him from  London, 'Ali Salih, when asked why there has been no adherence  to the cease-fire, said: "They are the ones violating the  cease-fire and they want international monitoring of it." Asked  what was the solution, he replied: "Dialogue is the solution."  He was then asked: Dialogue with whom? He replied: "With the  elements not included in the public prosecutor's decision on  people who are now legally wanted on the charge of committing  crimes against the homeland. We are willing to reach  understanding with those elements and to hold a dialogue in the  context of the Constitution of the Yemeni Republic and the  constant national principles."    It is known that the public prosecutor's decision includes  the names of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential  Council of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" and secretary  general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and a number of YSP  leaders including southern Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas and Defense Minister Brigadier General Haytham Qasim  Tahir.    AL-HAYAH has learned that a parliamentary delegation  consisting of representatives of popular and political sectors  is making contacts to pave the way for a visit to the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia in the next few days. The delegation is expected  to be headed by Yemeni House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh  'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. Another delegation is making  arrangements for a tour of the rest of the Gulf Cooperation  Council [GCC] states.    Meanwhile, there were reports yesterday of more military  pressure on Aden. Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary  general, announced yesterday in Abu-Dhabi that he was discussing  with the Yemeni leaders a compromise solution providing for the  participation of foreign observers in supervising the cease-fire  in Yemen.    Brahimi told AFP that supervision of the cease-fire could be  done "by a joint Yemeni committee with the participation of  foreign observers."    The Algerian diplomat, who is scheduled to visit Qatar and  Jordan later on, said that the plan currently under discussion  would provide "common grounds" that would lead to the cessation  of the battles which have been raging in Yemen for 40 days. He  described the plan as a "positive step" in his mission aimed at  implementation of Security Council Resolution 924. He added  that the plan was a compromise between the positions of Sanaa  and Aden.    The Yemeni Government yesterday informed Brahimi that "the  deployment of international observers between the government  forces and the secessionist forces could not be discussed at  international level as demanded by the YSP's secessionists, and  that there was a presence of international observers in the  framework of the Yemeni Joint Military Committee which had the  task of stopping the military deterioration which occurred  during the political crisis before the outbreak of the battles  and which, in addition to Yemeni military commanders, included  Jordanian and Omani officers as well as the U.S. and French  charges d'affaires in Sanaa."    A government source in Sanaa has stated that the Yemeni  Republic conveyed to Brahimi its acceptance of the plan for the  formation of a Yemeni joint military committee from the two  warring parties to supervise the cease-fire with the  participation of foreign observers. The government source  explained that the military committee proposed by the UN envoy  was already in existence and had been formed with the  participation of observers from Jordan and the Sultanate of Oman  and some foreign attaches to embassies in Sanaa, such as the  French and U.S. attaches.    The source said that urgent contacts held with Brahimi  yesterday afternoon resulted in agreement that Sanaa would send  representatives to a meeting with representatives of the other  side and that Brahimi suggested Geneva or Cairo as a possible  venue for the meeting. Sanaa is expected to name two  representatives in the next few hours who would leave as soon as  agreement is reached on a venue for the meeting, which would be  held under the UN envoy's supervision.    The source added that, because of that agreement, Brahimi  decided that there was no need for him to visit Sanaa again as  suggested by the Yemeni capital yesterday morning.    There was increasing talk in Sanaa yesterday about a  political solution to the crisis. Responsible sources had  expressed the view that an agreement on the principle of  dialogue between the two parties to the conflict on the basis of  the proposals submitted to Envoy Brahimi when he visited Sanaa  last week, a dialogue based on recognition of unity and  constitutional legitimacy, would lead to an effective and  practical cease-fire, but it seems that Brahimi insisted that  there should first be a cease-fire before anything else. As a  result, Sanaa responded to his request and agreed to the  formation of the proposed cease-fire committee.    It seems that some elements in the Yemeni leadership are in  favor of facilitating dialogue with the YSP leaderships without  insistence on any conditions except that the dialogue should be  within the framework of unity.    A high-ranking responsible source in Sanaa yesterday told  AL-HAYAH that "the Yemeni Government's clarification of that  matter, which was conveyed to the UN secretary general's envoy,  stemmed from the decision issued by the Yemeni president on  forming the Military Committee during the political crisis  before the outbreak of fighting between the government forces  and the misled forces under the command of the secessionist wing  of the YSP."    The source added: "The Yemeni Government has, from the first  weeks of the Yemeni crisis, been interested in the participation  of military observers from fraternal and friendly states along  with the Military Committee consisting of a number of military  commanders from the Yemeni armed forces, because of the Yemeni  Government's awareness of the real situation, since developments  have demonstrated that the secessionists in the YSP had a  premeditated plan for a bloody conflict to undermine the unity,  security, and stability of the country."    In conclusion, the source said: "The Yemeni Government's  acceptance of the presence of international observers is  conditional on the international team being from the Joint  Military Committee formed by a decision of Yemeni Armed Forces  Commander in Chief President Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  in the context of joint cooperation between the Yemeni  Government and the Security Council for the implementation of  Resolution 924 on the current situation in Yemen, in a way that  would not prejudice the Yemeni Republic's sovereignty, unity,  and democracy, and with commitment to constitutional legitimacy  and the results of the elections held on 27 April, 1993 as a  basis of any dialogue between the Yemeni Government and the  YSP."

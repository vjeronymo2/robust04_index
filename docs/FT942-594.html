			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's 2.2 per cent decline provides lead for region Share prices dropped as the yen set a new high against the dollar, sending the Nikkei 225 average down 2.2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index declined 465.79 to 20,300.96 in low volumes as most investors remained absent due to the turmoil on the currency markets. The Topix index fell 23.29, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,649.78. Traders said the political situation had little impact on investor confidence. One commented that the resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister, at the weekend actually had a favourable effect since it meant that a general election would be avoided. The Nikkei 225 opened at the session's high of 20,649.53, but soon fell on arbitrage selling to hit the day's low of 20,168.53 in the afternoon, before recouping some of the loss on buying by financial institutions. Volume was 363m shares, against 355m. The Nikkei 300 weakened 3.76, or 1.2 per cent, to 300.23 and first section declines overwhelmed rises by 1,006 to 89, with 95 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.71 to 1,342.75. High-technology shares suffered a sell-off due to the high yen: Toshiba fell Y27 to Y798 and Fujitsu lost Y30 at Y1,080. Consumer electronics makers were also lower, with Sony down Y140 to Y5,980 and Matsushita Electric Industrial off Y30 at Y1,780. Steels were sold, with Sumitomo Metal, the day's most active issue, falling Y8 to Y292. Automobiles were also lower, with Honda Motor down Y30 to Y1,840 and Nissan Motor falling Y24 to Y850. Sharp, however, reversed its morning decline to close Y10 up at Y1,800, while buying orders from public funds lifted Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y3,000 to Y837,000. Electric power companies, which are large importers of fuel, were the least affected by the bout of selling, and Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y30 to Y3,130. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 467.82 down at 22,774.56 in volume of 12.9m shares. Roundup The region's markets took their lead from activity in currencies. HONG KONG was led partly by a volatile futures market, which took a late slide. The Hang Seng index closed 233.52 lower at 8,647.48. Properties were hardest hit, with investors worried that developers' earnings might be affected by recent government measures to cool prices. Sun Hung Kai fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 45.50, New World Development by 80 cents to HKDollars 21.50 and Henderson Land by HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 35.50. There was said to be little impact on equities from the latest delay in Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's future. SYDNEY saw its biggest one- day decline since August 1991, which left the All Ordinaries index down 60.5 at 1,957.4. Turnover came to ADollars 502.1m. The takeover target Bridge Oil was the most heavily traded stock, with 56.49m shares exchanged after Parker and Parsley lifted its bid to 90 cents a share from 80 cents. Bridge moved ahead 4 cents to 90 cents. The insurance sector registered the biggest fall in percentage terms, losing 4.6 per cent on the day, as GIO fell 11 cents to ADollars 2.29. SINGAPORE was sharply lower, with losers swamping gainers by 319 to 13 in a nervous market. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 37.11 to 2,208.71. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded from a day's low of 996.90 to close 11.51 off on balance at 1,003.52. However, expectation of forced selling if the market weakens further took its toll of second-line stocks; Idris fell 16 cents to MDollars 4.68 in volume of 9.8m shares. SEOUL, one exception to the downtrend, saw a technical rally after a five-day decline, with healthy institutional support noted for banking shares - viewed as undervalued, given improving business performance. The composite index added 11.08 at 931.04. Both Cho Hung Bank and Korea First Bank went limit up, each gaining Won600 to Won10,800 and Won12,500 respectively. Trading and construction companies also gained momentum in anticipation of preparatory talks at the border vil-lage of Panmunjom today for a first-ever summit between presidents of the two Koreas. BOMBAY finished lower but after staging a mild recovery from the day's worst level. The market was not expected to encounter fresh impetus until Thursday, when the two-week account in specified shares ends. The BSE 30-share index lost 38.61 at 4,174.40. MANILA declined steadily throughout the day and the composite index ended off 39.69 at 2,749.45. Declines exceeded advances by 61 to 7, with 31 issues unchanged. Turnover shrank to 565m pesos from Friday's 1.34bn pesos. Manila Electric 'B' shares dipped 5 per cent, or 17.50 pesos, to 327.50 pesos and Philippine Long Distance Telephone lost 1.5 per cent, or 25 pesos, to 1,655 pesos. BANGKOK fell steeply, although it ended off the session's low point. The SET index dipped 37.73 to 1,254.81, having seen a downside of 1,248.56. Turnover was Bt5.9bn. One broker said there was support for the index at 1,250. Finance and bank stocks were the hardest hit - Bangkok Bank retreated Bt5 to Bt176 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt4 to Bt115. WELLINGTON ended at its lowest level this year in below average turnover, with most of the selling coming from retail customers. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 77.47 to 1,961.30 in turnover of NZDollars 29.13m. COLOMBO was supported by strong interest from domestic investors and renewed foreign demand, which lifted the all-share index 40.84 to 993.28. Turnover, however, contracted to SLRs149.9m from Friday's SLRs221m.  ---------------------------      THE DAY'S CHANGES  ---------------------------                  % Change  --------------------------- Wellington         -3.8 Sydney             -3.0 Bangkok            -2.9 Hong Kong          -2.6 Singapore          -1.7 Manila             -1.4 Kuala Lumpur       -1.1 Seoul              +1.2  ---------------------------</p>

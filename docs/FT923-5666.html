			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Japanese Economic Package: Pump-priming welcomed on Wall Street WALL STREET economists yesterday welcomed the Japanese pump-priming package as a strong stimulus to growth in the domestic economy which could have a significant global knock-on effect. 'Its larger than the market expected, both in cosmetic and substantive terms,' said Mr John Lipsky of securities house Salomon Brothers. 'I'm glad to see someone, somewhere in the world, realises that growth is important,' said Mr Bob Brusca, an economist at Nikko Securities in New York, who has persistently criticised the White House and US Federal Reserve for not doing more to stimulate US economic growth. Analysts said the move should help the world economy by boosting Japanese demand for imports and lowering the country's huge balance of payments current account surplus. The yen immediately gained against the dollar. Some analysts said this movement might peter out if scepticism grew about the package, but others suggested the currency would continue to strengthen over the longer term. 'We expect the yen to reach new heights against the dollar and move higher against European currencies,' said Mr Lipsky. The Japanese move is not expected to have much immediate, direct effect on US markets. Analysts said it could lead some fund managers to switch the weighting of portfolios more strongly into Japan. But they noted that US markets, preoccupied by domestic considerations, did not suffer much fall-out during the Tokyo stock market's long decline and were unlikely to register significant gains from a Japanese bounce back. Reaction in London was more muted. The measures were expected to have little direct effect on the European economy, although it was suggested they might boost investors' confidence. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers International, the US-owned investment bank, said: 'The measures may diminish the impact of the recession in Japan, but will do little to add to private investment in Japan or pull in imports. The Japanese are basically filling in a hole, rather than building a hill.' Mr George Magnus, international bond economist at SG Warburg Securities, the London investment house, said the impact of the package would not be as great as it seemed. 'It looks like a big 'un, but in reality only about two thirds of the package will count for new spending that will give the Japanese economy a fiscal boost. The spillover effects to Europe will be limited.' Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Finance International, the securities arm of the Japanese bank, said: 'The measures will bolster the Japanese financial system, and that will be good news for Europe. It will mean there is less of a risk of a large claw-back of investment by Japanese groups from Europe, which is likely to help the markets.' Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew, the Swiss bank, said the package would 'do very little' for Europe.</p>

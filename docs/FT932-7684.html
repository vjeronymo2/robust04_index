			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Progress on Bosnian peace moves, say UK and Russia THE RUSSIAN and British foreign ministers claimed yesterday that substantial progress was being made on new initiatives to end the fighting in Bosnia, in spite of President Bill Clinton's reservations on setting up expanded 'safe havens' for Bosnian Moslems. Neither Mr Andrei Kozyrev nor Mr Douglas Hurd disclosed details after discussions in Washington with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. But both hinted that all three, plus Mr Alain Juppe of France, could meet again today in either Washington or New York. The foreign minister of Spain, which is one of the nations with peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, has also been invited to join the discussions. Mr Clinton, speaking after a White House meeting with Mr Kozyrev, said the US was 'sceptical that we'll be able to resolve this satisfactorily within the framework that has been proposed'. He went on: 'I don't want to see the US get in a position where we're re-creating Northern Ireland, Lebanon or Cyprus or anything else.' He saw 'some potential down the road' for a peacekeeping operation, but added: 'We don't want our people in there basically in a shooting gallery.' His comments contrasted sharply with those of Mr Kozyrev, who insisted after meeting the president that the US and Russia were 'very, very close' to an agreement that could be presented to the European allies. But a senior British official emphasised that the allies accepted that the US would not send ground troops as a contribution to an expanded military force to protect the safe havens. The United Nations Security Council is due next week to consider the safe havens, as well as the setting up of a war crimes tribunal and the stationing of possibly 500 inspectors on the Serbia-Bosnia border to observe whether Serbia is honouring its pledge to stop military and fuel supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Hurd conceded that the question of the implicit recognition of Serb territorial gains 'will have to be answered' when full details of the new peace initiative are made known. Mr Christopher, according to several US press reports, has come round to the view that it is impossible to roll back all the Serb gains and is prepared to accept the safe haven notion so long as it is, as one senior official put it, 'a temporary measure and not the endorsement of any concept of partition'. That concern seems to underline Mr Clinton's reservations. The White House also made clear on Thursday that the US wants to avoid the impression that 'ethnic cleansing' by both Serbs and Croats is being rewarded. Mr Clinton was not entirely dismissive of chances of an international agreement. He said that 'ultimately there will have to be some reasonable borders and some political solutions which have a reasonable territorial component'. In such circumstances, he implied, US ground forces could be peacekeepers. Town without pity, Page 8</p>

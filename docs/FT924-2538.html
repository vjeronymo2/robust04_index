			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Goldman strategy will be unchanged MR STEPHEN Friedman, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, will become sole head of the New York investment bank when Mr Robert Rubin, the firm's other joint chief, becomes director of the Clinton administration's new National Economic Council. Goldman Sachs made clear last night that Mr Rubin's appointment, announced by president-elect Bill Clinton yesterday, would mean no other changes in the top management of the company. Goldman's strategy has made the firm one of the most consistently successful on Wall Street. In a message to staff yesterday Mr Friedman said: 'Apart from normal evolution, you should not expect any departures from the managerial or strategic courses we have been on.' The Clinton appointment brings to an end an unusually close working relationship between Mr Rubin and Mr Friedman for much of their careers at Goldman. They were appointed co-chief operating officers in 1987 and co-chairmen in 1990. Mr Rubin will detatch himself completely from the firm.</p>

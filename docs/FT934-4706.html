			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: State urges Renault to sustain unit The French government has asked Renault to draw up plans to prolong activity at Chausson, the motor group which suspended payments in September. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said the government was seeking to ensure the industrial future of Chausson, which is owned 50-50 by Renault, the state-owned automotive group, and Peugeot, its private-sector rival. Mr Longuet said Peugeot's decision to stop manufacturing bodies for its 504 utility vehicle from the end of November left the fate of the company in Renault's hands. Chausson has two factories on the outskirts of Paris, at Creil and Gennevilliers. It manufactures body parts and components for cars, including Renault's Trafic van. Mr Longuet said rationalisation was still necessary at Chausson, which has been confronted by an increasingly difficult financial situation.</p>

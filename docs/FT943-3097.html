			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Labatt shareholders vote against poison pill Shareholders of John Labatt, the Canadian-based international brewer, have rejected management's anti-takeover 'poison pill'. The plan would have made it prohibitively expensive to buy control of Labatt, but institutional holders swung the vote at Tuesday's annual meeting, bringing those in favour of rejection to 52 per cent. The institutions have been critical of the ambitious expansion plans of Mr George Taylor, president, but after the meeting, Mr Taylor maintained the vote was 'a verdict on management and nothing to do with corporate strategy'. Mr William Mackenzie, vice-president of Fairvest Securities, an institutional holder, said the poison pill was unacceptable because it did not allow a partial bid to succeed. Others said it was an attempt to protect management. The pill would have been triggered if anyone tried to buy more than 20 per cent of Labatt. In such a situation. existing shareholders could buy additional shares at a 50 per cent discount. Management said the pill was designed to give it time to pursue alternatives. Mr Taylor said he knew of no potential bidders for Labatt. The company has been widely held since the Edper-Hees group divested control nearly two years ago.</p>

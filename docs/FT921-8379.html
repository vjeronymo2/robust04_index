			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Proton public offering heavily oversubscribed THE public offering for 30 per cent of the shares in Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional (Proton), Malaysia's national car maker, was oversubscribed 6.44 times. The company - a joint venture between the Malaysian government and Mitsubishi of Japan - received MDollars 2.1bn (USDollars 808m) in bids for the 55.5m shares offered to the public at MDollars 5 each. This was in spite of the company predicting a fall in pre-tax profits over the next two years. Under government listing rules, the allocation of shares must be made along ethnic lines. Proton employees were allocated 5.7m shares, while the balance was reserved for government-approved Bumiputra, or Malay, investors. Almost 98 per cent in the employee portion was subscribed; details of Bumiputra bids were not disclosed.</p>

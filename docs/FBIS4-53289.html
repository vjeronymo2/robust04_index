			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Vientiane, May 14 (KPL) -- [Passage omitted] Mr.  Khamtai Siphandon's address at the inaugural session of the  third congress of the LPRYU [Lao People's Revolutionary Youth  Union] yesterday morning emphasized the youth organisation's new  challenge in fulfilling the comprehensive policy of renovation  of the party and state, in the safeguarding of the nation's  independence and territorial integrity while improving the  livelihood and the well-being of the people in the country.    The president of the LPRP CC [Lao People's Revolutionary  Party Central Committee] said that the youth ought to have  revolutionary ideals in life, and have the needs and energy to  put into deeds their ideals for the benefits of the society.  They ought to have knowledge, skills in addition to correct  revolutionary moral and conducts in the execution of the public  tasks in all sectors. The youths should be the leading task  forces at all fronts including those involved in anticorruption,  embezzlement, illegal transactions, tax collection, and other  negative manifestations in the society. He said that the youth  ought to translate their slogan "wherever there is difficulty,  the youth will handle; wherever there is hardship, the youth  will overcome; when the nation calls, the youth will be present"  into deeds in their integrated endeavours for national  construction from now till 2000. They must make optimal use of  the natural resources of the country in a sustainable manner so  that the people in the nation can benefit from the wealth of the  nation, providing each and everyone clothes and food so that the  people's living standard can be stabilised and improved.    Mr. Khamtai Siphandon said that the issue of expanding  membership of the LPRYU was an important task that the Lao youth  organisation needed to give special attention to and together  with the party organisation this issue needed to be handled. On  the one hand, the organisation of the youth needed to be  streamlined for work efficiency, and along with this, there  ought to be a programme for educating the organisation's members  and non-members alike so that they would understand and  appreciate the party and state's policies and the state's laws.</p>

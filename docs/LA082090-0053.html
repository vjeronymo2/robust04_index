			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Prague Rock: The Rolling Stones, nearing the end of their 3-month-old Urban  Jungle tour, rolled into Prague Saturday, drawing 100,000 to their first  concert ever in Czechoslovakia. The crowd was all the more impressive because  tickets sold for the equivalent of $10, about 8% of the average Czechoslovak's  monthly wage. The Stones are donating all proceeds from the concert to a  charity headed by the wife of Czechoslovakia's playwright-president, Vaclav  Havel. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

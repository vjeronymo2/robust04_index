			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang  Province has recently designated some 1.675 million ha -- nearly  95 percent -- of its farmland as basic agricultural reserves as  part of its measures to protect agricultural production.    Departments involved in agricultural development stipulated  the reserved land is not allowed to be used for purposes other  than farming, unless approved by the responsible department.    One of the economically developed provinces, Zhejiang  reported a record 45.6 billion yuan in total agricultural output  value last year.    However, for various reasons, the development of agriculture  is still being threatened by intensified market competition,  officials of the department in charge of agriculture said.    To bring into play the initiative of farmers in growing  food,  the provincial government will also lift the grain purchase  price, establish a risk fund system, and improve the grain  reserves and readjustment systems.    A host of granaries will be set up along the main roads  running through the province, to relieve pressures on the  grain-producing areas as well as make things convenient for  grain transportation, government officials said.    In addition, local governments and financial organizations  at  all levels will expand investment in the agricultural sector in  1994.    According to sources from the provincial government, it will  increase input in agriculture by ten percent this year.    A total of more than three billion yuan was invested in the  agricultural sector in 1993, the sources said.    Researchers from the provincial research institutes will  work  hard to popularize fine varieties of crops as well as advanced  planting techniques among farmers throughout the province, to  help them benefit more from farming activities.    Official sources said that the province's cultivated area of  early rice this year is expected to reach some 871,000 ha.</p>

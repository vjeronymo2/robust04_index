			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SIMPSONS' HELP FOX SEND A SIGNAL;  </P> <P> PROGRAMMING: DESPITE FEWER AFFILIATES, THE FOURTH NETWORK IS MAKING A STRONGER  SHOWING.  </P> <P> "The Simpsons" is an even bigger phenomenon than most viewers realize. The Fox  show's ability to finish among the nation's 15 most-watched programs and  frequently outdraw the Sunday-night competition on ABC, CBS and NBC is somewhat  analogous to RC Cola ringing up better sales than Coke, Pepsi and 7-Up.  </P> <P> The reason: Fox has only 129 affiliated stations that collectively reach only  about 90% of the country. By contrast, each of the three major networks has at  least 209 affiliates that together cover virtually every TV household in the  nation. And many of Fox's stations transmit comparatively weak, UHF signals  that the residents of those communities previously had ignored in the same way  that most Los Angeles area viewers rarely turn to KDOC Channel 56.  </P> <P> So Fox shows are automatically handicapped in their ability to compete for  national ratings. But Fox executives are hopeful that the skyrocketing success  of "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children" will help the upstart  fourth network overcome that handicap in the years ahead as its affiliates  attract new viewers and new advertisers, then plow at least some of the  increased revenues back into the stations for equipment and transmission  improvements that will make them, and Fox, a more formidable threat to the  three major networks.  </P> <P> Take, for example, WCOV Channel 20, the Fox-affiliate in Montgomery, Ala.  </P> <P> Before Fox, said station chief David Woods, WCOV was only months away from  going dark. "We didn't even have money to buy toilet paper," he said.  </P> <P> "When we would try to sell ourselves at an ad agency, they would laugh us out  of their office. Now they give us the nice chair."  </P> <P> In the spring of 1987, WCOV was airing reruns of the 1982 sci-fi series  "Voyagers," attracting a pitiful 1% of the audience in the Sunday night time  slot that now houses "The Simpsons." Fox's animated series routinely comes in  second in its time period in Montgomery with about 20% of the audience, beating  both NBC and ABC. And with adults between ages 18 and 49 -- the demographic  that advertisers prize most -- "The Simpsons" grabs a 30 share, crushing even  top-rated "Murder, She Wrote" on CBS.  </P> <P> It does all this despite the fact that WCOV is vastly inferior in terms of  power and reach to Montgomery's three major network affiliates.  </P> <P> "If we were drag racing," Woods said, "they all have V-8s and I'm an old  four-cylinder. I have an 800-foot (transmitting) tower, and they all have  2,000-foot towers."  </P> <P> That means that up to 30 miles from the center of town, Montgomery viewers can  tune in all four stations with equal clarity. Beyond 30 miles, the reception  for WCOV gets increasingly fuzzy up to 50 miles away, when the WCOV picture is  nothing but snow. But the three network affiliates can be seen up to about 85  or 90 miles away, Woods said.  </P> <P> Such technical inferiority is typical at many of the Fox affiliates nationwide.  Compounded with the network's 10% disadvantage in the amount of territory it  covers, this helps explains why "The Simpsons" or "Married . . . With Children"  could be No. 1 in Los Angeles and other big cities and then barely make it in  to top-20 in the week's national ratings. Last Sunday, for example, "The  Simpsons" attracted a whopping 37% of the Los Angeles audience to rank as the  week's most-watched program, but got only 25% nationally and placed 13th.  "Married . . . With Children" was fourth in Los Angeles and 18th nationally.  </P> <P> Fox executives say it will take years before their affiliates grow strong  enough to enable the network to compete on the same playing field with the Big  Three. Though Fox has been adding two or three new stations to its lineup each  year, additional stations simply do not exist in the majority of areas Fox  cannot reach. But "the tremendous performance" of "The Simpsons" and "Married .  . . With Children" will shorten the time frame, said Peter Chernin, president  of Fox Entertainment Group.  </P> <P> "When you think of a small UHF station that is not a factor in its market and  all of a sudden you put what may be the strongest show on television on that  little station, it's an extraordinary event," he said. "Now all of a sudden  people that never paid any attention to this station have to go find it. That  has an enormous impact on the rest of the station."  </P> <P> At WCOV in Montgomery, Woods confirmed that "sampling of other programs here  has increased considerably. Prior to Fox, no one watched us. Now they tune in  for 'Married . . . With Children' and they may see a promotional spot for  'Arsenio' or 'Hard Copy' and come back for that. Once you have the audience  watching, it's easier to retain them."  </P> <P> Harry Pappas, whose Pappas Telecasting Companies owns Fox affiliates in Fresno,  Omaha, Neb. and Greenville, S.C., said that the huge ratings for "The Simpsons"  and "Married . . . With Children" have helped to double and in some cases  triple prime-time ratings at his stations, doubling and tripling revenues on  the three nights that Fox supplies programming. Those gains have also rubbed  off on the rest of his programming lineup, he added.  </P> <P> For many of the Fox affiliates that have long been saddled with weak  programming, Pappas said, such revenue jumps will enable them to invest in  technical improvements and promotional efforts that will build their audience  -- and Fox's -- even more. The Fox blockbusters have also made it easier for  many stations to obtain financing for such improvements, he noted.  </P> <P> WCOV's Woods said that his station has purchased land at a more strategic site  to build a new, taller transmitter that will beam the signal farther.  Completion is still several years away, but WCOV already has built a new  control room in the last two years, complete with modern graphics equipment  that he said dramatically improved the look of the on-air product.  </P> <P> "These stations never had a reason to make these kinds of investments,"  observed Jaime Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting. "Now they have a  reason."  </P> <P> And what of Fox? Does the fact that the fledgling fourth network has proven it  can draw a huge mass audience with certain programs raise expectations for  Fox's other shows, such as "The Outsiders" and "The Tracey Ullman Show," which  last week were the two lowest rated programs in prime time?  </P> <P> Chernin said that the hit shows have certainly "raised the ceiling of our  expectations. Six months ago, if you would have said we were capable of such  national numbers, I would have said, 'No way.' But this network is based on our  ability to target specific (demographic groups). And the weakest show we have  is still doing impressive numbers with teens and adults 18-34, and we get  advertiser premiums for them."  </P> <P> In other words, Fox is structured so that it is able to turn a profit with  ratings that would drain the other three networks.  </P></p>

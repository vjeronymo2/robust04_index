			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese leader Li  Ruihuan said here today that long-term interests and the  environment should be emphasized in city construction.    Addressing the gathering for the first publication of the  book "Wan Li's talks on city construction", Li, member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese  Communist Party Central Committee, said faults are likely to  emerge with the fast growth of the economy and the speeding up  of city construction.    The book, made up of 48 talks on city construction by  China's  former Minister of Construction Wan Li, was praised by Li as a  "summary of lessons and experiences of China's 40 years of city  construction."    Li cited the publication of the book as "a great event",  saying that all leaders in charge of city construction should  read it in earnest.    He said that there are some leaders who know little about  city construction and never listen to other's criticisms with an  open mind.    He pointed out that in some cities, many high buildings are  arranged inappropriately, too much outside decoration is used on  high buildings, the colors of some buildings are not in harmony,  and the green areas are scrappy and scattered.    "Some faults in city construction can not be redressed until  long after the fact, if ever," Li warned.    He called on city leaders and managers summing up historical  experience and prudently handling various issues in city  construction.    China had more than 570 cities by 1993, with 32 extra-large  cities each with a population of over one million, 36 big cities  each with a population of 500,000 to one million, 161  middle-sized cities with 200,000 to 500,000 people, and 341  small cities with a population of no more than 200,000.</p>

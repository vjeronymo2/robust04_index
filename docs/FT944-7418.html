			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (3): Rolo fights to keep its roots - Profile of Credito Romagnolo The regional bank with powerful roots in the local community has persisted in Italy long after it has waned or disappeared elsewhere in Europe. But this phenomenon could well be about to change as the banking system begins to concentrate. In this process of concentration all eyes are on the fate of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the highly profitable Bologna-based bank which is rooted in the rich Emilia Romagna region of north-central Italy. The bank dates back to 1896 when it was founded as Piccolo Credito Romagnolo. Over the course of nearly a century, it has become a local institution, symbolising the region's tradition of hard work and thrift. These deep roots are also reflected in the 28,842 small shareholders who possess 22 per cent of the stock. 'Our shares are passed down from generation to generation,' says Mr Emilio Ottlenghi, the chairman. 'Sometimes they are sold at marriage to buy a house; but then they are bought back with subsequent earnings.' But as Mr Ottolenghi talks, in the bank's magnificent board room decorated with frescoes by the three Caracci brothers - the great 16th century Bologna artists - there is a sense of apprehension. Such solid traditions are at risk. At the end of October, Rolo became the object of a hostile bid by the recently privatised Credito Italiano, offering L2,010bn for 48.2 per cent of the shares. In response, Rolo revived and enlarged plans to merge with its long-standing local rival - Caer, the holding for the Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo). If Credito's bid is successful, this would create Italy's largest private banking empire. Alternatively if it fails and the Rolo-Caer merger succeeds,perhaps with the help of a big white knight,it would create the 10th largest banking group. The battle is going to be hard-fought, and one suspects it will be full of surprises given the untried and often ambiguous nature of Italy's 1992 take-over laws. Rolo's main arguments against being absorbed by Credito are quite simple. The bank recognises the Credito deal may benefit a few individual shareholders, but it will be detrimental to the bank's operating efficiency, eliminate its local identity and prevent Rolo's own healthy 'organic' expansion. The bank argues that its profit base would become obscured and would be used to bolster a large, flabby organisation. The bank also claims that the absorption by Credito would lead to the loss of of over 1,000 jobs among the 6,200 Rolo employees. The question of Emilia Romagna losing its 'local' bank to Milan, combined with the question of potential job losses, are clearly the most political aspects of the bid. Rolo, with total assets of L31,154bn, is currently controlled by a core of shareholders put together since 1988 by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, in the wake of a tough four-year struggle against a rival group led by Fiat and the Agnelli family. Mr De Benedetti controls just under 5 per cent, while the biggest single shareholder is France's BNP with 6.3 per cent. In the month-long run-up to the bid launched on October 26, Rolo shares moved from just below L11,500 a share to over L13,700, in part reflecting Credito's accumulation of a 2 per cent stake. Bourse gossip had it that Credito was talking to at least one large Rolo shareholder, offering up to L18,000 a share prior to the announcement of the take-over. The bank's statutes impose a 10 per cent ceiling on individual shareholdings  -precisely in order to preserve the diffused nature of share ownership. Persuading Rolo shareholders to change this norm represents a big hurdle. It will need to be overcome this statutory block in the case of the merger as well. The merger is on the basis of 1.31 nominal L1,000 Rolo shares for one nominal L10,000 share of Caer. Caer, controlled by a foundation with 93 per cent of the capital, would then possess 30 per cent of the new entity's stock. The two local banks will also have to explain more clearly why they should have revived so hurriedly a merger project which had been dropped only a month previously after more than a year of discussions, and which had the blessing of the Bank of Italy. Rolo executives insist the merger had merely been shelved - not dropped - since the structure of the deal was unsatisfactory. Only a limited range of services was included in the original merger, and the subsidiaries of both institutions were excluded. Now, the new merger plan is comprehensive and covers every aspect of both groups. Rolo counters Credito's claim that the merged bank offers limited growth prospects operating in a saturated area. Executives say the activities of Rolo and Carisbo, the main savings bank arm of Caer, are remarkably complementary. Rolo is involved in retail banking and has a fast-growing client portfolio management business: Carisbo, on the other hand, has a strong presence among local authorities and does more term lending. Ironically, it was the failure of the original Rolo-Carisbo marriage that suddenly made Rolo an attractive take-over target. Until that time it looked as though the merger would be an effective barrier against raiders, allowing the two to consolidate in Emilia Romagna and fan out from there, building on Rolo's successful four year-old venture into the economically vibrant Friuli-Veneto region through Banco di Friuli. In the battle ahead, both Credito and Rolo face many unseen obstacles. Not least of these is the legal position of the takeover in relation to the Rolo-Caer merger. Which of the two options for instance takes precedence? Should the takeover be allowed first to run its course? The takeover was announced first, but it was not formally initiated until after the merger was agreed.</p>

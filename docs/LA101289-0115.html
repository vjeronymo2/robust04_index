			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMS SEEM TO GIVE FORD CROWING RIGHTS  </P> <P> Former President Gerald R. Ford, once roundly ridiculed for declaring "there is  no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe," says he is taking particular pleasure  in liberalization moves there, especially in Poland.  </P> <P> "My mother taught me it is wrong to crow," Ford wrote in a column on the op-ed  page of today's editions of The Washington Post. "But former presidents as well  as small boys know no greater joy than being able to say: 'I told you so!"'  </P> <P> Ford recalled his statement during a 1976 presidential campaign debate with  Jimmy Carter, who went on to defeat him, that "there is no Soviet domination of  Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford Administration."  </P> <P> "I blew it," Ford wrote.  </P> <P> But, he added, "Reading the verbatim record with 20/20 hindsight in the light  of recent developments in Poland and throughout Eastern Europe, I come out  pretty well as a prophet."  </P> <P> Thirteen years after he made the statement that angered many Americans of  Eastern European descent, Ford said countries in the Soviet orbit "are writing  themselves new constitutions, based on fundamental human rights and freedoms."  </P> <P> The former President noted that "boasting, like lusting, is best limited to  one's heart."  </P> <P> So, he added, "when my friends say, 'You know, what you said about Poland not  being dominated by the Soviet Union wasn't so stupid after all,' I give them a  Sphinx-like smile and accept their (I guess) compliments."  </P></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Wesfarmers bid faces rejection BUNNINGS, the Western Australian timber group, has recommended that shareholders reject a ADollars 163m (USDollars 122.3m) takeover bid by Wesfarmers, an agriculture, coal and gas group, Reuter reports from Perth. Bunnings said an independent report by Ernst and Young, the accountancy firm, concluded the offer was not fair and reasonable. Ernst and Young valued Bunnings' shares at between ADollars 4.30 and ADollars 4.70 each, compared with the Wesfarmers offer of ADollars 3.55 a share. Bunnings shares closed yesterday at ADollars 4.06, a rise of 5 cents. Mr Dolph Zink, Bunnings' chairman, said the company expected to declare a fully-franked dividend of at least 20 cents a share for the year to June 30 1992. Bunnings cut its annual dividend to 8 cents for 1990-91 from 20 cents a year earlier. Wesfarmers holds 19.9 per cent of Bunnings. BTR of the UK holds 24 per cent of Bunnings acquired through its takeover of Hawker Siddeley.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province in  south China has taken a big stride in improving the management  of its ports in a bid to bring it into line with common  international practices.    The province has since 1978 spent some five billion yuan  (about 574.7 million U.S. dollars) constructing ports, according  to Chen Xueqin, director of the provincial office of the customs  department.    There were 196 land, sea and air ports in Guangdong Province  by the end of 1993, mostly in the special economic zones,  coastal open cities and other economically developed areas.    The ports handled 83.6 million incoming and outgoing  passengers and 111.5 million tons of import and export goods in  1993, 21.3 times and 9.3 times more than in 1978.    The province has simplified customs procedures and cut  unnecessary inspections and checks to make entry and exit easier.    The land port in Shenzhen introduced the practice of  concentrated check of freight vehicles, unified collection of  fees and unified customs declaration in order to reduce the  number of stops for inspection. The practice has been  introduced to all ports in the province starting from March 1.    In handling passengers, the border checking posts introduced  computer visa checks and random checks. Harbor supervision  departments have also changed the method of issuing certificates  to incoming and outgoing ships and prolonged the validity period  of visas. Transit passengers at the Shenzhen airport are free  from going through customs and border check procedures.    The province has also removed the way checking station at  Dachan Island for small ships of less than 500 tons shuttling in  the area of Hong Kong and Macao and they are required to go  through outgoing procedures at the starting ports.</p>

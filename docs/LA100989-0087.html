			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DELPINO OUT TO WIN RESPECT, PLAY MORE  </P> <P> Is Robert Delpino the most overlooked back in the Rams' running attack?  </P> <P> Well, maybe this remark made by Coach John Robinson after Sunday's 26-14  victory over Atlanta will shed a little light on that question:  </P> <P> "If (Greg) Bell hadn't pulled his hamstring (in the first half), we probably  would have run the ball more. But both Cleveland Gary and Gaston Green have a  limited repertoire and it cuts down on what we can do."  </P> <P> Delpino was not among the throng that had crowded into the interview room next  to the Rams' locker room, but no one would have blamed him if he had burst  through the door and screamed, "Hey Coach, what about me?"  </P> <P> Later in his postgame analysis, Robinson did note that "Bobby Delpino did an  outstanding job," but that doesn't change that fact that Delpino can relate to  all of Rodney Dangerfield's shtick and at least one Aretha Franklin song.  </P> <P> After all, all he wants is a little respect . . . and some playing time.  </P> <P> After Bell went out midway through the second quarter, Green, Gary and Delpino  shared the tailback duties. Green carried the ball nine times and gained 36  yards. Gary had seven chances and picked up 25 yards. He also had one reception  for five yards.  </P> <P> Delpino had 48 yards in four carries. He also had one catch, a forgettable  little routine, one-handed stab for a touchdown.  </P> <P> The Rams had a 10-7 lead and the ball on the Falcon seven-yard line when  quarterback Jim Everett rolled right, out of the pocket. He tucked the ball  away as if he was going to run and then pulled back abruptly, lofting a pass  over Delpino's head. Delpino leaped above Atlanta linebacker Aundray Bruce,  snagged the ball with his right hand and managed to pull it in as he hit the  turf.  </P> <P> "Aundray had it covered pretty good," Delpino said, "and I thought Jim was  gonna run, so I started to block. Then I saw him stop, so I just floated back  behind Aundray and watched it in and cupped it.  </P> <P> "It felt good. Really good. But for me, it's just exciting to get in the game.  Playing time. That's everything for me. That's all I want."  </P> <P> In the Rams' media guide, Delpino is described as "one of the most versatile  players on the roster," but so far, he's getting precious few chances to show  it. Sunday's performance pushed his season statistics to the point where he's  almost averaging two carries per game.  </P> <P> Delpino understands the situation. The Rams have two young No. 1 picks -- both  of whom made more than $1 million (including signing bonuses) in their first  year -- waiting on the sidelines to earn their pay.  </P> <P> It's a numbers game in which dollars don't always make sense.  </P> <P> "I don't have to like it, but it's reality," he said. "They're both No. 1s and  I'm a No. 5. I can't say that I don't sometimes think about how much money  they're making, but we're all good friends and that's just the way things are.  </P> <P> "They're both great players and I guess I'll just have to wait my turn. It's  the story of my life. I'll just have to prove myself again and again and  again."  </P> <P> At least Robinson and Co. don't have to worry about Delpino pouting. He's too  busy taking pride in his job. Seconds after making the touchdown grab, for  instance, Delpino sprinted the length of the field as a member of the kickoff  coverage team and corraled Falcon kick return ace Deion Sanders after a  nine-yard return.  </P> <P> Ask Delpino what he did best Sunday and he responds: "I think I finally came to  life on the special teams."  </P> <P> The flashy Sanders is known as "Neon." Delpino could go by "Lantern." You won't  be blinded by the light, but he's certainly dependable.  </P> <P> With Bell rolling up record yardage every other weekend, Delpino knows that  it's hard to get noticed. But he's smart enough to have figured out that  expecting to go 99 yards every time you touch the ball is not the answer.  </P> <P> "I try not to put that kind of pressure on myself, but somewhere deeply  embedded in myself is the desire to make something happen," he said. "You only  get so many chances and you have to make the most of them."  </P> <P> So, in the meantime, Delpino will take his knocks on the special teams and wait  for his opportunities.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting held today, the Leadership,  Coordination, and Control Bureau of the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] reached the conclusion that  Romanian President Ion Iliescu has infringed upon the  independence of the legal system in the statements he has made  during his visits through the country by trying to influence  judges in certain cases awaiting trial and by urging the  ignoring of judge's final decisions, a communique received by  ROMPRES reads. In conclusion, the aforementioned communique  points out that in view of the fact that the head of state has  exceeded his prerogatives through such statements and has  seriously obstructed the perquisites of the judicial power, the  PNTCD Leadership, Coordination, and Control Bureau has decided  to open impeachment proceedings against Romania's president,  through its parliamentary representatives, in accordance with  Article 95 of the Constitution.    Referring to the communique issued by the PNTCD Leadership,  Coordination, and Control Bureau on 10 June, Presidency  Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu made the following  statement, the contents of which we are presenting in full:    I consider the communique of the PNTCD Leadership Bureau as  an inadmissible offensive against the president coming from a  parliamentary political party. This is a regrettable act, even  embarrassing for its authors. The communique's allegations are  most serious and devoid of any factual foundation. I do not  know when or how Romania's president might have infringed upon  the independence of the legal bodies. This is an unfounded  accusation that I categorically refute. It is possible that, in  its combat program against the country's freely elected  president, the PNTCD has run out of all arguments and is now  inventing something to artificially provoke tensions and divert  the attention of the country's political forces and the  parliament from the real problems that have to be solved now.  This is painful and, I repeat, embarrassing for the authors of  this initiative.    So concludes the statement of the presidency's spokesman  regarding the communique of the PNTCD Leadership Bureau released  today, 10 June 1994, by the ROMPRES agency.</p>

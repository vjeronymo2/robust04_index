			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN MARINO COUNCIL STUDIES WAYS TO BOOST SCHOOL BUDGET  </P> <P> The San Marino City Council, concerned about "dire financial straits" in the  affluent city's school system, voted unanimously Wednesday to ask city staff  members to find ways to shift money to schools from city programs.  </P> <P> The budget crunch is caused by shrinking state revenues due to falling  enrollment in the schools, Councilman Michael Johnson said.  </P> <P> School Supt. Gary Richards said the district has cut back on textbook  allowances and janitorial services, and has reduced in-school nursing  "severely." The high school dropped choral music several years ago, Richards  added.  </P> <P> The school board will vote June 26 on a $10.3-million budget for the coming  fiscal year.  </P> <P> While the school budget is administered by the school board, the council may  legally shift city money to school programs, City Atty. Steve Dorsey said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the City Council on Wednesday approved a $7.6-million city operating  budget and allocated $953,600 for capital improvements in the coming fiscal  year.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Observer: Bus-lord's holiday With his Pounds 2bn-plus agreed bid for Quantum Chemical now in the bag, whither Lord Hanson? A clue lies in his other bag and baggage, including 13 suitcases, seen in a dark green Mercedes estate with silver terrier mascot and personal number plate, disembarking at Nice from the night train from Calais. The car then sped off in the tracks of the 'Gatsby set' of novelist Scott Fitzgerald - the very rich, he said, 'are different from you and me' - to the Hotel du Cap d'Antibes. The good lord himself will be following by private jet, of course. With his family and sometimes friends too, he has gone summer after summer to the ludicrously expensive establishment looking over the bay of Cannes. He is also a regular patron of the hotel's Eden Roc beach club, haven of film stars and old family money as well as international tycoons. This time the scheduled stay is unusually if not extraordinarily long. He is booked in for three weeks - his doctors have ordered him to take things easy, though more to convalesce after a disc operation than because they think he needs a rest from the strains of business. That is no doubt just as well. His suite at the hotel is being transformed into an office-in-exile, equipped with all manner of high-tech widgetry to keep him in constant touch with the affairs of his conglomerate. Nevertheless, his aides are offering even odds on two eventualities. One is that he won't be able to stick out for a whole three weeks away from headquarters. The other is that, if he does, he'll need another holiday to recover from it.</p>

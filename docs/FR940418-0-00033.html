			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By referencing the FHWA readjustment criteria in FMVSS 121, NHTSA has ``frozen'' the FHWA criteria in their current form as of October 20, 1992, for purposes of FMVSS 121. Even if FHWA later amends its criteria in response to Rockwell's petition or to accommodate new technology, NHTSA will have to take affirmative action to update its cross-reference. *&blank;*&blank;* The time consuming process of adopting future changes to FMVSS 121 will deter air brake technology or, at least, prevent its rapid introduction into the marketplace. Rockwell believes that NHTSA did not intend this result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agency's Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the petitions, NHTSA has decided to delete reference to the FHWA's regulations at issue. It appears that the FHWA readjustment limits are suitable for conventional drum brakes, but do not account for differences between conventional drum brakes and new types of air brake systems. When the agency adopted the readjustment limits, NHTSA did not intend to impede the development of brake systems that could provide comparable performance to conventional drum brakes, such as piston-type brakes. The FHWA requirements appear to be not fully appropriate for piston-type brakes because of substantially longer stroke length air brake chambers, which are fully developed and are undergoing fleet testing. Additional air brake chamber categories will have to be added to the FHWA Schedule A inspection tables as technology moves forward. Moreover, when NHTSA adopted the readjustment limits, the agency did not intend to prevent or hinder the development of brake designs that may offer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> potentially  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> superior performance over drum brakes in specific applications, such as the air disc brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The air disc brake system is subject to the same readjustment limits in the FHWA requirements as conventional drum brakes, which does not seem appropriate, given differences between the two types of air brake systems. Rockwell's air disc brake system has a stroking distance that is about 1/4 inch longer than that permitted by the current FHWA requirement. However, Rockwell submitted test data to NHTSA that show that, with this stroking distance, the air disc brake system performs well when tested to the specifications and requirements of Standard No. 121. (These data have been placed in docket 91&hyph;21, Notice 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available information indicates that the air disc brake system appears to perform to Standard 121 specifications and may perform better than conventional drum brakes in some situations. There does not appear to be any data to support the need to impose a shorter stroke limit on air disc brake systems such as Rockwell's, that would impede the development of those systems. NHTSA believes the development of alternative, potentially superior brake systems, such as the air disc brake systems, should be facilitated to the extent possible. NHTSA believes there is an alternative requirement that would address the need for readjustment limits, yet avoid the problems the petitioners addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

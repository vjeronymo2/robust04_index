			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US drops to third place in farm aid league WORLD AID for agriculture fell from Dollars 11.7bn in 1980 to just over Dollars 10bn in 1990 despite continued food crises in the developing countries, according to a report from the International Food Policy Research Institute. The decade saw a complete reversal in the position of the leading bilateral donors, figures compiled by the Washington-based institute show. The US lost top spot to Japan as its agricultural aid fell from Dollars 1.4bn in 1980 to Dollars 388m in 1990 and Japan's grew from Dollars 449m to just over Dollars 1bn in the same period (in 1985 US dollars). The World Bank is still the biggest single donor at just over Dollars 3bn in 1990, down from nearly Dollars 4.5bn in 1980. France was the second largest bilateral donor in 1990, with Dollars 527m, and the UK was seventh with Dollars 201m. The overall cuts, however, could threaten economic growth and political stability in volatile regions of the world, the institute warns, because agriculture forms the economic base for most developing countries. 'Such a decline would be justified if their food situation were improving, their rural poverty were diminishing, and they were becoming more capable of meeting their needs for public goods essential for agricultural growth', says Mr Joachim von Braun, director of IFPRI's food consumption and nutrition division. 'But in many developing countries the food situation is deteriorating, rural poverty is increasing and agricultural growth is stagnating.' 'Africa's poor economic performance throughout the 1980s was partly due to a neglect of agriculture,' says the institute's director general, Mr Per Pinstrup-Andersen, who expects to see more of the same in the future if agricultural development continues to be neglected. The report warns of substantial risks of large-scale food crises in the 1990s and notes that poor farmers are moving into rain forests, watersheds and other marginal areas to survive. IFPRI wants to see research into new agricultural technology to prevent environmental destruction. 'Such technologies cannot be developed by individual developing countries alone,' says the report. But if the trend is to be reversed and sustainable technologies developed then some major political barriers have to be overcome. Opposition from farm lobbies in donor countries to agricultural assistance was one of the political reasons for the decline in aid, according to the report. The lobbies saw their agricultural industries faced with increased international competition and lower food prices in world markets. 'Any agricultural assistance to perceived 'competitors' was attacked,' the report says. Changes in the aid organisations themselves and reductions in the numbers of agricultural specialists in donor agencies are also seen as contributing to the decline. IFPRI wants to see a strategic alliance between UN agencies and donor countries to draw attention to agricultural development.

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE AND U.S. CATHOLICS  </P> <P> Were it not so tragic, the irony of it would be hilarious. Now, when even the  Kremlin has learned that closed authoritarian systems are inherently  self-destructive, we have the spectacle of the Vatican telling the American  bishops to silence dissent and impose authority. The Pope is badly served by  Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and his Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Silencing Father Charles Curran and others will not stifle the spirit of an  honest search for truth.  </P> <P> The Dutch, American, and other Catholics, who no longer believe that an  authoritarian church is either good theology or good institutional policy, are  moving toward a critical moment in history. The choice is becoming clear;  either the Vatican makes the same courageous and essential leap as did Mikhail  Gorbachev and his supporters into glasnost and an open and democratic  structure, or those committed to freedom and equal human dignity will move on  into the 21st Century and leave behind a pathetic remnant church stuck in the  pathology of the dictatorship of a bygone era.  </P> <P> A great evil was begun when Augustine used the civil power of the state to  silence those who saw a different truth than he saw. Coerced conformity is an  insult to the spirit of Christ and to God's children today.  </P> <P> Pope John and Vatican II were a breath of fresh and holy air. May they be  revived before it is too late.  </P> <P> DEAN WATT  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P></p>

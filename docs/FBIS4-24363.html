			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Peng Peiyun,  chairperson of the Chinese Organizing Committee of the Fourth  World Conference on Women, said here today that as a host, the  Chinese government attaches great importance to the convocation  of the conference.    "Now it has been listed as an important item on the  government's work agenda," said Peng, also Chinese State  Councillor, at a meeting with Gertrude Mongella,  secretary-general of the Fourth World Women's Conference, here  this afternoon.    During the meeting the two agreed that they share a common  goal of making the conference a success, with hopes for  furthering their cooperation and making full preparations for  the conference.    Peng said that now the Chinese organizing committee has been  soundly formed and every functional committee has drawn up  detailed plans, which are now being gradually implemented,    She said: "Our preparations in the fields of finance,  materials and manpower have also been supported by governments  at all levels and the Chinese people as well."    Many non-governmental organizations also have shown their  aspirations to contribute to the World Women's Conference, she  said, adding: "This will be an important guarantee for us to  make preparations well."    Peng said that under the outstanding leadership of Mongella,  the secretariat of the United Nations has made unremitting  efforts and is playing an important role in promoting the  preparatory work in regions of the world and various countries'  departments at all levels.    "We appreciate this," she added.    She said: "We very much cherish our good cooperation and  ties  established between us. It is our inclination that the two  sides will make concerted efforts for the successful convocation  of the Fourth World Women's Conference."    Mongella said that her tour of China has enabled her to know  more about the progress that China, the host, has made in its  preparatory work.    Now that the Chinese organizing committee has become further  established, she believes that with the care of the Chinese  government, the preparatory work for the conference will be  conducted smoothly.    With the growth of the Chinese economy, the social status of  Chinese women has risen greatly.    "We appreciate the confidence and courage that Chinese women  have shown in China's reform and the important roles that they  are playing. This provides an important condition for the  successful convocation of the conference," she said.    This morning, Mongella and the second study group from the  UN  led by Ebrima K. Jobarteh, deputy secretary-general of the  Fourth World Women's Conference, made a special inspection of  the Beijing International Convention Center and the Beijing Asia  Hotel.    The officials of the Chinese organizing committee briefed  them on the preparatory work made since Mongella's first tour of  China.    Since then, the international convention center has been  defined as a place for holding the conference, to be held in  Beijing in 1995.    The host said that over the past year, the Chinese side has  made positive preparations for the conference according to the  requirements raised since the last study tour.    The halls for meetings and rooms for offices, press and  services as well as various facilities that the conference needs  have been decided on the whole.    Mongella congratulated China for its progress in making  preparations for the conference, adding: "I have full confidence  in the successful convocation of the conference."</p>

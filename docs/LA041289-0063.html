			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATORS NEAR AGREEMENT ON BUDGET  </P> <P> Congressional and White House negotiators neared agreement Tuesday night on a  preliminary budget plan that would narrow the deficit by about $27 billion,  sources said, with President Bush accepting about $4 billion less than he had  proposed for defense spending.  </P> <P> In the tentative accord, expected to be announced as early as today, Democrats  have agreed to pursue more than $10 billion in domestic spending cuts.  </P> <P> An agreement would set the broad outlines of spending priorities for the 1990  fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and improves the chances that Congress will  avoid an impasse with the White House over the budget. But such a plan must  still clear a number of hurdles and does not address many specifics of programs  that are subject to future legislative wrangling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grab Bag of Tax Changes  </P> <P> Previously, budget negotiators had agreed to raise about $14 billion from a  variety of revenue measures, including a grab bag of tax changes worth about  $5.6 billion to go along with additional user fees and sales of government  assets.  </P> <P> Administration officials, led by Richard G. Darman, director of the White House  Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,  demanded that any tax changes approved by Congress be limited to relatively  minor loophole closings so that Bush's "no new taxes" campaign pledge would not  be violated.  </P> <P> At the same time, congressional aides said, Administration officials dropped  their insistence that lawmakers accept the White House contention that its  capital gains tax cut proposal would raise $5 billion next year. But the  Administration told lawmakers that Bush would continue to pursue his plan to  limit capital gains to a maximum of 15%, less than half the current top rate.  </P> <P> The military, according to both Administration and Capitol Hill sources, would  receive authority to spend about $305 billion, a $4 billion cut from the $309  billion Bush said was necessary just to keep up with inflation. Bush met with  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney Tuesday to discuss the new limits on Pentagon  spending.  </P> <P> Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), the top-ranking Republican on the House Budget  Committee, said that negotiators are hoping to reach agreement soon on the  overall plan. He suggested that only minor stumbling blocks remain.  </P> <P> Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) said that negotiators are  working on a number of "loose ends" and are consulting with other congressional  leaders about the outlines of the plan.  </P> <P> On the domestic side of the budget, negotiators had agreed earlier to extract  about $2.7 billion in savings by holding down spending on the Medicare program  for the elderly.  </P> <P> Bush originally had sought almost $5 billion in Medicare cuts. Democrats wanted  to limit the budget savings to about $2 billion, which would have meant almost  no changes in the way the government currently pays hospitals and doctors.  Lawmakers also refused to accept a Bush proposal to require state and local  government employees to pay Medicare taxes, congressional aides said.  </P> <P> The plan, while couched in general terms, also calls for making cuts in farm  support payments and other government benefits programs.  </P> <P> But even after reaching the tentative agreement, the spending blueprint  ultimately could fail to meet the $110-billion deficit ceiling that the  Gramm-Rudman budget law requires if interest rates do not fall from current  levels.  </P> <P> That means lawmakers may be forced to seek additional savings during the summer  and early fall to escape the automatic spending cuts that Gramm-Rudman would  impose if Congress does not adopt a budget by Oct. 1 that meets the  $110-billion target.  </P> <P> Under the tentative budget plan, the Pentagon would fail to keep pace with  inflation for the fifth year in a row, losing almost 2% of the substantial real  spending increases it achieved from 1980 through 1986.  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Amato sets Italian central bank free THE FINAL piece of legislation designed to make the Bank of Italy an independent central bank has been approved by Mr Giuliano Amato's government. The move will end the Treasury's ability to use the bank to fund the budget deficit and is in line with the European Community's objectives for monetary union. The legislation also allows the central bank to decide the obligatory reserve requirements of the banking system. The Treasury's account with the Bank of Italy had been intended to finance day-to-day public spending needs. But, as Italy's public sector deficit grew to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product, the facility was increasingly abused as a form of permanent short-term finance. At the end of last year, the Treasury still owed L80,780bn (Pounds 36bn) to the bank. This debt will now be converted into state paper and handed over to the Bank of Italy. The Treasury will pay 1 per cent interest, the same as it was paying on the overdraft.</p>

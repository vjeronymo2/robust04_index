			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Charities suffer drop in income, says survey MOST OF Britain's large charities have experienced a drop in income during the past six months, according to Mr Michael Brophy, director of the Charities Aid Foundation. The foundation, which provides the main basis of statistical information about charities in Britain, yesterday published the full results of its 1989-90 charity household survey. It concludes that it is 'highly unlikely' that there has been any real increase in individual charitable giving over the period 1987-90. According to the survey, 26 per cent of respondents had given nothing to charity in the month before interview. Most of those who had made any donation gave relatively little, with nearly half contributing Pounds 1 or less. Only 17 per cent gave Pounds 10 or more. The evidence of declining public support for charity comes when financial pressures on local authorities mean that many are also experiencing cuts in public finance. In London, a financial crisis facing the voluntary sector has been made worse by a decision of Ealing council to withdraw its support from a proposed Pounds 29m budget to fund the capital's voluntary organisations. The council's finance committee had endorsed the budget - breaking political deadlock on the London Boroughs Grants Committee which distributes the funding - but this was reversed by the full council. Many of the capital's voluntary organisations face closure. Arts crisis brews, Page 21</p>

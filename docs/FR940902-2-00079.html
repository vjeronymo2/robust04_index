The IA will be supplemented, as necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision makers and the specific federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has been working with the BIA and IHS to revise the existing Interdepartmental Agreement which was published in 1976 and has not been updated to meet the regulatory requirement revisions that affect federal tribal interaction in the Indian Housing Program. The BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) was eliminated from this IA to streamline the agreement among all signatory agencies in the development of HUD Indian housing programs. It is anticipated that the IHS and the BIA will be addressing the BIA-HIP separately. Other sections pertaining to program procedures are more appropriately covered in the program handbook or program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) and have been deleted from the IA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposed Interdepartmental Agreement follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> PROPOSED INTERDEPARTMENTAL AGREEMENT ON THE INDIAN HOUSING PROGRAM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT_OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR_BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES_INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.0&blank;STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) is to set forth the working relationship among the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) in the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) in conjunction with the planning and construction of new Indian housing developments. The above agencies share a common goal to assist Tribes in improving their living environment through the delivery of quality housing and infrastructure. This goal can be more readily achieved with an efficient and integrated utilization of available resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Interdepartmental Agreement establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and the guidelines by which each of the three agencies will interact with Tribal governments and IHAs. The IA will be supplemented, as necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision-makers and the specific federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.0&blank;GENERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD RESPONSIBILITIES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will provide financial assistance for the development and management of low income housing and community developments in Indian and Alaska Native areas through the Traditional Indian Housing Development Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.2&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BIA RESPONSIBILITIES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BIA will review and approve all required trust land lease issues, easements and real estate appraisals; provide maintenance services to those IHA constructed roads and streets accepted into the BIA road systems in accordance with 25 CFR Part 170; and provide other support, when available, necessary for the timely development of housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.3&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> IHS RESPONSIBILITIES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IHS provides a comprehensive primary and preventive health services delivery system for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The environmental health component of IHS assists Tribes by providing technical and financial assistance in the development of tribal sanitation facilities [water, waste water, and solid waste facilities and operation &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) infrastructure]. As originally authorized under the Indian Sanitation Facilities Act of 1959 (Public Law 86&hyph;121), and as amended by the Health Care Improvement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;713), IHS has the primary responsibility and authority to provide Native American homes and communities with the necessary sanitation facilities and related services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.0&blank;AGENCY COORDINATION.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.1&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> PROCESSING PROCEDURES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The signatories of the IA agree to maintain timely and relevant processing of regulations, handbooks, notices and other administrative guidance for use by Tribes and IHAs.

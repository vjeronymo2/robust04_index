			<p>BFN     [Text] During yesterday morning's session, the plenum of  the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), by a vote of 50 to  one, approved the Citizens' Participation and Control bill  recommended by the CCD Constitution Commission.    The draft bill, divided into 47 articles, was proposed by  legislator Carlos Torres y Torres Lara (NM-C90) [New Majority --  Change 90), who said this bill makes important contributions to  Peruvian law as compared with the laws of other countries in  Latin America and the world. He pointed out that this is the  first authentically democratic step in the country's political  decisionmaking, as it combines direct and indirect democracy.    Torres y Torres Lara said this bill gives the people the  opportunity to participate in the reform of the Constitution and  the laws, as well as to revoke the appointment of authorities  and to be informed as to how the budget is implemented, among  other things. The legislator stated: "No more laws that do not  allow the participation of the people. This bill, moreover,  will allow the public to be integrated into the process and  their opinions taken into account."    Legislator Roger Caceres Velasquez said this initiative  fills  a gap that has existed in Peruvian laws since the Republic was  founded. Henry Pease Garcia (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement])  said the bill allows for a referendum without restricting it, as  the new Constitution does. Carlos Ferrero Costa (NM-C90) said  the public's right to begin an initiative should be broader than  legislators' rights. He said he was against the executive  branch not being able to subject the draft bill to a referendum.    Among the public's rights to initiative included in the  Citizens' Participation and Control bill are their participation  in the constitutional reform, in the drafting of laws, in  referendums, and in the drafting of municipal and regional  regulations, among others.    Among the public's rights to control are over decisions to  revoke the appointment of an authority or to remove an  authority, and in demanding information on the implementation of  the budget and other control mechanisms in the municipal and  regional administrations.    As for a referendum, the bill states that one can be  requested by no less than 10 percent of the electors, while the  support of 25 percent of the electors, with a maximum [as  published] of 400,000 signatures, is necessary to revoke the  appointment of an authority.    To request information on the implementation of the budget,  at least 20 percent of the electors, with a maximum [as  published] of 50,000 signatures, is necessary. An authority  will be removed if the National Elections Board determines that  more than 50 percent of the citizens of an electoral district  request it.    The CCD plenum yesterday also paid homage to the late  attorney, ambassador, and journalist Andres Avelino Aramburu  Menchaca, who was represented by his widow Lala Irigoyen de  Aramburu and relatives, who arrived in Congress at 1308.</p>

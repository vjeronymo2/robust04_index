			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory doctors - Ballot Box Perhaps surprisingly, given everything that you read, the Tories are still the favourite political party of the family doctors. According to a poll in today's Pulse, the weekly magazine for GPs, 29.8 per cent of them say that they will vote Conservative on Thursday. That compares with 24.8 per cent for the Liberal Democrats and only 17.8 per cent for the Labour party. On the other hand, more than 45 per cent of the doctors said they had voted Tory in 1987. Still, 52 per cent of them favour Tory tax policies.</p>

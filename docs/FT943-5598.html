			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (13): Satellites the top priority - A look at spaceflight On Sunday, July 20, 1969, US astronaut Neil Armstrong, commander of the spacecraft Apollo 11, became the first man to set foot on the moon. As he took his momentous first step he said: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' But 25 years later, the dizzy excitement of space exploration fuelled by the race in space between the US and Russia has been replaced by the more mundane worries of an industry fighting like many others for continued public and government support to help fund its future development and challenges. Space has become a commercial enterprise, albeit a high-risk one, and many of its remarkable technological achievements are now taken for granted by a population more concerned about jobs and welfare than by new scientific discoveries and the prospect of human beings living and working in space one day. 'I find it rather sad to see around here a relatively small crowd of people. When I've been here in the past it was jam-packed,' said a senior executive of the Anglo-French Matra Marconi Space group. He was speaking moments before the launch in July at Cape Kennedy in Florida of the US shuttle Columbia carrying an international space laboratory inside its cargo bay. The launch was spectacular and successful. The shuttle was blasted into orbit in a great cloud of smoke for a 14-day mission when its seven crew, including Japan's first woman astronaut, conducted life science and other scientific microgravity experiments inside the Dollars 1bn laboratory. But it made little impact in the news. In the US, the big stories were the trial of a famous American football star, floods in Georgia, unemployment figures and the death of the North Korean leader. If the American newspapers relegated the mission to the inside pages of their newspapers, it was lucky to find even the briefest of mentions in the European press. Only the Japanese covered the story in full, reflecting the presence on board the shuttle of the first Japanese woman in space and the determination of Japan to build up a strong presence in the space sector. In Japan, the government space budget is continuing to rise while it is declining elsewhere. The latest victim of budgetary reappraisals in Europe is the Hermes project to build a European manned space vehicle. In the US, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is having to fight for funds every year and many of its space projects, especially the Dollars 30bn space station due to be completed by 2002 and involving broad international collaboration, are living on a budgetary knife-edge. With the emphasis now being placed increasingly on the commercial opportunities offered by space, governments, space agencies and manufacturers of space equipment have been concentrating on the satellite business, in particular for earth observation, meteorology and communications. Governments have also continued to show growing interest in satellites for military applications. The role played by satellites in the Gulf war has further boosted this interest. In turn, competition in the satellite and satellite launch business has intensified. The commercial battle has essentially pitted the US against Europe. In the commercial satellite launch business, Europe has managed to build a leading position during the past 14 years with Arianespace and its Ariane rockets. The French-led Ariane programme has done for the European space industry what the Airbus consortium has achieved in the civil aircraft field: the establishment of a credible competitor to the US dominance of commercial aerospace markets that lasted until the early 1980s. But although Ariane has now taken a share of more than 50 per cent of the commercial satellite launch market, it is facing tough competition not only from US launchers but also from Russia, China and Japan, all seeking to penetrate the western market. With a finite market of around 20 commercial satellite launches a year, the battle for market share has provoked increasing international trade tensions mirroring those in the commercial aircraft market between the US and Europe. The US have accused the Europeans of subsidising its rocket launcher industry, while the Europeans have accused the Americans of cross-subsidising commercial launch operations with their large military satellite market, which to all intents remains closed to international competitors. And both the US and Europe have campaigned against price dumping for satellite launches by the Russians and the Chinese and sought to negotiate trade agreements with these countries. Competition has been equally fierce in the satellite manufacturing side of the business. It has forced leading manufacturers to seek wider partnerships and has led to increasing consolidation in the industry. In Europe, two big transnational groups are being established to create the economies of scale necessary to compete in a tight market. The French Matra group has already merged its satellite activities with those of the UK General Electric Company into a joint venture called Matra-Marconi Space, which is 51 per cent held by the French concern. Matra-Marconi Space is now acquiring the space systems division of British Aerospace in a deal which would create a European space group with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn. At the same time, Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace arm of the Daimler-Benz car group, is negotiating to merge its space operations with those of Aerospatiale, the French state-controlled aerospace company. But if the prospects for the satellite business remain secure, even though it is likely to face increasingly competitive pressures, the future of manned space flights continues to be clouded with uncertainty. NASA officials concede that the fate of the US space shuttle will hinge on whether the US-led programme to build an international space station will survive or suffer from government budgetary cuts. The Dollars 30bn project is designed to create a permanent orbiting science institute in space capable of performing long-term research in materials and life sciences in a gravity-free environment. NASA says that this fundamental research will accelerate breakthroughs in technology and engineering that will have practical applications on earth. 'What governments must decide is whether you should continue supporting long-term fundamental scientific research and space exploration or simply go for short-term commercial pay backs,' said one senior US space industry official. The issue is now taking on, once again, an international political dimension. But in contrast to the race between the US and Russia 25 years ago when the two superpowers were competing to outmanoeuvre each other to take the leadership in space, they are now working increasingly together. NASA recently signed a Dollars 400m contract with the Russian space agency to support a joint programme involving the US space shuttle and the Russian Mir space station. The contract also covers co-operation in the planned international space station. This collaboration, which both sides see as consolidating the new post Cold War era, could prove to be the main driving force to keep alive the long-term ambitions of the international space industry.</p>

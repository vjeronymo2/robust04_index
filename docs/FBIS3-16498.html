The main difference between the present  Constitution and the one adopted in 1978 lies in the fact that  it envisions a change in the state structure -- Belarus becomes  a presidential republic. According to the new constitution, the  Republic of Belarus is declared to be: a unitary, democratic,  social, law-governed state. Man is considered the supreme value  of society and the state. Belarus sets the aim of making its  territory non-nuclear and the state neutral.    The president of the republic is the head of executive  power.  The parliament is reduced from 360 to 260 members. It remains  semiprofessional, i.e. some of the deputies work on a  professional basis in permanent commissions and the others  combine their duties as MPs with other work.    The Constitution enters into effect from the moment of being  published. One month after that the republic's Constitutional  Court is to be set up. [passage omitted]</p>

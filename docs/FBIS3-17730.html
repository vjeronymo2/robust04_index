In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX on Saturday  Tatarstan's Vice Premier Vasily Likhachev declared that Kazan  positively appreciates the start of the negotiations between  Moscow and Groznyy. In his words, "We are happy with another  aspects of the negotiations as well; the question concerns the  fact that one of the factors which positively affect this  process is the treaty between the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Tatarstan, as both Moscow and Groznyy recognized."    "Given this factor and Tatarstan's growing political  authority, I'd like to declare about our readiness, as well as  about my private readiness, to take an active part in the  development of bilateral agreements under the mutual approval of  the delegations of the Russian Federation and Chechenya.  Without substituting the efforts of the direct participants of  the negotiations, we could render assistance in creation of an  atmosphere of confidence, strengthening of the dialogue, and  creation of a mechanism for permanent consultations of these  parties," declared Likhachev.    In his words, Tatarstan's peacemaking efforts are grounded  on  a sound sense and the need to strengthen historic, cultural, and  economic ties of the peoples and the strive to create democratic  Russia.    "Tatarstan is ready for a mediation mission to solve other  disputable issues on the territory of Russia and the CIS as  well, -- declared Likhachev. -- We are ready to discuss the  issue on opening of an Euro-Asian Center for International  Cooperation in Kazan with all interested states and  international organizations."    In his opinion, the nature of relations between Russia and  Chechenya slightly differs from the relations between Tatarstan  and Russia primarily "by a tougher position on the part of  Groznyy and maximization of its demands." "The political and  economic situation in Chechenya also differs from ours. But  there are several factors which coincide," he noted.    Likhachev believes that the negotiations between Moscow and  Groznyy must discuss a special status for Chechenya.</p>

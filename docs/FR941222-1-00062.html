			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plausible management scenario selected for wastewaters usually is treatment in surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The risks associated with disposing these wastewaters in surface impoundments would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very high. Two hazardous constituents (aniline and benzidine) are present in the waste at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations that would pose substantial risks to human health and the environment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens) for treatment in a surface impoundment. Large quantities of aniline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in excess, are used as a raw material in this process. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, very high concentrations of aniline are present in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process waters. Even after recovery operations, EPA found high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of aniline (in this case, an average of 200 ppm)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining in the wastewater effluent discharged to the POTW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benzidine was found to be present in several wastestreams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a feedstock, and is believed to be either a raw material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminant or a reaction by-product. The risks posed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzidine at the concentrations present in these wastewaters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3E&hyph;4, using a surface impoundment management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coeluting constituents, 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> azobenzene, which are likely by-products arising from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxidation of aniline are present in the waste at a concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting in a calculated risk level of 1E&hyph;5, based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine (see Section II.D, Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Health and Risk Assessments, for a discussion on the Agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to risk assessment for coeluting compounds). The mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spectrum representing these two coeluting compounds was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in all three wastewater samples collected from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane pigment operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, based on the insignificant risks associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current and plausible management practice for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream (treatment in tanks), EPA is proposing not to list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters from the production of TAM pigments as hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this wastestream would be hazardous if used for spray  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrigation or handled in surface impoundments, the Agency does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe that such management is plausible. The facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generating the wastewater already are 100% invested in treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste in tanks prior to sending it to a POTW. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is not a strongly expanding segment of the industry, so the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency does not anticipate more facilities starting up similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. Further, there is a general bias under most State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial waste programs against allowing surface impoundments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be built. Thus, based on the risk associated with treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in tanks, the Agency is proposing not to list this wastestream as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Still bottoms or heavy ends from the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane dyes or pigments (K166).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing to list still bottoms or heavy ends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posing a substantial present or potential risk to human health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, EPA calculated high-end individual risk levels (greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1E&hyph;4) for carcinogens under both the baseline and plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management scenarios. Two carcinogens pose high-end risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding 9E&hyph;3 for the plausible management scenario of disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an on-site monofill. These two constituents pose very high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of risk (greater than 1E&hyph;3) for the baseline management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice of disposal in a municipal landfill. In addition, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these constituents has an HQ of 6 for the air pathway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with management in an on-site boiler, a practice which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is both a baseline management practice and a plausible management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This wastestream includes distillation bottoms from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of triarylmethane dye and pigments, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated from solvent and raw material recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  recovery of aniline, dimethylaniline, or other solvents). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

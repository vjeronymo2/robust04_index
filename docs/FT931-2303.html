			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Life Assurance The Office of Fair Trading's proposals for greater disclosure in the life assurance market is good news for consumers. The same cannot be said for life companies. Those selling through independent financial advisers and with high expenses may find the odds stacked against them. That points to a further squeeze on small mutual life offices, which enjoy neither broad distribution nor economies of scale. Banks and companies which sell life products through them may be the beneficiaries. Low expenses and a customer base which overlaps with IFAs should leave them well placed to poach new business. But the case is by no means clear-cut. Low costs have allowed bancassurance companies to build fat margins. If the OFT manages to introduce price competition, they may equally feel the squeeze. The likes of the Prudential and Legal &amp; General, which sell through large direct sales forces, should feel secure. The OFT has abandoned any hope of unravelling commissions paid to salesmen or tied agents. There is always the worry, though, that consumers presented with more information on the cost of life assurance may turn to other savings products instead. With the life assurance sector at an all-time high relative to the market, that risk has hardly been discounted.</p>

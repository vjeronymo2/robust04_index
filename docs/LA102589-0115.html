			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FROM PUNCHES TO PRANKS, RIVALRIES A PART OF GAME;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS: THE SHENANIGANS THAT PRECEDE THE ACTUAL COMPETITION HAVE BECOME  AS MEMORABLE AS THE FINAL SCORES.  </P> <P> As a result of the tank rivalry and the tree incident, Sonora has become  involved in a feud with the cross town farm boys. -- SONORA SABRE, student  newspaper  </P> <P> The tank was a paint-splattered water tower in a vacant field, the tree was a  campus landmark and the farm boys were kids from the next town over.  </P> <P> It was mid-October of 1968 and Sonora and Brea-Olinda high schools were  preparing to play a football game.  </P> <P> The rivalry between the neighboring schools began when Sonora opened in 1966.  It grew slowly, centering solely on a football game -- an important game  between league rivals -- but picked up intensity and intrigue when the students  got involved.  </P> <P> Sonora students claimed the water tower as their own, decorating it with  graffiti the week before the big game.  </P> <P>  "SHS No. 1," "Tower Power," "Victory," "Class of '69."  </P> <P>  Days later, Brea students redecorated the tower with Wildcat slogans.  </P> <P>  "No. 1," "Brea Rules."  </P> <P>  In retaliation, Sonora students sawed down the senior tree, a campus landmark  in the Brea quad.  </P> <P> You know, of course, that meant war. And it has not let up in the 20 years that  have passed.  </P> <P> Through spray-painted water tanks, rocks, trees, mock funerals (Brea students  marched a Sonora coffin around school to inspire the football players and,  indeed, the campus to kill the Raiders), the schools have traded barbs, paint  strokes and, this season, punches.  </P> <P> The shenanigans that precede the games have become as important and linger as  long in the participants' memories as the final scores themselves.  </P> <P> Sonora-Brea is one of Orange County's longest-running rivalries, but by no  means the only one.  </P> <P> Name a school and it has a rival, a hated rival that its students would do  anything to beat.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley has Edison, Servite has Mater Dei, Santa Ana Valley has Santa  Ana, Tustin has Foothill, Esperanza has El Dorado, Corona del Mar has Newport  Harbor, Mission Viejo has Capistrano Valley, Capistrano Valley has El Toro, El  Toro has Mission Viejo . . . you get the idea.  </P> <P> Geography plays a part in establishing rivalries. What could be more heated  than a feud between cross-town high schools?  </P> <P> Some schools have seen cross-town rivals change as the county has grown.  </P> <P> "Our big rival now is Villa Park, but back in the 1940s, '50s and '60s we've  had Santa Ana, then Huntington Beach and then Foothill," said Dave Zirkle,  Orange athletic director.  </P> <P> Success plays a part, too.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley and Edison are rivals mainly because their games often decided  Sunset League championships.  </P> <P> Rivalries between coaches can't be overlooked, either. El Modena and Foothill  were rivals for many seasons because of the contrasting personalities of  personable Bob Lester at El Modena and gruff Ted Mullen at Foothill.  </P> <P> The rivalry has lessened in recent years, though. Lester retired in 1985 and  Mullen left Foothill in 1987, first for Anaheim then, recently, for Palm  Desert.  </P> <P> But most rivalries have endured through coaching and personnel changes, through  good teams and bad. Some carry more significance than others, but Orange  County's football rivalries are a big part of Thursday, Friday and Saturday  nights in the fall.  </P> <P> Vince Lombardo, assistant athletic director at Servite, speaks for most: "I  have heard it said on both sides that Mater Dei can't call it a good season  until it beats Servite, and the same for us. As long as we beat Mater Dei,  we're OK."  </P> <P> To that end, the students have their own wars to wage.  </P> <P> Halftime of the annual Esperanza-El Dorado game in 1978 was one fans of both  schools will long remember.  </P> <P> The Aztecs' mascot that season was a dog named Esperanza, trained to retrieve  tennis balls thrown by a custodian.  </P> <P> When Esperanza trotted out to do his act at halftime of the '78 game, El Dorado  fans heaved hundreds of tennis balls on the field. "There must have been 600 of  them; the dog went crazy," an observer, recalling the incident, told The Times  in 1983.  </P> <P> Usually, such pranks carry considerably less wit.  </P> <P> The Villa Park-Orange rivalry has produced a number of incidents.  </P> <P> During a pep rally, a former Orange coach made an off-handed comment about  Villa Park being the weenies on the hill.  </P> <P> "It stuck and our kids started throwing hot dogs at their people," Zirkle said.  </P> <P> Villa Park would strike back by throwing oranges.  </P> <P> One year, Orange students stuck oranges on the classroom door knobs at Villa  Park. Villa Park retaliated by plugging up all the key holes at Orange.  </P> <P> Another year, Orange students plunged a Volkswagen Karman Ghia into the Villa  Park pool.  </P> <P> And there was the time in the early '70s, when a dead dolphin was hoisted up  the school flagpole at Dana Hills. San Clemente students allegedly had found  the dolphin during a harbor cleanup and wanted to zing their rivals, nicknamed  the Dolphins.  </P> <P> But for sheer animosity, it's tough to top the Tustin-Foothill rivalry.  </P> <P> Pranks have ranked from a tame bombing of the rival's pool with dye to bales of  hay all over the Foothill campus.  </P> <P> "They always referred to us as farmers, so our cheerleaders spread hay all over  their quad," said Vince Brown, Tustin baseball coach and assistant football  coach.  </P> <P> The cheerleaders from the schools exchanged cookies the week before the game as  a gesture of good will, but one year things got a little twisted.  </P> <P> The Tustin cheerleaders put laxatives in their batch and handed them over to  Foothill.  </P> <P> "A tremendous amount of animosity built up and there was a lot of tension the  rest of the year any time the schools played," Brown said.  </P> <P> Emotions intensified during the 1981 Fullerton-Sunny Hills game. Before the  season finale against Fullerton, Sunny Hills forfeited four games after the  district office received an anonymous tip that the Lancers had used an  ineligible lineman.  </P> <P> Naturally, everyone at Sunny Hills thought someone at Fullerton made the call.  An estimated 25 police officers were on duty for the game, but there were no  incidents.  </P> <P> "There was an electricity on this campus that I've never seen before," said Tim  Devaney, Sunny Hills coach. "It was a strong rivalry that was suddenly  intensified.  </P> <P> "We played in a CIF (Central Conference) championship game against La Habra at  Anaheim Stadium in 1983, but I've never seen emotions higher on campus than  that week. The students wore war paint all week in preparation for playing the  Fullerton Indians."  </P> <P> For the most part, rivalries benefit the schools. Coaches say there is more  excitement around campus during the week of a big game.  </P> <P> Certainly, Edison and Fountain Valley, two Sunset League rivals, have reaped  huge rewards, not to mention profits, from their rivalry. It reached its height  in the late 1970s and early '80s, when the game outgrew high school stadiums  and was played at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> "Especially at that time, the best time to rob a house in Fountain Valley or  Huntington Beach was when Fountain Valley and Edison were playing because  nobody was home," said Bill Workman, former Edison coach now at Orange Coast  College. "The whole community was evacuated."  </P> <P> From 1975-1981, the game drew between 14,000 and 32,000 each year. Only once  did the teams draw fewer than 10,000 in Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Memories of Edison-Fountain Valley games tend to stick with the participants.  Dave White, Edison coach, was a quarterback on the Chargers' 1972 and '73  teams.  </P> <P> "I played (quarterback at Oregon State) against USC at the Coliseum," White  said. "I played in front of 90,000 in Tennessee and LSU. The games I remember  most were the two against Fountain Valley. I still haven't gotten over losing  in 1972."  </P> <P> This year, Mike Milner, Fountain Valley coach, received a letter from former  tight end Greg Bolin, who is in Zaire working as a Peace Corps officer. It was  dated Aug. 12 and somehow arrived before last week's game. Bolin had taken the  time to encourage his alma mater to beat Edison.  </P> <P> Edison won Friday's game with a touchdown in the final minutes, 28-25, in front  of a capacity crowd of 7,500 at Orange Coast.  </P> <P> Sometimes, games go beyond mere rivalries.  </P> <P> Sonora-Brea reached a head in the waning moments of the Wildcats' victory  earlier this season. A fight broke out after a number of personal-foul  penalties were called against both teams. After officials broke up the fight,  they ended the game early. Four Sonora players were suspended for a game by  school administrators for their part in the melee.  </P> <P> The schools have decided not to play next season.  </P> <P> "We need a couple of years of cooling off," said Jon Looney, Brea coach. "This  game has gone beyond just a rivalry. We need to let it cool down a little bit.  It's gotten out of hand."  </P> <P> Rivalries present a fine line between spirited pride and outright lawlessness  that administrators and coaches must traverse.  </P> <P> "You have to have coaches who can put things in perspective," said Tom Vitello,  Servite athletic director. "I look at (last week's) USC-Notre Dame game. Things  got out of control (during a pregame fight) and I blame the coaches."  </P> <P> Said James Golden, Mater Dei vice principal: "I know that kids will do things  that you have no control over. You have to try and discourage all that."  </P> <P> In the mid-1970s, things had become so bad between Servite and Mater Dei that  the Servite administration decided anyone caught defacing Mater Dei property  would be expelled.  </P> <P> And somewhere between the dye in the pool and the hay on the quad,  administrators at Foothill and Tustin decided something needed to be done to  curb vandalism and bad feelings.  </P> <P> "The principals decided that they better start doing something to bring the  kids together," said Brown, the Tustin assistant. "They have a lunch every year  before the game at the district office and try to get them to understand that  it's just a friendly game."  </P> <P> The schools have added campus security during the week of the big game to  prevent vandalism.  </P> <P> Breakfast has become a 20-year tradition as part of the Fountain Valley-Edison  rivalry.  </P> <P> Members of the school's student government, cheerleaders and selected players  are invited the morning of the game.  </P> <P> "The whole idea is to promote good sportsmanship between the schools," said  Fountain Valley Principal Michael Kasler, a former administrator at Edison.  "The kids get to know each other and become friends. We think it's very healthy  in promoting a good, clean rivalry."  </P> <P> Zirkle said this was the first year there were no incidents in Orange's rivalry  with Villa Park. He attributes that to a pregame breakfast both teams attended.  </P> <P> "Maybe it had an effect, I don't know," Zirkle said. "But this is the first  year we didn't have any vandalism."  </P> <P> Oranges were eaten, not thrown. No word on the hot dogs, though.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Donna Carter, Chris Foster, Tom Hamilton, Steve Lowery and  Barbie Ludovise contributed to this story.  </P> <P> A Collection of Classics  </P> <P> Perhaps no other county rivalry has produced as many significant meetings and  thrilling finishes as the Sunset League showdowns between Edison and Fountain  Valley. A few of the highlights from the series, which Edison leads, 15-6-1:  </P> <P> 1969 -- A freshman- and sophomore-dominated Edison team stunned Fountain  Valley, 21-20, costing the Barons the Irvine League championship.  </P> <P> 1970 -- Edison rolled to a 28-6 victory on the way to a 13-0 record and a  Southern Section 3-A championship.  </P> <P> 1973 -- Fountain Valley posted a 28-24 victory for its first win in the series.  </P> <P> 1974 -- Fountain Valley's Steve Thompson missed a 31-yard field goal attempt on  the game's final play, allowing Edison to escape with a 0-0 tie.  </P> <P> 1977 -- Willie Gittens' one-yard touchdown run with 3:19 to play allowed  Fountain Valley to avoid an upset with a 6-3 victory.  </P> <P> 1978 -- Edison drove 81 yards in the final minutes to set up a 32-yard field  goal by Rick Stephens in a 10-7 Charger victory. Edison went on to win the  Sunset League championship, but Fountain Valley went one better; the loss was  its only one in a Big 5 championship season.  </P> <P> 1979 -- Kerwin Bell rushed for 235 yards and four touchdowns in a 35-7 victory  for Edison, which was on its way to a Big 5 championship.  </P> <P> 1980 -- Edison rallied for a 14-13 victory on Ken Major's touchdown and  two-point conversion runs with 19 seconds to play before a crowd of 18,000.  Five weeks later, the teams played for the Big 5 championship before a crowd of  29,000, with Edison winning, 14-0, to cap a 14-0 season.  </P> <P> 1983 -- Fountain Valley ended a six-game losing streak in the series with a  33-7 victory.  </P> <P> 1985 -- Edison, the eventual Big 5 champion, rolled to a 24-0 halftime lead,  then held on for a 24-12 victory.  </P> <P> 1987 -- Fountain Valley's Eric Sasenberg stopped Greg Angelovic on a two-point  conversion run with no time remaining as the Barons held on for a 14-13  victory.  </P> <P> 1988 -- Fountain Valley, the eventual CIF Division I champion, stopped a late  Edison rally at the Barons' 10-yard line with 1:22 to play to preserve a 28-21  victory.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Moscow warns on wages crisis: Late payments raise unrest fear Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, has warned that the country's escalating late payments crisis could spark social unrest with severe political repercussions. According to Russian press reports, Mr Soskovets told a meeting of economic ministers, bankers and industrialists on Wednesday that the failure of many energy companies to pay their workers for months could prompt mass action by coal miners and oil and gas workers. An Economics Ministry report estimated that late payments of wages in industry and agriculture had risen from Rbs800bn (Pounds 240m) at the beginning of the year to Rbs4,000bn (Pounds 1.2bn) by August 1, with the energy sector being badly hit. The Russian government is grappling with ways of resolving the internal debts crisis but appears torn between whether to stick to a strict monetary path or try indirectly to inflate its way out of its difficulties by issuing fresh credits. Many Russian companies claim that the accumulation of inter-enterprise debt  -now estimated at Dollars 45bn (Pounds 29bn) - has created a cash flow crisis making it impossible for them to pay their workers. They are demanding cash injections from the government to ease the liquidity problem. The government commission for dealing with late payments, chaired by Mr Soskovets, has proposed an alternative package of measures including: Forcing companies to settle their rouble debts out of their hard currency accounts. Many companies have hidden away funds in foreign bank accounts to avoid paying taxes and to hedge against inflation. Insisting that enterprises could not pay dividends until their outstanding debts have been settled - a proposal which has prompted outrage among industrial managers. Greater investigating powers to assess the true financial state of troubled companies. Encouraging the use of promissory notes as a non-inflationary means of settling debts. Mr Anatoli Chubais, privatisation minister, has also suggested formal bankruptcy procedures could be used more aggressively to concentrate the minds of the managers of 200 companies which account for the bulk of the inter-enterprise debt. Mr Chubais cited the example of the Kristal enterprise, manufacturer of Stolichnaya vodka, which had suddenly 'found' Rbs500m to repay a debt when it was threatened with bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Travel: Big, better and Cecil B De Mille - A Patagonian mountain worthy of a Hollywood spectacular THERE ARE mountains and there are mountains. Everest is the biggest. K2, the 'savage mountain', may be the most brutal. Kilimanjaro, Africa's sunbaked, snow-capped giant, is possibly the most startling. But the Torres del Paine range, in southern Chile, is something else. It is as if Cecil B De Mille had assembled his special effects people, given them a huge budget and said: 'OK, build me a mountain that'll knock folks' socks off. Give it peaks and crags, real spiky ones. And cliffs, sheer cliffs. Knife-sharp ridges. Lotsa knobbly bits. Crevasses. Big rocks balancing on itsy-bitsy stones. Glaciers. Snow. Ice. And lakes: blue ones, green ones, clear ones. Waterfalls, great big waterfalls that roar like thunder. 'Gimme animals: guanacos, floppy-eared rabbits, buzzards, a puma or three. Trout. And lotsa salmon. Then build the whole shebang at ground level, so no other mountains get in the way and folks'll get a crick neck looking up at it. Go to it, boys.' It looks as if they did. The Torres - literally, towers - of Paine soar to 2,500 metres above the level grassland of Chilean Patagonia like a dreamscape. Other peaks have bigger peaks upon their backs to beat them, but the Torres del Paine stand in glorious solitude, daring you to believe them. From far off they look like a painted film set; close up the effect is magnified, so that one is tempted to wander round behind them to wobble the canvas. But they are real, and they contain in a small area every feature you dreamt of in a mountain landscape. The towers themselves are three sharp needles of granite isolated by erosion from softer rock beneath, a geological accident that gives the whole range its breathtaking sculpted appearance. In dawn or evening sun they glow like rosy fingers jabbing at the sky; more often they loom out of the mist like sentinels, stabbing the scudding clouds to release the torrential downpours that periodically sweep the area. On the other side of the towers stand the Horns of Paine, two sharply defined peaks separated by a steep-sided bowl. They look a devilishly difficult climb from any angle. The horns stand guard over an icy, clear lake, the largest of many in this area, regularly churned into foam by ever-present winds from Patagonia. The Torres del Paine offers some of the most rugged and rewarding trekking country in Chile. The most popular hike is El circuitio, a seven-day slog past the bleak mass of the Grey glacier and behind the Horns and Torres. Less ambitious walkers can find an array of day treks mapped out in the park's visitor centre. The area was made a national park in 1959 after a series of devastating fires swept the sheep-grazing flatlands surrounding the Torres. More land was added in 1962 and the area is now policed by national park officers, who are instructed to turn back solo trekkers at the park entrance: several lone walkers have vanished in the Torres' wilderness and theoretically only groups are allowed in. The fact that these 'groups' form largely on the three-hour bus ride into the park and then unbundle themselves immediately their entrance visas have been stamped is just part of the game. The park is now home to herds of guanaco, flamingos, long-eared hares, foxes and the occasional (shy) puma. More than 100 species of bird have been logged, including black-necked swans and the Andean condor. In spring and summer - roughly November to April, although one can experience all four seasons in a day - the peaks are carpeted in Alpine flowers. Accommodation in this wilderness is scarce and over-priced, but the Hotel Pehoe deserves its luxury rating for its position alone. It stands on its own tiny private island in the middle of Lago Pehoe, reached by a narrow wooden bridge, and has a marvellous, ever-changing view of the Horns of Paine. The rooms are small and dingy, and very expensive (for Chile) at around Dollars 90 for a double, but the hotel's only rival, the spartan Posada Rio Serrano, is scarcely cheaper at Dollars 55 a double and lacks a grandstand view. There are four campsites (Dollars 10 a pitch) for hardier souls, who are frequently seen counting their change while drying out in the Hotel Pehoe's restaurant. Getting there: An adventure in itself. Flights (around Dollars 220) from Santiago leave daily for Punta Arenas, a small port at the end of the Chilean mainland. From there it is a three-hour bus ride (around Dollars 10) to Puerto Natales, a settlement on the shores of the Ultima Esperanza gulf, and a further three-hour bus ride into the Torres. The bus from Arenas to Natales gets in too late to connect with the early-morning Torres run, so an overnight stop is unavoidable. The Hotel Austral is recommended; its owner, Eduardo Scott, can arrange tours into the Torres. A good restaurant in Natales is Don Alvarito, where the gargantuan owner will greet you like a long-lost brother and ply you with grape brandy all night long, sometimes longer. The Torres can be visited as part of Patagonian expeditions through UK companies such as Journey Latin America, tel: 081-747 3108.</p>

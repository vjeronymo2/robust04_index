			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's Investors who put money into quoted Lloyd's of London funds last autumn must be disappointed with their performance. Most stand below the price at which they were floated. In addition to turbulent stock and bond markets, which have eroded the funds' asset values, underwriting rates have softened. Funds which initially traded at a premium to net assets in anticipation of underwriting profits have fallen to a discount. This year's crop of new Lloyd's companies is likely to be smaller - perhaps Pounds 200m to Pounds 400m will be raised. Even so, they will need to make a convincing case. If Lloyd's keeps up its record of innovation, though, the new batch of companies will look different from the previous one. Rather than unit trust-style vehicles which invest in a wide range of syndicates, the new breed will provide capital for a single managing agency or even a single syndicate. Shareholders will be backing the skills of an agency and its underwriters, making the investment more akin to buying shares in a traditional insurance company. Such vehicles will only be listed if the stock exchange waives its usual requirement for a three-year trading record. The exchange will have to consider whether companies with all their eggs in one basket at Lloyd's are too risky for the public market. But it is difficult to argue that single-syndicate funds would be more volatile than biotechnology companies, which recently won a similar exemption from the exchange. Investors confident of their ability to pick winners at Lloyd's should be given the opportunity to try.</p>

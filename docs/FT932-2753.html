			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Court suspends Nigeria poll result THE POLITICAL future of Nigeria was thrown into renewed doubt last night when the commission overseeing presidential elections held last Saturday suspended publication of the outcome. The move followed a court ruling restraining it from announcing the result. It lends substance to fears raised by pro-democracy groups in Nigeria that the transition to democracy in Africa's most populous state, promised by the military government of President Ibrahim Babangida, is in jeopardy - having been put back three times in three years. Gen Babangida's options are now far from clear. Extension of military rule would be controversial yet the transition to civilian rule has been seriously undermined, and the August handover date appears impractical. Although a presidential decree in April stated that no court could stop the commission carrying out Nigeria's first presidential elections for a decade, the electoral body says it will respect the latest ruling from the high court. The suspension is in effect until further notice. Mr Moshood Abiola, the millionaire Moslem businessman who was presidential candidate of the Social Democratic party, one of two almost indistinguishable rival parties created by Mr Babangida's government, had been declared the winner in 13 of the country's 30 states by Sunday night. Since then no more returns have been released. Those close to the commission say Mr Abiola won by a clear margin, taking 59 per cent of the votes cast. The injunction against the electoral commission was brought by the Association for Better Nigeria, an unofficial pressure group which is seeking the extension of military rule for at least another four years. It claims to represent the views of most Nigerians - and can draw some strength for its arguments from the low turnout at the polls, estimated at below 40 per cent - but is thought to have close links with the presidency. Gen Babangida took power in a coup in 1985. The Campaign for Democracy, another pressure group, won an injunction against the ABN in April at a high court in Lagos on the grounds that a decree in 1992 made it illegal to campaign against the transition process. The ABN has ignored that injunction and the presidency has made no comment. The electoral commission denies alleged vote rigging is behind the suspension.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-ku: "Kim Il-song's Health Deteriorating </F> With Geriatric Diseases"]    [Text] Although North Korean President Kim Il-song, who has  just turned 82, is still continuing political activities, he is  suffering from various geriatric diseases. He often falls into  a comatose state these days, thus signaling a red flag in his  physical condition.    Although President Kim Il-song has boasted to foreign  visitors that he keeps healthy thanks to his "optimistic outlook  on life," informed sources, such as those who have recently  visited North Korea and met President Kim Il-song and Chinese  medical circles, say that his physical health has been  deteriorating with each passing day because of various geriatric  diseases, such as senile dementia, enlargement of the lump on  the back of his neck, neurotic disorder of the lumbar vertebra,  heaviness in the chest from a heart pacemaker, and mental  confusion.    When he appeared on the rostrum of the Kumsusan Assembly  Hall  in Pyongyang to deliver a New Year's address on 31 December it  was revealed that he has distinct difficulty in walking  resulting from retrogressive arthritis.    The arthritis causes pain in the area above the hip, so he  has to be assisted by two or three secret servicemen when he  climbs up stairs.    The most distinct proof of the deterioration of his health  is  a speech disorder resulting from senile dementia. While reading  this year's New Year's address, he made errors and his  pronunciation was indistinct from a droop in his lower lip.  These errors and indistinct pronunciation of words occurred  some 70 times during this year's New Year's address, compared  with 30 times during his 1993 New Year's address.    Because of the senile dementia, his right hand trembles, he  has difficulty in chewing food, and frequently uses a  handkerchief to wipe off the area around his mouth.    His sight has deteriorated to the extent that he has to read  documents in large printed letters with reading glasses. The  hearing in his right ear is so deteriorated that he frequently  says, "What did you say?" For this reason, when he receives  foreign visitors, he has Sony Japanese-made speakers installed  in each seat.    The lump on the back of his head, which is an obesity-caused  tumor, is confirmed to have deteriorated so much that it presses  against the larynx nerve.    The lump is not life-threatening, but an operation to remove  it is impossible because it is located close to the cranial  nerve. Some 10 doctors recommended by the CPC performed an  acupuncture procedure in October 1992, but he still suffers from  increasing pain from the pressure on the larynx nerve. Because  of the neurotic disorder of the lumbar vertebra, President Kim  Il-song has recently reduced the length of his discussions and  speeches to one hour and half an hour respectively under  ordinary circumstances. He refrains from traveling by airplane  or by car on unsurfaced roads, which can adversely affect the  lumbar vertebra.    He also avoids standing or walking for long periods of time.  He uses a wheel chair when he is at his villa.    The degree of his shaking backward and forward while  standing  has increased compared with last year, as witnessed by many.    In addition, President Kim Il-song, who has cardiovascular  disease, invited a medical specialist from the former East  Germany at the end of 1972 to perform an operation to dilate his  heart blood vessels and to insert a heart pacemaker. In 1987,  he was operated on again for the insertion of another aid device  by a French surgical specialist. Since the end of 1991, medical  doctors from the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan have regularly visited North Korea to check his physical  condition. In February 1992, however, he was unconscious for a  few minutes, so he received a secret treatment at a villa in  Chongjin for one month in the middle of September of that year.    Meanwhile, with Kim Il-song's health deteriorating with each  passing day, the North Korean authorities are reported to be  training those who resemble Kim's appearance and constitution,  selecting them through an advertisement on "recruiting actors  for a documentary film" for security and acting training,  including intonation and walking-style training, to prevent  confusion that may result after Kim Il-song's death.</p>

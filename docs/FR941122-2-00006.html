			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 days of publication of this notice and any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Interested parties may submit case briefs and/or written comments not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in such briefs or comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish a notice of the final results of this administrative review, which will include the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such briefs or comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department shall determine, and the U.S. Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the U.S. Customs Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon completion of the final results of this administrative review for all shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for Saha Thai will be that established in the final results of this review; (2) for merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or previous reviews, the cash deposit will continue to be the rate published in the final determination or the last final results for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in the final results of this review, a previous review, or the original investigation; and (4) if neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others rate'' from the LTFV investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floral Trade Council v. United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  822 F. Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  822 F. Supp. 782 (CIT 1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that, in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 15.67 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the Department's final determination of sales at LTFV (51 FR 3384, January 27, 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a countervailing duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (50 FR 32751, August 15, 1985). In accordance with section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act, entries subject to both antidumping duties and countervailing duties will not be assessed antidumping duties on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies. Because the amount of countervailing duties to be imposed on entries during the POR has yet to be determined, we cannot at this time make the appropriate adjustment. However, to ensure that the appropriate adjustment is made, upon issuing our final results of the administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs not to assess antidumping duties on the margin attributable to export subsidies for the POR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary of the Department's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

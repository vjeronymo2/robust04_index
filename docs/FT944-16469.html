			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / People: Iceland Peter Hinchcliffe, 47, one of the founders of the Iceland frozen food chain, is stepping down as joint managing director, thus ending a 24-year partnership which started when he and Malcolm Walker, 48, Iceland's chairman and chief executive, opened their first shop in Oswestry. Hinchcliffe (pictured in Iceland's warehouse at Shotton) and Walker were both deputy managers of Woolworth stores in North Wales; in their spare time they sold strawberries to passing motorists on the Horseshoe Pass. In 1970 they went into business full time and have built up a chain of almost 700 stores in the UK. Hinchcliffe says he wants to reduce his involvement in the company in order to pursue other business interests. He will retire as joint managing director and deputy chairman at the end of the year. He will remain a non-executive director and has been retained as a consultant for two years. He says he has no plans to reduce his shareholding of around 3 per cent in Iceland.</p>

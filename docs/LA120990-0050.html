			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEDDING LIGHT ON WETLANDS PACT  </P> <P> Milton Bassett's comments on the settlement between Friends of Ballona Wetlands  and Maguire Thomas Partners, developer of Playa Vista (Times, Nov. 11),  indicate that he doesn't understand the terms of our agreement. I hope I can  shed some light on just what the Friends agreed to support and why.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, certain trigger words used by Bassett only serve to arouse  emotions, while obscuring facts. When he labels the wetlands restoration a "pet  project" of the Friends, he denigrates one of the most important ecological  assets in Southern California. Over 90% of the wetlands are gone in Los Angeles  County. Our battle was fought to save what is left.  </P> <P> Also, the figures Bassett cites to support his contentions are misleading in  that they speak of an "increase in density" over the original project. It's  true there is an increase in residential units. But I would remind him that the  original project contained a regional shopping center (a tremendous traffic  generator), 33% more retail space, 25% more new office space and very little  affordable housing.  </P> <P> The Maguire Thomas plan will increase affordable housing by 110%. Additionally,  the amount of space devoted to recreational uses and open space will be  significantly increased. A 60-acre parcel west of Lincoln Boulevard and south  of Jefferson Boulevard protected by the new agreement had been targeted by  Summa Corp. for 10- to 15-story buildings, 1,433 units of housing and a private  golf course. Now that area will be freshwater ponds and a freshwater wetland.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas also agreed to eliminate an extension of Falmouth Avenue that  would have sliced through the heart of the restored wetland. They also  abandoned plans for a 225-unit building at the stable site adjacent to the most  sensitive portion of the wetland and replaced it, at our insistence, with a  plant nursery and other uses compatible with the wetland.  </P> <P> Within Playa Vista, Maguire Thomas plans a recycling facility for refuse  separation, a combined sludge and refuse organics processing facility to  produce soil amendment, and an on-site water reclamation plant. The reclaimed  water will be used for irrigation of landscaping, energy conservation, car  washes, toilet flushing and habitat improvement in the wetlands and Ballona  Creek.  </P> <P> When we added to all these pluses the realities of the marketplace, the Friends  concluded the settlement was the very best they could achieve. It would be  wonderful to have no development at all. It would also be wonderful to return  to Eden. But we live in the real world. The settlement we made is the best  possible in that world.  </P> <P> Certainly there are many issues besides the wetlands involved in Playa Vista,  and, yes, the project will have substantial impact on the surrounding  communities. But Playa Vista will have to go through public hearings. When the  draft Environmental Impact Report is circulated, we -- and everyone else --  will have the opportunity to comment.  </P> <P> It has been 14 years since Playa Vista was first announced by the Summa Corp.  The Friends have fought every moment of those years to prevent the destruction  of the Ballona Wetlands. We are pleased to have achieved our goal.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Mr. Bassett, please try to think kindly of the Ballona Wetlands.  They have had to live for many years with the "devastating environmental  impact" of the surrounding communities. They have fought the longest, faced the  most deprivation, surmounted insult and degradation and survived in the face of  terrible adversity. Now it's our turn to nurse them back to health. When you  see them in all their restored glory, you'll be glad we did.  </P> <P> RUTH LANSFORD  </P> <P> co-chairwoman,  </P> <P> Friends of Ballona Wetlands  </P></p>

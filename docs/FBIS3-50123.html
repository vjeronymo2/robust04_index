			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anton Uncu: "Our Leaders"] </F>   [Excerpt] We Romanians say that whenever God wants to  punish someone, he first makes them go out of their mind. After  that, there is no need to punish them any further for their sins  because they will punish themselves anyway. In this sense, the  case of Adrian Nastase [executive chairman of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, and speaker of the Chamber of  Deputies] can be very eye-opening. Ever since the [December  1989] revolution, he has been trying to portray himself as a  democratic, intelligent, impartial, and so on politician. And  why should we not admit that he really has all the necessary  prerequisites to become what he wants to be. He can speak  eloquently, he is calm, he has a good memory, good looks...  However, for some reason unknown to us, the speaker of the  Chamber of Deputies recently lost his memory. He has forgotten,  for instance, that a month ago, he told correspondents that the  party he represents would never accept the blackmail of PUNR  [National Romanian Unity Party], which, at that time,  conditioned its cooperation [with the ruling party] on being  offered a number of ministerial portfolios. Nastase's  indignation seemed real and worthy of our respect. However, a  few days ago, the official PDSR leader changed his views. The  PUNR blackmail does not concern him in the least; on the  contrary, he ceremoniously announced that the PDSR and PUNR have  established an alliance intending to govern the country. The  portfolios, which a month ago he considered to be the motive of  the blackmail, are included, of course -- at least, this is what  we think. The whole thing reminds us of a great Romanian lawyer  who manages to prove that the defendant is a scoundrel who  should be sent to jail, after which, within a few minutes, he  also manages to demonstrate that he is as innocent as an  angel... In today's Romania, this is how the official leader of  the ruling party turns black into white and white into black,  turning the whims of a spoiled child determined to ruin the toy  he has just received as a present into a political act. The toy  is nothing but Romania's Government, the leadership of which is  also coveted by the man who rings the bell in the hall of the  Chamber of Deputies... [passage omitted]</p>

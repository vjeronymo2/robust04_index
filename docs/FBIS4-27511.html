			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Korean residents in  Japan and Japanese people bitterly denounced the Japanese  Government's smear campaign against the DPRK and suppression of  the General Association of Korean residents in Japan (Chongnyon).    So Man-sol, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee  of Chongnyon, in a talk with compatriots of the Fukuyama branch  of Chongnyon in Hiroshima prefecture on May 18 said the ulterior  intention of the unreasonable search of the Osaka prefectural  organisation of Chongnyon by Japanese police on the pretext of  "forcible obstruction to business" was to destroy the  organisation and activity of Chongnyon.    Kim Hwa-hyo, vice-chairman of the Association of Korean  Social Scientists in Japan, in a lecture on May 14 branded the  police search as a deliberate and premeditated political  repression.    Koreans under the Hyogo, Nara and Wakayama prefectural  headquarters of Chongnyon, representatives of the Gifu and Mie  prefectural headquarters of the League of Korean Youth in Japan  and teachers and students of the Tohoku Korean Primary, Junior  and Senior Middle School joined the protests of the officials  and compatriots under the Osaka prefectural headquarters of  Chongnyon.    Japanese people expressed solidarity with the struggle of  Koreans in Japan.    Saichiro Uesugi, chairman of the Executive Committee of the  Buraku Liberation League in Tokyo, expressed deep concern over  the crackdown on Chongnyon organisation by Japanese police and  vowed to strive for a solution to this incident.    Den Araki, vice chairman of the Osaka prefectural  headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party, said his  party would firmly solidarize with Chongnyon and counter the  anti-Chongnyon campaign.</p>

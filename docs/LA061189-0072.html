			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK  </P> <P> KOOL MOE DEE "Knowledge Is King. " Jive/RCA ***: POP STARS ***** Great Balls of  Fire **** Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't  That a Shame  </P> <P> In the rap genre, stardom often comes and goes faster than many rhymers can  say, "Yo, baby, yo!" A rapper that's not in touch with the streets may as well  turn in his gold chains. Kool Moe Dee has remained one of the most  well-respected rappers on the scene since his first album was released in early  1987. With this third album Moe maintains the sense of humor and social  conscience that made his name for him, while managing to land a few poetic  punches at rival LL Cool J (the target of the last album's title cut, "How Ya  Like Me Now").  </P> <P> Boasting is still Kool Moe's most dangerous weapon; both this LP's title cut  and its debut single, "They Want Money," find the rhymer flaunting his  fast-paced life style while kicking out some wicked dance beats, but on the  title cut the bragging is tempered with a message for black consciousness  that's definitely in touch with the times. For today's more speed-conscious  dancers, "I Go to Work" goes a long way toward proving Moe Dee the hardest  working rapper in show business, while "Pump Your Fist" is a powerful rock  anthem-turned-rap that should emerge as another hit. Co-producer Teddy Riley  (Keith Sweat, Guy) ensures that the answer to "How Ya Like Me Now" will remain  a positive one. DUFF MARLOWE  </P></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Formosa Plastics complex to go ahead FORMOSA Plastics will shortly start work on a TDollars 210bn (USDollars 8bn) petrochemical complex after securing rights to use submerged land on Taiwan's south-west coast. News that the island's largest private investment project will finally proceed gave a boost to Taipei's efforts to urge local manufacturers to invest at home instead of mainland China. Mr P. K. Chiang, minister of economic affairs, said: 'Formosa Plastics' sixth cracker project will have a major impact on increasing private investment and industrial production.' He added that output from the complex would slice Taiwan's reliance on imported petrochemicals from 50 to 10 per cent of local demand. The acquisition of land-use rights was the most vexing of the problems that have plagued the plan to build the island's sixth cracker and related expansion projects since group chairman Mr Y. C. Wang proposed the project nearly seven years ago. The ministry of economic affairs has made 1,940 hectares of public land, now underwater, available at a price of TDollars 563.4m. Authorities in Yunlin County, where the complex will be built, had earlier supplied Formosa Plastics with 543 hectares of land. Reclamation costs will be borne by the investors, probably with assistance from government-backed financing. The complex will include two refineries, two naphtha crackers and up to 39 petrochemical intermediates plants, most of which will built by Formosa Plastics and other local companies. The plan also includes construction of a TDollars 15bn industrial port. Formosa Plastics will launch reclamation work after transfer of the land use rights is completed by July 10. Priority will be given to reclaiming land for a machinery plant, and constructing dormitories for workers, gravel storage sites, roadways and sewers.</p>

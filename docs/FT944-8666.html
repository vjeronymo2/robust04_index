			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sony's Hollywood romance dies - Things looked so different five years ago when the Japanese group paid Dollars 3.4bn for Columbia and Tristar When the news broke five years ago that Sony, the powerful Japanese electronics group, had pounced on Columbia and Tristar, the famous Hollywood studios, the reaction of the US media was nothing short of hysterical. Sony's Dollars 3.4bn acquisition, followed by the news that Matsushita, another force in Japanese electronics, was buying MCA for Dollars 6.1bn, unleashed a stream of rhetoric about the apparently unstoppable Asian invasion into America's cultural heartland - Hollywood. This mood soon changed as it became apparent that Sony and MCA's sober-suited executives were finding it difficult to manage their egocentric new subsidiaries. Sony yesterday demonstrated how difficult its Hollywood adventure had been by announcing a first-half Y280bn (Dollars 2.9bn) loss due to a Y265bn write-off on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), which includes Columbia and Tristar. The scale of the write-off outstripped the most pessimistic predictions. Against the backdrop of last month's public showdown between Matsushita and its unruly executives at MCA, it has strengthened suspicions that Sony and Matsushita blundered badly by making expensive acquisitions in the US entertainment industry. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said: 'If there is a moral to this story it's that Japanese electronics groups do not make good parents for Hollywood movie studios.' Things seemed so different five years ago when Sony and Matsushita embarked on their US spending spree. The consumer electronics market was maturing and the Japanese groups faced fierce competition from rivals in lower cost countries such as South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. Sony and Matsushita needed to diversify and reckoned the best area for investment was the software side of their business: the film studios and record companies that produced the movies and music pumped out by their hardware. Entertainment also offered excellent growth prospects. The emergence of cable and video, coupled with the globalisation of consumer taste and the creation of lucrative markets in eastern Europe and south-east Asia, augured well for long-term sales of English language films and music. The hitch was that the gulf between the ethos of corporate Japan and the world of Hollywood was wider than they had feared. One New York analyst said: 'These LA guys seem like a flakey bunch of prima donnas here in Manhattan. Over in Tokyo they must seem completely crazy.' 'Crazy' is probably an understatement for Matsushita's view of the behaviour of Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran chairman of MCA, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, his president. The two became multi-millionaires by selling shares to Matsushita and have since made no secret of their contempt for their new parent company. Tempers seemed to cool after last month's showdown. However, the intensely private Matsushita has been left in an unpalatable situation whereby one of its most important subsidiaries is run by two men who have publicly criticised its performance. Sony is in a similar predicament in the music industry thanks to Mr George Michael, the British singer who has mounted an expensive legal battle to try to sever his contract with its CBS music subsidiary. Mr Michael is now reported to be in talks with Mr David Geffen, who is leaving MCA to set up his own entertainment group. However, Sony's problems in music pale beside its traumas with films. It has over the past five years invested an estimated Dollars 4.5bn in SPE in addition to the original Dollars 3.4bn acquisition price. Mr Peter Guber, who spent most of that money, resigned last month as SPE chairman. His departure ended a grim year of internal rows, allegations linking senior SPE executives to the Heidi Fleiss sex scandal and a poor performance at the box office. SPE had an erratic year in 1993 with some successes, such as Philadelphia, but a disappointment in Last Action Hero, its Dollars 126m Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. This year has been worse. Variety magazine estimates that its share of the US box office has fallen from 14.7 per cent in 1990 to 9.8 per cent this year. Sony's studios are also bottom of this year's league table for average gross per film with Dollars 18.1m against Dollars 55.3m for Paramount, the top studio. Yesterday's writedown marks Sony's attempt to clear the debris of its first five troubled years in Hollywood. Its studio also faced substantial second-quarter losses for mopping up abortive development projects and lingering legal suits. After Mr Guber's departure it now, in theory, has a chance to start afresh. But some observers suspect Sony and Matsushita's plight is not simply due to cultural incompatibility, but to a flaw in their strategy. This suggests they should have stuck to hardware, by investing in information technology. Sony and Matsushita have already made modest investments in the information technology field. But both privately admit they would have been able to invest more aggressively had it not been for their commitment to Hollywood.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Italian export insurance for review - Tighter guidelines will follow corruption charges IN A little-noticed move, the Italian Treasury has decided to carry out a thorough review of the operations of Sace, the state-run export insurance agency with total exposure of L52,266bn (Pounds 22.25bn). The outcome is likely to have a profound impact on the way Italian exports are given cover. In future Sace - or its replacement - will operate on much tighter guidelines with more overtly financial criteria and less subject to the strong-arm of the politicians. Sace has operated with a great degree of discretion and has been deeply beholden to political masters. This has been exposed in recent months by its involvement in the corruption scandals that have led in turn to a complete overhaul of the agency's board. Mr Roberto Ruberti, head of Sace, is still in jail after being arrested on March 11 on charges of corruption. Two other senior Sace executives were arrested, along with three other figures linked to the export credit business. Mr Ruberti, a former member of the Bank of Italy, is alleged to have received payment in return for providing Sace cover for overseas Italian contracting operations. These developments prompted the Treasury to move in and take a closer look at Sace, while also guaranteeing the normality of the agency's operations. Rome magistrates are understood to be examining a series of suspect insurance deals, especially in the Caribbean, between 1983-88. Some Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m (Pounds 200m-Pounds 270m) is involved. Until the magistrates have clarified matters, the Treasury cannot approve formal settlement of the suspect operations. As a result the Treasury is expected to establish an escrow account to assure creditors they will be paid. Even without the damage caused by being caught up in the corruption scandals, Sace was in need of a reappraisal. Questions have been building up for years about how far the Treasury should be funding indemnity payments and over the slim size of premiums. There have also been demands for a better definition of the types of country risk available for Sace cover, as well as new guidelines on the agency's role in backing overseas aid projects. The latter area is where some of the worst abuses are believed to have occurred. The Treasury has handed out over L3,360bn in the past two years to assist Sace pay-out indemnity claims and L1,400bn more is likely this year. The level of indemnities is believed to have peaked in 1992, the large recent amounts reflecting problems dating back to 1983-90. These losses relate primarily to the Latin American debt crisis, exposure in Egypt and problems arising from political change in east Europe - notably the former Soviet Union, ex-Yugoslavia and Poland. The need for such Treasury support stems more from low premiums than from the income received from credits recovered. Since Sace was established in 1977 premiums have slipped from covering over 80 per cent of indemnities to under 10 per cent. The ratio of recoveries to indemnities is over 60 per cent. Since 1990 tighter methods of control have been in operation; but only now are the authorities recognising that Sace has conducted insurance cover on far too discretionary a basis. Thus one of the main tasks of the commission will be to provide a set of ground rules for transparent operations judging risk both by country and by business sector. A more sensitive issue concerns future Sace policy towards covering investments regarded as strategic in risk countries. This is especially important for Italy, which depends almost wholly on energy imports whose cost has to be offset by an aggressive export policy. Successive governments have thus encouraged big trade and project finance deals with the energy suppliers. The most notable examples are trade and investment deals to offset the cost of Algerian and Soviet gas. Between them, Algeria and the former Soviet states account for L15,000bn (split in roughly equal parts) of Sace's cover - nearly 30 per cent of all long-term commitments. Much of the L7,000bn Sace cover for Algeria embraces trade and investment related to building a second under-the-Mediterranean gas pipeline. Nevertheless, at present these countries would not necessarily come within the ambit of stricter criteria for Sace coverage - either in terms of political risk or because of non-payment of debts. The Treasury commission will therefore have to decide whether such strategic investments are determined by reasons of state or by purely commercial considerations. If the former, then cover will have to be arranged in a different way - for instance, guaranteed direct by the Treasury or backed by special collateral. A pointer is the current negotiations between ENI, the state oil concern, and Gazprom for a Dollars 1.8bn contract to modernise and upgrade the Russian federation's gas pipe network. Here the Italians want a commodity collateral in gas or oil. Only when the collateral has been finalised will the Sace cover of Dollars 1.6bn be forthcoming.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: A languorous look back at Venus and the myth - William Packer explores an exhibition of sculpture at the Liverpool Tate Each generation redefines its ideal of Woman in terms of its current pre-occupations and aesthetic. Ever since Paris first sat in judgement on the Three Graces, the story has been the same. Juno may have tried to bribe him with the offer of supreme power and Minerva with military glory, but Venus was always going to win. Sex and beauty always do. The Tate Gallery in Liverpool, continuing its excellent programme of small exhibitions that inform the richness of the gallery's own collections, is looking at those sculptors of the avant-garde who were working in Paris in the 50 years or so after 1890. The theme is the idealised, or at least formalised, female nude - which, in its inevitable symbolic aspect, is to the artist always Venus. Any such catch-all approach is fair enough, and this particular title of Venus Re-defined need not be taken too literally. Even so, the territorial limitation to Paris is to be regretted. How good it would have been, for example, to have had an early reclining figure by Henry Moore to set beside the Matisse and Laurens horizontales; and alongside Zadkine's totemic Venus, some ruder German Expressionist figure by Kirchner or Heckel. The point, perhaps, as is so often with these small and pilot exercises, is for a larger, more ambitious project then to propose itself. As to the present exhibition, for all the talk of Venus - given in the actual titles of the works by Renoir and Zadkine - and of Rodin's Cybele and Maillol's Three Nymphs, there is no question here of classical pastiche or pre-occupation. Whatever classical reference there is appears incidental rather than central, a matter of passing interest and general sympathy, no more than the simple monumentality of a sculptural presence, the shift of weight, the swing of a hip in a standing pose, or the languorous turn of the figure at rest. More to the point is the fact that all these artists, from Rodin in the 1890s to Laurens in the 1940s, engaged directly as they were with the principles and practices of modernism and the avant-garde, should have seen the female life model, set up in conventional, even archetypal, fashion as the normal and appropriate vehicle for the development of their ideas. How remote this seems from our own experience, when working from the figure is considered an anachronistic irrelevance, if not actively condemned as exploitation. Matisse's four monumental relief studies, which dominate the show, were made for his own purposes and not shown in public until after his death in 1954. The earliest dates from around 1910, the last from 1930, and each takes the same image of the standing woman seen from behind. So we follow him in his radical simplification of the image, abstracted almost to the point of abstraction. But was it ever, in his mind, a Venus re-defined? Autumn by Laurens, a large reclining figure of 1948, is an actively voluptuous and surreal composition of abstracted fruit-like forms, writhing and thrusting. Venus? Perhaps she is. And Maillol's Three Nymphs, a monumental reworking of the familiar group? Indeed. Other displays at the Liverpool Tate currently include In Light of the Other, the touring exhibition of work by Californian video artist Gary Hill. It was reviewed by my colleague Lynn McRitchie when it was at Oxford last autumn. The most notable element in the show is the set of inter-active images of silent figures who seem to notice the viewer as he stops before them, walk up to him as though to inspect him in the gloom, and turn away as he himself moves on. And continuing at the Tate is New Realities 1945-1968, a major international survey of the painting, and a little of the sculpture, of its period. Drawn from the Tate's own collections, it is about to enter the third and last of its annual revisionary phases since it was first hung in 1992. The survey falls into three self-explanatory parts: turning to the figure; pursuing abstraction; and towards a new aesthetic, and is particularly stimulating for the half-forgotten artists it brings back into the light alongside the more predictable and familiar names - Pignon, Buffet, Gruber, Coker, Armitage, Self, Solages, Henderson and others - and for the international and inter-disciplinary comparisons it draws.

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / US insurers face bill for toxic waste fund The Clinton administration is proposing to set up a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) fund paid for by the insurance industry as part of its overhaul of the controversial Superfund laws governing the clean-up of toxic waste sites. Ms Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said yesterday that the new fund, to be built up by a levy on the industry starting at a total Dollars 500m a year, would help settle insurance claims arising from waste dumped before 1986, when the Superfund law was revised, and cut down on lawsuits. The administration's draft legislation would also set up a new form of arbitration process for allocating responsibility for cleaning up waste sites, under the auspices of an independent expert, and make other changes that it hopes would resolve some of the law's current problems in assigning liability. Superfund legislation was first passed in 1980 amid public outcry over notorious dumps such as Love Canal, near the Niagara Falls, or Kentucky's Valley of the Drums. Its operation, however, has been widely criticised for the unfairness with which liability is distributed, the slowness of clean-ups - only 217 of the 1,280 sites listed as national priorities have been declared clean - and the amount of time and money spent on litigation. A study last year by the Rand Corporation, a California-based think-tank, estimated that transaction costs ate up 27 per cent of the money spent on clean-ups. 'We all need Superfund reform desperately. No one who knows anything about Superfund would dispute that,' said Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate committee on the environment. Ms Browner said the administration's proposals would make clean-ups quicker and cheaper. 'Our proposal will cut the length of clean-up by 10 to 20 per cent and the cost of clean-up by up to 25 per cent,' she said. The draft legislation aims to introduce some consistency by setting up national standards for clean-ups, although these standards will vary according to the future use of the land. One of the most controversial aspects of Superfund has been the application of joint and several liability, in which companies which contributed only a little to the pollution of a site may end up being saddled with most of the bill because other polluters have gone out of business. The administration bill retains joint and several liability, which is a well-established legal principle, but Ms Browner said the new procedure for allocating responsibility would allow businesses to settle their share and not worry about being sued by others. Joint and several liability was the inducement to take part in the allocation process, since those who did not settle could end up being sued for the leftover costs, or orphan share, which cannot be allocated to a specific party. Very small polluters - some households have faced a Superfund bill because their rubbish was taken away to a landfill - will be absolved of liability, and other small polluters will be given the opportunity to settle early.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Transcript of remarks by Pavel Bunich, deputy chairman of </F> the State Duma Committee on Property, Privatization, and  Economic Activity, carried under the "At the State Duma" rubric;  date not given: "How To Reconcile the Irreconcilable"]    [Text] I think that sensible people should be a little  reassured by the president's recent Message to the Federal  Assembly and the subsequent enlarged session of the Council of  Ministers. After the cabinet shake-up, the departure of several  key figures from it, and a worryingly long pause by the premier  the president and the cabinet head have made it clear that the  course of reforms remains as before. The government does not  intend to give in to pressure from sector lobbies which cause  momentary embarrassment in the upper echelons or heed the advice  of economic authorities fervently convinced that for the time  being the market is not for us -- that the road to the market is  a long and winding one that lies in some other dimension  altogether.    It is typical that both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin recalled  the  program drafted last August, dismissing once again, as it were,  the charges of unfocused, chaotic drift. If the program is a  course (and it is), serious deviations really will not be seen,  although modifications will have to be made to practice. Who  could have planned, for example, for state orders not being paid  for, for wages not paid out on time, or for those in the  budget-financed sphere being so badly hurt. On the contrary, it  was stressed that their incomes would grow almost in parallel  with prices. It did not work out. It is now time to pay for  past sins, and for virtually all of them at the same time. It  has been stated that the government will in the very near future  settle its accounts with the countryside, the defense sector,  the miners, and the budget-financed sphere. Major credits have  been promised on the surety of the spring sowing. Compensation  for the population's savings will continue to be paid. All this  will, of course, whip up inflation, but the new cabinet cannot  be blamed for that. The third act of the drama has come, and it  is time to fire the gun hanging on the wall. We have been able  to see for ourselves once again that you can have the very best  of intentions but you will build nothing durable on the basis of  unreliability and disregard of the law. If the government has  decided finally to clear its debts, its determination can only  be welcomed.    It is important not to overshoot the mark; it is important  to  keep a clear sense of proportion. Some people are asking that  not just the budget debt but suppliers too be repaid. However,  carrying out mutual settlement on the 1992 model means  delivering a very heavy blow to the reforms. Others propose  that working capital be indexed -- that is to say, you add  several zeros to their value and then quietly slip that gain  into wages. This has happened. We have experienced it. It is  senseless to repeat it. It is not difficult to predict that new  subsidies and cheap loans will be demanded from the government.  Enterprises' market muscles have just begun to develop, and we  are again providing them with hot-house conditions wherein they  have to compete against no one for anything and where the young  musculature will grow flaccid within a couple of weeks through  not being wanted. And all this under the slogan of combating  the reduction in output, of trying not to give way. Give way,  and you will not keep inflation down.    The 1994 draft budget is screwed down so tightly that you  can hear the nuts squeaking. By tradition we do everything  late. There are, it is true, nuances here. In the past we  would simply fail to pay money to, say, the Army or the northern  regions and then say: We will be making cutbacks. Such methods  generated a wave of discontent -- society and the economy cannot  be treated that way. First you plan what you will cut, you  agree this, you make arrangements, and you cut whatever it is;  then you make your expenditure savings. It is clear from the  draft budget what will be curtailed and slimmed down. But time  passes, and it gets lost again. If all the cuts had been  announced at least one quarter ago.... I fear that it will be  necessary to pay more than planned. Inflation will be not 3-5  percent by the end of the year but much higher -- given the  payment of debts, prices will increase roughly fourfold, by my  estimates. And that is at best, if the government avoids the  aforementioned pitfalls toward which some people are stubbornly  egging it on.    Unfortunately the session said little about overcoming the  investment crisis. This topic was touched on to a certain  extent by Basin, chairman of the State Committee on Issues of  Construction and Architecture. Revaluing fixed capital, he  reported, will increase deductions set aside for depreciation to  40 trillion rubles [R]. But the problem is that enterprises  will shamelessly consume this money and use it for wages. Basin  suggested that we introduce separate accounts for depreciation,  as was done in the past. I do not think that is enough. Tax is  not levied on depreciation as distinct from wages paid out of  profit or prime costs, and strictness here is therefore  justified. Let them return everything they have consumed to the  depreciation fund and then pay a fine in addition. The pointer  of economic interest will then shift in the direction we desire  and enterprises will be forced to think about the future.    There is in general a strange prejudice abroad that no one  will want to resort to investment under inflation conditions.  Quite the reverse. They want to. They very much want to. It  is precisely during inflation that investment is the best way to  save money. Land and real estate are self-indexing, as it were.  That the price confusion makes life difficult and that almost  everything goes on wages is another issue. Last year only 15  out of 600 facilities under the state capital investment plan  were commissioned. But what is significant here is that private  and joint-stock enterprises, where one's own, nonstate assets  increase, have a totally different attitude to investment.  One-third of them are modernizing, expanding, and making  improvements -- that is to say, are in some way participating in  the investment process. And I am encouraged by the thought that  by 1 July, when voucher privatization is completed, around 80  percent of state property will be joint stock or in private  ownership. In other words, approximately 80 percent of  enterprises will receive an investment incentive. There may be  no money to start with, but there will be an incentive. And  with time there will be money too.    Incidentally, privatized enterprises have the right to  obtain  money on the security of their own property. The law on surety  has been adopted, but a number of normative acts are required if  it is to work.    And why not consider investment concessions -- credit for  investment needs which will be granted against specific business  plans on a case-by-case basis rather than for whole sectors, as  is current practice? This is an active state policy which is  not even to be seen in embryonic form.    I understand the difficult conditions in which the current  budget has been drafted, and I am ready to resign myself  philosophically to many things. Yet one feature does produce a  sense of inner protest. Expenditure has determined the budget,  and no weight has been placed on the other side of the scales,  the revenue side, to counterbalance it. But, you know, you  cannot go on like that forever, because by contracting  expenditure you also cut back future revenue and reduce the tax  base. Something has to grow, to ripen, and yield fruit, and  this "something" must be identified by the state in good time  and, if need be, supported. But it seems to me that we are  reverting to discussion of investment policy.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CUT WATER USE 10%, DEUKMEJIAN ORDERS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian ordered all state agencies and departments to curtail  water use by at least 10% to leave more for farming and firefighting. "As bad  as things are in the state this year, we must also prepare for the possibility  of a fifth straight year of drought," Deukmejian said in his weekly radio  address.  </P> <P> "If we do not conserve this year, next year we may have more severe water  rationing, higher water prices and increased adverse economic and environmental  consequences." His executive order directs department managers to seek ways of  saving water, such as repairing leaks, limiting landscape irrigation, limiting  washing of state cars and windows, eliminating washing of sidewalks and  driveways and turning off decorative fountains. The drought, now in its fourth  year, is expected to hurt farmers, particularly in the southern San Joaquin  Valley, and cause losses in wildlife, fisheries and water-oriented recreation,  he said.  </P></p>

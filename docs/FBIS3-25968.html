A spokesman of the Chinese delegation urged the  congress to withdraw the motion on the Tibet issue.    The spokesman pointed out: The motion put forward by  Australia's Champaign Institute is a purely political one, which  describes Tibet as "a country" and also incites Tibetan  independence. This constitutes open interference and  infringement of China's sovereignty and a violation of  international law. As everyone knows, Tibet is an inalienable  part of the sacred territory of China. The formulation of  "rapid damage to the natural ecology in Tibet" is contrary to  fact. A host of facts illustrate that Tibet achieves success in  preserving forest and wildlife. The demand of the Chinese  delegation was supported by some countries.</p>

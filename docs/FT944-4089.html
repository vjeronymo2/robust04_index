			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: VAW decides to shut Bavarian aluminium smelter VAW will permanently shut its Toeging aluminium smelter in Bavaria at the end of next year but the rest of its smelters in Germany have been reprieved at least till the year 2000. Mr Karl Wobbe, the VAW board member responsible for aluminium production, said yesterday a sudden change in power availability in Germany played an important part in the decision to keep open the smelters here, at Stade and at Hamburg (the last is one third owned by VAW). Various factors, such as the severe drop in industrial activity in the former East Germany and closures in the country's chemical industry had ended Germany's power shortage. Electricity suppliers had offered power contracts to the Neuss and Hamburg smelters to 2000 at prices that made them internationally competitive. Negotiations were going on about the Stade smelters' contract but Mr Wobbe was optimistic about the outcome. He was also optimistic about Neuss surviving beyond 2000. Costs had also been cut by the streamlining forced on VAW by the crisis in the global aluminium industry, which last year saw the group cut its workforce by 2,000 to about 14,000. However the Toeging smelter, despite being supplied by hydro-electric power and using modern technology, could not be made competitive because its essential raw material, alumina, had to be trucked 600km through Germany, which was much more expensive than shipping the material to other smelters from Australia. Toeging's annual capacity is 90,000 tonnes but at present it is producing only 30,000 tonnes. The smelter, which as recently as 1989 employed 850 will be converted into a recycling plant with 100 employees. The Neuss smelters annual capacity is 210,000 tonnes but output is more than 10 per cent below that because VAW has joined in the round of global production cuts that followed the international trade agreement between some aluminium producing countries, signed in February in Brussels. Stade's capacity is 70,000 tonnes but it is operating at 10 per cent below that. VAW operates the Hamburg smelter, where Reynolds Metals of the US and Austria Metall own the other two thirds equally between them. Mr Wobbe said despite the recent sharp improvement in aluminium prices, VAW would continue to keep to the spirit of the February agreement and he felt other big producers would do the same. That suggested capacity would not be reactivated before the middle of next year. VAW also has a 20 per cent shareholding and is operator of the Alouette smelter in Quebec. Mr Wobbe said Quebec Hydro had given the partners an extension to March to make up their minds about taking up an option on low cost power and to more than double the smelters' capacity to 460,000 tonnes. Many of the partners were in favour of the expansion, which would cost USDollars 1bn and be completed by 1998. The project made excellent economic sense but VAW would not need extra metal as early as that and strategically his group would prefer to spend its capital on downstream operations closer to the ultimate consumer. Nevertheless, VAW was looking for ways to remain involved in the Alouette expansion, he said.</p>

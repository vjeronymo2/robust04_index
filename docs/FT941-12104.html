			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Emotion versus analysis - Midlands Pride Emotion went one way and commercial analysis another as Rover, the icon of West Midlands industry, slid into German hands yesterday. The change in ownership struck different chords throughout the region but nowhere was it a matter of indifference. The proportion of the regional workforce engaged in manufacturing remains higher than the national average. 'One in six jobs is dependent on the vehicles and vehicle components sector, and Rover is the largest single player in that,' said Mr Chris Tillett, economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountant. At its Longbridge car plant and at its Solihull Land-Rover and Range Rover plant, the group employs 22,000 out of its total workforce of 33,000. Also, Rover is spending Pounds 2bn a year on components. 'The group is heavily tied into local suppliers,' noted Mr Tillett. 'It is leading the West Midlands out of recession,' according to Mr John Gunn, director of the regional Confederation of British Industry. 'It has come to symbolise the recovery of West Midlands industry with its attention to quality and paying attention to what the customer wants.' Yet Rover's role as a source of jobs has diminished. Even after the convulsions in the group during the late 1970s and the early 1980s, it had, in 1984, a payroll of 96,000. Since Rover and its predecessor companies account for a large slice of Midlands industrial and social history, its future is a matter not just of economic interest but of emotional concern. Last Friday, at the annual banquet of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, mention of Rover's recovery in recent years drew the most animated response to any remark made in the speeches. Yesterday, after the announcement, Radio WM, the BBC's local radio station, was hit by an avalanche of calls. Mr Tony Butler, host of the station's morning show, said 30 calls had been broadcast. 'At least half the calls were anti-German and 85 to 90 per cent were against the sale.' Callers suggested a Land-Rover management buy-out would be better. 'There was a feeling British Aerospace had sold them short,' said Mr Butler. Chauvinism was at large, with evocations of the bombing of Longbridge. 'I understand the emotional reaction - it's one we can all share, but I see more upside potential than downside,' said Mr Bob Moore, chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. 'Anybody with red, white and blue in his heart will feel it's a pity,' said Mr Joe Gormezano, of Knibb, Gormezano, the motor industry consultant. 'But Rover is not viable on its own from a European point of view.'</p>

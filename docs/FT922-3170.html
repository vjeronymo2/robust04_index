			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: EC sees signs of hope in farm row RENEWED attempts by the European Community and US to secure a breakthrough in the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks are under way, on the basis of the so-called 'new ideas' brought into play following last month's reform of the Community's farm subsidies regime. Some Brussels officials detect a new willingness in Washington to settle the farm subsidies row, in anticipation of problems the US will have in winning an agreement on services and market access, the two other most troublesome areas of the Uruguay Round. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, will take up the talks when he comes to Brussels next week. Nevertheless, the EC and US remain stuck in apparently close but until now irreconcilable positions on farm subsidies. On the central US demand that the EC cut its volume of subsidised food exports by 24 per cent, Washington is immovable, a senior Commission official says. Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, is understood to have offered a 20 per cent cut, with 5 per cent swings within sectors, so that, for instance, in cereals, the EC could export more wheat if it exported less barley. But the most the US appears willing to accept is to extend the cuts - applicable pro rata to all products - over seven to eight years, instead of the six years stipulated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The US also wants to set in concrete the 15 per cent 'set-aside' (taking land out of production) in the EC's recent farm regime reform. This set-aside is the condition for farmers receiving compensation payments for big price cuts, and is one of two ways the Community intends to rein in overproduction. The US would allow these direct payments as non-trade distorting subsidies, officials say, provided overall domestic subsidy was cut by 20 per cent. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, has demanded that payments linked to production restraint should be totally exempt and open-ended. Senior officials say, however, that the the US is moving towards a big concession on the EC's demand for a so-called 'peace clause', whereby it would desist from unilateral trade sanctions such as the punitive tariffs it is now threatening on EC food exports. This, they say, would take the form of an undertaking to pursue future disputes through Gatt procedures - not the case in the current dispute sparked by the EC's oilseeds regime. The Irish agriculture minister, Mr Joe Walsh, yesterday called the US ambassador in Dublin to his office 'for clarification' over Washington's threat to impose punitive tariffs on a 'hitlist' of Dollars 2bn of EC food exports, if the EC does not reform its oilseed subsidy regime, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. More than 10 per cent of the penalties would fall on Irish exports, a highly disproportionate amount given Ireland's small contribution to EC oilseed production and given that its population is just 1 per cent of the EC. Meanwhile, Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner (right), said the US would suffer much more in a trade war with the EC as it had a trade surplus with Europe. 'The US and EC should look for peace in international trade and not trade wars,' he added. The punitive tariffs would be particularly damaging for Ireland's dairy processing industry, and for specialised liqueurs, using cream, which feature prominently on the 'hitlist'.</p>

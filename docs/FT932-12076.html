			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / IG Metall prepares for show of power IG METALL, Germany's most powerful union, yesterday announced it would begin indefinite strikes in selected enterprises throughout eastern Germany in support of higher pay. The strikes, which will involve over 28,400 workers at 50 steel and engineering enterprises, will mark a watershed in eastern Germany's turbulent history: it is the first time for more than 60 years that the region's workers have officially called a strike. The strikes, scheduled to start on Monday, will affect the steel industry throughout eastern Germany, and the metal and electrical sectors in the northern shipbuilding state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, and the heavy industry eastern state of Saxony. They are aimed at putting pressure on the employers to uphold a contract signed between the employers, east German managers, and IG Metall in March 1991. The contract was designed to equalise eastern and western German wages from April of next year. Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, and Arbeitgeberverband, the steel employers' association, pulled out of the contract for economic reasons. Officials said they could not pay wage increases of over 20 per cent for both sectors because of the recession in western and eastern Germany. Instead, they recommended pay increases of 9 per cent. Wages in eastern Germany are about 70 per cent of western German levels. The cancelled pay increases would have brought them up to about 80 per cent of their western counterparts. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's president, said if the employers continued to refuse to reinstate the contract, additional ballots would be held among the metal and electrical sectors in the three remaining states of Berlin-Brandenburg, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt. Employers are still hoping that talks today with IG Metall in the metal and electrical sector in Thuringia might break the deadlock. Meanwhile, in west Germany, the fate of the Krupp steel plant at Duisburg-Rheinhausen was sealed when the supervisory board of Krupp Stahl gave the go-ahead for the closure of the plant that will see some 2,100 workers lose their jobs. At the same time, some 100,000 miners demonstrated in nearby Bochum for the maintenance of state subsidies for the industry. They heckled and whistled at Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, when he promised state support for continuing coal production of at least 50m tonnes for both steel and electricity generation. There were indications yesterday, however, that the Klockner-Hutte steelworks in Bremen, the main plant in the Klockner-Werke group, may be reprieved with a substantial debt-relief package agreed with creditors.</p>

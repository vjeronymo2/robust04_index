Dr. Banda went to a Roman Catholic church to  commemorate those killed during the campaign for independence  from Britain. Dr. Banda, who is officially in his late 80s, but  widely believed to be much older, underwent brain surgery in  South Africa last year. He returned home in October and was  last seen in public on 1 January. Dr. Banda has ruled Malawi  for some 30 years and he is a candidate in the country's first  multiparty elections due to be held in May.</p>

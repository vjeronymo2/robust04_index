KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's correspondent talks to him.    [Gamov] Valeriy Dmitriyevich, what is your frame of mind as  you return to the judge's seat?    [Zorkin] I would like to sum up my feelings in one word --  hope. Hope that everything will gradually settle in such a way  that we can move forward along a lawful road, and not along the  path of 3-4 October.    [Gamov] Judge Viktor Luchin actively fought for your powers  to be reinstated, and he even declared a hunger strike. While  you made no effort at all in this direction. Why?    [Zorkin] That by no means signifies that I am incapable of  going on hunger strike. I swore an oath to be a judge, and in  my opinion I carried out my duty honestly. It seems to me that  society must find a means of defending a judge if he becomes the  object of injustice.    [Gamov] What kind of Zorkin is returning to the  Constitutional Court? Is he the same man he was in September  and October, or is he someone else?    [Zorkin] If you are talking about the principles of  compliance with constitutionality, then I am the very same  Zorkin that I always was. Although, of course, I have changed  in some ways. I, too, have learned certain lessons from  everything that has happened...    [Gamov] Do you intend to fight for a seat as chairman of the  Constitutional Court and again fill the niche of peacemaker?    [Zorkin] Everybody has to be a peacemaker, but not to the  extent of offering the other cheek when people are prepared to  slice off your head. In brief, the issue of the chairmanship  does not worry me in the least.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Calor surges to Pounds 27.6m as restructuring pays off CALOR GROUP, the liquefied petroleum gas distributor, more than doubled first-half pre-tax profits as the benefits of a two-year restructuring programme started to emerge. They rose to Pounds 27.6m from Pounds 11.5m last time, which included restructuring costs of Pounds 14.8m. 'A fair proportion of the restructuring is at last feeding its way through to the bottom line,' said Mr Hamish Macpherson, group treasurer. After allowing for the restructuring, profits were still 5 per cent ahead. Price cuts made to defend Calor's UK market share resulted in a drop in turnover to Pounds 152.8m from a previous Pounds 164.5m. Mild weather was experienced early in both years, and the same tonnage of gas was sold in both per-iods. Mr Macpherson described the results as 'satisfactory, considering we did not get the cold weather.' Five of the last six UK winters have been mild. Margins also suffered from a slight rise in the price of gas supplies and the weakening of sterling against the dollar. However, the company said its cost reduction programme had helped it to improve its competitive position against other fuel suppliers without materially affecting profits. The core gas business made operating profits of Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 31m). Total operating profit was Pounds 27.7m, up from Pounds 27m last time. Net interest paid was Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 700,000), partly because of lower rates, and partly because of lower borrowings. The latter reflected the low level of capital expenditure because of lack of growth in the domestic and commercial sectors. At the end of the half, gearing was zero and the group had net cash of Pounds 25.9m. Losses for the air separation business, which makes equipment for dispensing beer, were reduced to Pounds 1.6m from a previous Pounds 3.8m. The company said the division was making progress and had installed further systems 'with a high level of customer satisfaction.' The Pam Gas Central European venture with SHV, the Dutch investment company which owns 46.2 per cent of Calor's stock, and Primagaz, the French LPG distributor, was continuing profitably in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Earnings per share were up to 10.4p from 4.1p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 6p.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When relief is lost I have recently received a tax refund on account of my losses with Lloyd's of London. In addition to losing my personal allowance for the relevant years, I have also lost the business expansion scheme tax benefits on the ground that the BES is an allowance and not a relief. Is this right? And is there any way of recovering the allowance? Your BES relief is lost irretrievably, unfortunately. It is a pity that you did not (apparently) read the free Inland Revenue pamphlet on the BES, IR51, before deciding to make the investment. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador  to China said Friday [20 May] that the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) can inspect and measure spent fuel rods  from their nuclear reactor only after bilateral talks with the  United States are resumed.    Ambassador Chu Chang-chun told reporters the dialogue with  the U.S., which was suspended after two rounds last July, should  be continued if the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to  be resolved.    Technicians at North Korea's 5-megawatt Yongbyon  experimental  nuclear reactor began replacing spent fuel rods Saturday without  inspectors from the IAEA present, a move which violates the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and other agreements  between North Korea and the IAEA.    Three IAEA inspectors now at Yongbyon have not been allowed  to take samples or make tests on the spent rods, reports said.    "We will contain the spent fuel rods in a safe place and  display them before the inspectors. Then the inspectors can  verify that our nuclear materials have not been diverted to  nonpeaceful purposes," Chu said.    "This will be the inspection for the continuity of the  safeguards, this is to show the transparency of our nuclear  activities," he said.    "When the third round of talks between the DPRK (North  Korea)  and the U.S. are held and a package solution is realized, then  the agency (IAEA) can take the measurements at any time," he  added.    The Vienna-based IAEA has insisted that the spent rods must  be sorted and examined to see whether any spent fuel has been  diverted to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program.    Chu claimed that North Korea unilaterally suspended  withdrawal from the NPT last summer when talks with the U.S.  began and now has ''a special status'' within the treaty which  releases it from its NPT obligations.    ''We cannot allow the agency to conduct the routine and ad  hoc inspections because it is contrary to the special status of  our country,'' Chu said.    The ambassador blamed the U.S. for fabricating the North  Korean nuclear issue as a means to slander his country, while  demanding that the U.S. honor its commitment to provide  Pyongyang with a light-water nuclear reactor.    Chu also accused Japan of nuclear ambitions, while  continuing  to maintain that up to 1,000 nuclear devices are on the Korean  peninsula and they are all U.S.-made.    "That is why we insist that talks be held between the DPRK  and the U.S.," he said.    The 15-month-long dispute has become central to North Korean  relations with the U.S. as well as the eventual easing of  tension and possible reunification of the Korean peninsula.</p>

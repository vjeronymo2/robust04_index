			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Reshuffle should put Porth back into black FESTIVE CHEER is still eluding Porth Group, the Welsh-based company which is Britain's biggest producer of Christmas decorations. Porth has decided to close its main factory at Llwynpia, in Mid Glamorgan, and move its operations three miles away to Treorchy, alongside existing warehousing and distribution facilities. No jobs will be lost; the permanent workforce has already been cut by 55 to 156 in the current year. Porth, which came to the USM in 1989, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.34m last year, compared with Pounds 1.04m in 1990. The group said that, despite improved trading, it still expected to be in loss this year, particularly since there would be exceptional costs. Mr John Miller, chief executive, said: 'The outlook for 1993 is markedly improved following the move of the factory and, although an assumption has been made that consumer spending will not increase in 1993, a profit is expected.' Porth, which raised Pounds 978,000 from shareholders in the summer, has agreed funding arrangements for 1993 with its principal bankers, National Westminster, and said it did not intend to seek further funds next year for current operations. The Welsh Development Agency has agreed to refurbish the new factory at Treorchy and the Welsh Office is seeking to preserve jobs by granting Porth Pounds 500,000 over three years. Last year Porth appointed Sir Michael Edwardes, former head of British Leyland, as its non-executive chairman and raised Pounds 3.5m in a rights issue. The shares closed 1p higher at 5 3/4 p, giving the group a market capitalisation of about Pounds 1m, compared with its flotation value of Pounds 13.8m.</p>

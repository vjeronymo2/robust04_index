			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 06, BNS -- Lithuanian Energy Minister  Algimantas Stasiukynas once again denied accusations of allowing  to import and to use toxic fuel in Lithuania.    It is strange that lawmakers have no idea of who is  responsible for what and direct their interpolation "to the  wrong address," Stasiukynas said at a press conference Wednesday  [5 January].    The parliament's rightist opposition demands to take a vote  of confidence in the minister for allegedly allowing to burn  toxic fuel in boiler houses of several Lithuanian towns and  regions. The opposition said the step resulted in numerous  gas-poisoning cases.    Stasiukynas said Absorbent A-1, the toxic fuel used in some  areas, will be collected and stored in a special reservoir of  the Elektrenai thermal electric power station. The minister said  there are several ways to get rid of the fuel. Experts suggest  either to burn it at the Akmene cement factory and in  Elektrenai, or to take the absorbent out of the country.    The minister said poisonous substances are emitted only when  the fuel is burned in low temperatures. In theory, toxic  substances should also be emitted when the absorbent is burned  in high temperatures, but laboratory tests proved the opposite,  he said. Additional tests will reportedly be made in the West.    Stasiukynas said Tuesday that the fuel was unlawfully  imported by the Lithuania-USA company Lamaringas and sold to the  state-run company Siluma (Heat). The importer forged customs  documents, which indicated a different kind of fuel, he said.    The first warning signals came from the Environmental  Protection Department last May. Stasiukynas said his ministry  immediately began a search for places where the fuel was used.  All absorbent users were known by July-August and all  reservoirs containing the fuel were sealed. The minister said  the only incident occurred in the town of Kelme where some fuel  spilled through a leaky pipe.</p>

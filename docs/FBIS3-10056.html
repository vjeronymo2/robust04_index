			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, holds the  government responsible for the clashes that occurred early on  the morning of 26 February at Chapare, Cochabamba Department.    Nearly 15,000 Chapare coca growers staged a demonstration on  25 February, rejecting the compulsory eradication of their  plantations. This demonstration, which in the opinion of COB  Executive Secretary Oscar Salas was entirely legal, brought to  the region Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents who occupied  the site. A clash was the result early on the morning of 26  February.    [Begin Salas recording] Blood was shed during the violent  repression, and 18 fellow coca growers were injured. [end  recording]    While the COB asserts that 18 people were injured, some with  buckshot, the government reports that only three people were  injured: two of them coca growers and the third an Umopar  officer. The COB also asserts that 78 people had been arrested,  although they have now been released. The government, however,  asserts that only 60 people were arrested.    Despite the reigning tense calm, an agreement has been  reached with the government by which the coca growers ask not to  be confused with drug traffickers.    [Begin Salas recording] Their repressed fury was against the  coca growers instead of against drug traffickers. The other  point is that there must be an equivalence, that coca must be  replaced by other products. [end recording]    Salas categorically pointed out that no one can force  growers  to eradicate their coca plantations because the alternative  development programs are not being implemented. If the  government forces this measure, it would be removing their  livelihood.    It must also be said that the coca growers are unaware of  the  contents of the few alternative development programs, which  still remain on paper.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All numbers as received] </F>   [Text] Lagos, 20 Apr (PANA) -- Various types of drugs and  psychotropic substances, weighing 8,811.4874 kilogrammes and  with an estimated street value of 1.34 billion Naria (22 Naira;  one US dollar), were seized from 453 suspects arrested by  Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in 1993.  The NDLEA said in a statement made available in Lagos Wednesday  [20 April] that the figure did not include the massive haul of a  special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes imported from  Bangkok, Thailand. The drug was seized in December from  businessman Joe Brown Akubueze, who was jailed 25 years early in  1994 for the offence.    The statement said that the number of arrests in 1993 far  outstripped the figures from the previous years. It said  7461.744 kilogrammes of marijuana were seized while the  quantities for cocaine and heroin accounted were 1308.6697 and  39.2862 kilogrammes. The statement added that Murtala Muhammed  International Airport, Lagos, maintained its position as the  leading point of both seizures and arrests. It said the largest  drug haul was made in February when 2724.896 kilogrammes were  [seized], adding that this was followed by another seizure of  1647.2515 kilogrammes in October.</p>

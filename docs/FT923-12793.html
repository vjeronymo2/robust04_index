			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Italy's Efim may fold as board quits THE board of Efim, the debt-ridden Italian state industrial holding, resigned yesterday, foreshadowing an imminent winding-up of the entity. Efim, which controls more than 100 companies with activities ranging from aluminium, defence and transport to glass and health spas, has accumulated losses of more than L4,000bn (Pounds 1.8bn) and debts of L8,500bn against a turnover of L4,660bn. Its fate has been in the balance for a long time and earlier this year the public audit office called for the board to be replaced because of repeated losses. The holding was founded in 1947 to finance the development of private and public sector industry but has ended up as a hospital for loss-making businesses employing 37,000 people. The worst business is aluminium. Alumix, which accounts for a quarter of total debt, is the heaviest loss-maker; but other loss-makers include its glass division, Siv, with 30 per cent of Europe's automotive glass sales. Efim possesses good advanced technology and makes profits in its rolling stock and mass transit division (Breda). It also has important defence interests - via Oto Melara, and helicopters through Augusta. Although Augusta has 7 per cent of the market for civilian light helicopters and 5 per cent of the military in this field, the company is strapped for cash, has large stocks and owes L2,000bn to the banks.</p>

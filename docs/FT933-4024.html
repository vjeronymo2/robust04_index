			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Liquidity seeps into US property: The search for higher yields After three years of stagnation, liquidity is seeping back into the US commercial property market. The soaring prices - and falling yields - in equity and bond markets are driving some investors into property in search of higher returns. And with banks and insurance companies still weighed down by their property lending binge of the late-1980s, there is a big overhang of assets for sale. On Wednesday, the Quantum Realty Fund, a property investment vehicle set up by the financier George Soros, paid Dollars 634m (Pounds 419m) for a portfolio of troubled property assets from Travelers, the US insurance company. Even after the sale, Travelers has Dollars 4.3bn of underperforming commercial mortgage loans and properties acquired through loan foreclosures. Like other big insurers, including Prudential Insurance, it is still looking at ways of unloading properties in bulk. Selling underperforming assets allows the insurers to reinvest money in areas which offer a higher current return. Also, risk-based capital rules for insurers that are to come into force soon will make property investments less attractive: Mr Bob Crispin, Travelers' chief investment officer, estimates that property will attract a 10-15 per cent capital charge, compared with the 1-2 per cent charge on corporate bonds. Travelers reports strong interest from pension funds looking to acquire property assets. With pension funds increasing their involvement in sub-investment grade bonds, emerging stock markets and Latin American debt, it isn't surprising to see them returning to property as well. However, the decline in property prices has undermined the view of property as a stable asset offering a high rate of return. Some investment managers, believing the stock and bond rallies are sure to end soon, are building a bigger exposure to property: Morgan Stanley has taken its investment in property from almost nothing to 9 per cent in less than six months. The chance to earn yields of 8 per cent or more, when 10-year Treasury bond yields have fallen to 5.23 per cent, explains the move. One of the clearest indications of growing institutional interest has been the flow of new cash into real estate investment trusts (Reits). In the first six months, trusts raised Dollars 2.5bn, more than in the whole of 1992. Demand for Reits pushed up the property investment trust index run by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts by nearly 15 per cent in the first three months of the year, though a correction in the second quarter saw it fall back slightly. Even after this, the yield on property investment trusts had fallen to around 6 per cent - well below that on commercial properties traded in the private market. Other securitisations of property have picked up. Total sales of new commercial property-backed securities was running at around Dollars 1.5bn a month in the first six months of this year, up from Dollars 1bn a month last year. The Resolution Trust Corporation, established to take on and dispose of assets of troubled thrifts, accounted for only a quarter of these sales, compared with more than a half during 1992. Its shrinking involvement has left more room for private sector entities such as banks and insurers to dispose of assets. The yield premiums available on commercial mortgage-backed debt accounts for much of the demand. A 10-year, double-A rated bond currently trades at a yield of around 200 basis points (or two percentage points) above US Treasuries. The yield premium on a comparable good-quality corporate bond is only 70-80 basis points. The demand is likely to generate more commercial property-backed securities. The Quantum Fund plans to issue bonds to finance some Dollars 350m of its Travelers purchase, and may also put some of the assets into a Reit, which would then be floated. Prudential Insurance, which has hired Morgan Stanley to explore the attractions of a bulk sale of as much as Dollars 700m of its properties, is also considering shifting assets into a Reit. In spite of the increased activity, there is little to suggest that property values are heading up again. A commercial property market index run by consultants Frank Russell and the NCREIF, based on appraised market values, showed a total return of zero for the first six months of this year: the income generated by properties in the index was wiped out by further capital write-downs. This was at least an improvement after eight consecutive quarters in which the total return had been negative. Prices are likely to recover only when demand for vacant office, retail and industrial space falls and rental income picks up. That will happen when economic activity accelerates and companies take on more space to house growing workforces. Yet last week's disappointing US employment data for August offered little hope that America is returning to work yet.</p>

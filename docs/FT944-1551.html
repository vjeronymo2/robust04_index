			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Israel's markets tax to go ahead Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday said a controversial capital gains tax would go ahead on January 1 as planned. The statement put an end to a cabinet row over the proposed measure and settled more than a week of uncertainty. Mr Rabin made the announcement after meeting Mr Abraham Shochat, the finance minister, who spent last week fending off fierce criticism over the tax on stock market profits. Opponents maintained that imposition of the tax had caused a decline in public support for Mr Rabin's Labour party. Mr Rabin, however, said he was considering modifying the tax and would be listening to the investors in Israel's stock exchange. Under the present legislation, investors will have the option of paying varying rates depending on whether they want to deduct stock market losses. The option with deductions will be assessed at a 20 per cent rate on net profits and will require investors to file year-end tax reports. The option without deductions will be assessed at 10 per cent and will be deducted at source. Foreign investors living in countries which have a double-tax treaty with Israel, like most western European nations, will be exempt from paying the tax. Stock market analysts say the prospect of implementing the tax has been one factor depressing the stock market which has declined about 35 per cent in the past year. The market rallied briefly last week while Mr Rabin was abroad, but sentiment was quickly damped after the announcement and shares yesterday afternoon steadily shed their morning gains. The Mishtanim index, which had risen 3.25 per cent during the morning, was up by only 0.05 per cent shortly after the announcement.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Jersey row sparks call for change THE ROW between Britain and Jersey over the dismissal of one of the island's judges may lead to its assembly seeking some constitutional changes. Earlier this week Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, angered many islanders when he dismissed Mr Vernon Tomes as deputy bailiff, a post combining judicial functions with the deputy speakership of the island's parliament. The reason for dismissal was inefficiency in delivering legal judgments. Now moves are afoot to split the post's functions. That would not affect Jersey's distinctive financial regime or its status as an autonomous territory under the Crown.</p>

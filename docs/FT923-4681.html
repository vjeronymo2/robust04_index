			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Ukraine claims recovery MR Vitold Fokin, Ukrainian prime minister, yesterday claimed that the national economy has begun to pull out of its nose-dive, having grown by 0.5 per cent in the year to July. Such a stabilisation could be contrasted with the large declines in production plaguing other ex-communist countries in eastern Europe. Also, Mr Fokin announced Ukraine is seeking a stabilisation fund of between Dollars 6bn-Dollars 6.5bn from the International Monetary Fund, which the republic formally joined on Thursday. Ukrainian officials had said they would need Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn from the IMF to cushion Ukraine's planned currency, the hryvnia. In Washington, a Ukrainian delegation to the IMF, headed by Mr Hryhori Piatachenko, finance minister, was reported to have stuck to the lower figure. Mr Fokin claimed that, in July, production had increased by 0.5 per cent in comparison with July 1991. He added that, in the next day or two, he will unveil a new 'Action Plan for the Economy'. He said his programme would simultaneously cut taxes and the budget deficit, but made little mention of privatisation or other structural reforms.</p>

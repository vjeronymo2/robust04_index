			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAILING;  </P> <P> CARTER HAWLEY JOINS OUTSIDE BUYING FIRM;  </P> <P> BROADWAY'S PARENT TO SHUT DEVELOPMENT OFFICE  </P> <P> Carter Hawley Hale Stores, owner of the Broadway, said Thursday that it is  shutting down its New York product development office and will affiliate with  Associated Merchandising Corp., a big research and buying organization for  Dayton Hudson, Bloomingdale's, Harrod's in London and others.  </P> <P> About 25 of the 220 employees of Carter Hawley Hale Market Services will move  to AMC's offices on Aug. 1 and will work with AMC staff members to develop  private label products. Carter Hawley Hale already has a large commitment to  brands made exclusively for its five department store divisions under such  names as Neil Martin, C. C. Courtenay and Cassis.  </P> <P> The company said most of Market Services' merchandising employees will be  offered posts at department store divisions, while many of the 105 support  personnel will lose their jobs.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley Hale, which opened its independent product office with some  fanfare six years ago, said joining AMC will provide access to AMC's vast store  of market research and greater buying clout.  </P> <P> Philip M. Hawley, chairman and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based  company, said that the shift "isn't essentially an economic decision" and that  "the economics are close to a wash."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $3-Billion Client  </P> <P> Retail sources estimate the cost of running Market Services at $17 million a  year. Hawley said expenses for the first two years with AMC will probably  average $13 million to $14 million a year. In addition, Carter Hawley Hale will  have the costs of closing down the New York office and adding Market Services  workers to other divisions.  </P> <P> The addition of Carter Hawley Hale is a big boon for AMC, which through a  worldwide network of 26 offices represents groups of retailers in making  purchases from U.S. and foreign manufacturers. With Carter Hawley Hale, AMC  picks up about $3 billion in business.  </P> <P> Despite widespread turmoil and consolidation in retailing, AMC has managed to  boost its income by attracting mass merchandisers. Federated Department Stores,  owner of Bloomingdale's, pulled out of AMC's domestic operations and reportedly  is also considering dropping the organization as its overseas representative.  </P> <P> Hawley disputed the suggestion that Carter Hawley Hale's move to AMC would lead  to more of the "sameness" syndrome that has permeated retailing in recent  years. A frequent customer complaint is that department stores carry  merchandise that is too similar. Although most house brands tend to be  mainstream in styling, they do at least offer some distinction.  </P> <P> "Our private label strategy remains unchanged," he said, adding that the  company still plans for private labels to eventually account for 20% of overall  sales. House brands, which generally sell for less than comparable national  brands but are more profitable for the retailer, now account for about 17% of  volume.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley Hale has 35,000 employees and operates 113 department stores  under the names the Broadway, the Broadway-Southwest, Weinstock's, Emporium  Capwell and Thalhimers. Thalhimers, Emporium and H. Capwell were among the  founding members of AMC in 1916.  </P></p>

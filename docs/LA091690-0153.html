			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DISCUSSES WITH ALLIES NEW WAYS TO PUNISH IRAQ  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, encouraged by an international backlash against raids  by Iraqi troops on Western diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, said Saturday that  it is discussing with other countries new ways to punish the Baghdad regime for  its actions.  </P> <P> "We continue to consult with France and our other friends on further possible  steps to bring home to Iraq the costs of its aggression, including tightening  of the sanctions in all possible ways," the White House said in a statement.  </P> <P> Although White House spokesman Sean Walsh declined to elaborate, analysts said  the discussions are likely to include a proposal by French President Francois  Mitterrand to impose an air blockade against Iraq. Another possibility would  involve some form of sanctions against nations that help Iraq evade the  international embargo.  </P> <P> The White House statement came as the U.N. Security Council, at France's  request, prepared for an emergency session in response to the forcible entry of  Iraqi troops at the French, Canadian and Belgian embassy compounds on Friday  and at the Netherlands compound earlier last week.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. officials delivered to Iraq a videotape in which President Bush  offers his view of the Persian Gulf conflict to the Iraqi public.  </P> <P> The Administration also tried to resolve internal differences on the scope of a  proposed sale of U.S. arms, possibly worth as much as $23 billion, to Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> A planeload of 285 former U.S. and Canadian hostages arrived at  Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Among those aboard was a  25-year-old bank employee who was released after his mother sent a personal  plea to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> A flight carrying a second group of former hostages is scheduled to arrive at  the airport today.  </P> <P> White House officials, seeking to stress the international opposition to Iraq's  Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, strongly approved of France's decision to add 4,000  soldiers to the defense forces in the Persian Gulf and to evict from Paris  Iraq's military attaches and other Iraqi personnel.  </P> <P> "We welcome France's decision to contribute substantial additional forces,  including ground troops, to the international effort in the gulf," the White  House said in its statement. "This decision is further evidence of the  determined and unified international will to resist Iraq's blatant aggression  and violations of international law."  </P> <P> President Bush spent the day at his mountain retreat at Camp David, Md., where  he signed into law a bill authorizing an expansion of the nation's strategic  petroleum reserve to 1 billion barrels from its current cap of 750 million  barrels. The law allows the government to lease crude oil from producers and  keeps the reserve in operation for four more years.  </P> <P> One day after Iraqi troops in Kuwait forced their way into diplomatic compounds  of France, Canada and Belgium, a group of about eight diplomatic personnel  remained inside the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city without electricity and cut off  from outside supplies. State Department spokesman Mark Dillon said their  situation has not changed. Despite the continuing presence of Iraqi soldiers  outside, there was no word of any advances on the American compound, Dillon  said.  </P> <P> The Administration, meanwhile, was preparing to submit to Congress an  extraordinary list of weapons it wants to sell to Saudi Arabia, including F-15  fighter planes, tanks and other sophisticated arms to bolster the kingdom's  long-term security.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Walsh said the arms sale proposal is being worked on by a  task force of representatives from the Defense, State and Commerce departments  and had not yet been forwarded to the White House. "They would all have their  recommendations," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad delivered the President's  videotaped message to the Iraqi public to Iraq's undersecretary of foreign  affairs, Nizar Hamdun. Iraq has promised that it will allow the tape to be  broadcast on state-owned television, but the timing of the transmission is  unclear.  </P> <P> "The U.S. has announced that if it's not broadcast within five days, it will be  released to the media," said a spokesman for the State Department's Kuwaiti  Task Force.  </P> <P> The discussions involving further action against Iraq are expected to include a  possible air blockade to prevent goods from entering or leaving Iraq by plane  in violation of the international trade embargo. Both Libya and Yemen are  believed to have allowed such flights.  </P> <P> An air blockade "is being debated now," a senior Arab diplomat in Washington  told The Times last week. While acknowledging that such an escalation of the  trade embargo would involve potential dangers, the diplomat estimated that it  would be effective in 8 out of 10 cases because many pilots would refrain from  trying to evade an air blockade.  </P> <P> "Why? Because four of those eight won't go because they know perhaps it's  dangerous," he said. "And the other four, you can prohibit them in the airports  if you can identify them, say, in the airports."  </P> <P> The talk of tougher economic sanctions comes amid signs that the existing  sanctions have been taking a toll. There were reports Saturday that Iraqi  troops in Kuwait, short on food as a result of the embargo, have eaten many of  the animals in the Kuwaiti zoo.  </P> <P> The White House also applauded recent announcements by France, Canada, Belgium,  Italy and Britain that they will bolster their military forces in the Persian  Gulf with additional combat troops, fighter planes, tanks and ships.  </P> <P> Citing the latest French deployments, the White House statement declared: "We  consider such steps appropriate and justified in view of Iraq's continued  infringement of diplomatic conventions covering the presence of foreign  embassies in Kuwait."  </P></p>

Havel received Walesa in the Brozik Room of Prague Castle,  thus opening a series of bilateral talks at the highest level  between the leaders of the Visegrad countries (the Czech  Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary). At the same time a  series of bilateral meetings is taking place between U.S.  President Bill Clinton and the presidents of Hungary, Poland,  and Slovakia (Clinton talked to Havel yesterday.)    After meeting Havel, Walesa told journalists that he wanted  to consider, together with the other presidents of Central  European countries, how best they could serve their nations.    Poland is one of the most enthusiastic advocates of the  fastest possible integration of Central European countries into  NATO. In recent days the Polish press has also expressed  dissatisfaction with the way in which the Czechs organized the  Prague meetings.    President Walesa also told the independent Czech daily  LIDOVE  NOVINY that he was disappointed at the Czech Government's having  scheduled Clinton to meet each of the Visegrad heads separately  instead of there being a joint Visegrad meeting. The Czech side  had also insisted that a joint statement would not be made by  the Visegrad Four, he said. If the talks were not successful,  Walesa said, Poland would be "forced to say that it was the  fault of the organizers."    President Havel has made no statement on today's meeting  with  Walesa.</p>

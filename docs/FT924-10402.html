			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Food: A culinary oasis in a sea of drabness - Grand hotel / Coming soon, good food in Warsaw, hopes Giles MacDonogh WHEN YOU walk through Warsaw's small diplomatic market with Kurt Scheller, executive chef of the Hotel Bristol, you quickly realise what immense power a man in his position can wield. Everywhere hands reach out to offer foods otherwise unavailable in the Polish parts of the city. But Scheller looks deeply unimpressed as he strides through the stalls piled high with tins of caviar and dried mushrooms, occasionally stopping, only to turn up his nose at cream-coloured smoked salmon, a few eels, some uneven bundles of white asparagus, an undersized leg of lamb, or some poor Polish cheese. He, more than anyone, is aware of the problems of running a quality dining room to the east of the old Iron Curtain. The Bristol is closed for the time being; it was due to reopen tomorrow, but when I was there few of the hotel's staff thought they would meet the deadline. Now, I hear, it is to open in December. Now franchised to Lord Forte, the Bristol was Warsaw's smartest hotel before the last war and had the good fortune to survive the destruction of 78 per cent of the city by the Germans by virtue of the fact that it was their military HQ. After the war it was run by the state hotel chain, Orbis. Predictably, standards dwindled and nothing was done to make the place suitable for international visitors. Forte's first move was to gut the hotel so that bathrooms could be installed in all rooms. Some of the old interiors will then be put back to please the local equivalent of the Ministry for National Heritage. Had the Bristol been in Western Europe, Scheller might be the happiest of chefs, seeing his dream rise about him. With a team of 50 (10 of them non-Poles), Scheller will have a smart cafe complete with pavement terrace; an upmarket Italian restaurant; and a main dining room serving 'new Polish cooking' to play with. And this does not include the usual panoply of banqueting rooms. Scheller's vision is troubled, however, by problems with the supply chain: can he rely on Poland for raw materials or must he import everything from the west? Scheller's experiences had not been without their comic side. He told me a story about a roguish farmer who brought him a chicken which, he said, was the best in Poland. Scheller cooked the super chicken for four hours, but the beast was still unbearably tough. The next time the chicken farmer turned up Scheller kicked him out. Others brought him ducks the size of geese covered with impenetrable layers of fat. In the main, the rivers, lakes and ponds were so polluted as to render the pike, carp and zander untrustworthy. The hanging of meat had disappeared under communism and, although beef was cheap and plentiful; the meat was impossibly tough. One glimmer of light had come from an unlikely source: a fellow Swiss who for one reason or other had come to Poland to farm. Here he was producing eggs, milk, cream and cheese as well as fruit by ecological methods. Scheller had signed a contract to take all the small farm's produce but it fell well short of his requirements. Meantime, the farmers in the three villages closest to the Swiss had been impressed by the prices fetched by his produce and had asked him to act as a consultant. The result is that all three villages are now supplying Scheller with the best dairy produce. Scheller has also been having second thoughts about the 'new Polish cuisine' he had intended for his main dining room. Some ideas lent themselves to adaptation: the traditional stuffed carp could be rendered as an aspic with carp and pickled vegetables. Others were simply too rustic to please the businessmen most likely to use the restaurant. Regional recipes had proved very hard to come by. Poland's shifting borders after the second world war had made a nonsense of Polish provincial cookery. The few remaining practicioners of Pomeranian, Silesian or East Prussian cookery were more likely to be across the borders in Germany; huge population transfers had dealt a fatal blow to local folklore; the departure of the nobility had meant that the secrets of the great aristocratic kitchens were lost to the modern Poles. Where they could be traced from old manuals they proved essentially derived from France anyhow. Kurt Scheller is an intelligent and hard working man and I feel certain that he will get it right on the day. In the run up to the launch, however, my heart goes out to him in his kitchen: it cannot be an easy job injecting a feeling for quality into a people starved of such considerations for more than 50 years. It will take a long time before Poland becomes the pleasant place it must have been before the war. Until then, it is likely that the Bristol will remain an isolated instance of excellence among the omnipresent drabness.

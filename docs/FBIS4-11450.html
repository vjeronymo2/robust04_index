			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Armed Forces have said they will remain  subordinate to civilian power when the new government that was  elected on 24 April takes office.    Defense Minister General Humberto Corado stressed the role  that the military has played in the country's institutional  life, especially in the 1980's. He said the military has always  supported past governments and now is no exception, because the  military has always believed the country needs stability and  calm to progress.    The armed institution is "subordinate, obedient, and  nondeliberative," stressed Corado. The defense minister stated  this yesterday morning shortly before casting his vote at the  Central American pavilion at the International Fairground.    He indicated that the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation] must give up the conspiratorial, clandestine, and  subversive methods it used in the past. "The FMLN must accept  the democratic rules of the game and act like any other  political party."    According to Gen. Corado, "The FMLN has to act according to  the times in which it is living, make proper use of the mandate  the people gave to its deputies in the Legislative Assembly, and  forget the negative methods of the past."    He also urged the FMLN deputies to act "like real fathers of  the fatherland and representatives of the society which placed  its trust in them, so the balance in the Legislative Assembly  will be beneficial."    Making his appeal to the losing party, he said any political  organization that participates in elections must be ready to win  or lose: "If it wins, it must govern and legislate, and if it  loses, it must accept the people's will and prepare for the next  elections."

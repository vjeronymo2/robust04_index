			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Arab hijacks Dutch aircraft AN Arabic-speaking man claiming to have a bomb hijacked a Dutch aircraft with 138 people aboard yesterday. He forced it to land in Dusseldorf and demanded to be flown to New York, AP reports from Dusseldorf. It was not clear whether the man was armed. He was said to have demanded the US free a blind Islamic cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, linked to the bombing of New York's World Trade Centre. All passengers and four of the seven crew members were released as the KLM aircraft, which had been en route to Amsterdam from Tunis, Tunisia, sat on the tarmac at Rhein-Ruhr Airport. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-400, has a range of 3,800 km and would thus have to make an intermediate refuelling stop to reach New York. It would first, however, require refuelling in Dusseldorf. Shortly before 1300 GMT yesterday, the hijacker gave the aircraft's captain a note in English saying he would blow up the aircraft if it were not flown to New York, according to KLM in Amsterdam. The aircraft landed in Dusseldorf half an hour later. By 1530 GMT all but three of the crew members - the pilot, a co-pilot and a steward - had been freed, the airport official said. Authorities said no one had been hurt. The hijacker was demanding that the aircraft, which was surrounded by security forces and parked in front of a hangar, be refuelled. Police were negotiating with the hijacker by radio.</p>

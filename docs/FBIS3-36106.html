			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 22 for 2 </F> February 1994; by Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and  Vladimir Shishlin; edited by Boris Grishchenko]    [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur admits that the  Tiraspol leaders could organize various provocations, including  armed ones, which could lead to bloodshed. This was said in the  address to the heads of state and governments of Russia,  Ukraine, and Romania (the members of the quadrilateral group on  a peaceful settlement of conflicts in Transdniester) and to UN  Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali published on Wednesday.    Snegur pointed out that the socio/political situation in the  Moldovan left-bank regions had significantly deteriorated. The  leadership of the Transdniestrian anti-constitutional bodies  continues to hamper possible settlement of this conflict  regardless of the efforts to resolve the conflict by peaceful  political means displayed by Moldova, the Moldovan president  said.    According to the Moldovan leadership, the main goal of the  Transdniestrian leaders is to prevent the inhabitants of  Moldova's left-bank regions from participating in the early  parliamentary elections in Moldova, planned for February 27.    Snegur addressed the Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian, and UN  leaders with a demand to use all their authority and other means  in order to influence the Tiraspol anti-constitutional bodies  and to create conditions necessary for normal preparations for  parliamentary elections. According to the Moldovan president,  this could be a move forward toward a final settlement of the  conflict in Transdniester.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Orfanidou: "Triple Score on Heroin"] </F>   [Text] Alexandroupolis -- The smugglers figured that the  customs officials would be preoccupied with the TV broadcast of  the "Olympiakos" [team] basketball game. But they lost their  nerve when they saw the officials at their posts. A few minutes  later the customs officials discovered 121 kilograms of heroin  concealed inside the walls of their mobile home.    Giorgen Mery, 31, a cosmetics merchant, and his 36-year-old  wife, Anette Duna, confessed that they purchased the heroin in  the Turkish town Yialova and planned to take it to London and  sell it for 100,000 D.M. (approximately 38 million drachmas)  [over $158,000].    This is the largest quantity of heroin discovered in Greece  and the authorities believe that they have dealt a heavy blow to  the circuit which moves heroin from Turkey to Europe.    Those arrested also confessed that in previous years they  had  transported large quantities of heroin from Turkey to Europe  using the Smyrna-Brndizi ferry boat.    This time they used their mobile home which they had  remodeled with the help of Turkish drug dealers. But this first  transfer by land failed because their information regarding the  inadequate policing of the Kipoi customs post proved false.  <H5>  A Large Circuit </H5>   Stavros Tzioras, director of the Kipoi customs post said  that  a large circuit of European and Turkish drug dealers is behind  the arrested couple, and that after this blow they will think  twice before they try again to pass narcotics through Evros.    Late in the afternoon the couple was taken to the public  prosecutor. The customs officials estimate that the value of the  heroin exceeds 2.5 billion drachmas, but with additives this  quantity is increased threefold for the street market and the  value increases proportionately.    --Two construction workers, refugees from Kazakhstan,  arrested yesterday in Drama, had in their possession seven  kilograms of hashish. They are Nikos Motkalidis, 36, and Rafik  Toulkerogli, 34, who were arrested following surveillance. Today  they were to be sent to the public prosecutor.</p>

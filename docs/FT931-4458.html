			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Kenya devalues official rate: Move to win back aid from foreign donors THE Kenya government intensified its economic reform drive yesterday devaluing its official exchange rate in a bid to win back foreign aid from donors who meet in London next week. The central bank announced a 20 per cent devaluation of the official rate - used solely for government imports and servicing public and publicly guaranteed debt - from 36.4 to 45.6 shillings to the US dollar. The commercial rate of exchange, set by the banking sector for all other trade, is hovering around Sh60 to the dollar. The move is a further concession to the International Monetary Fund and removes an obstacle to speedy resumption of crucial quick disbursing aid worth up to Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) a month, suspended in 1991 because of economic mismanagement. The IMF left Kenya last weekend without agreeing a provisional deal which could lead to the resumption of the frozen aid. The Fund was reported to have insisted on a staggered merging of the official and commercial exchange rates before giving its stamp of approval to the government's reform programme. Money supply grew last year 35 per cent and inflation is between 40 and 60 per cent. After months of delay the government embarked on a serious programme of reforms in mid-February. It floated the currency for commercial transactions, announced tighter expenditure controls and took steps to restart the liberal-isation of the agricultural sector. Next Monday the World Bank will chair an informal donors' meeting in London to review the recent measures and discuss the possibility of resuming the suspended aid. Among proposals to be discussed is the rapid unblocking of a World Bank export promotion loan worth Dollars 150m in World Bank and bilateral funds.</p>

He pointed out:  Thanks to the management work in the previous two stages, we  have dealt blows at a large number of local ruffians and  despots. Social order in our rural area has been considerably  improved, the masses have a stronger sense of safety and a  healthy atmosphere prevails while the unhealthy one has been  checked. However, to ensure a long-term peaceful environment,  we still face strenuous work in the future. Therefore, during  the stage of consolidating and imposing restrictions, which  starts in April, various specific measures for comprehensive  management must be fully implemented in grass-roots units.    Wu Xiangdong, member of the provincial party committee  standing committee and secretary of the political and judicial  commission under the provincial party committee, made specific  arrangements for the work in the next stage. He urged the  continued strengthening of leadership and establishing and  improving various responsibility systems for the management of  public order. He also urged directly linking the work of  comprehensive management of social order with the assessment of  work achievement, and with rewards and penalties, so that party  and government leaders at all levels, and various political and  judicial departments, will enhance their sense of political  responsibility for protecting local safety.    At the meeting, Comrade Wu Xiangdong also stressed: To  manage social order in rural areas well, it is necessary to  strengthen the building of grass roots units and consolidate  fundamental work at that level. Fourteen prefectures,  autonomous prefectures, and counties passed on their experiences  at the meeting, including Changsha, Yueyang, Shaoyang, Lingling,  Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, Changde, and others.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Signs that confidence is recovering - London The stock market is trying hard to revert to its traditional role as a measure of performance of Great Britain plc, but the process is not proving easy. Bond markets, both in Europe and the US, are still capable of throwing UK equities back on their heels and are likely to present fresh challenges this week. The problem appears to be one of general nervousness rather than simply of interest rate prospects, or what the Bundesbank or the Federal Reserve may or may not do. For equities, the warning is that any tremor in the bond markets can still wipe out the fragile recovery of confidence in the stock market. But there are clear signs that confidence is recovering as the flow of company results and, more importantly, of dividend statements, indicates that economic recovery is making itself felt. There have been increased dividends from the banking sector, and from Glaxo and HSBC, two of the biggest companies in the market. Last week's high-flyer, in terms of trading volume and share performance, was BTR, another dividend-boosted stock. NatWest Securities, noting that since last April, the gross dividend base of the market has risen by 5 per cent, is lifting its own dividend growth forecast to 7 per cent for 1994, which, it calculates, represents a real increase of around 4 per cent. Significantly, NatWest now predicts a switch away from the consumer sector as the likely engine of economic recovery, preferring the diversified manufacturing stocks; consumer-oriented sectors are still suffering a flow of downgradings in profit forecasts. Forecasts for earnings growth in the retail sector are, significantly, only around 13 per cent for this year, compared with about 16 per cent for the market as a whole. The likely impact next month of the Budget changes in taxation, the less confident view on domestic interest rates and the generally lacklustre image of some retail group managements, have combined to cast a cloud over the sector. Dixons and Burton both have fallen out of favour in the market and are now seen in some quarters as yesterday's stocks. Dixons, having pleased the stock market and nation's high streets alike with its aggressive marketing of electronic goods, has never quite recovered after a disappointing statement on Christmas trading. Now the spotlight has turned on the implications of the OFT investigation into warranties. Burton is regarded as a victim of its policy of discounting at its Multiples chains, which are believed to have weakened brand names. A similar cloud has fallen over the commercial property sector, where anticipation, at least on the part of some investors, continues to outrun performance. Confidence in a long-awaited recovery in office property in the City of London has been jolted by the first of the December results statements. For the near term, the focus will be on prospects in European property, with Brixton Estates and Hammerson reporting soon.</p>

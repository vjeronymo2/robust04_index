			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Repsol ahead at Pta79.85bn Repsol, the main Spanish oil group, reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year to Pta79.85bn (Dollars 614m) compared with Pta65.61bn at the same stage last year. The company, in which the state holds just over 40 per cent, said the improvement reflected the first signs of recovery from Spain's 1993 recession, with a recent increase in fuel consumption. It had been achieved against a background of lower crude oil prices, especially in the first quarter, and in spite of tighter refining margins in the second quarter, Repsol said. Net profits after deduction of minority interests rose by a similar margin to Pta49.68bn from Pta43.16bn, on revenue about 9 per cent higher at Pta1,151.37bn. Operating results were 20 per cent up at Pta88.41bn, while net cash flow was 16.5 per cent higher than last year at Pta107.39bn. However, the fall in crude prices brought a sharp drop in operating profits from exploration and production, which fell 47 per cent to Pta7.36bn. The average price per barrel produced by the group during the six-month period was Dollars 15.10, compared with Dollars 17.10 in the same period last year. This was offset by a recovery in chemical activities, which showed operating profits of Pta5.31bn following a loss of Pta4.58bn in the first half of 1993. Repsol said this reflected higher margins for basic and intermediate products, cost-cutting and improved competitiveness following the trip devaluation of the peseta in 1992-93. Operating profits in refining and marketing rose by almost 13 per cent, and in the gas sector by almost 22 per cent. The company recently reached agreement with BP to purchase 90 service stations in south-west France.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Dining on disappointment - Nicholas Lander on why meals in hotel dining rooms may fail to please THE NEWS that Bruno Loubet, the talented chef at the Four Seasons Hotel, Hyde Park, London is to leave at the end of this month only confirmed one of the London restaurant trade's most widespread rumours. Loubet, it is now suggested, will be opening a large brasserie somewhere in the West End early next year. This follows a fashion set by some of the top chefs and restaurateurs in Paris who are fighting the recession with lower-priced restaurants: two-star Michelin chef Michel Rostang owns Bistro d' a Cote, his counterpart, Jacques Cagna, owns Rotisserie d'en Face while Claude Terrail, proprietor of the three-star Tour d'Argent, presides over La Rotisserie du Beaujolais. But Loubet's departure from the world of Michelin-starred restaurants and the grand hotel dining room, however temporary, may be a result of something more significant. Loubet was brought to London four years ago by the hotel's general manager, Ramon Pajares, in what was considered a stroke of entrepreneurial genius. In the mid-1980s hotels and restaurants were flourishing and hotel concierges were often pleading for restaurant tables on their guests' behalf. The solution seemed to be to upgrade hotel restaurants, in many cases neglected for the past 20 years, and entice hotel guests to eat in. New chefs were hired, small fortunes were spent on kitchen and restaurant redesign and hundreds of press releases were despatched. I believed it would be successful: the hotels seemed to have found a winning formula and could, given the income generated by their rooms and banqueting operations, more than match restaurants on price. However, the whole venture has proved a costly mistake. They were not helped by the timing. Just as the enterprise was given its final polish the Gulf War broke out, business and tourist travel declined and recession set in. Also with one or two exceptions, hotel dining rooms have failed to deliver. The vacant tables at lunch and dinner have also reflected a poor product mix, poor marketing and an inadequate understanding of what the general public is looking for. Over the last six months many restaurants have shown that careful pricing can fill their tables and leave the hotel dining rooms empty. I have eaten in and and been disappointed by a depressingly long list of hotel dining rooms this year: The Connaught, The Lanesborough, The Grosvenor House, The Langham Hilton, The Dorchester, and The Halkin. Criticisms include: a main course risotto that was served lukewarm, an unexciting series of dishes that made up a meal that cost Pounds 210 for three, a Chinese meal that looked good but tasted bland and another that, mistakenly, masked the flavour of ingredients with cream. One hotel dining room was chilly, even in late June, and our conversation was hampered by a perpetual piano player and a mini-waterfall. There are some standard reasons given for these disappointments: the manager of a 300-bedroom hotel does not necessarily have the requisite skills to run a 50-seater restaurant; hotel dining rooms, often serving four different meals a day, are nearly always impersonal, particularly if they do not have a separate entrance, and therefore identity, from the hotel; and restaurant wine lists can be outrageously expensive. London's hotel managers have courted big name chefs but neglected to staff the front-of-house with people of the same calibre or personality. They have failed to promote enough women to positions of importance in their dining rooms, so perpetuating an often supercilious attitude, particularly towards the female diner. Their biggest omission has been in marketing, in spite of the constant stream of press releases and invitations. Four years ago, instead of joining to promote eating in London's hotel dining rooms, the hotels decided to fight each other as well as the restaurants. There was no generic advertising or marketing campaign, although the funds must surely have been available. A few hotels did create their own dining card with discounts for frequent diners but they never launched a 'hotel dine around card' that could have tempted non-residents to cross the lobby. London's hotel managers have let slip a golden opportunity. The dining rooms of our big hotels should be a shop window for the hotels themselves and stiff competition for the best of our restaurants. But at the moment there is no contest.</p>

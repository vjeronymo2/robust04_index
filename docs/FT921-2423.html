			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (44): Laing uses the right tools for the job - Consultant's Critique LAING Homes is a good example of using the correct systems to achieve its business goals. The central problem for housebuilders is to match demand and supply as accurately as possible. Building houses involves long lead times so Laing Homes needs to have as much information as possible. Its approach has been sensible and it has chosen tools which are scaleable in size and performance. Laing also combined tools such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Oracle to take advantage of the strengths of each. Oracle is used for the central data storage and manipulation. This is its major strength. Lotus is then used for preparing reports in tabular and graphic form. The monthly report sent to senior management is clear and informative with creative use of shading in tables to highlight key pieces of data. The graphs were uncluttered and enhanced the raw information by showing trends. There is a marked contrast between this study and that of Willis Corroon, (see page 8). Laing Homes have used the correct tools for the job. A report takes only a few minutes to prepare and is accessible by non-computer personnel. Timely information is crucial to most businesses, but it needs to be in a digestible form. The use of graphs makes the sales figures comprehensible at a glance. Too few corporate reports use graphs for anything more than decoration. I was pleased to see that Laing's graphs were integral to the report, rather than tacked on as an afterthought. With Laing Homes moving away from the previous strategy of maintaining a warehouse as a stock buffer, it is essential that it maintains cost-control over its suppliers. While the building industry is not yet up to 'Just In Time' techniques, the recession has made suppliers very aware of the need for quality service. The logical next step at Laing will be to implement a cut-down materials and resource planning function to streamline its house building still further. I have every confidence that the IT staff will choose and install the correct tools to achieve this. In a tough market, only the wise (or the very lucky) survive. Laing Homes has been around for a long time and appears to have the information technology infrastructure to keep it alive for some time yet.</p>

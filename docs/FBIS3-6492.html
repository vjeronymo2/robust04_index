Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for diplomatic  and security affairs, pointed out today that progress in the  North Korean nuclear issue up to now has been very  unsatisfactory and the possibility of this issue being turned  over to the UN Security Council is highly likely. He noted that  the government is being forced to basically reexamine its  previous policies, thus expressing serious concern over this  situation.    However, Senior Secretary Chong Chong-uk said that the  governments of the ROK and the United States are making  last-stage efforts in various ways to make North Korea fulfill  the agreement reached between the United States and North Korea,  including sincere acceptance of inspection and the exchange of  North-South special envoys. He noted that he has not discarded  the hope for a peaceful solution to the problem.    Senior Secretary Chong Chong-uk revealed that the government  will finalize its position after watching the special meeting of  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors  slated for 21 March and a North-South working-level contact  slated for 19 March. He pointed out that in the event that the  special Board of Governors meeting concludes that the nuclear  inspection ended in failure and that no progress is made in the  issue of exchanging special envoys, resumption of the Team  Spirit exercise and introduction of Patriot missiles will be  inevitable.</p>

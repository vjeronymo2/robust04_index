			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Fat skis send you flying - Arnie Wilson on how a new type of ski allows almost anyone to go heli-skiing Painting by numbers may not have produced many Rembrandts but it gives pleasure to many would-be artists who might otherwise have difficulty painting a shed. And Bach might be turning in his grave at modern keyboards that play themselves, but they bring the excitement of making music to uninitiated. And now we have 'fat boys', which allow mediocre skiers to join the hitherto elite and become heli-skiers - skiers who ride like Vietnam 'grunts' to virgin snow in a clattering helicopter, there to ski in bottomless powder where few have skied before. So how, in the time it takes to don a powder suit in a telephone box, can Average Skier become Super Skier? Fat skis are the answer. They have sparked the off-piste revolution and this winter, have taken a grip on heli-skiing. The 'fat' ski was developed by ski manufacturer Atomic, based on a prototype designed by a former Austrian train driver who had the idea of sawing a snowboard in half. The original, the Atomic Powder Plus, was quickly imitated by virtually all the main ski manufacturers. The usual length is either 165cms or 185cms and because the ski is almost twice as wide as a conventional ski it floats on the surface of powder rather than burrowing deeply into it. They can bought or rented in most main ski areas, but not in huge numbers as they are only really designed for off-piste use. So today, middle-aged intermediates who would have had a terrible struggle to ski powder can now sign up for a week's helicopter skiing knowing that the fat skis will be their passport to success. The only barrier to heli-skiing now is cash, not skill. But the question remains: is it right and proper that the rank and file should be allowed to use this new equipment to penetrate the mystique of the true artist or athlete? Inevitably, those with a passion for the real thing might resent 'skills' acquired so cheaply. Those skilful enough to heli-ski on ordinary skis tend to resent the fact that their precious world - not to mention their sacred powder - is being invaded by lesser beings. Helicopter skiing is frowned upon in many parts of Europe, where environmentalists have successfully managed to have it banned in most of Austria and France. This leaves Switzerland as Europe's heli-skiing mecca, with Italy another option. The French get round the ban by transporting clients across the border into Italy, where heli-skiing is permitted, and flying them to peaks from which they can ski either in Italy or back into France. Helicopters are allowed to collect skiers on French terrain at the end of the day from the bottom of the mountain but not to take them to the top. Grindelwald offers some of the best heli-skiing in the world, with huge 7,000ft vertical descents from such spots as Sustenalp and Rosenegg just across the Eiger/Munch/Jungfrau massif. There is good heli-skiing in New Zealand, the Himalayas and parts of what was the Soviet Union, but North America - especially Canada - with its vast wilderness areas, is where the sport of heli-skiing has become a fully-fledged industry. Resorts such as Sun Valley, Jackson Hole, Telluride, Whistler and Panorama offer daily heli-ski outings, but if you want the 'total experience' you should look at the option of spending a whole week in a heli-skiing lodge in British Columbia where you live, breathe and dream helicopter skiing. It is not cheap, but it is undoubtedly the best. Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH) runs lodges in nine areas, including the celebrated Bugaboos, Cariboos, and Monashees. If you are reluctant to be 'incarcerated' - however cosily and luxuriously - in a wilderness lodge for a week, you have the option of basing yourself in town: CMH offers excellent heli-skiing out of Revelstoke. Its only serious rival is Mike Wiegele, whose operation is based in just one location at Blue River but covers an enormous amount of terrain. While CMH is the brand leader, both organisations are extremely professional and the overall experience is similar. Fat skis now dominate Canadian heli-skiing. Even most of the guides use them. Skilled powder skiers determined not to pander to such toys can use conventional skis, but the fat skis make it so much easier and less energetic that they can find themselves being left behind by the fat brigade.

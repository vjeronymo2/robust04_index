			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries move higher on refunding announcement US TREASURIES wavered yesterday afternoon following the Treasury's refunding announcement. The 30-year bond initially lost ground after the Treasury said it would offer Dollars 15bn in three-year notes, Dollars 11bn in 10-year notes and Dollars 10bn in long-bonds next week. But the long bond later recovered as the market reacted favourably to the Treasury's decision to keep the proportion of long bonds stable to the rest of the issues in the quarterly refunding sale. The details of the refunding were essentially in line with market expectations. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted  3/16 higher at 103, yielding 7.73 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market and Fed funds traded at 4 per cent in the afternoon. The Fed's perceived target for the rate is 4 per cent. STRONG demand for medium and long-dated UK government bonds lifted gilt prices and helped the Bank of England sell all three of its tap issues yesterday. The three tap stocks - Pounds 150m of the 9 1/2 per cent Treasury loan due 1999, Pounds 150m of the 12 1/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1999, and Pounds 250m of the 9 1/2 per cent Conversion stock due 2005 - sold out on the first day of issue. Traders said there has been considerable pent-up demand for these maturities, and there is some speculation the Bank may take advantage of the current bullishness in the gilts market to announce further tap issues soon. Volume in the futures market was relatively high at about 40,000 contracts. Gains at the short end of the curve were limited, as traders said the recent wage settlement for German steelworkers had dashed hopes of a cut in German interest rates and therefore reduced the chances of lower UK interest rates. However, at the long end, the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt rose from 116 7/32 to 116 3/8 by late afternoon. FRENCH government bond prices fell as worries about the domestic political situation and the likelihood of German interest rates remaining high, prompted some switching out of the market. The minority Socialist government continues to face criticism following the admission to hospital of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Mr George Habash. Traders said some investors used this as an excuse for a sell-off. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the March bond futures contract closed at 108.10, down 0.22 from Tuesday. Elsewhere, German government bonds ended slightly lower on the day as worries about wage settlements continued to trouble the market. Some traders said the sharp jump in unemployment figures for eastern Germany, released yesterday, could have a moderating effect on the current wage talks. The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from 88.03 to 87.88 by late afternoon. JAPANESE government bond prices dropped on concern about the recent rise in short-term interest rates and worries about possible new supply in the market. The JGB market started the day on a strong note, following Tuesday's firmness in the US Treasury bond market. Concern over the rise in short-term interest rates in recent days prompted some profit-taking. Rates on three-month certificates of deposit have crept up to 5.2 per cent, having fallen as low as 4.95 per cent last month, wiping out hopes of an imminent cut in the Official Discount Rate.</p>

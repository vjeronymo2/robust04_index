			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Profits plummet at Thai Air Net profit for Thai Airways International (Thai) fell 67 per cent in the year to September, dropping to Bt1.02bn (Dollars 40.2m) from Bt3.07bn in 1992, the company announced yesterday. Thai, partially privatised and listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand last year, acknowledged that results were below budget - only last month it predicted net profit of about Bt1.9bn - but described them as 'satisfactory' in the light of the global recession. Thai's regional flights in Asia are profitable, but intercontinental and domestic services have performed poorly. Operating revenue, boosted by an improvement in the tourist trade, rose 6.5 per cent to Bt58.58bn but operating expenses were up 7.3 per cent to Bt53.95bn, pushing operating profit down 2.6 per cent to Bt4.63bn; unexplained 'other expenses' reduced pre-tax profit 68 per cent to Bt1.38bn. Thai's shares have performed poorly since the privatisation and are only now approaching the initial public offering price of Bt60. The airline planned to complete a reform of its accounting system by next month with the help of KPMG Peat Marwick Suthee to produce an accounting format more familiar to foreign investors. 'This is considered essential as Thai still needs more funding from overseas to reduce the company's interest costs,' Thai said. Mr Thamnoon Wanglee, Thai president, has said Thai is considering issuing debentures with warrants or a convertible bond. Load factor for the year was over 64 per cent, and Mr Thamnoon predicted this would rise to 67 per cent in the current year. Anticipated break-even point is 66.7 per cent, although Thai makes profits from operations other than flights, such as airport limousine services and restaurants. Thai has proposed the formation of a new airline for domestic flights.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>   [Text] Yet another attempt is being made to reform state  television and radio broadcasting. It is envisaged to end  federal financing of 89 regional Russian television and radio  companies; if local budgets are unable to support them, they  will be auctioned off and privatized. This is a tempting  business, and according to the plan's authors it will be of  value to Russia. Of course, not a single reform in our country  in the post-Soviet period has hit its mark, and has usually hit  another target--the one it was meant to defend. Previously,  innovators had little chance of participating in these attempts  at reform, but now more successful people have become involved  in this matter. Possibly they will be the first in Russia to  promptly manage to do two things at once: break up the old and  build the new.</p>

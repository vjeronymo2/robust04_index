			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- The Indonesian Government  plans to reduce and put a brake on its growing foreign debt in  view of the 15 percent appreciation of the Japanese yen against  the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months.    Speaking to reporters at his office on 21 March, Saleh  Affif,  coordinating minister for economics, finance, and develoment  supervision, said Indonesia's foreign debt now stand at U.S. $90  billion, 40 percent of which belong to the private sector, 20  percent of which are short-term debt of less than one year, and  the remaining 40 percent which are government debt. He added  that 40 percent of the U.S. $90 billion debt are in Japanese  yen. "We must be careful because the 15-percent appreciation of  the yen in the last 12 months has increased our foreign debt by  U.S. $3billion. This is quite a large amount," he said.    Therefore, the government is now making efforts to reduce  the  amount of new commercial loans, 25-year long-term soft loans  from the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), as well as  10-year long-term export loans, which has an interest of six to  seven percent.    To reduce the amount of overseas debt, several steps have  been taken, including the placing of restrictions on commercial  loans by the Overseas Commercial Loans Coordinating Team.  Meanwhile, the National Development Planning Agency will be in  charge of monitoring export loans. "What is difficult is how to  prevent the private sector from taking on new commercial loans,"  the minister said. [passage omitted]</p>

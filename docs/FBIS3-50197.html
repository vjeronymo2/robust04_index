			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 22 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus says in today's issue of LIDOVE NOVINY that "We do not  need the Culture Ministry in the long run," but until at least  the next parliamentary elections in 1966 it will have to be  preserved. He says that other ministries have far more work to  do and that the Culture Ministry's duties could be performed by  a department attached to a government body.    "A whole ministry cannot occupy itself with the couple of  things, such as monuments, the National Museum or the National  Library," Klaus says. Asked to react to a recent statement by  an unnamed Polish economist that he does not understand the  Czech economy because low unemployment, no bankruptcies, and a  relative prosperity are not phenomena that go together, Klaus  says: "Somebody has erroneously coined the idea that  bankruptcies have curative effects, that they are desirable, and  that the success of economic transformation is in proportion to  the number of bankruptcies," Klaus says.    "But there are many forms of restructuring enterprises and  the bankruptcy is an extreme method. The first form is the  company's getting back on its feet. A number of internal  measures are carried out which turn the company, retaining its  old name, into an entirely new one. The other thing is the  process of privatization which has led to marked changes in the  structure of many companies. Hundreds of enterprises have been  intentionally liquidated and no one is surprised. Everyone  would like to hear the word bankruptcy. But the more successful  the other ways of restructuring are, the less bankruptcies can  occur," Klaus stresses. He also dismisses the  environmentalists' assertion that the large amount of raw  materials in Czech exports is not a positive phenomenon in the  long run.    "This is an entirely erroneous way of thinking influenced a  little by the mercantilist idea or by the idea of early  industrialization stages. Naturally, these considerations also  contain the vision of socialist industrialization which our  environmentalists have not yet mentally overcome. This idea is  based on the tenet that a healthy economic development is  connected with the manufacturing industry, and within it with  the so-called modern, effective sectors.    "But foreign trade is based on nothing but on the idea of  comparative advantage as coined by David Ricardo in 1817. ...If  I have comparative advantage in the production of microchips,  then I will export microchips. If I have comparative advantage  in the production of kaolin tiles, I have to export kaolin tiles  even though they have a greater content of raw materials than  microchips. This is the elementary truth and it is just this  argument -- export of raw materials -- which is used as an  argument against free market," Klaus stresses in conclusion.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fahd al-Tayyash] </F>   [Text] For many Iraqis, the journey to the unknown starts  as soon as they leave the Iraqi border points. The most  important of these border points is that of the Jordanian  al-Karamah point, previously known as al-Ruwayshad. Those who  are departing are troubled by personal worries as well as by  worries related to the nation as they cross this border point.  Many Iraqis continue to leave by way of this border crossing. It  is a continuous journey that started with the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait, when Iraqis were in search of either a haven or a  shelter far from the fighting; the journey presently continues  as Iraqis search for an asylum away from prisons and  concentration camps. Therefore, the journey in search of  suffering, hope, and facing the unknown starts at al-Karamah  with the first step of the 1,000-mile trip.    A number of Iraqi networks and groupings have been formed  outside Iraq, especially in Jordan, during the last few years.  Each of these networks has certain motives. The motive behind  one network is to help Iraqis; it was established having  humanitarian incentives and great urgency that stemmed from  within the Iraqi community. Another network is underground,  stalks the Iraqi regime's enemies, and learns about their  activities. A third network was formed with a goal to exploit  and financially drain those who opt to leave for the unknown.  Besides, there are smaller networks that have combined more than  one of the above mentioned goals. However, this reporting is  only concerned with the first kind of these networks, which  overshadows other networks.    When I met a number of Iraqis in Jordan, as a first  reaction,  most of them were afraid. However, once I became acquainted with  the leaders of the network, my mission became easier.  Nevertheless, the most prominent request from those who portray  fear remains their wish to be incognito with regard to the  information they furnish. One could imagine the fear that Iraqis  who live abroad face when one realizes the continuous fear that  Iraqis live in--that same fear that drives them to leave their  country. This implies that one's safety and the safety of one's  folks is placed in jeopardy once one's fate is known. A  prominent member of this humanitarian network confirmed to us  that he had met with an Iraqi artist after the latter had  entered Jordan. Upon asking him about his destination on this  journey to the unknown, he replied by saying: "Denmark." But,  why Denmark? Did he know anything about that country? Did he  know anyone in Denmark? Was there any prospect for him there?  All his answers were in the negative. However, Denmark was the  only country that would grant him asylum. This Arab artist  eventually embarked on his journey to the unknown.    An Iraqi journalist who resides in Amman believes that there  is a campaign to induce Arab brains, especially scientists, and  foremost Iraqis, to immigrate. This inducement is performed  through various international bodies, most important of which is  the International Council of Churches. This Council and other  bodies support Iraqi immigration to Canada, Australia, Greece,  and the United States. This journalist confirms that there are  about 2 million Iraqis abroad. As a result of that, scientific  institutions have lost a lot of their cadres. He gives as an  example the case of the College of Agriculture in al-Mawsil  University, where this journalist met with one of its faculty  members, who told him that he was one of those who deserted this  university. This faculty member added that only 18 percent of  the faculty of the College of Agriculture did not quit. This  small percentage did not emigrate for reasons that were stronger  than the attempt to emigrate and leave. Despite the fact that  the Iraqi regime requests any Iraqi professional to pay a sum  that varies between 500,000 and 1 million Iraqi dinars [ID] in  order to be able to leave Iraq, emigration still continues. In  fact, the number of emigrants is on the rise. At the same time,  the Iraqi journalist confirms that Iraqi's best artists,  literary writers, and journalists have also left the country on  the journey to the unknown. During the last three years, Iraq  has lost about 400 artists, literary writers, journalists,  poets, and critics. How much did Iraq spend to prepare these  cadres? How much time is needed to prepare new cadres? This loss  impacts the whole Arab Nation, not just Iraq. This loss is  further magnified if the number of other scientific  specializations is added to specializations already indicated.  <3>  Iraqis in Amman    Many Iraqis congregate in the al-Husayn Mosque Square in the  heart of the Jordanian capital, Amman. I was filled with sorrow  as I reached this square. Many questions came to my mind. All  the questions were centered around one single issue: why do  people emigrate? Those Iraqis who gathered in this square seemed  sad, needy, and poor. In such a situation, grief is mixed with  poverty, and poverty with dignity. This is because, though there  is great hunger and great poverty, dignity is precious.  Injustice and years of suffering and fear have brought about  this fate to these groups. I saw many of them struggling with  poverty, yet, maintaining the greatness of Arabs. The Iraqi  emigrant would roam the avenues of the unknown and not ask for  favors. He would face need and yet maintain his/her pride. Dr.  'Adil Ziyadat, professor of journalism at al-Yarmuk University  in Irbid confirms that the immigrant Iraqi community lives in  dignity. He adds that this community represents a sane society  that is free from crime, though the temptation to commit crime  may be great.    A number of small hotels are located around al-Husayn Mosque  Square. Mr. 'Umar al-Natur, who manages one of the hotels,  believes there are 40 of them. He also says that Iraqi guests,  60 percent of whom are men, make up 80 percent of the total  guests. The average number of rooms in each of these hotels is  50; these can accommodate between 150-200 persons, as more than  three persons can share one room. Members of the Iraqi networks  meet in these hotels, so do members of the one family, who had  been separated from each other by going on different journeys to  the unknown. This situation is especially true with regard to  those who cannot go back to their country, fearing for their  lives. Moreover, these hotels are used as centers where Iraqis  receive money transfers and financial aid from friends and  relatives. Mr. al-Natur confirms that most of these transfers  originate in the Gulf states. This is because of the existence  of mixed families, such as Iraqi-Kuwaiti, where members of the  one family had been divided as a result of the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait. Those Iraqi families that travel to Amman to collect  financial support from relatives and friends in the Gulf  encounter much hardship. Having to pay an exit tax when leaving  Iraq is the most important of these hardships. Some of those  leaving Iraq have indicated that, according to recent Iraqi  Government regulations, each passenger leaving Iraq has to pay a  tax equal to 200 American dollars (ID15,000).    Besides, Iraqis entering Jordan face regulatory problems  from  the Jordanian authorities. As immigrants enter, they are given  two-week resident visas, the same as is given to other  nationalities. Subsequently, residents are allowed an extension  of three months for their residence, and then a last three-month  extension. At the end of the second three-month extension,  immigrants are subject to both legal questioning and deportation  to their country. An Iraqi poet resident in Amman confirms that  at the Jordanian official level, immigrant Iraqis are given  permission for residence, as Jordan is a second home for them.  However, they get equal treatment as other Arab nationals, with  no consideration for their political status vis-a-vis legal  questioning. Some Iraqis have actually been deported to Iraq.  This poet believes that deported Iraqis encounter great  suffering, as there is no fleeing what they had previously fled;  they start to face the unknown inside their homeland. This poet  also thinks that the Iraqi and Jordanian Governments are  cooperating with regard to sending Iraqis back, especially  skilled laborers and specialized professionals. An Iraqi  photographer resident in Amman indicates that in spite of the  fact that all immigrants are considered non-permanent residents  when they first enter Jordan, the Jordanian ministry of labor  does not grant Iraqis work permits, though these are granted to  other Arab nationals such as Egyptians.    Jordanian security forces confirm that the number of Iraqis  currently resident in Jordan does not exceed 20 thousand  persons. This figure is lower than previous figures because of  Iraqi emigration to the European countries and the United  States. A knowledgeable Iraqi journalist believes that the 20  thousand figure is wrong and that the right figure would be 70  thousand. This last figure would include those who have  permanent residence, as well as those who use Jordan as a  stepping stone to emigrate to an unknown country. The 70  thousand figure would also include those who are temporary  residents, who are waiting either for someone who wants to meet  or get in touch with them, or for receiving money transfers that  would help them deal with the hectic circumstances of their  lives.   </3></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Antonov report under the "Violations" rubric: </F> "Mordovia Supreme Soviet Ignores President Yeltsin's Edict.  Federal Commission at Work in Saransk"]    [Text] The Republic of Mordovia Supreme Soviet is dragging  its feet on reforming organs of representative power in the  republic in violation of President Boris Yeltsin's edict. In  February 1994, the 17th session of the Supreme Soviet called  elections for the State Assembly for 5 June, which is clearly  beyond the president's deadline. The next session set 27  November as a new election date. Next the Supreme Soviet  Presidium, clearly ignoring Boris Yeltsin's edict on reforming  local self-government, passed a decision on resuming the  operation of rayon and town Soviets of People's Deputies. Nor  would Supreme Soviet deputies heed the opinion of the  prosecutor's office and the government of the republic.    A commission set up by Boris Yeltsin's directive is  currently  working in Mordovia. It is composed of officers of the Main  State Legal Administration and of the president's staff  administration for work with territories, the Ministry for  Nationalities Affairs, and the Russian Federation Central  Electoral Commission. Mr. Stepanov, Russian Federation deputy  justice minister, has been appointed the commission's chairman.  The commission is supposed to establish to what extent the  legal acts passed by Mordovia's parliament correspond with the  Russian Federation Constitution. The Commission has met with  Supreme Soviet deputies, Mr. Guslyannikov and members of his  former cabinet, heads of rayon administrations, leaders of  parties and movements, and candidates nominated for Mordovia's  State Assembly.</p>

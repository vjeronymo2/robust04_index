			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: INTIMACY BY SUSAN CHACE (PLUME: $7.95)  </P> <P> A fragmented, inconclusive novel about an alcoholic woman who somehow survives  the disease, despite a series of weird adventures that include a suicide  attempt and a dalliance with her brother-in-law.  </P> <P> The narration bounces about confusingly, shifting time and voice at the drop of  a glass. The constant switching between Mary Cronstein's version of events and  her friends' accounts may represent an attempt to re-create the fog of acute  alcoholism, but Susan Chace probably makes extensive use of other characters  because Cronstein's incessant whining bores her as heartily as it does the  reader. Critics have ceased to announce the death of the novel, but "Intimacy"  is at least badly wounded.  </P></p>

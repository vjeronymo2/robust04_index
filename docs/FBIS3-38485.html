			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of an "exclusive" interview with Cypriot President </F> Glavkos Kliridhis by NOKTA correspondent Sevgul Uludag in  Nicosia; date not given--punctuation as published]    [Text] [Uludag] First, the confidence-building measures.  The newspapers report that the Greek Cypriot side has agreed in  principle to discuss them.    [Kliridhis] We have agreed to discuss the three documents  drawn up by the UN secretary general. They relate to the  fenced-off area of Maras [Varosha], Nicosia Airport, and the  confidence-building measures in general. We have agreed that  the issue of the return of the residents of Maras to their  property be placed under UN jurisdiction, the UN be responsible  for running Maras, and the UN police control the area. We have  also agreed that Nicosia Airport be operated by UN officials and  used by the two communities.    [Uludag] Do you mean to say you have agreed to have two  terminal buildings?    [Kliridhis] Yes, exactly. We have agreed to the UN secretary  general's proposal. But the Turkish Cypriot side has not agreed  to place the fenced-off area of Maras under UN jurisdiction.  The Turkish Cypriot officials have said they want to retain the  area near Demokratia Avenue and that they are not interested in  Nicosia Airport. They asked that we recognize Ercan Airport and  the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta. We responded by saying we  cannot do that because it would imply the recognition of a  Turkish Cypriot state, which we do not recognize. The UN  secretary general revealed at the beginning that issues relating  to the confidence-building measures should include nothing that  would imply the Greek Cypriot side's recognition of the Turkish  Cypriot administration or the Turkish Cypriot side's recognition  of the Cypriot Government....    Rauf Denktas has informed diplomats that the embargo must be  lifted. He has equated that with the Greek Cypriot side's  recognition of the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta and Ercan  Airport. I can't predict what he may do after he holds talks  with Prime Minister Ciller in Turkey in February. I can't say  whether Prime Minister Ciller will change Denktas' mind or  whether he will insist on his stance.    [Uludag] Elections have been held in north Cyprus and a  coalition government has been established. Can you outline your  views on that coalition? Do you believe the Turkish Cypriot  side may change its policy on Cyprus?    [Kliridhis] I have read the coalition protocol very  carefully. Considering Denktas' policy on Cyprus, I have seen  nothing different in that protocol. Ozker Ozgur and Denktas  have approached each other. In practice, Ozgur has made more  approaches to Denktas than Denktas to him. Considering Ozgur's  views before the coalition's establishment, Denktas' approach is  to the fore.    [Uludag] Can you comment on Prime Minister Ciller's policy  on  Cyprus?    [Kliridhis] Prime Minister Ciller has informed President  Clinton and Prime Minister Major that she is convinced that the  time to solve the Cyprus problem has come and that Turkey will  try to contribute toward a settlement. But that gives no hint  of the nature of the solution to be found. We will wait until  next month to see what Prime Minister Ciller has in mind for a  solution.    [Uludag] Do you mean you have seen no change?    [Kliridhis] I have not. Prime Minister Ciller has only said  that "Turkey will try to find a solution." We have nothing to  indicate the kind of solution to be found.    [Uludag] Several Greek Cypriot politicians defend the view  that agreeing to the confidence-building measures will be  tantamount to recognizing a Turkish Cypriot state. Do you  believe the package of confidence-building measures implies  recognition?    [Kliridhis] I have already mentioned that the UN secretary  general said that nothing will be done to imply any recognition  when the measures are effected. Indirect recognition will  depend on what we agree on. Let me give you an example. The  Turkish Cypriot side may agree to UN officials running Nicosia  Airport but we will reject a proposal that UN officials should  accept Turkish Cypriot passports. Because doing so will mean  the recognition of the Turkish Cypriot state.    [Uludag] So how will the Turkish Cypriots travel?    [Kliridhis] Just as they do now, with Turkish passports.    [Uludag] Do you mean you will agree to UN officials  processing Turkish passports?    [Kliridhis] Turkey is recognized. I will not accept  passports issued by Turkish Cypriot officials, because that  would mean the recognition of a Turkish Cypriot state. I will  be careful and I am convinced that Denktas will be just as  careful.    [Uludag] You have known Denktas long. Do you believe you  can reach an agreement with him?    [Kliridhis] I met Denktas when I became a lawyer in 1950. I  believe we understand each other very well. Unfortunately, I  also believe that if he were to choose between the post of vice  president of the Cypriot Republic and president of a Turkish  Cypriot state, he would prefer to be president of a Turkish  Cypriot state in north Cyprus. He is used to being the top  official. But what he wants is not the issue. If Turkey says:  "Yes, we will solve the Cyprus problem," Denktas can't obstruct  the process alone. He can cause delays....    [Uludag] The general view is that Turkey cannot solve the  Cyprus problem without Denktas.    [Kliridhis] I do not believe that is true.    [Uludag] That is the general viewpoint. He must sign the  agreement to be reached....    [Kliridhis] I believe Turkey can convince Denktas to be  reasonable, that is, if it wants to do so.    [Uludag] I wanted to stress that Turkey cannot completely  ignore Denktas and move to sign an agreement.    [Kliridhis] I do not believe that is necessary. It would be  wrong to leave him out.    [Uludag] The Greek Cypriot side has allocated a large amount  from its new budget for arms purchases. And you have decided  you need to be under Greece's defense umbrella. Many  politicians believe you are playing with fire. Is that right?    [Kliridhis] No, it is not.    [Uludag] Why do you need to be under Greece's defense  umbrella and why do you want to strengthen Greece's influence?    [Kliridhis] I don't want to strengthen Greece's influence. I  want to reduce Turkey's influence to the minimum. Turkey has an  army in Cyprus, a very strong army of 36,000 men.    [Uludag] Do you believe the Turkish troops will attack the  Greek Cypriot side?    [Kliridhis] I have not said they will attack me or the Greek  Cypriot side. But I believe their presence is aimed at forcing  me to agree to a solution that favors Turkey and the Turkish  Cypriot side. If I don't agree, then the Turkish military  forces will remain in Cyprus. I say: If you want to play the  game like that, then I can play the same, by increasing Greece's  influence. Later, I will say: Right, get out, both of you!    I have sent a letter to the UN secretary general informing  him that I am prepared to disband the Greek Cypriot National  Guard and hand over all its arms to UN officials. The police  force can remain as it is and we are prepared to undertake the  expenses of a UN peacekeeping force, which will be composed of  units from various countries. I am prepared to transfer the  cash we will have from all that to a UN account, which will be  used to serve the two communities when the Cyprus problem is  solved. I am prepared to transfer the Greek Cypriot armored  vehicles to UN officials. They can be used by UN troops to  control the buffer zone against any kind of aggression.  Naturally, everything will be subject to the condition that the  opposite side complies in the same way. Let us have no armies  on the two sides. Let us have a strong peacekeeping force in  the buffer zone and move to hold talks.    [Uludag] We have the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements. Are  you willing to conclude a nonaggression pact with Denktas? Are  you willing to sign an agreement with him to reduce the arms and  troops in Cyprus?    [Kliridhis] I do not object to the two sides giving separate  guarantees to the UN secretary general that they will not attack  each other. But if we are not to attack, it will be meaningless  to maintain the presence of the military forces. I must  strengthen my defenses anytime a Turkish soldier arrives in  Cyprus. And more Turkish troops are deployed in Cyprus as I  strengthen my defenses. Consequently, we have a vicious circle.  I need no army. I can give up my arms. The Turkish Cypriot  side needs no army either. We need a peacekeeping force. Let  us conclude an agreement with the United Nations and guarantee  that neither side will attack or enter the buffer zone. Let us  then hold talks like normal people do.    [Uludag] How do you assess the Turkish Cypriot community?  Do you see it as an equal political partner or as a minority in  a federation?    [Kliridhis] The wings of a federation have equal rights,  whether the federation is made up of two or more parts. Let us  consider the federal systems in India or the United States.  Many of their states (provinces) have populations of several  million people. Many others are smaller. But all have equal  constitutional rights. Indeed, there are constitutions that call  for equal senate representation, regardless of the population  structure ... So, the Greek Cypriot side agreed during the  Makarios era and later when Spiros Kiprianou was in power that  the two federal states would be represented on a 50-50 basis in  the upper house. Had we not agreed to equality, we would have  said: As for the population ratio, the Greek Cypriots make up  82 percent and the Turkish Cypriots 18-20 percent. The issue of  representation should be based on that ratio.    But we have agreed to equal representation.    [Uludag] Can you explain the kind of federation you have in  mind?    [Kliridhis] I believe the Cyprus problem should be solved as  follows: The two communities that will establish the federation  must have the right to the highest degree of self-government.  Only that which is necessary should be transferred to the  federal government. The federal government must have  jurisdiction over issues relating to unitary sovereignty,  unitary international identity, foreign policy, and defense.  The federal states and governments will be responsible for all  issues relating to internal administration. The issue of having  unitary federal citizenship is important. Arrangements against  criminal activity are important. So, having arrangements to deal  with federal offenses, as is the case in the United States, is  important. The taxes of the federal government and those of the  two states establishing the federation must be clearly defined.  A control mechanism must be established. A supreme federal  court must be empowered to ensure that the two sides comply with  human rights. That must be a federal procedure. Naturally,  state courts will also be established. But the final decision  must be made by the federal courts. We must also consider  particular issues relating to health. The two sides must have  common laws or rules, for example, against importing  contaminated foodstuffs. The two sides must agree to issues  that guarantee the people's health. All that must be clearly  outlined in a constitution.    [Uludag] Do you expect a solution in 1994?    [Kliridhis] Where is my crystal ball? I can't say I see a  speck of light at the end of the tunnel.... True, Turkey has  promised to contribute toward a solution and use its influence  on the Turkish Cypriot community. But no sign of what it thinks  about the solution itself exists. It is premature to decide on  that issue. I must be very cautious about saying I have  observed particular developments that may lead to a solution.  The issue can be better assessed after we see the Turkish  Cypriot side's reaction to the confidence-building measures in  February and March....</p>

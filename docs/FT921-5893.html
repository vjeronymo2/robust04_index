			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Management: Maximum muddle over minimum pay A lot of UK companies are worried about the Labour Party's planned minimum wage, but few have investigated how to mitigate its effect. The Labour Party is committed to a minimum hourly rate of 50 per cent of male median earnings - Pounds 3.40 per hour in 1992 terms. Such a minimum could effect 3m employees, or 15 per cent of the workforce, according to a recent study by the Institute of Personnel Management. The policy has sparked particularly loud protests from retailers, caterers and textile companies, and the Confederation of British Industry has called the minimum wage a recipe for unemployment. John Wilson, director of the British Catering Industry Association, says: 'If the Labour Party interprets the policy as a national minimum hourly rate, that could add about 30 per cent to the industry's pay bill.' However some protests have been scaled down after clarification of Labour's plans. Labour says that the Pounds 3.40 applies to hourly earnings - including extras  - and not just the basic rate. It does, however, exclude overtime. The IPM study shows fewer than 50 per cent of employers were well informed on the subject. Some employers thought the minimum wage would not affect them when it actually would. Colin Purvis, head of the textile industry's association, is not worried about the effect on larger employers. He believes that only the sweat shops will be affected, although argues that they will be difficult to police. Mary Clarkson, employment researcher at the Institute of Directors, says employers are not planning ahead and would only begin to do so in the first days of a Labour government. Not all employers are opposed to the minimum wage. Roger Faulkner, personnel director at Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry, said he was already looking at low pay but stressed that a minimum wage would have to be linked to productivity. Health is one sector where half the respondents to the IPM study said they supported the minimum wage. David Cowden, managing director of Securicor Guarding Ltd, which employs 3,000 guards, said: 'If the Labour Party does come in and impose these kinds of rates on the industry, it could be quite good for us. It would attack the cowboys who pay low rates.'</p>

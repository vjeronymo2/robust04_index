			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTRAS TO START GIVING UP ARMS AND DISBANDING  </P> <P> Heeding a face-to-face appeal by Nicaragua's Roman Catholic prelate, Contra  leaders agreed Friday to end their war against the Sandinista government and  start disbanding their 12,000-member U.S.-backed guerrilla army.  </P> <P> The vaguely worded agreement, signed in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, obliges all  rebels based in that country to hand their weapons to an international  peacekeeping force by April 20, five days before Sandinista President Daniel  Ortega turns over power here to a newly elected pro-American government.  </P> <P> But it set no deadline for armed rebels inside Nicaragua, who make up at least  one-fourth of the Contra force. Under the accord, they would concentrate in  cease-fire zones under international supervision, turn in their weapons and  return to civilian life.  </P> <P> A top Contra commander, Oscar Sovalbarro, signed the accord with Cardinal  Miguel Obando y Bravo and two representatives of Nicaraguan President-elect  Violeta Barrios de Chamorro after six hours of talks at a Honduran air base.  </P> <P> Their communique, read aloud by Obando y Bravo, said Chamorro's victory in the  Feb. 25 elections "allowed a triumph of the people's will to establish a  democracy" after eight years of rebel efforts to oust the Sandinistas by force.  </P> <P> "This permits us to declare emphatically that we have decided to begin the  process of general demobilization of our forces, starting with the disarming of  those who remain in Honduras," the agreement said.  </P> <P> Ortega embraced the cardinal upon his return to Managua and said he would  instruct the Sandinista army to respect the agreement. He joined with the  Contras, the political opposition and the Honduran government in describing it  as historic.  </P> <P> "If the letter of this accord is applied, there will not be a single armed  Contra in Nicaragua by April 25," he said, insisting on an interpretation not  explicit in the communique. "In conditions of peace, we can then confront the  grave economic and social problems that affect all Nicaraguans."  </P> <P> But the Sandinista leader expressed concern over the absence of the top rebel  commander, Israel Galeano, from the talks. He also said that hundreds of rebels  had infiltrated from Honduras into Nicaragua in recent weeks, apparently intent  on eluding any agreement to close their camps in Honduras.  </P> <P> "I am sure there are some who want to stir up the troops to continue the war,"  Ortega said. "But this agreement has to be respected because it interprets a  national consensus that the war must end."  </P> <P> Since his electoral defeat, Ortega has pressed insistently for rebel  disarmament as a condition for a peaceful hand-over of his power by his  revolutionary government. After his victorious rival joined last month in  urging the Contras to come home in peace, Ortega restored a cease-fire, and  leaders of Chamorro's National Opposition Union began talks with Contra  commanders.  </P> <P> The United States, which financed and trained the Contras, and the Honduran  government, their increasingly reluctant host, stepped up the pressure for  disarmament. Vice President Dan Quayle met with rebel leaders last week and  Honduran President Rafael L. Callejas arranged Friday's talks, sending an air  force jet to carry the negotiators from Nicaragua.  </P> <P> It was the presence of the cardinal, the Nicaraguan most trusted by many Contra  fighters, that apparently swayed rebel leaders. Entering the talks, he declared  that "the time has come for the guns to be silenced."  </P> <P> "He's the person they respect," said Aristides Sanchez, a leading civilian  adviser to the rebel commanders. "They are religious and he has been their  protector."  </P> <P> The rebels, concerned about their safety as civilians in Nicaragua, greeted  negotiators with a long list of demands, including one that Sandinista forces  be disarmed along with their own fighters.  </P> <P> That demand was dropped, Sanchez said, after Chamorro adviser Antonio Lacayo  assured them that the new president will exercise full control over the armed  forces after taking office.  </P> <P> "It will be the duty of the new government of Nicaragua to watch out for the  security of our people," Sovalbarro told reporters.  </P> <P> The Contra war, which has claimed nearly 30,000 lives, began three years after  Sandinista guerrillas overthrew the Somoza dictatorship in 1979. The insurgency  began to fizzle after the U.S. Congress ended military aid in February, 1988.  </P> <P> After a Contra-Sandinista peace accord signed two years ago Friday broke down,  Central American presidents began pressing the rebels to disarm, in exchange  for free elections in Nicaragua. The latest regional accord, last Aug. 7,  created a task force of peacekeeping observers from the United Nations and  Organization of American States.  </P> <P> Distrustful of those organizations, the rebels agreed Friday to accept them as  long as Obando y Bravo worked with them. Ortega said a small U.N. peacekeeping  force already here will be expanded and start drawing the cease-fire zones,  while a joint commission of Contra leaders and Chamorro aides works out details  of the peace accord.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Swedish banks set to merge A merger of Nordbanken and Gota Bank to create Sweden's biggest bank in terms of market share appeared certain yesterday after Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the only other bidder for Gota, broke off negotiations. A combination of the two state-owned banks would have 24 per cent of total deposits and lending, although in asset terms it would still be smaller than Swedbank and SE Banken. The merged entity could be privatised as early as 1995. SE Banken said its decision to withdraw its bid was based 'on judgments and analyses of the information that has continuously been made available during the negotiations,' but it declined to elaborate. Its statement echoed that of its rival, Svenska Handelsbanken, which pulled out of the bidding earlier this week because of information received during the valuation process. Handelsbanken also said the government was seeking 'far too high' a price for the bank. SE Banken's withdrawal means Nordbanken is the only remaining bidder for Gota Bank. A government statement on the future of Nordbanken and Gota is expected today, when details of the recapitalisation of Gota Bank may also be published. The bank is likely to receive an injection of at least SKr20bn (Dollars 2.5bn) to support its problem loans. A formal separation of Gota's healthy activities from SKr43bn problem loans, dumped in a 'bad bank' entity called Retriva, is expected to take place at the year-end. Analysts believe the state was deliberately asking a high price for Gota because it had concluded that the synergy benefits from a Nordbanken/Gota Bank merger would be considerable and would enable the state to get a better price for the combined entity than the two components. Nordbanken and Gota Bank both collapsed into state control last year after suffering huge losses during Sweden's financial sector crisis. Nordbanken, which saw the bulk of its problem loans hived off into a unit called Securum early this year, recorded a SKr2.5bn operating profit in the first nine months. Gota Bank incurred a SKr8.48bn operating loss over the same period, excluding the impact of state guarantees.</p>

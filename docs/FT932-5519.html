			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Observer: Revised version The more things change . . . British nostalgia buffs watching this week's Channel 4 early-hours re-run of the 1950s Nat King Cole show may have noted that what's now called political correctness was already in evidence four decades back. Cole's main guest was the scat singer, Cab Calloway, who performed It Ain't Necessarily So from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, a number in which the raffish character, Sportin' Life, mocks at religious stories. What wasn't necessarily so in the original lyrics was 'the things that you're liable to read in the bible'. And that was the version Calloway sang when he played the role on the London stage in 1952. But for his TV rendering five years later, the producers evidently thought it safer to take on the priesthood than sects such as Jehovah's Witnesses, who uphold the literal truth of the scriptures. The line had been altered to 'the things that the preacher is liable to teach yer'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis described the  Corfu Summit decision, by which Cyprus will definitely join the  European Union [EU] in the next expansion phase, as a great  success for Cyprus. In a written statement tonight,  Mikhailidhis added that with the Corfu Summit, Cyprus is now  entering the course for joining United Europe. He added that  the decision is not merely a step forward, but a decisive step  because, as he stressed, the only thing that remains is setting  a date for the beginning of accession negotiations.    The foreign minister said it is significant that, for the  first time, Cyprus is referred to by linking it to EU expansion,  and not by mentioning the existing political problem.  Mikhailidhis stressed that this is a great success for Cyprus,  and reinforces the Cypriot people's hopes and expectations for a  better and safer future within the EU. The foreign minister  expressed Cyprus' gratitude toward the European Council for  making the decision and toward the Greek Government,  particularly the Greek delegation that successfully waged the  great battle.</p>

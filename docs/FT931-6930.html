			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Mortgage lender places its faith in securities - Yesterday's pounds 105m issue by the troubled National Home Loans achieves a number of important goals NATIONAL Home Loans' Pounds 105m issue of securities backed by non-performing mortgages yesterday achieves a number of important goals for the troubled mortgage lender, which had to be rescued by its banks last year. As well as removing a further chunk of mortgages from its balance sheet, NHL will use the proceeds to repay more expensive bank and bond debt. The deal will leave NHL with a mortgage book of just Pounds 325m, after securitising a total of more than Pounds 2bn of its mortgages. The mortgage-backed issue, launched yesterday by Goldman Sachs, consists of two senior tranches and a large subordinated tranche, providing collateralisation, which is kept by NHL. The senior tranches pay interest of 85 basis points over the London interbank offered rate - for an estimated one-year average life - and 110 basis points above Libor for a two-year average life. Although this margin looks high compared with spreads on ordinary mortgage-backed securities with a similar average life, which are currently trading at 35 to 40 basis points over Libor in the secondary market, the cost savings for NHL are substantial. When the company was forced to reschedule its debt last year, its financing costs rose dramatically. NHL is currently paying interest of 200 basis points over Libor on its Pounds 400m of bank debt. Prior to the restructuring of its debt last year, the company was paying only 30 basis points over Libor. NHL is also paying 200 basis points over dollar Libor on its dollar bonds, which were also rescheduled. Earlier this month, NHL shelved plans to reschedule its D-Mark bonds. Since last year, the company has generated cash to repay Pounds 140m. Its main source of cash is now the vehicles created to issue previous mortgage-backed offerings; any surplus revenue not needed to pay interest on those deals is channelled back into the mortgage originator. Under the terms of its debt restructuring last June, all banks and bondholders received equal payments of the Pounds 140m paid in debt paid down, reducing the total level of debt to Pounds 560. The latest financing serves another function; the maturity of the securities matches the life of the mortgages. The severity of National Home Loans' problems in the last few years were exacerbated by the company's failure to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities, by funding long-dated mortgages in the money-markets. NHL was in the process of renegotiating its syndicated bank facilities when money-market funding dried up suddenly, as investors withdrew funds in the wake of the BCCI collapse. This resulted in the steep increase in cost of funding, which it is now attempting to reverse. Last year, NHL recording pre-tax losses of 146m, but Mr Jonathan Perry, the group's executive chairman, predicted a 'significantly reduced loss' in 1993 and a future return to profitability. Although the company has managed to repay some of its debt, NHL is not generating any new business, and with only a small mortgage book left, is little more than a shell company. So far, Barclays and the TSB are the only UK banks to have securitised any mortgages, but UK banks and building societies are currently studying the market. There is a strong incentive for banks to remove non-performing mortgages from their balance sheets, since they require twice as much capital.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Britain has more than a 'little left' of machine tool industry Sir, John Griffiths wrote, 'With little left of the UK machine tool industry . . . ' in his report on Nissan's plans to invest Pounds 200m in its Sunderland car plant ('Nissan to raise Sunderland capacity 30 per cent', January 17). This statement is factually incorrect and misleading. The UK machine tool industry, while combating the effects of the recession, saw domestic production of Pounds 960m in 1990 spread across more than 100 manufacturing sites in the UK employing approximately 23,000 people. Rolls-Royce, one of Britain's premier symbols of manufacturing, increased its procurement of machine tools from British manufacturers to 70 per cent in 1989, and there are many other examples.

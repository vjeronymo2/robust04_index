			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: GETTING PLUGGED IN TO A LATE-NIGHT RADIO CIRCUIT  </P> <P> I am not inclined by taste or by biorhythm to listen to radio talk shows late  in the night. I think I may finally have heard Larry King, but I am not at all  sure.  </P> <P> I was happy to be a guest at Mary Anita Loos' marriage to Carl von Salza and  was in Santa Monica Canyon last weekend for a day awash with happy memories and  shining anticipation.  </P> <P> I stayed with my dear friend, Mirabe Nowell, who lives in the Riviera in  Pacific Palisades. We have been friends since high school, and we spend our  times together howling with laughter. We have always done that. We were those  two silly gigglers behind you at the movies whom you wished would be pitched  out.  </P> <P> Mirabe had a green Chevrolet that everyone drove. It was during the Depression,  and we used to put gas in it two gallons at a time. Mirabe lived with her  parents in the highest-up house in the Riviera, although now it is surrounded  by other houses. Her father was a retired New York state Supreme Court judge.  But that didn't mean we had any money. We stretched what pennies we could get  our hands on. I have mentioned before that the gruel gets thin in big houses,  too.  </P> <P> She now lives in the house her husband built for her next door to the big house  where we spent so much of our time when we weren't at my house.  </P> <P> Now, about Larry King.  </P> <P> I was sleeping in a downstairs study on a sofa bed last weekend as I didn't  think I could make it up to Mirabe's second floor because of the prosthesis in  my knee. We had gone with some friends of Mirabe and with Audrey Ann Marie  Boyle, my good friend, who also lives in the Palisades, to dinner at a Mexican  restaurant.  </P> <P> When we got home, I toddled off to bed after Mirabe unfolded my bed and  supplied fat down pillows and a fluffy comforter. I was sleeping like a lamb in  the middle of the night when the radio boomed forth with a man's voice talking  about whether or not Notre Dame was really national football champion.  </P> <P> I sprang from my bed to turn it off, forgetting that Mirabe had showed me where  the sound system controls are. I ran to the table whence the voice was coming  and pushed or pulled every button I could see. Then, after turning on all the  lights downstairs and shivering in the cold, I found the cord where it was  plugged in and pulled it apart.  </P> <P> Nothing. The man kept right on talking. I looked at the clock. It was 3:30 a.m.  </P> <P> I pattered out to the stairway through the living room and entry hall. Peaches  all the while barked quite testily because her sleep, too, was destroyed. We  called up to Mirabe, but she was around a corner and down a long hall with her  door closed, and did not hear us.  </P> <P> I went back and studied the snarl of cords apparently attached to the sound  equipment. It looked like the work of a frenzied gooney bird trying to build a  nest. I finally pulled the entire thing apart, and Larry King, if it indeed was  Larry King, went back into the night.  </P> <P> I explained my problem to Mirabe in the morning. Why didn't the radio turn off  when I pulled out the plug? Because I was silencing the telephone answering  machine, that's why.  </P></p>

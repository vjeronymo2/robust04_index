			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAUSE OF HUBBLE TELESCOPE DEFECT REPORTEDLY FOUND  </P> <P> The defect that blurred the Hubble space telescope's view of the heavens  apparently was caused by a flaw in an instrument used to measure the  observatory's mirror as it was being built, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Preliminary results of tests conducted on a testing device called a "null  corrector" found one spacing in the instrument was about one millimeter off  from specifications, which would account for the deficiency, officials said.  </P> <P> "This is certainly the smoking rifle," said National Aeronautics and Space  Administration project scientist Edward Weiler. "There may be a few peashooters  around. But this is the rifle."  </P> <P> The null corrector was used to measure the surface of the telescope's primary  mirror in 1981 when it was being ground in Danbury, Conn., by what was then  Perkin-Elmer Corp.  </P> <P> Officials were uncertain how the error in the null corrector occurred and  withheld any final conclusion until the possibility of additional problems is  eliminated.  </P> <P> Although upset that such an error occurred, Weiler said he was pleased that the  probable cause of the telescope's defect had been found because it will enable  engineers to be more certain that repairs being planned will correct the  problem.  </P> <P> Engineers are developing a "prescription" for mirrors that will be built into a  replacement camera officials hope to install in the telescope in 1993 to  restore the telescope to full capability.  </P> <P> The long-awaited, highly publicized $1.5-billion telescope was expected to  revolutionize astronomy by peering more deeply and with greater clarity into  space than ever before from its perch high above Earth's atmosphere.  </P> <P> But, after the 12-ton instrument was ferried into space in April, engineers  discovered that the telescope's supposedly perfect optical system was seriously  flawed because its 94-inch primary mirror suffered from spherical aberration,  meaning its curvature is slightly incorrect.  </P> <P> One millimeter is about 1/25 of an inch, or about the diameter of the point of  a ball-point pen.  </P> <P> "Preliminary analysis indicates that a discrepancy of this magnitude could  cause spherical aberration similar to that observed in the (telescope's)  primary mirror," a NASA statement said.  </P> <P> The observatory can still conduct valuable research, but the flaw sharply  reduced the telescope's abilities by preventing the device from bringing  starlight to a sharp focus.  </P></p>

Consequently the proposed change does not involve any significant increase in the probability of occurrence of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change only allows certain identified test failures of the Division 1 diesel generator to not be included in the total number of failure used to determine whether testing of the diesel generator should be increased. Because appropriate corrective action has been taken in response to those particular test failures, acceptable reliability of the Division 1 diesel generator is assured without increased testing in response to those failures. Further, the Clinton Power Station design includes redundancy and consideration of single-failure criteria such that alternate sources, both onsite and offsite, are provided to ensure safe shutdown of the facility in the event of an accident, including mitigation of the consequences of an accident. Based on the above, Illinois Power concludes that the proposed change will not increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed change does not involve any modification to plant design or operation which could introduce a new failure mode. The proposed change only impacts the frequency of testing of the Division 1 diesel generator as it does not directly affect operation or the design of the Division 1 diesel generator or any other plant structure, system or component. As a result, no new failure modes are introduced and the proposed change will therefore not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) As noted above, other than the impact on the frequency of testing performed on the Division 1 diesel generator, the proposed change involves no changes to the plant design or operation. Therefore, as they are typically defined or established by the plant's accident analyses, no margins of safety are impacted by the proposed change. Notwithstanding, if diesel generator reliability is viewed as a margin of safety, Division 1 diesel generator reliability is the only margin of safety potentially impacted by the proposed change. However, as noted previously, reliability of the Division 1 diesel generator is not adversely affected by the proposed change since the corrective actions taken in response to the noted failures provide assurance of acceptable diesel generator reliability without increased testing in response to these failures. Further, the proposed change will reduce the potential for excessive or unnecessary increased testing of the diesel generators which may adversely affect diesel generator reliability through wear and degradation. Precluding unnecessary testing of the diesel generators will also limit the potential reduction in plant safety resulting from disturbances in the offsite power system or in non-vital loads. In total, the proposed change does not therefore involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

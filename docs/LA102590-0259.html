			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NEWMAN, WOODWARD JUST LUCKY  </P> <P> What has kept Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward married for 32 years? Eternal  love? Undying affection?  </P> <P> Try sheer luck.  </P> <P> The Newmans, breaking a policy of not talking about their marriage, told Parade  magazine they don't know why they have stayed together.  </P> <P> "Our marriage hasn't been a bed of roses," Newman said in the magazine's Sunday  issue. "Sometimes you get terminally irritated, and at one point I just packed  up and left."  </P> <P> Asked why she thought their marriage had lasted, Woodward said: "I have no  idea. Absolutely not one single idea on the subject. Probably sheer luck."  </P> <P> And what about the time Newman packed up and left?  </P> <P> "I was gone about 15 minutes," Newman said. "And I stopped and thought to  myself, 'What the hell am I doing? I have no place to go!' And I turned around  and came right back. Joanne's right. She said it. What we've got is sheer  luck!"  </P></p>

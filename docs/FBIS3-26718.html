			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Feng (7812 1496): "Deng Xiaoping Praises the `50 </F> Measures' Fixed By Third Plenary session of the Central  Committee and Once Again Stresses the Need To Grasp the  Opportune Moment for `Accelerating Development'"--passages  within slantlines published in boldface]    [Text] The economic development was, indeed, not bad in  mainland China last year, registering a 13.5 percent growth and  reaching the highest level so far in the 1990's. During the  second half of last year, monetary order was rectified,  macroeconomic regulation and control was intensified, and the  "Decisions on Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic Structure" (the "50 Measures") were  adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee. These have exerted, and will continue to exert, a  relatively positive impact on mainland China's economic  development. In particular, the "50 Measures" adopted by the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee can be  called a programmatic document for mainland China to eventually  realize the transition from a planned to a market economy.    The outline of the basic ideas in this document was sketched  out in 1988 when Zhao Ziyang was in power. Had it not been for  the strong opposition from the conservative forces within and  outside the party, and the backward forces in society at that  time, against the mainland's economic structural reform, and the  structural reform of prices in particular, these measures might  have been introduced then and put into practice. It is a good  thing that the work has begun after all, although it has been  put off for four or five years. Moreover, judging from the  systematic, comprehensive, and manipulative character of the  document, the ideas in it are more mature than those in 1988;  the fundamental tenets of the "market economy" have been more  prominently stressed and defined. No doubt this marks a major  historic advance in China.  <H3>  Deng Xiaoping Spoke Highly of the Creativity of the  Decisions Adopted at the Plenary Session </H3>   Deng Xiaoping himself was very pleased at this. At the time  when Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  was published in the middle of November last year, just before  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was  held, Deng Xiaoping particularly pointed out: "The  general guiding principle of this book lies in my speeches made  during the south China tour at the beginning of last year  (1992), in which I expressed some ideas on how to understand  socialism and how to build socialism with Chinese  characteristics. There was something new in them and some  improvements had been made. The document adopted at the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee coincides with  the meanings of my abovementioned speeches. It contains some  new expressions that are not mine. This is very good, for this  is creativity and development. If an idea or a concept can be  proved in practice and further elaborated and developed, then it  will have vitality and win support from the people. If we  persistently follow this road and discover the law, the overall  situation will not be hampered no matter whether someone is  still alive or not and whether someone is in power or not. When  this law works, the general direction will not be changed. I am  most happy about this."  <H3>  Deng Xiaoping Places Hopes on Shanghai for Another Great  Leap Forward </H3>   Deng Xiaoping has been in high spirits recently. A short  time ago, when accompanied by someone in his car driving along  the Beijing Airport Expressway and the newly built Dongsanhuan  Lu Bridge, he praised Beijing for "having a new atmosphere every  year, which is very exciting." Recently, Deng went to Shanghai  with his family for the Spring Festival there. Accompanied by  his beloved daughter Mao Mao, he inspected the magnificent  Yangpu Bridge on 13 December last year. Deng showed a  special feeling for Shanghai when he said: "Shanghai is a place  of blessing in China. People of our generation started a  revolution in Shanghai at that time. Now, the development of  China also needs another great leap forward that should start  again from Shanghai. I have placed high hopes in Shanghai.  Whether the work in Shanghai is well performed or not next year  (1994) will have a bearing on the overall situation, so this  step in the chess game must be made appropriately."  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping Once Again Stresses Faster Development </H5>   Deng Xiaoping also stressed recently: "I think the  last few years of the 20th century will be very advantageous to  China. Many developing countries and regions all have a history  of sustained economic growth for two or three decades. Will  China be able to do the same? I think it is full of hope.  Counting from 1980, we have only developed for a dozen years  now. The comprehensive national strength has been augmented  because we have chosen a correct path and the international  climate is also favorable. These are basic conditions. Of  course, we also have quite a few knotty problems. However, when  we advance rapidly, we have more ways of solving these problems.  That is why I feel that we must not slow down in the next few  years. We must solve our problems in the course of development  and spur development in the course of reform. We need not  listen to some people's arguments abroad because they do not  want to see a powerful China. They have failed to boost their  economies, which has precisely offered us an opportunity. All  countries are advancing and there is competition among them.  Hence, we will suffer losses if the opportunity is seized by  others. The problems with which China is now faced include a  large population, the still unsteady position of agriculture as  a foundation, and the still poor performance of most state-owned  enterprises, which we must not treat lightly. We must take firm  hold of these important matters which have a bearing on the  overall situation and strive to make some new changes every  year. In short, I am full of confidence."  <H5>  Is a Growth Rate of 9 Percent Appropriate? </H5>   Will the mainland's economy continue to grow at the same  high  rate as last year? Will the economic structural reform which is  being carried out on a large scale, go on smoothly? Everyone is  following these two major issues with interest. In analyzing  these issues, we may find the following phenomena worthy of  further exploration.    The problem of inflation. By October last year,  the mainland's retail price index had risen by 14.5 percent, the  index of residents' living expenses in 35 large and medium  cities had risen by 20.1 percent, and the prices of daily  necessities and labor services had increased by even larger  margins. This year, as the prices of key industries and  products such as petroleum oil, coal, communications,  electricity, and so on will be raised successively, they will  certainly bring about price rises in consumer goods and the  agricultural means of production. As control on grain prices  has been lifted and the price scissors of industrial and  agricultural products has been gradually narrowed, the prices of  essential consumer goods for daily life, such as grain, meat,  poultry, eggs, vegetables, among other things will also rise  substantially. Last September, the mainland's credit again  showed an excessively rapid growth rate when the government  injected credit funds into the economy to alleviate the problem  of insolvency with which enterprises were universally  confronted. The domestic credit, was increased on the mainland  by a total of 199.5 billion yuan in the first nine months of  last year. Of this, the September increase alone was 53.3  billion yuan with the growth rate reaching 26.7 percent. Among  these increased credits, nearly three-quarters were used to meet  enterprises' demands for circulating funds. In October, the  government once again injected approximately 80 billion yuan as  credit funds to satisfy the requirements for circulating funds.  The credit growth contributed to the growth in money supply. As  mainland economists pointed out, the experience of inflation in  1988 has proved that the growth in money supply has a notable  impact on inflation and inflation comes after a growth in money  supply. Therefore, the inflation triggered by the mainland money  supply due to credit growth will be reflected on a large scale  around March this year. By that time, the economic life on the  mainland will very probably be in the situation where the  economy will operate very rapidly as it did last June and, at  the same time, inflation will pick up sharply. This will  certainly bring about a rather unfavorable impact on the  mainland's large-scale economic structural reform and its  efforts to seek rapid economic development this year. When  inflation reaches the limit of social and people's tolerance, it  will inevitably give rise to social disturbances, about which  the CPC hierarchy has been much worried. This is a matter to  which people cannot help but pay special attention.    It is said that there are different views in economic  circles  on the question of how rapidly the economy should grow this  year. Even though the CPC hierarchy has recently determined  that the economy should grow at 9 percent this year, some  mainland economists still maintain that 7 to 8 percent will be  more suitable because, if the monetary policy is relaxed too  early, the positive results yielded by the measures taken since  last July to rectify monetary order, intensify macroeconomic  regulation and control, stabilize the economy, check inflation,  and so on may be disrupted and high inflation may emerge again.  This means that still more stringent measures must be adopted  in the future to restore monetary order and stabilize the  economy, so that the national economy will not once again fall  into a vicious cycle of big ups and downs. Moreover, the rapid  economic growth propped up by increased money supply will only  retard the change from the old structure to the new and lead to  a massive waste of natural resources and a confused condition in  the economic sphere.    However, there is very strong pressure from the governments  of various localities on the mainland. They are calling for  rapid growth and for the central authorities to ease credits and  enlarge the scope of input and those advocating accelerating  both reform and development simultaneously have got the upper  hand. Under these circumstances, the CPC hierarchy has won the  support and confidence of governments in various localities and  is willing to adopt a compliant attitude in exchange for their  recognition of the central authority. In addition, Deng  Xiaoping's recently repeated emphasis on a faster growth is also  a principle that the CPC hierarchy should follow in determining  this year's growth rate. At present, as regards the policy of  tightening currency, the CPC hierarchy has tried its best to  avoid some expressions which have been used since last July.  This signifies that it has put more stress on the policy idea  of an "accelerated development." Perhaps after March or April  this year, there will be some indications concerning the actual  effect that this policy tendency will produce. The mainland's  economic circles predict that if this year's credit and money  placement are arranged in line with the growth rate of 9  percent, the "policy of tightening up money supply" may be  abandoned and inflation will continue to pick up. The soaring  prices of consumer goods in various large cities on the mainland  a short time ago were a signal of that.  <H5>  Agriculture Faces Two Major Tough Problems </H5>   The problems in agriculture. The problem of  "issuing IOU notes" which emerged universally in rural areas in  1992, has hurt peasants and encroached on their interests. Last  year, the CPC hierarchy adopted some measures and reaped certain  positive results. However, the rapid industrial growth and the  chaotic monetary order on the mainland last year caused a  substantial amount of funds to transfer from agriculture to  nonagriculture, so that "intensifying the position of  agriculture as a foundation" became "empty talk" to a  considerable extent. Last year, the output of several major  agricultural products was lower than in 1992 and the condition  that agricultural growth was not coordinated with industrial  growth further deteriorated. Hence, insufficient supplies of  agricultural products will be fully exposed this year.    Today, there are two major problems which face agriculture.  One is that peasants' income has been continuously declining  over the past few years and the sustained growth of peasants'  income of the early 1980's no longer exists. High inflation,  high production costs, large amounts of fundraising, and large  amounts of apportionment have become onerous burdens which the  peasants are unable to bear and the reduction of agricultural  income has dampened peasants' enthusiasm in farming, year after  year. The mainland's economic reform started from the rural  areas but the reform measures which have been introduced since  the late 1980's have not brought many substantive benefits to  the peasants or to the rural economy. While the market economy  is eliminating backward rural production modes, peasants have  not generally benefited from this and their participation in the  large-scale socialized production system will inevitably cause a  considerable number of them to pay the price of becoming  relatively poor. As peasants on the mainland number 800  million, any proportion of them being reduced to poverty will  bring a powerful onslaught on social, political, and economic  lives throughout the country. Therefore, in the reform process  to establish a market economy, how to diminish this degree of  poverty in the best possible way and enable the vast numbers of  peasants to gradually adapt themselves to the requirements of  the economic transformation and universally benefit from the  reform, is a very tough problem. Due to the constant decline in  their income over the past few years, peasants have not been as  "temperate, kind, courteous, and obedient" as they once were.  Since last year, several dozen incidents of violent protest  have occurred in various rural areas. In some areas, such as  Renshou County in Sichuan Province, the peasants' protest was  staged on a very large scale. These phenomena merit the CPC  hierarchy's serious attention.    Another major problem in agriculture is the outlet for a  large number of surplus laborers. According to a survey, the  surplus labor power in rural areas now numbers approximately 110  million, about 80 percent of whom have quit the rural areas and  formed an enormous "floating population" moving here and there  all over the country. As viewed from a positive angle, this  huge "floating population" has provided the economic growth in  the developed regions with affluent resources of labor power.  Taken from a negative angle, however, the "floating population"  has exerted great pressure on maintaining social order and  stability. According to the economic development level on the  mainland at present, only 30 to 40 percent of the rural surplus  labor power can find jobs (including those absorbed by township  and town enterprises). The rest of them mostly do not have a  way out. Today, it is a general phenomenon in rural areas that  only the old, underaged, weak, and female residents remain in  the fields, while the able and strong laborers are unwilling to  do farm work. How can this situation not cripple agriculture as  a foundation? In this connection, many economists have reminded  the CPC hierarchy of the necessity to seriously handle the  agricultural problem and to introduce policies and measures like  those in the 1980's to effect a major breakthrough in the 1990's  so as to reverse the increasingly backward agricultural  conditions in China.  <H3>  Reasons Why the Campaign Against Corruption Cannot Be  Carried Out Thoroughly </H3>   The corruption issue. In a bid to overcome the  constantly spreading corrupt phenomena among government  officials, the CPC hierarchy has made a series of arrangements  and adopted a number of measures since last August; the  understanding of the corruption problem has been deepened and  considerably greater attention has been paid to it, in attitude  at least, because the hierarchy does not feel as shy or that it  is necessary to cover it up now as it did before. But, what are  the actual results? More than six months have passed and it  should be admitted that there is still a big gap between the  achievements and the expectations of the people at the beginning  of the campaign. Many "major and serious" cases of corruption,  which have been exposed and brought to light, could not be  handled smoothly and had to be laid aside, to say nothing of  those that have been covered up, evaded, or ignored.    There are two basic systems responsible for handling the  corrupt cases--the public security organs, procuratorial organs,  and people's courts outside the party; and the departments for  discipline inspection within the party. The way of handling  cases by both systems is of a closed nature, with different  criteria and methods, but with identical practice--details may  or may not be made public to the people in society. Both  systems work "under the unified leadership of the party" and the  views of party committees have the functions of "final  adjudication." It is very difficult to guarantee the fair and  legal handling of the corrupt problems in this way. In  addition, the CPC's basic consideration for handling the corrupt  problems is "stability." It will only act if things are  beneficial to stability so it cannot really "act in accordance  with the law."    Moreover, the mainland's current economic structure is a  "mixture" of power economy plus market economy. The rationality  and irrationality of bartering money for power are mutually  complementary and can be proved using two different rules,  hence, it is not so easy to determine which is legal and which  is illegal. It has been reported that there was also such a  problem in handling the swindling case of the "Great Wall  Machinery and Electrical Appliances," which was ferreted out  last June. Some senior officials involved in the case were able  to prove that their conduct was "legal" by invoking relevant  legal provisions, while they were proved "guilty" according to  relevant policies and stipulations promulgated within the party.  The "two contradictory laws" have deferred the handling of the  case even after stalling for a long time. That is why relevant  personalities in legal circles, who were acquainted with the  details of the case, pointed out that the conflict between  "policy" and "law" is an inevitable product in countries ruled  by a single party. Under the conditions that the party alone  has been in power for a long time, the ruling party need not and  cannot formulate laws which it has an obligation to abide by and  comply with. Its basic point of departure in formulating laws  is to safeguard the ruling position of the party. When the  general applicability of the laws affects its ruling interests,  the laws must make way for its policies. The existing Chinese  Constitution makes definite stipulations on "upholding the four  cardinal principles," the first principle of which is to "uphold  the CPC's leadership." This stipulation is binding on various  social strata but it is only a "safeguarding force" rather than  a binding force on the CPC itself. In this regard, as viewed  from the angle of "binding," the whole Constitution has no  effect on the CPC--the only party in power and no political  forces in the entire mainland society can supervise and  standardize the CPC's political conduct with this Constitution.  Perhaps this is a fundamental reason that the CPC is unable to  depend on laws to overcome its own corrupt phenomena.    This year, the CPC will carry out large-scale reform in the  economic area. One of its main ideas is to change the "dual"  structure of "power plus market." Originally, this can be  regarded as a fundamental measure to stop officials from seeking  economic interests by abuse of powers. However, people are in  doubt--to what extent will government officials at various  levels, who have gained enormous interests in the "dual"  structure of "power plus market," support and welcome this kind  of reform? In the change and transformation from a  "double-track" structure to a "single-track" structure, how many  illegal interests will be transformed into legal interests?  These problems can constitute a major obstacle to the  large-scale reform of the economic structure. A phenomenon  which merits people's attention is thatthe ultra-leftist and  conservative forces within the CPC are particularly active in  the anticorruption campaign. However, it was precisely these  people who reaped exorbitant profits in the "double-track  system." This group of people could not accept the market  economy but they would accept the economy of "power plus  market." One of their principal objectives in performing  actively in the anticorruption campaign was to safeguard the  "power plus market" economic structure because, by so doing,  they could have the grounds for maintaining their "planned  control" over the economic life and, simultaneously, have the  means for seeking personal benefits from the market. They took  advantage of the anticorruption campaign to prove that the CPC  was capable of exercising self-discipline to work honestly, so  they must wield the power of direct intervention in the economic  life. Such political intentions of the CPC's ultra-leftist and  conservative forces should be detected and exposed to prevent  them from turning the anticorruption campaign into an antireform  political action.  <H5>  Stability Can Hardly Be Effected by Exercising Control </H5>   The stability issue. To the CPC hierarchy, the  maintenance of political stability is a matter of paramount  importance. The CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing  Committee specially held an enlarged meeting at the end of last  year to discuss this issue and make decisions. The meeting  stressed that the first task of maintaining stability is to  "resolutely suppress and crack down on various kinds of  antirevolutionary activities conducted by the antagonistic  forces at home and abroad and particular attention should be  paid to cracking down on those organized political opposition  activities." Another task is to effectively grasp and ontrol  the press, cultural, and propaganda departments, to stress the  "theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  party's basic line, and the themes of patriotism, collectivism,  socialism, and traditional virtues of the Chinese nation," and  to ban the words and deeds regarding bourgeois liberalization,  extreme individualism, hedonism, and money worship from  appearing in any form in news reporting and propaganda material.  According to this strategy, relevant departments have adopted  tight and stringent measures to control political, cultural,  press, propaganda, and other areas. The censorship in films,  press, and publication has been intensified, and almost every  month the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department issues  directives that articles concerning such and such films,  performers, news themes, books, periodicals, and authors "must  not be reported and propagated," or "must be criticized," or  "must be ordered to suspend publication and make self  examination." The Central Propaganda Department also stipulated  that various major newspapers, broadcasting stations, and  television stations at the central level "must submit their  plans for news reporting and theme selection" and "must refrain  from presumptuously publishing reports not included for  selection" on a regular basis. Personalities from mainland  press and cultural circles have a common feeling: "The control  of press and culture at present is nearly the same as that  during the decade of the `Cultural Revolution.'" Today, press  and publications are flooded with illogical, undemonstrable, and  unconvincing reports and articles which are simply dull  preaching full of outmoded ideology. The people's voices,  thoughts, and views are nowhere to be heard or seen and there  are terribly few articles with insight and of good quality which  can help people understand important international and domestic  events. In short, there are no academic contentions, free  discussions, criticism on work errors of government officials,  or news reports which the masses wish to know in the press.  However, such an inanimate and lifeless atmosphere of  propaganda and public opinion is eulogized as the "press opinion  exercising leadership over social opinion and being higher than  social opinion."    Relevant departments maintain that only by strictly  controlling political, cultural, press, and other areas can  political and social stability be guaranteed on the mainland.  They do not understand that the multiple public interests, the  diversified social life, and the wider openness brought by the  mainland's economic structural reform can no longer be accepted  and controlled by centralized politics and "unified opinion." A  major contradiction, brought about by the authorities in pushing  forward the economic structural reform through the traditional  political structure and opinion control mode, has blocked and  cut off the channels and bridges of exchange and linkage that  promote the understanding between the officials and the ordinary  people, so that the ability of the ruling party and government  to respond to social changes and demands has become less  flexible and they are unable to obtain understanding and support  from the people when the economic reform meets with difficulties  and obstacles. What is more, social contradictions will be  sharpened and social unrest will be triggered off. The 4 June  incident in 1989 did not occur because the political structural  reform took the lead and the CPC's authority declined but  because the reform lagged behind and even retrogressed. In  summing up lessons after the 4 June incident, someone from the  CPC hierarchy maintained that bourgeois liberalization had  crippled the CPC's leadership. Hence, only by opposing  "liberalization" can the CPC's ruling position be solidified.  Since the coup d'etat in the Soviet Union on 19 August 1991,  the CPC hierarchy, led by Deng Xiaoping, has acquired a new  understanding of the above conclusion and believes that "China  will come to a blind alley unless it persists in reform and  opening up." Afterward, it came to realize the "necessity to  maintain vigilance against the right tendencies but primarily  guarding against the "left" tendencies because the latter is  also a major cause of weakening the ruling position of the  Communist Party. However, this understanding only remains in  stressing the "need to further carry out economic structural  reform" and the CPC, by and large, sticks to the previous  traditional concept with regard to the political structural  reform. This is shown in the wording about the political  structural reform written in the "Decisions" adopted at the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.  <H5>  Constructive Remarks of Mainland People of Insight </H5>   Mainland people of insight point out: The general mood of  the authorities has fallen into an erroneous sphere. On the  mainland, the broad masses' support given to the CPC has, on the  whole, not been changed (given the numerous complaints and  dissatisfaction) because the people are clear that the CPC has  performed meritorious deeds over the past few years, as they  have benefited from reform and opening up. There are no other  political forces in China that are able and qualified to replace  the CPC. The CPC should have confidence in this. However, the  CPC should also understand that it should not just rely on  unflinchingly pushing forward the economic reform to enhance and  consolidate its ruling position but should also rely on  unflinchingly pushing forward the political reform, as this is a  basic condition to ensure that the people will make concerted  efforts with the ruling party to maintain basic social  stability. To have a democratic political advantage is more  conducive to maintaining the CPC's ruling position and the  stability of the country than to have its "traditional political  advantage." The establishment of a democratic political  structure is also of great benefit to the ruling party in  developing and fostering new political resources for use by  itself. The people's expression of support for and  participation in the political activities of the ruling party  through various forms of democratic politics will have a greater  political cohesiveness than the mere instillation of the  "loyalty awareness" into the people. It is hoped that the CPC  hierarchy will give careful consideration to these constructive  remarks.</p>

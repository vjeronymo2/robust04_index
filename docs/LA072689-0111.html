			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ROUGH WEATHER IN JAPAN;  </P> <P> MOVIE 'BLACK RAIN' RUNS AFOUL OF NATION'S CUSTOMS  </P> <P> Late one afternoon during the production of "Black Rain," film director Ridley  Scott and his 180-member crew were rushing to get in the last two scheduled  shots of the day in a steel mill in Osaka, Japan, when two observers from the  steel company began yelling at them to stop.  </P> <P> The crew was running 15 minutes behind schedule, according to production  manager Bill Watkins, and about to overshoot the approaching 5 o'clock  deadline. As Watkins and others began to stall for time, one of the two  Japanese mill reps walked over to the camera and put his hand over the lens.  </P> <P> Not only was the day's shooting at an abrupt end, but the "Black Rain"  production company was faced with the possible forfeiture of the $40,000  deposit the mill had required to assure that its restrictions would not be  violated. In Japan, unlike in the United States and other Western countries  where film crews routinely work overtime, strict shooting schedules are  observed to the minute.  </P> <P> The "Black Rain" company did get its $40,000 back, said Watkins, but the mill  sequence had to be completed later at a plant back home in Fontana.  </P> <P> The incident was just one of many that "Black Rain" principals say placed them  at odds with their Japanese hosts and left feelings bruised on both sides of  the Pacific. Whether the "Black Rain" experience in Japan stands as a triumph  over tough odds, or as a matter of arrogant Western movie makers trying to  impose their methods upon the Japanese, depends upon who is telling the story.  </P> <P> Ridley Scott, reached Tuesday at his home in London, acknowledged the problems  in Japan but said he didn't blame the Japanese.  </P> <P> "I found the Japanese to be tremendously hardworking, although their logic at  first seemed pedantic," Scott said. "Ultimately, it was very sensible and  honorable."  </P> <P> When the film company first arrived in Osaka last fall, it was apparently  expecting the kind of welcome Hollywood productions receive elsewhere when they  show up to fuel the local economy. But the welcome mat never came out.  </P> <P> "Their attitude is, 'We're not interested in having an American production  here. . . . We couldn't care less,' " said "Black Rain" co-producer Sherry  Lansing. " 'You want to come here and make this movie? Fine. You'll do it our  way with our rules. You'll start at this time, you'll finish at this time. And,  yes, we do put the hand in front of the lens if you're a minute over.'  </P> <P> "Once you get that, you're all right," Lansing said. "And we got it. I learned  to ask for three days (on a location) if I thought I needed one."  </P> <P> "Black Rain," a reportedly $30-million Paramount film scheduled for release in  September, stars Michael Douglas as a New York City police detective who  becomes ensnarled in a case involving the Japanese mafia. Japanese star Ken  Takakura plays his Osaka police force counterpart and the man with whom he  experiences culture clash on a personal level.  </P> <P> "What we all found was that we all began to feel like Nick Conklin, Michael  Douglas' character in the movie," said Lansing. "Nick Conklin gets involved  with the different ways the Japanese do business as compared to us. You go  through a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of administrative detail. There is a lot of  bowing. Everything is very slow. . . . They're a closed society and suspicious  of outsiders. . . . All of this is what causes the Nick Conklin character to  become so frustrated and angry.  </P> <P> "We were stunned," she said, "not by the accuracy of our script, but by the  fact we found ourselves living the script."  </P> <P> Shigenobu Suzuki, an Osaka city official who worked with the "Black Rain" crew,  said the production problems were the result of cultural misunderstandings on  both sides.  </P> <P> "Formalities are complicated in Japan," Suzuki said. "Film makers here write up  their schedules down to the hour and even minute. But Paramount's schedule was  loose, formed more according to the surroundings that fit their artistic  considerations."  </P> <P> Suzuki said the film company didn't get a lot of local cooperation, especially  from the police.  </P> <P> "The police were perhaps the most difficult to deal with because they are the  ones with responsibility for crowd control and there are always flocks of  people wherever there is a film crew," Suzuki said.  </P> <P> Donald Richie, a historian on Japanese film who lives in Japan, declined to  discuss the specific problems with "Black Rain," but said film companies often  make assumptions about shooting in Japan that don't pan out when they get  there.  </P> <P> "If you went to America to make a film you would go knowing the language,"  Richie said, "but yet people have come to Japan from all over who don't know a  word of Japanese. . . . Here you are supposed to get permission ahead of time.  A lot of foreigners who come here don't have huge plans and meet with  problems."  </P> <P> Japanese members of the "Black Rain" crew also say the Americans brought on  many of their own problems.  </P> <P> "If the Americans were more willing to adapt, it would have been easier," said  one of the Japanese crew members, in an interview in Tokyo. "If they had  studied the Japanese situation instead of just saying, 'This is how we are  going to do it,' it would have been better."  </P> <P> Among the many problems that arose on the Japanese locations of "Black Rain":  </P> <P>  -- Japanese officials, honoring a countrywide restriction on firearms, refused  to allow in the automatic weapons and handguns needed to fire blanks in action  sequences (eventually a mix of real weapons and flame-spitting Japanese fakes  was used).  </P> <P>  -- Because of narrow streets and tight corners, equipment trucks were about  half the size of those used in the United States.  </P> <P>  -- Before leaving Japan -- a month earlier than originally planned -- the film  company was aggressively hustled out of a pachinko parlor after running over  its filming deadline.  </P> <P>  -- There were verbal confrontations with police over breaches of official  restrictions on just how the film crew was supposed to shoot in the city's  spectacular Dotonburi nightclub district.  </P> <P>  -- Obtaining filming permits required long, arduous negotiating sessions.  Every location site represented a series of formal meetings that included  ceremonial protocol such as exchanging gifts and drinking tea. Often,  negotiations went on for weeks, only to end up with the permits denied.  </P> <P> Poul said that American and Japanese productions have been filmed in the  Japanese countryside in recent years, but in "a controlled, outdoor  environment." But nothing with the scale and urban setting of "Black Rain" had  been attempted in 20 years.  </P> <P> "When we were in Osaka, we were constantly trying to get permission to do  things no Japanese film crew had ever gotten permission to do."  </P> <P> For a while, there was talk of shooting the urban scenes for "Black Rain" in  Hong Kong, a city that has frequently been used for large productions. David  Salven, the film's production manager until a heart attack sidelined him in  Tokyo, said co-producer Stanley Jaffee and some of the others felt it was  essential for the film's authenticity to shoot in Japan.  </P> <P> "I was more concerned with the physical side of it," Salven said. "Obviously,  it would have been easier to do it in Hong Kong. They're more geared to a  motion picture company shooting there."  </P> <P> Solving the myriad details was also expensive, Watkins said .  </P> <P> "We estimated a day of shooting in Japan at $145,000. By comparison, when I was  doing 'Coming to America,' we estimated about $125,000 a day in New York and  $85,000 in Hollywood."  </P> <P> Explanations for the company's early departure from Japan differ. Lansing said  the decision to return to California was made even before they got to Japan,  because "We found it was more cost efficient to shoot interiors in L.A."  </P> <P> Others said the company got out as soon as they could and that by returning to  the United States three weeks early, the entire U.S. schedule was thrown off.  Because they left Japan early, "Black Rain" sources said, deals had to be  renegotiated with several Japanese actors who had to obtain visas and complete  their roles in America.  </P> <P> According to casting director Diane Crittenden, American look-alikes were  "matched" with some Japanese bit players, but that only worked in instances  where the originals were shown at a distance, or "where they could be cut in  and out." Other Japanese players were simply excised from the movie.  </P> <P> In addition, props and vehicles established on film during the Japan location  had to be duplicated or transported to the United States.  </P> <P> Soon the production team found itself facing red tape, American style.  </P> <P> For starters, two Japanese propane-fueled cars were needed for sequences to be  shot in California. Paramount's legal department had to jump into the fray  before the automobiles -- which didn't meet U.S. safety standards -- could be  imported. Even then, the company had to promise to have both vehicles crushed  immediately after shooting was completed.  </P> <P> Then there was the matter of matching locations, "a truly hideous task" in the  words of production manager Salven, who briefly returned to the film at the  beginning of California location.  </P> <P> Due to the company's hurried departure from the Osaka steel mill, for example,  additional bits of footage had to be shot locally. That meant several days of  shooting at the California Steel Industries mill in Fontana. In other  instances, entire Japanese sets had to be created.  </P> <P> The "Black Rain" team managed to convert a construction area downtown at Hope  Street into an Osaka street. A nightclub was re-created -- interior and  exterior -- on the Paramount lot. A Los Feliz neighborhood was shot as a  Japanese suburb. Los Angeles International Airport subbed for Osaka Airport.  The monastery in which Yakuza members will be seen meeting in the film was  actually located at the Chandon vineyard in Napa -- at an additional cost,  sources said, of $350,000.  </P> <P> Despite the problems, director Scott said that for him, shooting "Black Rain"  in Japan was not a bad experience.  </P> <P> "Working with the Japanese was difficult initially because of obvious language  and cultural differences," he said. "Overall, I understood and respected the  Japanese message."  </P> <P>  Vibeke Laroi, a Tokyo-based reporter for Reuters, contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P></p>

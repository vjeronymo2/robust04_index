			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE CREDIT  </P> <P> We citizens of Claremont cannot understand why the city of Upland receives  credit for all of the recent earthquakes. News reports typically state the  epicenter was 3.2 or 4.6 miles west of Upland. When you're that distance west  of Upland, you're in Claremont and we would like to get credit!  </P> <P> JIM STRIPLING  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Change of strategy sought on reform in Haiti THE US and international organisations seeking to restore constitutional government in Haiti are reconsidering their strategy so as to force Haiti's military leaders to step down and allow the exiled president to return. The re-think - by the United Nations, the Organisation of American States and the US - follows the rejection by the Haitian army leaders of proposals that they accept an amnesty, leave office, and permit the reinstatement of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a coup 19 months ago. Diplomats in Washington and in several of Haiti's Caribbean neighbours have decided that the UN's options are limited, but that the first move will be discussions with the European Community aimed to tighten economic sanctions against Haiti. The sanctions, imposed just after the coup, have been sieve-like. There is also likely to be increased pressure on the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, to end cross-border trade, much of it controlled by the Dominican military and providing a supply line for the Haitian military and the rich elite which supports it. General Raoul Cedras, leader of Haiti's army and de facto ruler of country's 7m people, had suggested that he was willing to accept UN proposals by which he and other senior officers would step down and receivee an amnesty, clearing the way for Father Aristide. But Mr Dante Caputo, a UN envoy seeking a resolution of the crisis, has reported a hardening of position by the army leaders. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the leaders of the Haitian military had indicated that they understood the 'importance' of a prompt return of constitutional government and the return of Father Aristide. 'It is time for the military leaders of Haiti to indicate firm agreement on the key points of a settlement of the political crisis,' he said.</p>

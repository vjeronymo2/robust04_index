			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 31 May (PL) -- With the decision to discuss  economic, integration, and commercial issues, the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit will move beyond discussions of a common  history, language, and culture to give itself a new dimmension.    In an article published in the latest issue of the magazine  PRISMA, Foreign Minister Robaina says there is an idea of adding  an economic dimension to the association of all those nations.    After saying that Cuba has always been in favor of a united  Latin America, Robaina noted that it is necessary to coalesce  all the ongoing subregional processes.    He added that concurrently, we must defend common positions  on political, economic, and social matters, especially matters  dealing with regional integration and the participation of the  subcontinent in international relations on a just basis.    As Robaina sees it, for this to happen, it is necessary to  progressively engage the integration of the production and  services sectors without disregarding science, technology,  health, or education as vital tools for an irreversible and  permanent integration.    Robaina said this process could be a suitable framework for  Cuba to make available its achievements and experiences in  social development matters to the region, disregarding  ideologies, to resolve common problems requiring urgent  solutions.    Robaina said his country will go to the Cartagena de Indias  summit with the intention of contributing to the strengthening  of that important forum at a moment when the hemispheric summit  convoked by the United States works against the Ibero-American  conferences. Robaina said the Ibero-American Summit remains as  a mechanism for concerted actions.    The new U.S. democratic Government is trying to exploit the  successful approval of NAFTA to protect a good image on the  continent and to recover lost ground, Robaina said.    After cautioning that Latin America and the Caribbean know  they cannot have too many illusions about the results of  Washington-called summits, Robaina explained that such meetings  make a lot of fuss and yield little.    The Cuban foreign minister noted that the hemispheric  meeting  must be used not to serve the specific interests of the United  States, but those of the participant countries and for this  reason, the date, site, agenda, and participation for the  meeting should be the result of a common agreement and not a  unipolar mandate by Washington.</p>

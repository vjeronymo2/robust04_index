			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: La Generale's net profit falls 38% to BFr7.6bn INDUSTRIAL gloom has again hit Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, which yesterday announced a 38 per cent drop in net profits for 1991 to BFr7.6bn (Dollars 223m) from BFr12.2bn. But the group said there were 'positive signs' of growth in 1992, and plans to maintain its dividend at BFr84 per share as a sign of confidence in the future. An improved result from the group's service companies - which include banking and insurance subsidiaries - underpinned the 1991 figures. They recorded improved current profits of BFr6.3bn against BFr5.03bn. But profits at many of La Generale's industrial companies slumped - in particular at Acec-Union Miniere, the 76 per cent-owned non-ferrous metals subsidiary, and Gechem, the chemicals subsidiary, both of which made losses. They helped drag down the sector's contribution to just BFr800m from BFr6.57bn. In 1989, the industrials made BFr15.2bn and the whole company recorded net profits of BFr20.1bn. The group said it planned to inject BFr3bn of new capital into Gechem, and was looking for industrial partners for Acec-Union Miniere, or for any of the group's 12 'business units'. Mr Gerard Mestrallet, La Generale's managing director, said the holding company would be prepared to sell some of its stake in Acec Union-Miniere, but would retain a majority interest. The group's current result, before exceptional gains, slipped to BFr4.5bn from BFr6.3bn. Mr Mestrallet pointed out that if Acec Union-Miniere were excluded, group profit had actually risen slightly during 1991. With the industrial economy in the doldrums, La Generale has been hamstrung by its dependence on stakes in cyclical industrial groups, and in recent months its share price has reacted most favourably to rumours that it plans to spin off its zinc, chemicals or cement subsidiaries. But Mr Mestrallet said yesterday: 'La Generale isn't a company which is getting smaller and smaller, and which has to divest companies to keep itself afloat.' He pointed out that the estimated value of the group's holdings had nearly doubled to BFr177bn since the end of 1987 - before Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian entrepreneur, unsuccessfully tried a takeover. La Generale was rescued from that bid by Compagnie Financiere de Suez, which now owns 61 per cent. Suez and Groupe AG, part of the insurance company Fortis, have both agreed to complete the purchase of their shares in La Generale releasing BFr11.3bn of capital. La Generale also stands to receive a further BFr3.9bn from Accor, the French hotels group, when the Belgian company exercises a put option and sells some of its shares in Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism company. Accor and La Generale mounted an agreed bid for Wagons-Lits last year.</p>

Yeltsin]    [Text] With a view to implementing the provisions of  paragraph "e" of Article 84 of the Russian Federation  Constitution, I decree:    1. Federal laws are subject to mandatory publication in the  newly created information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA  ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII [Collection of Russian Federation  Legislation]. Federal laws are also published in ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA and are passed on for entry into the data base of  official legal documents maintained by the "Sistema" scientific  and technical center for legal information.    2. Publication of federal laws in SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA  ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII and in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA constitutes  official publication. The texts of official laws distributed in  machine-readable form by the "Sistema" scientific and technical  center for legal information are also official.    Federal laws can also be published in other printed  publications and promulgated via television and radio.    3. Federal laws enter into force throughout the territory of  the Russian Federation 10 days after the day of their official  publication.    The date of entry into force of federal laws indicated in  this paragraph does not apply in instances when a federal law  stipulates another date for its entry into force.    4. Federal laws adopted on matters concerning the  ratification and denunciation of international treaties are also  published in the BYULLETEN MEZHDUNARODNYKH DOGOVOROV [Bulletin  of International Treaties].    5. SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII is  published weekly and consists of three sections: Federal laws  are published in Section One, Russian Federation presidential  edicts and directives in Section Two, and Russian Federation  Government decrees and directives in Section Three.    Sections Two and three are subdivided into two parts: Part  One contains statutory documents, Part Two contains documents of  a nonstatutory nature.    6. Documents published in SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA  ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII are placed in entries with corresponding  sequential numbers. Appendixes to documents are placed in the  same entries as the documents themselves.    7.

Further to the Russian Federation President's Edict No.  363 of 4 April 1992 "On Amendments to the Statute on the  State-Legal Administration of the Russian Federation President,"  the State-Legal Administration of the Russian Federation  President is to be tasked with monitoring the correctness and  timeliness of the publication of federal laws.    9. The Russian Federation President's Administration is to:    found the information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA  ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII instead of the information bulletin  SOBRANIYE AKTOV PREZIDENTA I PRAVITELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII  [Collection of Russian Federation Presidential and Governmental  Acts];    approve the editorial council of the newly founded  bulletin;    form an editorial staff for the said information bulletin  within the structure of the Juridical Literature publishing  house, making provision for a corresponding increase in the  publishing house's regulation personnel strength;    resolve questions linked with the size of the print run  and mandatory distribution of the information bulletin.    10. The Russian Federation President's Administration is to  ensure the priority dispatch in full of federal laws and Russian  presidential edicts and directives to the editorial office of  the information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY  FEDERATSII and the "Sistema" scientific and technical center for  legal information; the Russian Federation Government is to do  likewise for Russian Federation Government decrees and  directives.    11. The Russian Federation Government is to resolve within  one month the question of printing facilities for the  information bulletin SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY  FEDERATSII, the allocation of the necessary quantity of paper,  and also the financing of work to publish and distribute this  bulletin in accordance with Paragraph 7 of this Edict.    12. The Russian Federation Ministry of Communications,  jointly with the editorial staff of the information bulletin  SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII, is to determine  the conditions for the distribution of this publication taking  account of the rights of 1994 subscribers to SOBRANIYE AKTOV  PREZIDENTA I PRAVITELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII.    The Federal Government Communications and Information Agency  under the Russian Federation president is to determine within  one month, by agreement with the State-Legal Administration of  the Russian Federation President, the procedure and conditions  for the distribution of SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA ROSSIYSKOY  FEDERATSII in machine-readable form via the system of federal  government communications and information agencies.    13.

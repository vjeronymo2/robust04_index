			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GRAND NATIONAL SAFETY QUESTIONED  </P> <P> The Jockey Club will investigate the safety of the Grand National after the  deaths of two horses in this year's running of the world's best-known  steeplechase.  </P> <P> In a statement released today, the club, which controls horse racing in  Britain, said trainers, jockeys and officials of the Royal Society for the  Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will be questioned about possible changes in  the course, including the notorious Becher's Brook jump. Animal-rights  advocates have called for changes, such as reducing the field from 40 horses to  30 and lowering jumps such as Becher's, sixth of 30 jumps on the 4 1/2-mile  circuit. Becher's stands 4-foot-10 on the takeoff side but has a 12-foot-deep  trench on the landing zone.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Becher's claimed a top runner, Dark Ivy. On Saturday, two  horses, Brown Trix and Seeandem, were killed in falls at Becher's.  </P></p>

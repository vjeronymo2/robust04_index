			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "C.G.": "Kinkel Warns Moscow Against Returning to </F> Old Behavioral Pattern"]    [Text] Bonn, 11 Feb -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has  warned Russia against disregarding the rights of neighboring  states. In an address to the German-Russian Forum in Bonn,  Kinkel said that Germany wants a Russia that is open to the  world, stable, and democratic, a country that can be a  competitive economic partner and a reliable pillar in an  all-European peace system. "This would be the best security  guarantee for our entire continent." However, it cannot be  ignored that there are forces in Russia whose ideas of their  country's role are fundamentally different. "Those people in  Russia who believe they could improve their rating at home by  falling back to behavioral patterns in foreign policy from the  Soviet era that everybody thought were part of the past, must  know that they risk new isolation and confrontation." Germany  is taking seriously the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, the  Final Act of Helsinki, and the Paris Charter: "We expect Russia  to do the same." Germany wants to extend cooperation, but  remains determined in its defense of fundamental behavioral  standards for European security: "In the new Europe there is no  room for so-called spheres of vital interests."    Germany's policy toward the other countries in Central and  East Europe and on the territory of the former Soviet Union  pursues independent objectives, Kinkel said. He referred to the  worries of those countries: "It would be fundamentally wrong to  see them as tools for our Russia policy." Germany was aspiring  toward ever-closer integration of its Eastern neighbors into the  Euro- Atlantic forms of stability, "which will finally also  include full membership." Russia should be integrated into these  "security structures." If the smaller Eastern neighbors were to  grow into the security structures, then the relations with the  other countries in the East must be intensified at the same  time. For Russia the growing together of Europe does not  constitute a threat but an increase in stability, security, and  economic opportunities. Kinkel warned Moscow against taking  steps of its own in the conflicts in the Caucasus or other  bordering areas: "When it comes to settling bloody conflicts in  the CIS, we have to ensure that peacekeeping missions are  carried out under the auspices and the principles of the CSCE;  this requires the agreement of all parties involved." Ambiguous  terms such as "immediate neighborhood" do not fit into our time:  "As Europe is growing together we are all becoming the  immediate neighborhood for one another; Russia does not  constitute a special case here." Besides, the term "immediate  neighborhood" was blurring the differences between individual  CIS states. For all states on the area of the former Soviet  Union the following must apply without any restrictions: "Full  respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and  inviolability of existing borders." Kinkel said that it was the  task of Russian diplomacy to build up relations with Moscow's  new neighbors that are based on trust and mutual respect: "That  is a crucial issue for Europe."    Nowhere were people reacting more sensibly to Russia's  position toward Europe than in the Baltics and in Ukraine.  Kinkel requested: "The remaining Russian forces must leave  Latvia and Estonia by the end of August 1994." The Baltics  could constitute the first proof that openness toward the world  and cooperation in partnership are superior to a way of thinking  that is guided by spheres of influence and hegemonic privileges.  Kinkel added: "Therefore, I am in favor of consistently  connecting the Baltic states to the European Union." Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania need associated membership agreements  including the same "entry prospects" that are contained in the  existing Europe agreement with Poland and Hungary. "No threat  but a lasting impulse for parallel developments in the  neighboring Russia will emanate from the Baltics that feel safe  and begin to prosper." However, Russia does have a legitimate  interest in preventing discrimination against Russian  minorities. Germany has advocated reasonable conciliation  consistent with the CSCE rules; the efforts by the CSCE's  minority commissioner have been "quite successful." Kinkel  recommended Russia and Ukraine to conclude a comprehensive  agreement on good neighborly relations, border guarantees, and  minority protection to ease tense relations.    "Russia is of vital importance for European security,"  Kinkel  said. Russia remains the most important country in Europe and  Asia. "Ecological problems and disasters in this part of our  continent will not leave us unaffected." Like every other  country, Russia is pursuing interests of its own that are not  always and everywhere identical with Germany's: "A self-assured  Russia is not necessarily a threat; conversely, a Russia that is  cooperative is not necessarily an easy partner." What is  necessary is a business-like policy of accommodation of  interests and continuously growing confidence.    The resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar and Finance  Minister Fedorov created doubts about the new government's  reform course and its will to carry on with the reforms: "There  is now a threat of a loss of confidence, not only at the level  of international financial institutions but also that of foreign  investors and the population at home." Since the beginning of  the year, the ruble lost one-quarter of its value abroad. The  flight of capital from Russia is assessed at more than $1  billion per month. Unless Russian economic policy manages to  create investment opportunities at home, it cannot expect too  much from foreign capital. Kinkel said that one must hope that  the statements by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that the reforms  would continue will be decisive for the course of the new  government. The G7 stand by their financial support, but these  alone are not enough to create the necessary structural changes  in Russia. Kinkel added: "But there will not be more money for  less reform." The federal foreign minister argued: "Regarding  our support for the reforms we have to keep a balance between  our own fundamental convictions and what can be expected from  the people in Russia." Apart from stabilizing the national  economy a system of social security independent of enterprises  is recommended. Only then can the course of reform gain wide  support. Yet, without reforms lasting improvement of social  conditions will not be possible. With almost 90 billion German  marks [DM], Germany has contributed most for Russia and more  than half of the entire international aid. Germany is in favor  of Russia's getting closer to the OECD. "We would welcome it if  Russia were to become a member of the Council of Europe."  Russia should become a partner with equal rights in the G7.  Germany was also supporting the efforts for early conclusion of  negotiations on a cooperation agreement between the EU and  Russia. In 1994, Germany will open consulates in Kaliningrad  (former Koenigsberg), Saratov, and Novosibirsk and is anxious to  increase exchange in all spheres.</p>

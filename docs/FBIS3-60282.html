			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Nov 17 (PTI): India has urged the bureau  of parties to the Montreal protocol that the CFC producing  developing countries should also be allowed to export CFCs to  the consumer countries during the phase-out period of Ozone  depleting substances (ODS).    Under the protocol provisions, only the developed countries  are allowed to export CFCs. India, China and Brazil are among  the developing countries which are in a position to export CFCs.    Delivering his presidential address at the concluding  session  of the fifth meeting of the bureau of the parties to the  Montreal protocol in Bangkok today, the minister of environment  and forests, Mr Kamal Nath, said that this would help reduce the  burden on the developing countries as well as on the  multilateral fund.    This would also help accelerating the process of phasing out  of the ozone depleting substances.    Mr Kamal Nath lays down his office as chairman of the bureau  at the end of his one-year term today.    Mr Kamal Nath said that the provisions of the protocol  should  be so amended that the early reduction of ODS did not become a  disincentive. In fact, such efforts needed to be recognised and  rewarded, rather than be allowed to become a punitive constraint  in future.    Expressing deep concern over the development of technology  and its transfer, the minister suggested that the effort should  be widened by roping into the process more scientific and  technical institutions, particularly in the countries where the  appropriate technologies were to be used.    He pointed out that the denial of funds for research and  technology development would amount to the protection of  commercial interests of a few and not the environmental  interests of all.    Stressing the need of rigorous control over the demonstrable  essential uses of halons, Mr Kamal Nath said that it must be  borne in mind that many developing countries did not have access  to the halon substitutes available to the developed countries.    These realities must all receive due consideration,  including  when deciding upon the location of halon banks. The  halon-producing developing countries should be involved in the  development of halon banks, he said.    Mr Kamal Nath cautioned that with the greater integration of  the global economy and the on-going liberalisation process in  several parts of the world, it should be ensured that ODS-using  equipment that would become technologically obsolete, or the use  of which was legally restricted, in the developed world was not  dumped by unscrupulous elements onto projects in developing  countries.    Each country would have to evolve suitable mechanisms to  ensure this. But simultaneously, while approving projects, the  executive committee would also have to ensure that ODS-using  equipment was suitably prevented from recirculation, he said.    Reviewing with satisfaction the last one year's progress  under his chairmanship, Mr Kamal Nath said a total of 122  countries had signed the protocol.    The executive committee has so far approved 27 country  programmes for phasing out ODS and sanctioned projects and  activities worth a total of $200 million. India's country  programme worth $2 billion was approved by the committee last  week in Bangkok.    The minister stressed the need for adequate and timely  replenishment of the multilateral fund and requested that  contributions to the full extent of the agreed target amount be  made with a sense of urgency.</p>

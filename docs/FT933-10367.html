			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Esselte posts 30% drop to SKr138m at midterm ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, saw profits after financial items fall to SKr138m (Dollars 17.5m) in the first six months of the year from SKr198m in the same 1992 period. It blamed the 30 per cent fall on weaker demand in its main European markets and said it was not reaping the full benefits of the rationalisation programme which it had implemented in the US. However, the company said the recent turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, following the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism, could turn out to be beneficial for the group. It manufactures 80 per cent of its office equipment for the European market in Denmark, France and Belgium, whose currencies are expected to weaken in the new ERM parameters. 'Our products should be more competitive and we hope that demand will pick up in a lower interest rate environment,' the company said. The group is sticking by an earlier forecast that profits for the full year will exceed last year's SKr259m. Sales in the first half climbed to SKr5.70bn from SKr5.00bn thanks to the devaluation of the Swedish krona.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRAIL BLAZERS TAKE ONE AWAY ON ROAD, 112-109;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: WILLIAMS MAKES KEY STEAL. JOHNSON MISSES SECOND HALF AS SUNS ARE  OUSTED.  </P> <P> Buck Williams did not merely strip Tom Chambers of the ball Thursday night. He  took away the Phoenix Suns' fading playoff hopes, obliterated the notion of  home-court dominance and ended 13 seasons of Portland Trail Blazer frustration  since their last trip to the NBA championship series.  </P> <P> In one stealthy move, Williams did all that. The Trail Blazer forward's steal  with eight seconds left, the last of several late and crucial defensive plays,  enabled Portland to secure a 112-109 victory over the Suns in Game 6 of the  Western Conference finals.  </P> <P> Finally breaking through on the road, after losing two previous times at  Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the Trail Blazers felt it fitting that the victory  that will send them to the championship series for the first time since the  1976-77 season was made possible by tough defense in a close game.  </P> <P> It was the way the Trail Blazers won all four games, the first three coming at  home. Even though the Suns were without point guard Kevin Johnson, who sat out  the second half with a strained left hamstring, the Trail Blazers nonetheless  again made all the big plays at big times.  </P> <P> None was bigger than Williams' steal. Portland led, 110-109, lead with 23  seconds left, but Phoenix had the ball. Without Johnson to run the offense, the  Suns' options were guard Jeff Hornacek, who had 36 points and played  brilliantly, or Chambers, who had 17 points but played horrendously.  </P> <P> Chambers, perhaps by process of elimination, was the choice.  </P> <P> He had posted low against Williams and received an unobstructed pass from  Hornacek. When Chambers turned and swung the ball near his ankles, Williams was  crouched and ready to pounce. "I've been watching Tom Chambers do that all  series," Williams said. "He tries to rake the ball, swing it around, to give  himself space. I got very low and I was ready for him. I was picking my spots."  </P> <P> Williams' timing was impeccable. After gaining possession of the ball, he  slapped it to Clyde Drexler, who was fouled and made both free throws for a  112-109 lead with 6.8 seconds left. Hornacek's desperation three-point shot at  the buzzer failed, and the Trail Blazers had, well, stolen the Western  Conference final series from the Suns.  </P> <P> In this case, calling it a steal is high praise.  </P> <P> "It's fitting we won it like this," Drexler said. "That's the way we won it all  season." It was how the Trail Blazers overcame a 10-point third-quarter deficit  to make it close in the fourth quarter and, eventually, overtake the Suns.  </P> <P> Chambers, who had all of his 17 points in the second half, claimed he was  fouled. In fact, he said Williams pushed him out of the post even before the  steal.  </P> <P> "That's just the way it goes," Chambers said. "I was posting up at the low post  at the beginning of the play, and I wound up in three-point land. I didn't walk  out there by myself."  </P> <P> Before Williams' steal, Jerome Kersey blocked a shot by Hornacek. The Suns  still had a 109-108 lead with about 40 seconds left when Hornacek saw an  opening in the lane and drove.  </P> <P> Kersey stepped in and blocked Hornacek's running one-hander. Then he deftly  retrieved the ball and passed to Drexler to start the fast break. Kersey  finished the break with a layup and gave Portland a 110-109 lead with 27  seconds left.  </P> <P> "(Hornacek) had a lot of rotation on that shot; it was kind of a lob," Kersey  said. "I just wanted to get a hand on it."  </P> <P> Trail Blazer hands were everywhere. Their strong defensive play enabled them to  win the series despite making barely more than 40% of their shots.  </P> <P> "When the game was on the line, defensively we did what we had to do," said  Portland guard Terry Porter, who had 23 points.  </P> <P> Said Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons: "I wanted the ball in Tom Chambers' hands or  Hornacek's hands, and we got it to them the last two plays. But Portland has  great athletes, and they made great plays. Give Portland credit for that."  </P> <P> Certainly, Kevin Johnson's absence in the second half adversely affected the  Suns. Yet, with Hornacek making 11 of 22 shots and all 14 free-throw attempts,  the Suns carried on quite well for at least one quarter.  </P> <P> But even with Johnson earlier in the series, the Suns had been incapable of  executing well enough to win close games. However, the Suns had beaten the  Trail Blazers at home twice by a combined 46 points with Johnson.  </P> <P> Naturally, their spirits sank when he limped off the court with 2:54 left in  the half, shortly after making a three-point play on a driving layup.  </P> <P> "You can never overcome KJ's loss," said Sun swingman Dan Majerle, who had 22  points through three quarters but was shut out from there. "They just kept  chipping away at our lead. We tried to throw some points at them, and they just  kept coming back."  </P> <P> Given their five-game road playoff losing streak, many figured the Trail  Blazers would have to go back to Portland to try to win the series. They were  as concerned as anybody about their inability to win on the road.  </P> <P> "We showed the rest of the country we could win on the road," said Drexler, who  also had 23 points.  </P> <P> "To some extent it's true, because we've been struggling on the road," Porter  added. "But we knew we could. It was just a matter of executing. Whenever it  gets down to a close game, we have about four or five go-to guys."  </P> <P> Now, the Trail Blazers will either go to Auburn Hills, Mich., to meet the  Detroit Pistons in the finals or stay in Portland and host the Chicago Bulls.  </P> <P> Either way, they are happy for a few days off to rest and savor the achievement  of advancing to the finals for the first time since Bill Walton wore a red  beard and ate granola in the locker room.  </P></p>

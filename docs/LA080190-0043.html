			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Chris Evert came to the defense of her good friend and old rival Martina  Navratilova and chided former tennis great Margaret Court for suggesting that  Navratilova was a bad role model for young players because she is gay.  </P> <P> "Martina has been a role model for me," Evert said. "I think Martina's been one  of the most professional tennis players just in the way she changed herself in  the last 10 years physically, mentally and emotionally to be a champion.  </P> <P> "We should judge her on what she did on the court, not in her private life."  </P></p>

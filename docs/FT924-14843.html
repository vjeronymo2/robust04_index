			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Iceland's opposition politicians brand 1993 budget draft as unrealistic Iceland's centre-right government has proposed a 1993 draft budget that would cut state spending and hold down inflation, but opposition politicians yesterday branded the plan unrealistic, Reuter reports from Reykjavik. Mr Fridrik Sophusson, the finance minister, said yesterday that expenditure would be reduced in real terms by 3 per cent from 1992. 'One of the main goals of the economic policy is to create conditions for growth; to get the wheels of the economy rolling again,' he said. Cuts for health, education and the government housing loan fund are proposed. Subsidies on farm products would be eliminated, though they will be partly replaced by direct payments to farmers.</p>

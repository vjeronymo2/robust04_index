			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Developer is accused over damage to listed building NOTTINGHAM City Council has accused Grosvenor Square Properties, the development subsidiary of AB Ports, of unauthorised alteration and demolition work at a listed building in the city centre. Nottingham Magistrates' Court has sent the case to the Crown Court. Council lawyers are considering a second action to require Grosvenor Square Properties to reinstate the parts of the building it is alleged to have demolished. The action is being taken under sections seven, eight and nine of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. It is alleged demolition and alteration were carried out in the building 'in a manner which affects its character as a building of special or historical interest'. The case concerns a scheme to turn an old department store into small shop units. One frontage of the old store consists of three 18th century cottages. The dispute illustrates the more stringent attitude of local authorities to conservation issues. Save Britain's Heritage, a pressure group concerned with protecting historic buildings, said: 'Years ago councils were wary of doing anything. Now they realise they can take tough measures.'</p>

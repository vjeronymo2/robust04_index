			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEEDUP IN ARMS CUTS PROPOSED BY BUSH AT SUMMIT;  </P> <P> SUPERPOWERS: PRESIDENT'S 16-POINT PACKAGE INCLUDES BAN ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS. HIS  GOAL: AGREEMENT BY 1990.  </P> <P> President Bush, meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a summit  disrupted by violent weather, proposed Saturday that the two superpowers speed  up their efforts to cut back conventional and strategic nuclear weapons and to  ban the production of chemical weapons.  </P> <P> The arms proposals, part of a 16-point package covering a wide range of  economic, environmental and other issues, were aimed at seeking concrete  agreements in all three areas by the end of 1990.  </P> <P> The President, declaring that he wanted to put some "steam" in the Strategic  Arms Reduction Talks (START) process, urged that a treaty be concluded -- if  possible -- by the time of a Bush-Gorbachev summit in Washington, which he  suggested be held the final two weeks in June.  </P> <P> To speed up negotiations on a chemical weapons treaty, Bush indicated his  willingness to end all U.S. production of new chemical weapons as soon as a  multinational ban on such weapons is completed -- provided Moscow accepts such  an agreement.  </P> <P> "This is the first time the United States has ever proposed such a ban on  chemical weapons," a senior Bush aide said. "It is a major policy departure."  </P> <P> Other analysts cautioned, however, that the issue of chemical weapons is so  complex and that a total multinational ban so difficult to enforce that any  such agreement may be years away at best.  </P> <P> Although Bush opened the two-day summit with proposals for action on some of  the most important issues dividing the two superpowers, opportunities for  significant progress on any of them here were substantially diminished by the  violent storm that rolled across the Mediterranean on Saturday.  </P> <P> The storm, kicking up waves of more than 16 feet and packing winds of more than  50 miles per hour, caused the two leaders to cut their time together almost in  half. They canceled a second bilateral meeting of almost two hours that was to  have been held Saturday afternoon, as well as a two-hour dinner meeting  scheduled for Saturday night.  </P> <P> Moreover, so turbulent did the waters of Marsaxlokk Bay become that they were  forced to hold their five-hour session during the morning aboard a Soviet  cruise ship moored in more sheltered waters, rather than on the missile  cruisers Belknap and Slava, which were struggling to hold their positions 1,000  yards off shore.  </P> <P> The President's top aides had worried that, by offering such concrete  proposals, he might be opening the way for the kind of detailed negotiating  session he wanted to avoid. But they concluded that the risk was necessary to  seize the initiative on U.S.-Soviet relations at a time when some critics have  accused Bush of being too timid.  </P> <P> "The President was informal in delivering his proposals and said he did not  expect a detailed response," according to a U.S. official. "He was not trying  to nail him (Gorbachev) down on specific issues. He was proposing some major  changes in U.S. policy because of the extraordinary changes in Soviet policy in  the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> Bush, laying out his proposals at the beginning of the morning session, called  for carrying forward the negotiations on conventional forces reduction "with  sufficient speed" to permit a special summit meeting in Vienna next year at  which all 23 nations of the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization could gather to sign a treaty.  </P> <P> The Bush package, which a White House official said drew a "quite positive"  response from Gorbachev, also included proposals for speeding up negotiations  for a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement and for other measures designed to assist the  Soviet Union economically and to help it enter the international free market  economy.  </P> <P> In addition, Bush said the United States would host an international conference  next fall to begin work on a framework treaty to control global warming and  invited the Soviets to join that meeting, as well as an earlier "experts-level"  conference on the economic impact of the problem to be held at the White House  next spring.  </P> <P> With first the uprising in the Philippines and then the stormy weather here  distracting Bush and threatening to overshadow the summit, White House  officials scurried around Saturday night briefing reporters and emphasizing  that the President had moved forcefully to lay his proposals before Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Soviet officials, who had planned a joint on-the-record briefing with the  United States for Saturday night until it was scrubbed because of weather  conditions, said they had no immediate comment on the Bush proposals  </P> <P> Bush, in a prepared statement released by the White House, called Saturday's  session "extremely productive." Despite the disruption, with Bush virtually  marooned on the missile cruiser Belknap and apparently unable to travel to the  Soviet liner for the scheduled dinner meeting, the White House announced that  it expected today's schedule to be maintained as originally planned even though  it means forgoing about four additional hours of Bush-Gorbachev sessions.  </P> <P> The schedule calls for a final one-hour session on the Belknap and joint press  statements by the two leaders, after which Bush plans to hold a press  conference and then fly to Brussels.  </P> <P> There, he is scheduled to brief Western allies on the results of the summit.  The White House noted that the weather forecast called for winds to decrease to  15-20 m.p.h. today, which would enable Gorbachev to travel to the Belknap by  launch.  </P> <P> Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, issued a statement saying that Bush  and Gorbachev, each accompanied by seven top advisers, had "a very productive,  informal and substantive meeting" of about two hours' duration to begin the  summit. But with Fitzwater also stranded on the Belknap, an on-the-record press  briefing on that session and on a later one-on-one session between the two  leaders of about three hours was delayed until today.  </P> <P> Bush opened the summit by talking for about an hour, speaking both  extemporaneously and from notes as he laid out his proposals. He reportedly  told Gorbachev: "You already know that I want perestroika to succeed. Now I  want to show that I mean that with a series of specific ideas."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, said a U.S. official who participated in the session, replied: "We  greatly appreciate these proposals. We had come here prepared to ask for  specifics, so we are glad to get them without asking for them."  </P> <P> Bush apparently voiced major criticism of Soviet policy in only one area --  Central America. The official who participated in the session said Bush told  Gorbachev that Soviet policy in Central America is out of step with new  thinking within the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe and that its policy  toward Nicaragua and Cuba is the most problematical factor in U.S.-Soviet  relations.  </P> <P> Bush reportedly told the Soviet leader that while he would like to proceed with  all of the proposals he outlined, he would not be as free to do so as long as  Soviet policy in Central America remains unchanged. The official declined to  discuss Gorbachev's response but said that "there wasn't a meeting of the minds  on that issue."  </P> <P> He also declined to comment on any criticism by Gorbachev of U.S. policy,  except to say that criticism of the U.S. role in helping put down the military  revolt in the Philippines "was not a major factor in the discussion."  </P> <P> Bush's other proposals included:  </P> <P> * Targeting the 1990 summit for completion of a final agreement for granting  the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status, which would help qualify it for  U.S. government credits and credit guarantees.  </P> <P> * Supporting observer status for the Soviet Union at the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks, which Washington has previously opposed, once  the Uruguay round of talks are completed next year.  </P> <P> * Expediting U.S.-Soviet technical cooperation, including specific cooperative  projects such as finance, agriculture, statistics, small business development,  budgetary and tax policy.  </P> <P> * Beginning discussions on a bilateral investment treaty.  </P> <P> * Completing work on the two nuclear testing treaties -- the Threshold Test Ban  Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty -- so they can be signed at  the 1990 summit.  </P> <P> * Jointly supporting Berlin as the site of the 2004 Olympics games.  </P> <P> * Persuading the Soviets to make public details of their military budget, force  posture and weapons production figures, as the U.S. does now.  </P> <P> * Significantly increasing the university student exchange program so that an  additional 1,000 U.S. and 1,000 Soviet college students would be studying in  each other's country by the beginning of the 1991-92 school year.  </P> <P> Earlier Saturday, the seas were so heavy at times and the wind so ferocious  that it appeared uncertain whether the summit would get under way on time.  </P> <P> The 8,575-ton Belknap, where Bush spent the night, and the 12,500-ton Slava  were both anchored at the bow and stern, about 400 yards apart, in Marsaxlokk  Bay.  </P> <P> At times both ships dragged their stern anchors, but the White House issued a  statement saying the relative positions of the ships remained the same and that  the high winds and heavy seas represented "no danger to anyone aboard the  Belknap."  </P> <P> However, because the winds made it extremely difficult for Bush to disembark  from a launch, officials decided to shift the opening sessions to the  25,000-ton, 644-foot Maxim Gorky, a Soviet luxury liner built in 1969 by the  West Germans. It was docked about 1,000 yards away in much calmer waters,  making it possible for Bush to get there and disembark from his launch after a  rather rocky ride.  </P> <P> The two leaders managed to begin their first session on time -- about 10 a.m.  Malta time -- after scrapping a 15-minute arrival ceremony that Gorbachev had  planned for Bush.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, jovial and chatting with aides, arrived in the lobby of the Maxim  Gorky about five minutes before Bush was due and told reporters who tried to  question him, "I'm relaxing right now."  </P> <P> But after Bush arrived, looking weary after an 8-hour, 35-minute flight, a busy  schedule Friday and a night on a rocky ship, the Soviet leader seemed to  delight in joshing with reporters.  </P> <P> Bush, playing it straight, told inquiring reporters, "We will be discussing a  wide array of subjects."  </P> <P> At which point Gorbachev, asked if he planned to propose reductions in Warsaw  Pact forces, replied: "The first thing to do is to eliminate those types of  ships which you cannot board in this kind of weather.  </P> <P> "We will have a secret agenda in this way," he added with a laugh, "to disarm  the 6th Fleet."  </P> <P> Bush, standing beside Gorbachev as reporters wrote down his every word, chose  to ignore the comment about the U.S. naval force that patrols the Mediterranean  and instead chimed in with a weather report: "Calming down. It's a good sign."  </P> <P> With that, Bush declared, "Let's go to work," and both leaders and their  entourages turned and walked toward the meeting room -- the card room on the  ship's promenade deck. Shelves of books lined one wall of the room, and on  another wall hung a portrait of Gorbachev smoking a pipe.  </P> <P> As the parties entered the room, the mood was jovial. Bush shook hands all  around and said, "Feeling pretty good. Fine, just fine. Good night's sleep."  </P> <P> Gorbachev joked about the weather and how it had forced them to change the  meeting site, then cracked a joke about the narrow table at which the two teams  sat facing each other for the meeting.  </P> <P> "It's so narrow that if we don't have enough arguments, we will kick each  other," he declared. Bush managed a faint smile.  </P> <P> Questioned by reporters who were present before the official discussions began,  Gorbachev said, "Da, da" (yes, yes), when asked if the summit would result in  agreements.  </P> <P> Asked what kind of agreements, he said, "Mnogovo," (many), but his comments  were off the cuff and may not have been intended as a substantive statement  about what the summit will produce.  </P> <P> Bush opened the expanded bilateral meeting, which lasted until noon, by  speaking for more than an hour, according to the White House, and laid out more  than a dozen suggestions for economic and political progress in U.S.-Soviet  relations.  </P> <P> Gorbachev spoke at length about his goals for economic and political reform in  the Soviet Union and the discussion also ranged from the economic situation in  Europe to arms control and unrest in Central America.  </P></p>

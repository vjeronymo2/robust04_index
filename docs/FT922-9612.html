			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / People: Wakeling's move: 'routine tidying-up' Richard Wakeling, chief executive of Johnson Matthey, is stepping down from the board of Charter Consolidated, JM's biggest shareholder. The move led to renewed speculation that Charter might be close to deciding what to do with its 38.5 per cent stake in JM which is worth more than half Charter's stock market capitalisation. However, Charles Parker, who is the remaining Charter man on the JM board, describes the move as a 'routine tidying up operation'. Wakeling, 45, had been Charter's acting chief executive before moving across to JM as part of a major management shake-up of Charter's most important affiliate. Parker says Charter is happy with JM's performance and described the relationship between the two companies as 'really stable'. He says there are no plans to nominate additional Charter directors to the JM board and notes Wakeling's appointment as a non-executive director of Costain. Nevertheless, Wakeling's departure is a further sign of the growing independence of the two groups. David Davies, JM's chairman, used to be deputy chairman of Charter but no longer sits on the Charter board. Charter has net cash of Pounds 130m and if it chose to sell its JM stake, which provides around a third of its profits, it could have close to Pounds 400m to spend on an acquisition.</p>

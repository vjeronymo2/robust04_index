The latest tour of Israel and Tunisia made by Russia's  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made it crystal clear that  Russia has been back to the Middle East peace drive.    Since peace negotiations were first set in motion in Madrid  in October 1991, Russia's role has not been particularly  significant as Russia's participation has only been in  accordance with formalities.    Now, Russia is not anymore hesitant to take attitudes which  are inconsistent with those taken by the United States.    It also stressed that it could take advantage of its  traditional influence with Palestinians and some Arab countries  to help revive the PLO-Israeli peace negotiations, suspended  since the Hebron massacre of at least 30 Palestinian worshippers  in Ibrahimi Mosque on February 25.    Russia has declared that it supports the Palestinian demands  of providing protection for the Palestinian people in the  occupied lands and has proposed that another international  conference, along the lines of the Madrid Conference, be held to  break the stalemate of the peace talks, though the U.S. and  Israel have rejected this proposal.    Kozyrev toured Israel and Tunisia Friday [11 March] for  talks  with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat on ways of continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations, with  emphasis on the draft resolution put to the U.N. Security  Council on the Hebron massacre.    After his talks with 'Arafat, Kozyrev said the PLO chairman  has signaled willingness to continue negotiating with Israel,  while 'Arafat said that the Palestinian leadership expects  obvious and explicit guarantees from the co-sponsors of the U.S.  and Russia for safeguarding the Palestinian people in the  occupied Arab territories as well as Islamic and Christian  shrines.    As Kozyrev was having talks with 'Arafat in Tunis, Russia's  representative to the U.N. put forward a draft resolution on the  Hebron massacre to the Security Council.    Official Palestinian sources said that the U.S. and Israel  said they are not satisfied with the provisions of the draft  resolution on the Hebron massacre now discussed by the Security  Council, but they are ready to accept it should the PLO be  committed to continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations.    The sources said that the draft resolution condemns the  Hebron massacre, calls for international presence in the  occupied Arab territories and urges the Israeli Government to  take further measures to disarm Jewish settlers in the occupied  lands.    The resolution also asks the U.S. and Russia to monitor the  implementation of the resolution, which is expected to be voted  Monday.    Tunis-based Arab diplomatic sources said that Russia's  flurry  of diplomatic activity in the Middle East can further strengthen  the Palestinians' attitude and exert pressure on Israel and the  U.S. to help speed up the Middle East peace process.</p>

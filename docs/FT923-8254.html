			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Serbs scent victory in war-torn Bosnia: 'We should all sit down and make peace .. We control 70%. But we only claim 64%' 'YOU see what a big country we have. It took nine hours for me to get to Banja Luka by car,' says Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia. 'We have a functioning government. We have everything. All we need now is a negotiated settlement,' he says, sitting on a dark balcony of the Hotel Bosna in Banja Luka, seat of the republic. Mr Karadzic rejects an offer from a Serb official to order the city hospital to switch off its generator so that the hotel can get power. Candles, and the blue flash of light from a passing armoured personnel carrier, cast shadows on the Serb leaders and soldiers in camouflage uniforms. There is an air of celebration in the hot night. The Serb leaders are noisily swapping stories, after arriving from towns where communications have been knocked out by the war. They appear oblivious to the bursts of automatic weapons fire. A confident Mr Karadzic says he is ready to have an 'all-for-all' prisoner exchange. He blames the delay on Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, who he says refuses to accept the offer. Mr Karadzic does not mention that the Moslem Slav prisoners have no home to return to. They have been destroyed. Mr Karadzic, who politically describes himself as 'a leader of the centre', says he is ready for a peaceful solution in Bosnia. 'One day we should all sit down and make peace in the Balkans, even give up some territory,' he says, adding: 'We now control 70 per cent. But we only claim 64 per cent as ours.' Mr Karadzic says he is ready to make peace because he knows that Serbs, who make up less than one-third of the 4.35m population, have succeeded in carving out their own republic in Bosnia. The political reality is that Bosnia-Hercegovina no longer exists. Mr Karadzic appears unconcerned about western military intervention. 'It would be a bloody big mess - with no clear political goals,' he says. Banja Luka, a 195,000-strong city in north-western Bosnia, is surrounded by villages, some of which have been devastated. Houses have been razed to the ground. Serb forces and local government officials have driven out Moslems and Croats. Houses which have been dynamited, the walls standing, but the roof blown off, bear witness to the process of 'ethnic cleansing'. To reach Banja Luka from Pale, Mr Karadzic's mountain stronghold just east of Sarajevo, drivers travel through corn fields and along dirt roads. Along the way, Serbian army soldiers check identity documents. Crowds of women refugees stand on the roadside under the blazing sun waiting for a passing car to take them to an unknown destination. Many villages have no electricity or telephone lines with the outside world. Soldiers ' all Serb men and many women have been mobilised - sit and drink beer, waiting for the war to end. Battles between Serbs, on one side, and Croats and Moslems on the other, are still taking place around Brcko, once a town of 87,000 people, north of Sarajevo, near the border with Croatia. Amid a barrage of gunfire, a 19-year-old blond soldier says: 'The Ustashe (Croat militia) are just over the bridge.' Brcko's centre has been looted, the houses burnt out. Walls of standing buildings are riddled with bullet holes. A road sign bearing arrows to Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade has been crossed out and shot at. In their place, are signs, hand-printed in large black Cyrillic letters. As if to erase the past, they point to Banja Luka and Belgrade, Serbian capitals. Mr Karadzic proudly points out that the Serbian Republic of Bosnia has its own currency. The notes bear the Serbian symbol of the two-headed white eagle. 'We dropped the communist symbols, and adopted a real Serbian symbol, not like Belgrade,' he boasts. The charm of this bushy-haired Serb leader, a psychiatrist and poet, stands in stark contrast to the senseless destruction and deaths of some 10,000 people in the four-month war in Bosnia. Indeed, local Serbs are outraged at allegations that they are operating concentration camps. A soldier tells how Serbs would never open death camps because hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gipsies during the second world war were killed in an Ustashe concentration camp, operated by pro-Nazi Croats. But prisoners in the Serb-run Manjaca detention camp, about 20km from Banja Luka, appeared cowed. Some are very thin and dressed in old and ragged clothes. On a visit to the camp, Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of Britain's opposition Liberal Democratic party, said: 'This is not a death camp. This is not a concentration camp. It is a prisoner of war camp.' But he described conditions in the camp as vile and said they must be improved. Manjaca is surrounded by barbed wire. Signposts warn that the area has been mined. Col Bozidar Popovic, the camp commander, blames UN sanctions for food, medical and other shortages which the prisoners have to endure. A soldier says: 'It is war. What do you expect. But the prisoners have better conditions than many of our boys at the front.' Col Popovic says: 'I can personally guarantee that the conditions here are 90 per cent better than Izetbegovic's camps for Serbs.' But a prisoner, who identified himself as Havazic, said he had been transferred three days previously from Omarska, where televised scenes of painfully thin prisoners last week shocked the world. 'It was cruel. They broke our ribs,' said Havazic. He is from Kozarac, a village near Prijedor where the camps are centred. Mr Karadzic says it costs Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,570) a day to feed the 3,500 prisoners in Manjaca. He adds that this is a burden on the republic which must now start improving its economy. He offers to pay the bill for visiting foreign journalists. Hotel workers shrugged sceptically. One weary woman shakes her head and says in a cynical voice: 'Sure Karadzic will pay.'</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ALWORTH WAS A PRIZE CATCH  </P> <P> Fittingly, a fellow Hall of Famer gives the quintessential testimonial to the  pass-catching ability of Lance Alworth.  </P> <P> Says Sid Gillman: "Lance is all-time all-pro in my book, a great athlete and a  great competitor."  </P> <P> There probably is no one better qualified than Gillman to venture such an  opinion. He is known as the guru of the passing game, an innovator who  developed many of the ideas in vogue today.  </P> <P> Gillman was the Chargers' first coach, Alworth their first superstar. Alworth  was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, the first American  Football League player to be so honored. Gillman was elected five years later.  </P> <P> "He was the greatest combination runner, jumper and catcher I ever saw,"  Gillman said. "His sense of timing was so great that with him out there, we  felt that the fly pattern was no more a gamble than a run."  </P> <P> Another glowing accolade came from someone Charger fans love to hate, Al Davis.  The managing general partner of the Raiders was an assistant coach with the  Chargers when Alworth was drafted out of Arkansas in 1962. It was Davis who  beat the National Football League to the punch by signing Alworth after the  Sugar Bowl game in New Orleans.  </P> <P> Said Davis: "Lance was one of maybe three players in my lifetime who had what I  would call 'it.' You could see right away he was going to be special."  </P> <P> This despite the fact that Alworth had had only a smattering of receiving  experience in college. He was a running back under Coach Frank Broyles at  Arkansas, and estimated that he "might have caught 20 passes in three seasons  there."  </P> <P> Alworth adjusted so well to his new role that in 11 pro seasons, nine with the  Chargers and two with the Dallas Cowboys, he caught 542 passes for an 18.9-yard  average and 85 touchdowns.  </P> <P> In a seven-season stretch covering 1963 through 1969, Alworth's reception  totals were 61, 61 again, 69, 73, 52, 68 and 64. In the first six of those  seasons, his averages per catch were 19.8, 20.2, 23.2, 18.9, 19.4 and 19.3.  </P> <P> Charlie Hennigan of Houston caught 410 passes in only seven seasons and set a  pro single-season record of 101 (since broken) in 1964, but he had no illusions  about who was the dominant receiver of his day.  </P> <P> After retiring in 1966, Hennigan said, "A player comes along once in a lifetime  who alone is worth the price of admission. That player is Lance Alworth."  </P> <P> Perhaps Alworth's nickname of Bambi, dreamed up by running back Charlie  Flowers, tells best what kind of receiver he was. He had great speed, a long  stride, quick feet and leaping ability that inspired defensive back Ron Hall of  the Boston Patriots to remark, "I think he trains on a trampoline."  </P> <P> It's conceivable that Alworth, not a big guy at 6 feet and 180 pounds, could  have avoided the physical beating he took in football by accepting a bonus  offer from the New York Yankees. He was an outstanding center fielder in  college.  </P> <P> Actually, Alworth was good at every sport he tried. He won 15 letters in high  school in Brookhaven, Miss., and set freshman sprint records of 9.6 and 21.2 in  the 100- and 220-yard dashes at Arkansas. He also played basketball, but said,  "That wasn't one of my stronger sports."  </P> <P> Today, Alworth, 48, runs a storage company in Solana Beach, but his path to  success in business hasn't been as easy as it was in football. He once had a  dry-cleaning business that foundered.  </P> <P> "I went through bankruptcy in '68 and '69," he said. "The man who was supposed  to handle my money didn't do it, so I learned a good lesson. I decided to  handle it myself, and I've had a nice little business here for 14 years.  </P> <P> "We build and manage mini-storage facilities, and we recently closed a deal  with a big New York firm. It's not necessarily lucrative, but being with them  has added a lot of credibility to what we do. I like being recognized as a  decent businessman, not just an ex-football player."  </P> <P> Alworth was born a generation too soon to hit big money in football. He  originally signed with the Chargers for $20,000 a year for two years, plus a  $10,000 bonus.  </P> <P> "I made a career high of $50,000 my last two years," he said.  </P> <P> The only reason Alworth got as much as he did as a rookie was the bidding war  between the AFL and NFL. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first  round and by the Chargers in the second.  </P> <P> "The AFL had an early draft, and Dallas, now Kansas City, drafted me," Alworth  said. "We didn't have agents then, and I went in to see Lamar Hunt in Dallas.  He asked me if I'd sign for $10,000 a year and a $2,000 bonus. I said, 'No,  sir. I'll go to law school before I'll sign for that.'  </P> <P> "They canceled that draft for some reason, and the next time, Dallas didn't  draft me. It was San Francisco and San Diego, and Al Davis worked on me pretty  hard. I talked to the 49er coach, Red Hickey, and told him I wanted a no-cut  contract. He said they didn't give such things, so I walked out. Then he said,  'We'll give you one,' but I said to myself, 'I don't need this.'  </P> <P> "I never talked to the 49ers again, plus I loved Al Davis. My parents did, too,  so the decision was easy."  </P> <P> Alworth recalled his struggle to learn the art of receiving as a rookie with  the Chargers. Their quarterback was Jack Kemp, later a congressman and now  secretary of housing and urban development.  </P> <P> "Kemp threw passes 90 miles an hour," Alworth said. "He could fire it. I was  running quick out patterns, and I wasn't catching the ball. I dropped a couple  of balls that hit me right in the hands.  </P> <P> "I was so bad that one day they made me stay after practice. Joe Madro, the  offensive line coach, was there, and I heard him say, 'We made a mistake on  this guy.' Fortunately, I finally started catching the ball."  </P> <P> Once Alworth caught on, the Chargers' only regret about the 1962 draft was  picking fullback Bob Ferguson of Ohio State ahead of him. Ferguson not only  didn't sign, he was a monumental flop. He lasted only two seasons with the  Pittsburgh Steelers, who also drafted him No. 1, and gained a total of 209  yards.  </P> <P> "Ferguson and I were with the College All-Stars, and I was surprised he wasn't  bigger," Alworth said. "I thought he was a real bruiser. At that time, guys in  the Big Ten got all the press."  </P> <P> Once Alworth perfected moves to complement his natural ability, he drove rival  defensive backs up the wall. He caught at least one pass in all 96 AFL games in  which he played. He made the AFL's all-league team seven years in a row and was  elected unanimously to the AFL's all-time all-star team.  </P> <P> Alworth played hurt, too, despite his fragile build. In 1966, he caught 37  passes in a seven-game span in which he had both arms in casts because of wrist  and hand injuries.  </P> <P> In his second year, 1963, Alworth had one game in which he caught 13 passes and  another in which he totaled 232 yards. He was the biggest single reason why the  Chargers won their only AFL championship.  </P> <P> "I had one of the best 'up' moves, and a great 'out' move," Alworth said. "My  corner move was terrible, though. I was so quick, I made my cuts so fast that I  never really gave my quarterbacks (primarily John Hadl) time to follow me in.  </P> <P> "I had good hand-and-eye coordination and was blessed with above-average speed,  but my quickness was the biggest factor. I was unorthodox in that I caught  everything in my stomach. I didn't like to catch balls above my head, because  if I got hit, I might have dropped them."  </P> <P> Alworth gave much of the credit for his success to Gillman. "Sid was probably  the greatest offensive mind ever to coach the game," he said, "and I feel that  he was 50% or more responsible for my success. Even though they played a lot of  zone then, he figured out ways to get us in one-on-one situations. He was 20  years ahead of his time."  </P> <P> The champion Chargers of 1963 were so good that Alworth said, "We felt we could  have beaten anybody in either league. We had everything going offensively, and  what people didn't realize is that we were also a great defensive team."  </P> <P> One of Alworth's happiest moments was watching Joe Namath and the Jets upset  the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.  </P> <P> "I had no resentment against the NFL until they said we couldn't play with  them," Alworth said. "Everybody talked about the debacles of the first two  Super Bowls when Green Bay won, but they didn't realize that Green Bay beat  everybody like that. Everybody in the NFL behind Green Bay was just another  team.  </P> <P> "I felt that Kansas City wasn't our best team for Super Bowl I. I thought there  were three teams that were better, and that we were one of the three. I was in  the stands when the Jets did it, and I was yelling, 'Go, Joe.' I haven't been  much more excited in my life."  </P> <P> Of all enemy cornerbacks, Alworth had his most memorable duels with Fred (The  Hammer) Williamson.  </P> <P> When Alworth was a rookie in 1962,, Williamson said he didn't have any moves.  After a Charger-Raider game a year later, he said, "Go ask Sid Gillman how many  passes Alworth caught. I caught more than he did, and I play defense."  </P> <P> Recalling Williamson's remarks, Alworth said, "I told Freddy one time, 'I'm  tired of this.' He said, 'You don't understand. We've got to keep this thing  going. I want to be known as the Cassius Clay of the AFL.'  </P> <P> "After that, I said to Sid (Gillman), 'Put me on this kid. If you don't run me  against him, I'm not going to play.' Sid said it would be easier on the other  side, but he went along with me. I caught two touchdowns and went for 96 yards  against Williamson. He never said anything to any of us after that."  </P> <P> Alworth surprised a lot of people when he chose Davis to present him at the  Hall of Fame ceremony in Canton, Ohio.  </P> <P> "Everybody got a little angry with me for that," Alworth said. "But Al was like  a father to me, and he still calls my mom and dad. The thing about him that  nobody knows is that he has helped a lot of people, guys out of work, and not  just ex-Raiders but guys who played on other teams.  </P> <P> "I believe Al is totally misunderstood. To me, he's a gem."  </P> <P> Alworth's election to the Hall of Fame meant even more to him than a just  reward for his achievements.  </P> <P> "I called my dad and said, 'Dad, your son has just been voted into the Hall of  Fame,' " Alworth said. "Then I started crying. I had been trying to prove  myself to him ever since I was in ninth grade.  </P> <P> "One night I scored two touchdowns, but he said to me, 'There were a couple of  times tonight when you kind of dogged it. Remember, no matter how good you are,  there is always somebody better.'  </P> <P> "That brought me down to earth very quickly. It put everything in perspective  for me."  </P></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Sport: The dark world of bribes and bungs - Soccer The video of a man alleged to be Bruce Grobbelaar, the Southampton and former Liverpool goalkeeper, apparently negotiating to throw a match, made distressing viewing for any fan of English soccer. His laugh when he boasted of deliberately letting in a goal was like a kick in the stomach. Suddenly the replay of Andy Cole's hat-trick against Grobbelaar when Newcastle beat Liverpool last November, looks less like the coming of age of a young striker. Instead the eye is caught by Grobbelaar's vain acrobatics as one wonders if he is in the best position, is he reacting fast enough? The accusations have led to careful scrutiny of his play. Grobbelaar denies that he has ever taken bribes or that he has ever tried to fix the result of any game. There have been match-fixing scandals in the far east and in eastern Europe, but rarely in the UK. There have been odd incidents of match-rigging in England, however. Three Sheffield Wednesday players were jailed for betting on their team to lose at Ipswich in 1962. And opponents of Leeds United in the 1970s claimed they rejected bribes to lose matches. Accepting bribes would represent a high risk for a relatively low return for the average English Premier League player, judging by the amounts Grobbelaar is said to have negotiated: from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 150,000. Few earn less than Pounds 5,000 a week plus bonuses, although Grobbelaar is said to have earned much less at Liverpool. He is accused of having tried to deliver an agreed score in at least four matches. If so he succeeded in only one, Newcastle's 3-0 win over Liverpool. Even here Liverpool nearly scored to spoil the 'sting' in the last minutes. To guarantee a result a large number of players and go-betweens need to be involved - in the 1983 Hungarian match-fixing conspiracy 260 players and 14 referees were suspended and 75 people convicted of criminal offences - and that increases the risk of a leak. A player who accepts a bribe risks life suspension, public humiliation and perhaps jail. There are safer traditional fiddles in British soccer. These have a long and vigorous tradition and are seen by those in soccer as victimless crimes; no one counts the tax inspector. Since within the game there are few losers, there is little reason to break ranks. However, fans can suffer when their teams buy or sell players. Sometimes, managers receive a cut of the fee - several have clauses in their contracts giving them a percentage of profits they make dealing in players. Sometimes a player who is unfit or out of form is picked because he, or the manager, wants to safeguard his transfer value. Occasionally a player who wants a transfer plays badly. The FT spoke to two soccer insiders. One is the former chairman of a lower division club - referred to as the Director - the other was an administrator of a Premier League club, the Administrator. BONUSES Since attendances are related to league position and cup runs it makes sense to tie expenditure to revenue through incentives. But some managers do not like them. In any case they must be carefully thought out. One chairman of a lower-division club introduced special bonuses for a popular striker: Pounds 50 for each goal with an extra bonus for a hat-trick. The striker would share his bonuses with the rest of the team. The consequence, says the Director, was that the other players started passing to the striker even if they were in better scoring positions. He says he once saw a player on a breakaway stop and wait for the star to catch up, passing up a certain goal in the hope of his share of a hat-trick bonus. HOLIDAYS Holidays are normally taxable perks, but not for leading football clubs which find two-week post-season trips to some sunny resort essential for team-building. Wives and mistresses come too, but often only for one week. Wives come out for the first week, mistresses for the second. Clubs discovered that if they organised things the other way round careless gossip from hotel staff could alert wives to the existence of mistresses and that does not help build team spirit. CASH Anyone who has covered non-league soccer, where clubs often make most of their money at the bar, has seen soccer's cash economy at work. The manager and the players come into the clubhouse after the game. The manager walks over to the bar and the players crowd round him, but instead of reaching into the pocket of his sheepskin coat the boss sticks out his hand. The barman hands over a wad of notes and the manager doles these out to the players. Turnstile fiddles used to be a soccer commonplace. Clubs would turn off the meters at 3pm, or slightly before, and anyone who came in after that was not counted in the attendance. Clubs would often allow managers or star players to put one of their men on a turnstile and keep the takings, or even keep a percentage of the takings of one stand. When big clubs deigned to go to little clubs for friendlies, the visiting manager would often expect a similar arrangement. But the days when club secretaries spent Saturday afternoon in tiny rooms under the main stand counting mountains of small coins and sorting out players' boot money are gone. A high proportion of tickets are paid for with cheques or credit cards. Furthermore, in the aftermath of the Bradford fire and the Hillsborough disaster, clubs can no longer lie about attendances. It is much easier to calculate the gate at an all-seater stadium. Safety inspectors and local authority licensing officials lurk at every game, and any turnstile may come under their scrutiny. In any case a growing number of clubs have computerised turnstiles which allow safety officers to keep an exact track on how many fans there are in each part of the ground. If a club needs cash for a bung it will often come from the chairman's pocket or from one of his other businesses. THE BUNG In the safety of the High Court last year Alan Sugar, Tottenham Hotspur chairman, said Brian Clough, then manager of Nottingham Forest, 'liked a bung': cash to arrange the transfer of players from Forest. Clough denied the accusation. But while bungs for managers are not uncommon, agents benefit most often. Most top players have agents or commercial representatives. A well-organised manager who wants to re-sign a player will often take the precaution of reaching a quiet agreement with the agent before starting negotiations with the player. The agent may well find he is well compensated for the commission he loses by persuading the player to accept too low a contract. Where a player is coveted by more than one club, an agent will find his good will in demand. Such payments are usually made in cash, although the agent may find his reward wrapped up in payments for other services. LOYALTY BONUSES When a player signs a new contract he will receive a signing on fee, which can be quite large. In each year of the contract, on the anniversary of its signing, he will receive a loyalty bonus. The loyalty bonuses and signing on fee together can add as much as 50 per cent to the total value of the contract. If a player asks for a transfer in writing he will lose the next loyalty bonus. So players must master the trick of forcing clubs to sell them without making a written request. Furthermore, if a player is transferred part of the way through the year there can often be some debate as to whether he is entitled to the loyalty bonus. Often, especially where a player is being unloaded to a less wealthy club, the selling club will pay the loyalty bonus to encourage the player to leave and take his lucrative contract with him. CONTRACTS Contracts are worth rather less than the average fan might think. For a rising star reaching the end of his contract and keen to move to a bigger club the best policy may be re-sign with his current club. He need not surrender the freedom that being out of contract brings if he makes an oral deal with the club that it will sell him if a big team bids for him. The player lands two signing-on bonuses and the club receives a much larger transfer fee than it would have done if he were out of contract. If the club tries to renege on the deal, the star can stop playing well, driving down his transfer value and weakening the team. The threat is usually enough, but it does happen. VAT Football clubs live in terror of the Vat inspector. But the Vat inspector can be a friend of the indebted club because he is a patient creditor. The Director found it could be in the interests of a club to have the Vat inspector slap a distraint order on a club which effectively locks up its assets. Since the club must pay Vat before any other creditor, the effect was to persuade the others to stop clamouring for their cash, knowing that if they forced the club to the wall they would collect nothing. THE PLAYER POOL At many clubs there are two player pools in which money is collected for players. There is the one that exists and the one that does not. The one that exists is the one the manager refers to when he talks of players being fined for being booked or some misdemeanour at training: being late, swearing, forgetting some of his kit. Usually these fines, even for bookings in a match, are small: Pounds 10 or Pounds 5 a time. But by the end of the season the average squad of professional footballers will have committed enough offences to pay for a good night out. The player pool that does not exist is the one that is filled with payments for unofficial work. Players generally hate meeting the public. Fans like meeting players. Often, wealthy and corporate fans or sponsors who own boxes at football grounds will pay players to come up and meet their guests before or after the match. These payments can run to several hundreds of pounds for a session of glad-handing. A solitary star may pocket the cash, but often groups of players go along together or perhaps the players take turns, and the money goes into a quite substantial pool of untaxed cash, which, of course, does not exist.</p>

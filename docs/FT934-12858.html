			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Howard set to ease police fears MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, is expected this week to go a considerable way towards meeting the police objections to the Sheehy report on police pay and conditions. Senior police officers are confident that after their intensive lobbying of the government, Mr Howard will dilute proposals on fixed contracts so that they apply only to senior ranks, as at present. The report recommended an initial 10-year contract, with subsequent five-yearly renewals. Officers argue that bright candidates would be discouraged from applying to police forces if they knew their initial appointments were to be for a fixed period only. Mr Howard is also likely to agree that the Sheehy criteria for performance-related pay are too complex. Instead, a simpler scheme is expected to be implemented. Mr Howard will be concerned to defuse the concerns raised among police and the public by the recommendations. One fear among police officers is that any attempt by the government to try to relate pay to performance, along the lines used in industry, could backfire. Many types of police work, such as those involving work in the community rather than the pursuit or arrest of criminals, cannot be monitored in pure performance terms, they argue. In response to the proposals to streamline management, police groups have said that many of the force's cumbersome administrative structures have already been dismantled. In a further attempt to head off some of the recommendations, Mr Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, has announced plans for a shake-up of senior ranks at Scotland Yard. He said the quickest and most cost-effective way of achieving this would be for the government to pay for a redundancy scheme.</p>

According to the newspaper, which is published in this  capital, Foreign Minister Amorim referred indirectly to the U.S.  embargo against Cuba at a lunch with Lage on 3 February when he  condemned some countries' adoption of unilateral measures,  disregarding international law.    According to this publication, Amorim kept reiterating such  actions undermine both Brazil and Cuba's development.    Commenting on this, Amorim said his country rejects the  imposition of extraterritorial law (Torricelli Law) on third  countries, although he did not specifically mention the  Torricelli Law, also known as the law for democracy in Cuba.    Amorim discussed his expectations regarding political  changes  in Cuba, and expressed his support for Cuba's reintegration in  the hemisphere.    He pointed out that Brazil and Cuba can join forces to  overcome their weaknesses, and cited as an example the benefits  that should result from a recent bilateral agreement, by which  the Brazilian market will obtain Cuban medicines.    Amorim said the Federal Government will distribute the  medicines to the poorest people of this country for free.    Amorim also referred to cooperation with Cuba in sugar,  science, and technical areas.    Meanwhile, in an interview by a Brazil news agency, Lage  emphasized that the U.S. blockade against his country has caused  many problems, and he said Latin American rejection of this  aggression is important.    According to the news agency, Lage told Amorim that Cuba is  interested in paying off a $30-million debt with Brazil, making  the medicines' agreement possible. The value of the medicine is  greater than the debt.    Lage noted that the medicines' agreement will also promote  Cuban-Brazilian economic relations, and added that Brazilian  businessmen are interested in investing in Cuba, especially in  tourism, health, agriculture, and biotechnology.    According to JORNAL DO BRASILIA and the Brazil news agency,  Cuba has placed special emphasis on tourism and oil. The  newspaper says Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum], a state oil  company, invested in oil exploration in Cuba, but stopped its  operations. The publication stresses that the Cuban Government  wants Petrobras to resume those activities.    According to the sources, Lage believes his visit to Brazil  will help achieve an increase in bilateral trade.    JORNAL DO BRASILIA says that, according to Lage, in 1992,  Cuban cash purchases to Brazil totaled $47 million, and  consisted mainly of food, spare parts, chemical products, and so  on.    On the third day of his visit to Brazil, Lage will lunch  with  Health Minister Henrique Santillo, then later he will meet with  the vice president of the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Associations.  The itinerary will conclude with a news conference.    On Saturday, Lage and his delegation will arrive in Rio de  Janeiro for a 48-hour stay. Lage's official visit will conclude  on Monday with his departure to Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Report sets out an ambitious remit for self-regulation THE ENORMOUS painting of Henry VIII in the Barber-Surgeon's Hall in London hung uneasily yesterday behind the members of the Cadbury committee preaching the message of greater power-sharing in corporate boardrooms. After 18 months, Pounds 160,000 in expenses and countless hours of committee time, the final version of the report on the financial aspects of corporate governance offered an ambitious and perhaps last chance for self-regulation to work. At the heart of the document is the code of best practice, which encompasses boards of directors, non-executive directors, executive directors and reporting and controls of companies. The annual reports of all quoted companies from June 30 next year must include a statement saying they comply with the code, or spec-ifying any divergence from it. In addition to the code there is a detailed series of recommendations on good practice which are powerful but not enforceable. Non-executive directors: Boards will require a minimum of three non-executive directors, at least two of whom should be independent. When they first join, directors should be given a schedule of matters reserved for decision by the full board, which should lay down rules to determine any transactions that are considered material. To ensure their independence, non-executive directors should not participate in share-option schemes nor receive a pension from the company. They should be selected by a nomination committee, which should have a majority of non-executive directors and make a proposal to the board. On appointment, non-executives should receive a letter setting out their duties, term of office, remuneration and its review. Board sub-committees: The remuneration committee's membership should be set out in the directors' report, and its chairman should be available to answer questions at the annual meeting. Audit committees should be formally constituted as sub-committees of the main board, be given written terms of reference and normally meet at least twice a year. The external auditor and the head of internal audit should attend, as should the finance director. Membership should be disclosed in the annual report. There should be at least one audit committee meeting with the auditors each year - without executive board members present - to discuss any unresolved issues of concern. It should be able to obtain outside professional advice, and full access to information to investigate any matters within its terms of reference. Financial reporting: The report and accounts should contain a coherent narrative of the company's performance and prospects alongside suitable figures. Setbacks should be dealt with as well as successes. Directors' responsibilities: There should be a statement covering the legal requirement for directors to prepare financial statements each year that give a true and fair view; and their responsibility to maintain adequate accounting records, safeguard assets of the company, prevent and detect fraud, and consistently apply suitable accounting policies and standards. The committee's main recommendations are: Boards of all listed companies should comply with the code of best practice. There should be a statement about their compliance and any reasons in areas of non-compliance in accounts for years after June 30 1993. The statement of compliance should be reviewed by the auditors before publication, where the statements can be objectively verified. The Auditing Practices Board should consider issuing guidance. All parties concerned with corporate governance - particularly institutional investors - should use their influence to encourage compliance. The committee's sponsors should appoint a new committee by the end of June 1995 to examine how far there is compliance and implementation of the other recommendations, and consider wider issues of corporate governance. The Companies Act should be amended so directors' service contracts should not exceed three years without shareholders' approval. Interim accounts should include information about balance sheets and they should be reviewed by auditors. Regulations under the 1991 Companies Act should be reviewed to ensure the disclosure of the company's audit and non-audit fees paid to the audit firm. The accountancy profession should draw up guidelines on the rotation of audit partners. Directors should report on the effectiveness of internal controls, and the auditors should report on that statement. The accountancy profession should draw up criteria for assessing the systems. Directors should state in the report and accounts that the company is a going concern. Accountants should develop guidance on that. Legislation should be considered to back reporting on internal controls. The government should consider extending to auditors of all companies the protection given to those in the regulated sector so they can report reasonable suspicion of fraud freely to the authorities. The accountancy profession should consider the question of illegal acts other than fraud, and how to improve standards and procedures to strengthen the standing and independence of auditors. Institutional investors should disclose their policies on the use of their voting rights. The committee's successor body should consider issues including the application of the code to smaller listed companies; directors' training; disclosure of directors' remuneration; the inclusion of cashflow information in interim reports; procedures for putting forward resolutions at general meetings; and developments on the nature and extent of auditors' liability.

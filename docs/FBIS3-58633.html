During six hours of questioning Mr Major, who became Foreign  Secretary in July 1989, then Chancellor before succeeding Lady  Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990, denied any role in for  formulating, considering amending or interpreting policy on  defence exports to Iraq.    He said he had not been told of an alleged relaxation of  guidelines on military exports to Iraq until November 1992 after  the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial. He still did not  accept that any relaxation had been put into practice.    Mr Major said he had not been involved in the decision in  1990--by which time he was Chancellor--to investigate and later  prosecute three Matrix Churchill executives. That was a matter  for Customs, not ministers, he added.    He said he had not been briefed about the operation of the  guidelines on exports to Iraq and Iran when he became Foreign  Secretary in July 1989. During his three months at the Foreign  Office the issue had arisen only once, when the Cabinet rejected  British Aerospace's plans to sell the Hawk trainer aircraft to  Iraq.    Asked if he knew that following the Iranian fatwa on Salman  Rushdie, civil servants operated stricter export rules for Iran  than for Iraq, Mr Major said: "Neither at that stage nor later  was I involved in formulation of the guidelines, consideration  of the guidelines, amendment of the guidelines nor  interpretation of the guidelines."    When Miss Presiley Baxendale, QC [Queen's Counsel], counsel  to the inquiry, returned to the issue, Mr Major replied: "We  have been dancing around this point for some time. You're asking  me to make a judgment at a distance and not a judgment at the  time.    "With great respect I don't think that is a judgment I  should  make. I think that is a judgment for the inquiry."    Lord Justice Scott told Mr Major that the inquiry knew that  the rules on exports to Iraq had been relaxed.    Mr Major said: "Well, I don't know that and I didn't know  that." He had not known of any discussion on changing the  guidelines until he had been at No 10 for two years. "The first  time I was aware they had been looked at and a change considered  was on Nov 13, 1992, when I received a memo from my private  secretary to that effect. "    Then, amid the flurry of political and media inquiries  following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill case, he had  ordered "a massive search of files" to establish what he had  been told.    "One of the charges at the time was that, because I had been  Chancellor, because I had been Foreign Secretary, because I was  Prime Minister, I must have known what was going on in the  undergrowth."    A memo from Mr Stephen Wall, then his private secretary,  mentioned a meeting between three junior ministers--Mr Alan  Clark, Mr William Waldegrave and Lord Trefgarne--in December  1988 at which the wording of the guidelines was revised.    Mr Major marked the passage in the memo with a cross. "It's  my cross on the paper because that is the first time I knew of  it."    Days later further research by Mr Nicholas Bevan, then a  senior Foreign Office official suggested the revised version of  the guidelines had not been put into practice.    Senior ministers were uncertain about how to respond to the  barrage of parliamentary questions facing them. Having by now  announced the Scott Inquiry they decided against further  statements to Parliament.    Mr Major said: "There was a great deal of uncertainty over  what had happened over the 1988 wording. Had it been implemented  or had it not? I couldn't know which was right. It is very  dangerous to respond to Parliament when there is a doubt."    As Chancellor from 1989-90 papers relating to a  Cabinet-level  meeting on the future of trade with Iraq were circulated to his  private office. The meeting, chaired by Mr Hurd in July 1990  weeks before the invasion of Kuwait, decided to relax controls  on defence exports to Iraq. Mr Major said he did not see the  papers nor attend the meeting. They were passed to a junior  minister.    As Prime Minister, issues concerning the Matrix Churchill  prosecution were raised with him. Whitehall was concerned about  the possibility of ministers setting a precedent by appearing as  witnesses. The usual practice was for civil servants to  represent them.    Mr Major said he sought the Attorney-General's advice and  was  told that Mr Clark and Lord Trefgarne should appear at the trial  if called.    The use of public interest immunity certificates in the case  was the first time he had come across them in practice, said Mr  Major. He had not inquired about the contents of the documents  they covered and was not involved in the decision to sign them.    Later he and Mr Hurd agreed that if the certificates were  overturned and sensitive documents were released to the defence,  it would not be right for the Government to try to stop the  trial.    The inquiry was adjourned until later this week.</p>

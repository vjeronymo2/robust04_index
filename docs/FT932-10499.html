			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Labour sacks Lord Desai for contradicting policy LORD DESAI, Labour's economic spokesman in the Lords, has been sacked for undermining the shadow cabinet's policy by advocating the abolition of zero-rated value added tax on some goods. Lord Desai, who also speaks on health, was sacked within 24 hours of his views being quoted in the Commons by Mr John Major, the prime minister, as he moved to blunt an attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Mr Smith had joined Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in harrying the government over breaking election pledges by imposing VAT on domestic fuel and suggesting that its extension to food, transport, newspapers and children's clothing could be the next step. The prime minister responded by quoting an article by Lord Desai in the the leftwing Tribune newspaper in which he argued the case for ending the zero rate of VAT. Lord Desai's views were also quoted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who contended that Labour had one taxation policy in the Commons and another in the Lords. It was the second time in six weeks that the prime minister had used Lord Desai's views to wrongfoot Mr Smith. This was stressed yesterday by Lord Richard, the Labour leader in the Lords, when, in response to pressure from shadow cabinet colleagues, he took the unusual step of dismissing Lord Desai from his frontbench team. Lord Desai, a professor at the London School of Economics who was made a life peer in 1991, said he readily accepted that he should return to the back benches. Lord Desai's views on health as expressed in the Lords have not always coincided with those of Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary. Lord Desai was recently accused of departing from official policy by expressing broad support for the government's proposals to curb expenditure on drugs by extending the list of products not available for prescription on the National Health Service.</p>

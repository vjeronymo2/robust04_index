			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Yudin, deputy chairman of the </F> Magadan Oblast Property Fund, by Vladimir Androsenko, RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA reporter, Magadan: "The North is Not Rushing to Applaud  Chubays"]    [Text] The Federal Assembly must give territories the right  to make their own decisions regarding privatization, says  Vladimir Yudin, deputy chairman of the Magadan Oblast Property  Fund. A RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent talks with him.    [Yudin] I would like to begin with a comparison. As we know,  in the Far North nature is extremely fragile. The wounds that it  suffers take decades to heal. Just as capable of being wounded  is the north's particular economy, which is based on mining and  fishing. Production, which is a single technological process,  reacts to network violations by declining, and this has a severe  effect on workers. Such ruptures are the result of too hurried  privatization "according to the Chubays method," which is  characterized not by economic expediency but by a practice  well-known to us from the past - that of the company campaign,  of the most rapid 100-percent seizure.    Unfortunately, in many parts of Russia it is too late to  stop  and look into matters because everything has been given away.  But that is not the case here. In Magadan Oblast privatization  has proceeded slowly until now. The first to be subject to it  were trade, the consumer sphere, and transportation. The  foundation, however -- ore concentration combines and the fish  industry --remained untouched. For us this was a good chance to  preserve our economic potential. I feel that the oblast duma and  oblast administration, in developing a privatization plan for  1994, will be obliged to make corrections that are directed at  raising its effectiveness.    [Androsenko] In your opinions, what should be the  priorities?    [Yudin] First of all, it should be noted that the idea of  voucher privatization has suffered a crash. Meanwhile, the  powers that be are forcefully pushing the voucher variant. Why?  The answer is obvious -- this is advantageous to our nouveau  riche, to those who have amassed a great deal of money through  speculation and other criminal activities, who bought up  vouchers at an inexpensive price, and who, taking advantage of  corruption, became the overseers of the most profitable  enterprises. I think that the rejection of voucher privatization  and the transition to routine privatization using money will be  more fruitful.    The second question -- monopolies and "key" enterprises. Is  it efficient, let us say, to put the only Nefteprodukt  [Petroleum product] enterprise in the oblast into private hands  when it has at its disposal all fuel capacities and fuel lines  in the territory? Pilots, automobile drivers and villagers are  now dependent on it, but the possibilities for regulating its  operations at least in some way have already been lost.    Or let us take transportation by motor vehicle. Practically  all motor-transport depots in the oblast have been privatized  and control over solutions to general territorial problems has  been lost. The tragedy of the frozen village of Yagodnyy had a  great deal to do, I think, with the impossibility of interesting  private car owners in transporting coal.    [Androsenko] Vladimir Dmitriyevich, the first stage has  practically been completed. What will the consequences be?    [Yudin] One of them will be the fragmenting of government  property into small parts with an inadequate level of management  and responsibility. In our oblast we have not heard of any  privatized enterprises that have begun to work more productively  or dependably. As far as I know the same is true all over Russia.    A second important consideration is that the country is  being  deprived of a normal labor market. Take a look. A furious  emphasis is being placed on property owners. Moreover, this is  done with reference to Western society. Yet this is not true. In  the West the majority of the population is comprised not of  owners but of ordinary people who work for someone else and who  receive a dignified remuneration for their work. As a rule,  owners there have assets to develop production and pay workers.  Here the labor collective, having exchanged 51 percent of stock  for vouchers, must supply and develop production as well as  supply its own needs, but it does not have the assets to do  this. Basically, the government is simply freeing itself of the  responsibility for the fates of millions of people. I do not  believe that this is right and I think it will have a  considerable negative impact on reform.    Our stockholders often do not even understand the real cost  of fixed AO [joint-stock company] capital, of investments and  degree of dependability. They are bewitched by the round figures  of promised dividends and no one cares about anything else.    [Androsenko] Yes, television pictures of Muscovites storming  the offices of Olbk when stock was issued seemed symptomatic to  me. Such things do not occur here. Is it that northerners are  more prone to analysis or is it simply hard to get them moving?    [Yudin] The main thing here is that northerners were first  among Russians to face the uncertainty of tomorrow. In the Far  North we can see with special clarity the gap between the pretty  stories of radical reformers and the actual situation. Here  geology, building and agriculture have been almost completely  destroyed, gold extraction is on the decline and mining towns  are closing. Under such conditions it is difficult to expect  people to invest assets in enterprises that can become bankrupt  at any time.    There have been a few things that have put us on the alert.  The Russian Privatization Program for 1994 was passed without  the participation of representatives and without summarizing  1993 results. Judging by A. Chubays' statements, such an  analysis would be undesirable for him, and it is understandable  that he would attempt to keep it from a vote.    Meanwhile, the privatization process is acquiring more of an  administrative and command nature. It is strange that the  directives of the former Gosplan [State Planning Committee] are  considered bad while those of Goskomimushchestvo [State Property  Committee] are looked upon as good. And it is not important that  the word "directive" somehow does not correspond to A. Chubays'  favorite word -- "market." For example, despite the order from  above, for over a year now we have been unable to sell all of  the stock of Khasynskiy Building Materials Plant -- the  population will not buy it. On the other hand, the hurried  fulfillment of last year's presidential decree on selling motor  vehicle enterprises by 1 August, in my opinion had a negative  effect on the situation in the oblast. In other words, a clear  transition from one administrative system to another, and one  that is even more severe, is evident.    We feel it is essential that the Federal Assembly make a  decision that will give territories the right to deal with basic  questions involving privatization. Undoubtedly, it is necessary  to privatize enterprises and to place them into private hands,  but not in the way that Chubays demands, wholesale, and by the  end of the first six months of the year without fail. We wish to  implement matters openly, without fuss, and to the greatest  advantage for the working man, the new owner and the government.</p>

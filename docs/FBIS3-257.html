A  resolution adopted unanimously at a Council meeting in Cape Town  urged it to ensure that the people of Natal were freely able to  exercise their right to vote. Supporting the motion, ANC  [African National Congress] Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa  said Natal posed the greatest challenge to the TEC's authority.  He said people were being trained and armed by white  conservative farmers in Northern Natal with the apparent aim of  "serving the stated goal of certain parties" that no election  would be held in the territory. "The TEC cannot pussy-foot  around this issue. We have to act firmly and demonstrate that  the TEC's powers are enforceable."    Mr Ramaphosa said the TEC had to reaffirm its commitment to  free and fair elections throughout the country on April 27 and  no single province should be exempted. With the co-operation of  the South African Government, a climate conducive to free and  fair elections could be created in Natal.    Chairman Zam Titus said important steps had already been  taken to ensure that elections went ahead unhindered throughout  the country. "We are now looking at reinforcing what is there  already."</p>

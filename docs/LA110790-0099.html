Taggart received a $50,000 consulting fee from  now-defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan within a week after he left office, the  San Francisco Chronicle reported. The check was written 27 days after Taggart  approved a request by Lincoln involving $900 million in taxpayer-insured  deposits, the newspaper said. Taggart has denied wrongdoing in the case.  </P></p>

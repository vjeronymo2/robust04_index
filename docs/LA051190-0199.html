			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAULEY: 'TODAY,' FAMILY CLASHED  </P> <P> Jane Pauley says she left NBC's "Today" show, where she was co-host for 13  years, because the job was in conflict with her family life.  </P> <P> "NBC was very serious about keeping me," Pauley told USA Weekend in this week's  issue.  </P> <P> "We were in a mutual state of disbelief. They did not believe I was serious."  </P> <P> Pauley, who left the morning show five months ago, has exchanged pre-dawn  rising for daytime duties at NBC that include substituting for Tom Brokaw on  the evening news for three weeks starting May 23.  </P> <P> She says she is a less-stressed mother to her three children, 6-year-old twins  Ross and Rachel and 3-year-old Thomas.  </P> <P> "They're getting a more relaxed bedtime routine," says Pauley. "I'm more likely  to linger over a bedtime story because I'm less anxious to get to bed myself."  </P></p>

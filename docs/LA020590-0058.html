			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BREAK UP CLIPPERS  </P> <P> Doctor, doctor, come quick! They've brought in another one!"  </P> <P> "Don't tell me."  </P> <P> "Another Clipper."  </P> <P> "I told you not to tell me."  </P> <P> "He's hurt, doctor."  </P> <P> "Of course he's hurt, nurse. He's a Clipper."  </P> <P> "Leg injury, doctor."  </P> <P> "Wow, there's a surprise."  </P> <P> "His name is Gary Grant."  </P> <P> "I enjoyed all his movies."  </P> <P> "No. Gary."  </P> <P> "Oh."  </P> <P> "Where should I put him?"  </P> <P> "Over there, by the others."  </P> <P> "We're running out of room in there, doctor."  </P> <P> "I know. It looks like a ski lodge. We're turning into Clippers Sinai."  </P> <P> "Mr. Harper's appointment is at 3."  </P> <P> "And Mr. Manning?"  </P> <P> "His checkup is at 4."  </P> <P> "What about those other basketball people, the ones with the hamstrings?"  </P> <P> "Those were Lakers, doctor."  </P> <P> "Strange how all these L.A. players hurt their legs, isn't it?"  </P> <P> "Yes, doctor."  </P> <P> "What do you suppose causes it?"  </P> <P> "I don't know. Maybe they don't pump enough air into their tennis shoes."  </P> <P> "Hmmm."  </P> <P> "Or maybe they don't do enough walking. These Los Angeles people drive  everywhere, you know."  </P> <P> "You may have something there."  </P> <P> "The Clippers shouldn't have shoe contracts. They should have cane contracts."  </P> <P> "True."  </P> <P> "I mean, these guys really take it on the shins."  </P> <P> "How are the Clippers doing, by the way?"  </P> <P> "They're showing a lot of heart."  </P> <P> "Well, they'll probably break that before the season's over."  </P> <P> "They've invented a new lineup -- the No-Guard offense."  </P> <P> "Who brings the ball up?"  </P> <P> "Nobody. After every opponent's basket, the Clipper coach calls a timeout. That  way they get the ball at mid-court."  </P> <P> "Very clever."  </P> <P> "The Clippers are thinking about starting five 7-footers. The Quintuple  Towers."  </P> <P> "Might just work."  </P> <P> "Or, sometimes they use David Rivers."  </P> <P> "David Rivers? Didn't he used to play for the Lakers?"  </P> <P> "Not so you'd know it."  </P> <P> "How about trading for a guard?"  </P> <P> "Funny you should mention that. Elgin Baylor just called me. He's about to  trade for a guy, but first he wants us to do something for him."  </P> <P> "Namely?"  </P> <P> "He wants us to X-ray the guy's legs."  </P> <P> "I see."  </P> <P> "Then he wants us to make the guy run 82 simulated NBA games on a treadmill."  </P> <P> "I don't blame him."  </P> <P> "Then he wants us to do an arthroscopic exam, a total leg massage, a blood  transfusion, a cartilage transplant, an athlete's foot inspection, and then  soak the guy's legs for four hours in boiling Perrier with lime."  </P> <P> "OK."  </P> <P> "Then he wants us to telephone every living relative of the guy and ask them if  they have any history of leg problems."  </P> <P> "Will do."  </P> <P> "Then he wants us to strike the guy's knee with a hammer, every 10 minutes."  </P> <P> "To check his reflexes?"  </P> <P> "No. To check the hammer."  </P> <P> "Anything else?"  </P> <P> "Yes. He wants to know if there's anything we can do to guarantee a minor leg  injury, and not another one that's going to take a year to heal."  </P> <P> "No. Tell Mr. Baylor I'm sorry, but all I can do is make a suggestion."  </P> <P> "What?"  </P> <P> "Tell him to trade every healthy body he has, before it's too late."  </P> <P> "You think so?"  </P> <P> "How about that Charles Smith person? Are his legs OK?"  </P> <P> "Far as I know."  </P> <P> "Then get Elgin on the phone and tell him to trade that man, immediately!"  </P> <P> "Really?"  </P> <P> "Definitely. The man is afflicted with Clipper Syndrome. It's only a matter of  time."  </P> <P> "What should he trade Smith for?"  </P> <P> "Anybody. Anything. Trade him for Ralph Sampson. His legs already are shot.  It'll save the Clippers a lot of time and trouble."  </P> <P> "What about Danny Ainge or Jeff Malone?"  </P> <P> "Absolutely not! I have examined the legs of Mr. Ainge and Mr. Malone, and they  are perfect! Don't you dare trade them to the Clippers! These men have families  to think about."  </P> <P> "They're probably insured."  </P> <P> "Are you kidding? No insurance company in America will write a policy on a  Clipper today. They've already paid off a fortune to these people. It's called  dribble indemnity."  </P> <P> "I know what you mean. Marques Johnson, Norm Nixon, Derek Smith, Manning,  Harper, Grant . . . the Clippers could have won three world championships by  now, if they played wheelchair basketball."  </P> <P> "Don't be cruel."  </P> <P> "Maybe we should just put them out of their misery."  </P> <P> "How do you mean?"  </P> <P> "They shoot Clippers, don't they?"  </P> <P> "Oh, well. Maybe the All-Star break will help them heal up."  </P> <P> "Don't say 'break' around the Clippers. Besides, there's only one thing that  could help that team."  </P> <P> "What's that?"  </P> <P> "If the All-Star break lasted two years."  </P></p>

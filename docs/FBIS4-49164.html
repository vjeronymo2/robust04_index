			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fung Wai-kong] </F>   [Text] Expatriate civil servants have been shut out of an  all-important meeting next week between the government staff and  Lu Ping, the top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong  affairs. They have been given the cold shoulder by the  increasingly assertive Preliminary Working Committee, which has  set up talks between Mr Lu and representatives of at least five  of the most influential groups for local staff. The Association  of Expatriate Civil Servants was not invited, even though it had  already lodged a request through the local branch of XINHUA (the  New China News Agency) to meet Mr Lu, director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.    The most influential of the five local groups are the Senior  Non-Expatriate Officers' Association (SNEOA) representing mainly  middle-ranking officials, and the Hong Kong Chinese Civil  Servants' Association, which speaks for about 90,000 local staff  of all ranks. The chairman of the SNEOA, John Luk Woon-cheung,  revealed that the invitation to meet Mr Lu had been made  informally by officials of XINHUA. "We have been in good  contact with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, but it will  still be good to see Mr Lu in Hong Kong," he said. The  executive committee will meet during the week to decide what  messages they will convey to Mr Lu.    Expatriate civil servants were disappointed that they were  being left out of the talks. Governor Chris Patten has already  been snubbed by Mr Lu, who has decided he had no time to spare  in his hectic schedule.    Expats' chairman Royston Griffey said it would be  unfortunate  if they were barred from the dialogue between civil servants and  the incoming sovereign power, because they formed a significant  part of the administration and would remain so even after 1997.  "It's important to break the ice in our relations as soon as  possible," Mr Griffey said, referring to the lack of a response  from XINHUA to earlier requests for a meeting.    Mr Lu's decision to meet local staff associations was  further  evidence of an effort by China to marginalise Mr Patten from the  process of planning the government of the future Special  Administrative Region. Mr Patten said on Wednesday that if Mr  Lu's schedule was too busy to meet him, it must be too busy to  meet any senior civil servants.    However, the Governor's spokesmen, Mike Hanson, said the  Government did not feel that the scheduled meeting next Saturday  was a further snub to Mr Patten.    Rather it was good for Mr Lu to hear all shades of opinions,  including those of the civil servants associations. "The  Government has no difficulty about these contacts," said Mr  Hanson.    In Beijing, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy  director Wang Feng-chao again urged all civil servants,  including expatriates, to stay on after 1997. He reiterated  that only the principal official posts as defined in the Basic  Law had to be filled by Chinese citizens. The other posts  remained open to all.</p>

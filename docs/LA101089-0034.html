			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party begins its annual  conference today with its popularity at an eight-year low, the economy in  trouble and public rumblings that her free-market revolution has gone too far.  For the 63-year-old British leader, the four-day meeting in the north England  resort of Blackpool is shaping up as one of the most difficult since she won  power a decade ago. New opinion polls show the Conservatives 7 to 11 percentage  points behind the socialist Labor Party, with many voters apparently opposed to  several of Thatcher's key programs, including a new property tax.  </P></p>

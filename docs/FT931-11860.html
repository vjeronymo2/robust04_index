			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / People: HSBC's Smith moves to take on Midland's international interests The integration of Midland Bank's international business with those of HSBC Holdings after last year's takeover has taken a further step forward with the appointment of Michael Smith, an experienced HSBC manager, as managing director of Midland's international interests. Although Midland's businesses in the Far East and America will be integrated with local HSBC operations, Midland's new owner wants European businesses to remain under the British bank. Midland owns banks worth Pounds 11bn in asset size in countries including Germany and France. 'Midland still has quite a strong name in Europe. It has not suffered as badly as from publicity in Britain over the past few years,' says Smith, who was moved to Midland as planning director before the takeover. Midland and HSBC were exchanging managers as part of their overtures. In his role as planning director, he was responsible for planning the reshaping of Midland's branch network. Smith, who has been with HSBC since 1978, says there is 'an awful lot of development to do' on Midland's European network. He wants to introduce the 'discipline and common direction' of HSBC. Before coming to Midland, Smith followed the career path of high flyers in HSBC, helping to manage businesses in Hong Kong, Australia, Oman and Japan among others. The switch to Midland's European operation will mark a change from retail operations to largely corporate and investment banking. ***** Hugh O'Brien, formerly group planning director of Midland, has been appointed head of group financial planning and capital financing for HSBC Holdings.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Office building cheaper in US THE COST of developing a large office block is almost a third cheaper in the US than in the UK, according to a study commissioned by BAA, the airports company. BAA spends about Pounds 250m a year on large construction projects and is proposing to build a Pounds 900m fifth terminal at Heathrow Airport. It said yesterday that, as a test, it asked contractors in North Carolina to tender for a 200,000 sq ft office block identical to a Pounds 17.1m development by British Airways at Heathrow which is due to be completed this year. Lynton, BAA's property subsidiary, commissioned Bovis Construction, the UK contractor, and Davis Langdon &amp; Everest, quantity surveyors, to tender for a similar project at an airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, where labour and material costs are similar to those in Britain. It was found that the offices built to US designs and specifications were 32 per cent cheaper at Pounds 11.65m than in the UK. Construction costs were marginally higher in the US at Pounds 17.14m if identical designs and specifications were used. Mr Gordon Edington, Lynton's chairman and BAA's property director, said that the main reasons for differences in costs were that US developers used more standard designs and common components. Developers also spent longer preparing detailed designs and organising a job before starting building work, saving valuable time during construction. Mr Edington said: 'US architects and engineers spend less time re-inventing solution wheels and are more ready to incorporate standard technical solutions into their designs.' The flood of construction companies which have gone into receivership is likely to increase as the UK economy recovers and building costs rise, the EC Harris construction cost consultancy warned yesterday. Mr Christopher Vickers, chairman, said: 'Pressures on contractors are increasing from a number of directors and not just from rises in input costs.' The failure of customers meant large losses on jobs while contractors were receiving less interest on progress payment money held on deposit for sub-contractors, so cashflow was likely to fall. EC Harris said in its quarterly economic survey that contractors bidding fixed prices on projects unlikely to be completed for up to two years could run into serious difficulties due to rises in building material prices. Producers of steel, glass, plasterboard, cement and aggregates have announced price rises this year. EC Harris said: 'The latest increases in material prices look set to stick because the costs of alternative cheap imports have now increased 15 per cent due to sterling's devaluation.' It said that defaults by customers were adding to the pressures on contractors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Christophe Parayre] </F>   [Text] Buchanan, Liberia, March 11 (AFP) -- A murderous  attack by an armed faction has forced thousands of Liberian  civilians to flee this week to the iron ore port of Buchanan,  refugees and relief workers here said.    More than one thousand displaced people have arrived here  daily since Sunday [6 March] for fear of further attacks, aid  personnel in the town, 90 kilometres (56 miles) southeast of  Monrovia, told AFP.    Guerrillas of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC) militia on  Sunday launched a "brief, violent attack" on civilians in the  Compound 2 region, 20 kilometres (13 miles) north of Buchanan,  killing several, a refugee said.    "They opened fire right among the people," he said. "They  began to throw grenades everywhere. Everybody ran. We left our  home to go to the bush."    The dead included a Liberian worker for the charity Medecins  sans Frontieres [MSF] (Doctors Without Borders), he added.    Available information indicated that the attacks had  stopped,  but this had not prevented some 7,000 people from joining 20,000  other displaced persons already sheltered in Buchanan schools.    They had fled fighting between the LPC and the National  Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), which controls the area and  was one of three signatories to a peace pact last year, before  the LPC was formed in September.    The attack came a day before the installation of a  transitional State Council, or collegiate presidency, and the  official start to the disarming of Liberia's armed factions  under the July peace accord.    But disarmament by troops of a multinational African  peacekeeping force under the supervision of UN monitors was  Thursday only a dream here, where five lorries carrying mainly  women and children arrived in less than two hours.    Most of the displaced people were dressed in rags and were  visibly exhausted, often with nothing but a small bag of  possessions. After receiving a food card, they went to a  makeshift reception centre where an elderly woman was handing  out small rations of rice.    In the classrooms, benches and tables were pushed into a  corner to make space for the new arrivals. Mats were laid on  the floor for them to sleep on.    For the present, the relief agencies were coping, Christine  Muller of MSF declared.    "It's not over," she said. "We are expecting more than 7,000  new arrivals in the coming days."</p>

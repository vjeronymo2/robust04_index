			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Losing the sparkle in a cold climate - How the recession and forced restructuring has hit Whitbread WHITBREAD's 250th anniversary this year finds it with little cause to celebrate. The veteran of the UK brewing industry is suffering more than its rivals from exposure to the chill economic climate and the rigours of the industry's enforced restructuring. With 92 per cent of profits generated inside the UK, even some long-time supporters in the City are beginning to worry about its pinched and harried look. Will it recover its former bounce and emerge rejuvenated when the long-promised economic recovery comes? Its financial constitution remains sound. Until this year it had enjoyed 16 years of uninterrupted profit growth. Net debt stands at less than Pounds 400m, gearing at 16 per cent, and interest is covered 8 times. 'Over the last 18 months,' says Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, 'existing businesses have been broadly cash neutral and we have borrowed to make acquisitions.' The troubles that beset Whitbread, Mr Jarvis insists, are peripheral: the body of the business is healthy though there may be a touch of frostbite to the toes. But as the recession and the increasing competitiveness of the industry combine to depress the outlook for beer volumes, prices, and margins over the next two or three years, some industry observers are sceptical about the ability of Whitbread's breweries and pubs to continue pumping out the profits it needs to expand its other retailing operations. Consolidation of the brewing industry has left Whitbread well behind Bass, Courage, and Allied/Carlsberg (if that merger is approved) with a 13 per cent share compared to the others' 19 per cent to 23 per cent. But Whitbread's niche is stronger than its national position suggests. Production and distribution is as cost-efficient as any of its rivals. It was the first UK brewer to build large green field production plants and it has further reduced costs by closing four breweries in the last three years. Its draught beer business is tightly focused, giving it the biggest market share in south-east England, and a strongly competitive position along the south coast, in the west country, and the north-west. It also has strong beer brands. Heineken and Stella Artois lagers make it market leader in the growing take-home trade. Boddingtons heads a sizeable portfolio of cask-conditioned ales; Murphy's stout, in only its second year of distribution, last year achieved Pounds 75m in retail sales. Continuing success for these brands is essential if Whitbread is to maintain its position as the beer market becomes freer under the impact of the government's beer orders, requiring the national brewers to release some 11,000 pubs from exclusive beer supplies. Whitbread's announcement of charges of Pounds 37m for bad debts shows how costly and relatively unsuccessful its attempts to extend its foothold in free trade pubs have been. Of its 11,000-12,000 customers, about a quarter are in financial difficulties. The restructuring of pub retailing, initiated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, has been more onerous on Whitbread than any of its competitors. The group's pubs, with average beer sales smaller than those of their rivals, have been more difficult to sell in the depressed property market. About 1,000 have been sold, however, at book value; and another 300 are expected to be sold before the November 1 deadline. The remaining 1,200 are to be leased free of the tie and for short-term periods to regional brewers and pub companies. One complication remains to be sorted out. Stakes held by Whitbread and the associate Whitbread Investment Company (WIC) in regional brewers Marston's, Morland, and Brakspear, and in the Devenish and Boddington pub companies, bring their pub estates into the reckoning. If the shareholdings remain unchanged, Whitbread would have to free another 1,000 pubs. The competitive disadvantages that would bring make it certain the stakes will be diluted. Some speculate that a solution may be found in the abolition of Whitbread's 'poison-pill' two-tier share structure. Whitbread has made a Pounds 87m provision for the cost of this restructuring, which will deliver another knock to beer sales. It will be left, however, with a tied estate of about 4,150 focus of an intensive refurbishment programme over the past four years. Since 1988, Pounds 60m a year has been ploughed back into improving the 1,600 managed houses; and 1,500 of the 2,500 tenanted pubs have so far been similarly upgraded to attract the more discerning customer of the 1990s. Pubs have been contributing more than half of Whitbread's profits, and from them was bred the retailing management skills on which its expansion has been largely based. Whitbread's hotels - from the upmarket Country Club chain to the economy Travel Inns - have continued to perform ahead of rivals in the recession-hit market. More than Pounds 400m has been spent on improvements in the past four years, and there seems no reason to doubt they will prosper from any upturn in the economy. Benefits should soon be evident,too, from some shrewd acquisitions in other fields. With the Pounds 49.5m purchase of the Dominic off-licence chain from GrandMet last October, Thresher is now the largest specialist drinks retailer in the UK with a total of 1,660 stores, well placed to share in the expected growth of the take-home drinks trade this decade. The Pounds 115m acquisition of the Berni pub/restaurants has strengthened its Beefeater chain; and TGI Friday's, the US-style diners, Henry's cafe bars, and Mulligans fish restaurants, are being gradually expanded. Pizza Hut, the UK joint venture, has consolidated its grip on the pizza sector of the competitive fast-food market, with an overall 35 per cent share. Its success in the UK promised much for Whitbread's future profits in the development of the European franchise. Mr Jarvis does not hide his regret about the decision to withdraw from that venture after an initial Pounds 40m investment. 'It had great potential,' he says, 'but the exit terms on offer were just not good enough to safeguard shareholders' interests in the huge investment needed.' The European development would also have helped reduce Whitbread's dependence on the UK market - the cause of much of its present troubles. Virtually its only overseas interests are its small but successful Keg restaurants in North America and Australia, and the Churrasco steak houses in Germany. 'The strategy, however, remains intact,' he says. 'We intend to prove to ourselves that we can run restaurants in these countries as well as any other operator - and then do it on a bigger scale.'</p>

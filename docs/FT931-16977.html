			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Consensus points to increased inflation INFLATION will be the key indicator for the gilt market over the next 12 months. While there is a range of views about how prices will change in the UK economy during 1993, the consensus is that inflation will emerge as a bigger problem than last year and may push up gilt yields. Another worry for gilt investors will be the large volume of issues from the Bank of England in the 1993-94 financial year, a factor likely to hold back price rises. The prospects for gilts are tied to the degree to which the UK economy picks up from its longest recession since the 1930s. Any expansion which is more than languid would re-ignite inflationary pressures - which are subdued - reducing the prospects for further cuts in interest rates, and depressing gilt prices. Most economists envisage a slow upturn in 1993, with growth of about 1 per cent. However, this judgment is clouded by uncertainty, especially as this time last year many expected a sharp recovery in 1992, not the fall in GDP that took place. During 1992, many gilt investors saw substantial gains. Price rises were particularly marked at the short end of the yield curve, partly due to weak inflation. Another factor was the 3 percentage point cut in base rates between sterling's devaluation on September 16 and the end of November. From nearly 10 per cent at the start of the year, yields for five-year gilts fell to just over 7 per cent by the end of December. This fall of nearly 300 basis points brought a corresponding increase in prices. But it was only partly replicated at the long end of the yield curve. Here yields for 20-year bonds fell from about 9.5 per cent to under 9 per cent. The overall rise in gilt prices during the year - which saw the yield curve change dramatically from being downward sloping in January to upward sloping in December - was helped by investors switching more funds away from recession-hit equities and into government bonds. Price changes in the economy, as measured by the year-on-year change in the retail prices index, stood at just 3 per cent in November, the lowest figure for six years. According to a Financial Times survey of 38 forecasting groups published just before Christmas, inflationary forces are likely to grow significantly by the end of 1993. The consensus was that RPI inflation by the final quarter would work out at 4.1 per cent. However, there remains considerable disagreement about the outlook for inflation. Mr John Shepperd, of S. G. Warburg Securities, is among the pessimists. He predicts that rising inflationary forces will limit reductions in base rates to just one further cut of 1 percentage point - bringing base rates to 6 per cent - by the time of the March Budget. Mr Shepperd believes that as a result long-dated gilt yields will climb during the year to about 9.75 per cent, with little change in yields for short-dated securities. Mr Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu is much more sanguine. He forecasts that RPI inflation will be just 1.75 per cent by the end of the year. Consequently, he believes long-dated gilt yields will continue to come down, to below 8 per cent by December, while yields for short-maturing bonds will drop below 6 per cent. Whatever happens to the economy during 1993, the PSBR is almost certain to increase. That will happen as growth in tax income remains subdued, and social security and unemployment payments stay high. According to the FT survey of forecasts, the PSBR in 1993-94 is likely to reach Pounds 46.9bn, up from an expected Pounds 38.2bn in 1992-93. This would require about Pounds 50bn of gilt issues during 1993-94 - or some Pounds 1bn a week.</p>

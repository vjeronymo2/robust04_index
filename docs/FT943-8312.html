			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Congress urged to reject R&amp;D proposal A coalition of US companies has joined foreign businesses to oppose legislation, now in a House-Senate conference, which treats foreign companies differently from US companies in government research and development programmes, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. At issue is the Manton Amendment, attached by Congressman Thomas Manton, to the National Competitiveness Act. The Act funds and expands US government involvement in R&amp;D and manufacturing. The amendment allows participation by foreign companies only if their governments allow US participation in their R&amp;D schemes. US business groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, European-American Chamber of Commerce, and Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association, say the Manton Amendment would keep even major US companies from participating in the US technology programmes. 'Narrow eligibility criteria discourage beneficial foreign investment, invite retaliation against US exporters and US companies doing business abroad and violate our obligations under international agreements,' they said in a letter to Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary.</p>

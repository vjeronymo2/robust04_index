			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Good to see that having been for a time (for whatever reasons) persona non grata with Channel 4, Mavis Nicholson is now back on screen. In With Mavis (8.30) deals with euthanasia. In Amsterdam, where the practice is tolerated though not legal, Nicholson talks to Val Williams and her husband Bill who has cancer. They have decided that at some stage the best alternative to continued suffering would be an assisted death. In Around Whicker's World, the old master of alliteration has proved yet again, as though it were necessary, what a great professional he is. The final episode in the series today finds the 87 tourists on their private jet visiting Rio and New York. Whicker asks his fellow travellers whether they would pay another Pounds 37,000 each to repeat the experience (9.00 ITV). BBC1 begins a series of Friday concerts, Proms On One (10.20) with the Cleveland Orchestra under Christoph von Dohnanyi performing Mahler's 'Ruckert Lieder' and then Beethoven's Fifth. BBC2 continues its admirable policy of showcasing new film-making talent in 10 x 10, offering a 10-minute surrealistic thriller (10.20).</p>

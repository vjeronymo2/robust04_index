			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR OKS BUDGET HIKES FOR SOCIAL PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, in a move aimed at reducing tensions with the  Democrat-controlled Legislature, Thursday agreed to substantial increases in  budgets for mental health, youth camps, health services for the poor and  nursing programs for the elderly.  </P> <P> Deukmejian disclosed his change in position in announcing how he wants to  divide the lion's share of the $2.5-billion tax windfall that turned up in May  as a result of unexpectedly high state income tax receipts.  </P> <P> The development came as the Senate unanimously approved, on a rare 40-0 vote, a  $49.7-billion version of the new state budget that included a hotly debated  amendment that would virtually wipe out Medi-Cal abortions for poor women.  Anti-abortion senators introduced the amendment in spite of repeated rulings by  the state Supreme Court that such restrictions are unconstitutional.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abortion Debate  </P> <P> The fractious debate over abortion contrasted sharply with the general  good-humored tone that accompanied easy passage of the the budget proposal. The  vote moves the Legislature closer to a Senate-Assembly conference committee  that will negotiate the lawmakers' final budget proposal, which will be sent to  the governor. The Senate budget now goes to the Assembly, which is scheduled to  vote on its own version Monday.  </P> <P> There was immediate evidence that the governor had reduced tension in the  Legislature by offering to spend substantially more money on programs backed  strongly by Democrats. Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los  Angeles) told the Senate that in January Deukmejian had "presented us with a  bleak budget highlighted by painful reductions in basic programs to people in  need. The recent discovery of new, unexpected revenues has changed all that."  </P> <P> Roberti, who often in the past has collided head-on with Deukmejian, said  during the Senate debate that the governor "must be credited with his  willingness to work with the leadership of both houses on a bipartisan basis to  untangle the complex web" of issues that now stand in the way of fashioning a  final budget.  </P> <P> Although numerous points of disagreement still exist between the Republican  governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature, Deukmejian's budget  announcement erased some of the most controversial proposals he made last  January when it looked like the state would not collect enough tax revenues to  pay all its bills.  </P> <P> The Republican governor last January proposed getting out of the tight squeeze  on state finances by making whopping cuts in numerous health and welfare  programs. The suggested cuts rankled Republican as well as Democratic lawmakers  -- and touched off months of demonstrations and furious lobbying by health and  welfare interest groups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contingent on Agreement  </P> <P> Deukmejian, in his announcement Thursday, made it clear that his latest budget  proposals are contingent on agreement being reached on the broader fiscal  issues referred to by Roberti. On the bargaining table are proposed changes in  the state spending limit, long-term funding for public schools and a 10-year,  $18.5-billion transportation improvement program.  </P> <P> The governor, who has already had four sessions with legislative leaders in the  last two weeks, plans to meet with top lawmakers from the Assembly and Senate  again next week.  </P> <P> Working with the $2.5 billion in expected new revenues, Deukmejian proposed  funding for a series of programs he had earlier marked for substantial  reductions.  </P> <P> For one thing, he proposed full funding of county juvenile justice programs at  a level of $67 million. In January, he had proposed cutting $30.4 million from  the juvenile justice programs, a move that local officials warned could lead to  the shutdown of highly successful youth camps. Local officials said that if  Deukmejian's cuts went through, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 delinquent youths  either would be transferred to the California Youth Authority, where  incarceration is more costly, or released outright.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Move  </P> <P> In another major move, Deukmejian proposed an additional allocation of $259  million for health programs serving the working poor. Deukmejian had been  criticized for proposing to cut money from health programs for the indigent,  then replacing the funds with new tobacco taxes raised by Proposition 99.  Critics called the governor's proposal illegal. Under Deukmejian's new plan,  the $259 million for health care for indigents would be in addition to tobacco  tax allocations.  </P> <P> On top of those proposals, Deukmejian said he wants to provide full funding of  $350 million for community mental health programs. He had proposed cutting more  than $200 million from local mental health programs. He also said on Thursday,  in contrast to an earlier position, that he now plans no reduction in the  budget for in-home supportive services, a program designed to assist elderly  and sick shut-ins with various support services.  </P> <P> Some substantial differences remain between Deukmejian and legislators.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, for example, said in his announcement that he wants $1.45 billion  set aside in a reserve fund for unexpected future budget needs. Neither version  of the budget coming together in the Assembly and Senate sets aside a fixed  amount for the reserve.  </P> <P> And Deukmejian did not back away from his proposal to freeze monthly support  payments to welfare recipients and aged, blind and disabled people receiving  state aid, a plan sharply criticized by Democrats. That is one of the thorniest  issues that remains to be negotiated.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), chairman of the  Assembly Ways and Means Committee, called Deukmejian's turnaround  "encouraging."  </P> <P> Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, said the tax windfall was clearly  the leading factor in Deukmejian's shift in thinking. Brett said Deukmejian had  proposed the deep cuts only because the state did not have enough money to  cover all its obligations when the governor drafted his original 1989-90 budget  in January. "It was out of a sense of necessity that he did it. Conditions  clearly have changed," Brett said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sense of Frustration'  </P> <P> During the intense Senate debate over abortion funding, Democratic Floor Leader  Barry Keene of Benicia noted that anti-abortion legislators had failed to get  their way over the years and now "out of a sense of frustration they strike out  against poor women."  </P> <P> Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, the GOP caucus chairman, introduced the  amendment to eliminate funding for abortions except in cases of rape or incest  or when the mother's life is endangered. "We don't want abortion used as a  method of birth control" at taxpayers' expense, he said.  </P> <P> The amendment narrowly passed 21 to 19, generating both Democratic and  Republican support.  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia seeks to boost domestic gas consumption Indonesia's main island of Java is set to increase its consumption of natural gas by 242 per cent to 975m cubic feet a day with the commissioning of three new electric power stations, a urea plant and a gas system for the city of Surabaya in East Java, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. Speaking to a recent meeting of the Indonesian Gas Association, Mr Wijarso, a senior official of the Department of Mines and Energy, said the planned expansion was backed up by proven reserves of 4.5 trillion cubic feet. He said Arco International is developing new offshore fields to deliver 260m cf a day to the newly built 1,350 MW combined cycle power plants in Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, and to the Kujang II urea plant in Cikampek. The ARBNI Pagerungan field will soon supply 390m cf a day to the city of Surabaya and to a 1,080 MW power plant and urea plant in Gresik. Mr Wijarso estimated that consumption by the year 2000 in Java, which has a population of 108m and is the economic centre of Indonesia, would be close to 1,500m cf a day. A recent World Bank study estimated that gas fields in Java and its offshore surrounds could be proven up by an additional 2.1-8.1 trillion cf. Even at the low 2.1 trillion cf figure, an additional delivery of 500m cf a day of gas could be brought on line by the end of the decade, Mr Wijarso said. The government's policy is to, whenever possible, substitute domestic oil consumption with gas. Indonesia would save 250,000 barrels of oil a day if domestic gas consumption in Java could be increased to 1,470m cf a day.</p>

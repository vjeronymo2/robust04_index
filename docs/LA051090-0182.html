			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNDS GET NHL TEAM IN BAY AREA  </P> <P> The San Francisco Bay Area got an NHL franchise, and the Minnesota North Stars  got new owners in a deal approved Wednesday by the league's Board of Governors.  </P> <P> Howard Baldwin, former chairman of the Hartford Whalers, and Morris Belzberg, a  retired Budget Rent-A-Car executive, acquired the North Stars from Gordon and  George Gund for about $38 million.  </P> <P> In turn, the Gunds were given a Bay Area franchise for 1991-92 -- the league's  first expansion since four teams from the World Hockey Assn. were admitted in  1979.  </P> <P> In addition, the NHL said it might expand by one or two more teams for the  1992-93 season. The league, which said last December that it plans to increase  from 21 to 28 teams by the end of the decade but did not intend to add any  teams until 1992, set a price tag of $50 million per franchise.  </P> <P> The Gunds owned the North Stars since merging them with their Cleveland Barons  in 1978.  </P> <P> The new team will play in the Cow Palace near San Francisco in 1991-92 before  moving to a new arena in San Jose the next season.  </P> <P> It will be the first Bay Area hockey team since the California Seals -- owned  partly by the Gunds -- left Oakland for Cleveland in 1976. The Seals were part  of the league's first expansion in 1967, when six teams, including the North  Stars, joined the original six clubs to double the NHL's size.  </P> <P> Citing $16 million in losses over the past three years and lack of support from  the Twin Cities, the Gunds announced on Jan. 30 that they would ask the NHL for  permission to move to the Bay area unless they could get $15 million in  improvements to the Met Center.  </P> <P> The Gunds were denied the improvements in February.  </P></p>

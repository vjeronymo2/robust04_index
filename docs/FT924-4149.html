			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (3): Industry participants begin to thin out - The Deal Leaders BUY-OUTS have proved a profitable niche for the British venture capital industry - so profitable, in fact, that while interest in start-ups and other early-stage deals has waned, many venture capitalists have made buy-outs the focus of their activities. A growing number of the smaller venture capital funds which backed early stage ventures have ceased making new investments. So far, the attrition visible elsewhere in the industry has yet to show itself among the buy-out funds but, many participants expect, it will not be a long time coming. 'The industry is rationalising itself and polarising around a dozen or so players,' says Mr Ian Forrest, managing director of Montagu Private Equity (formerly Midland Montagu Ventures). The reasons for this thinning out of the industry are not hard to find. Poorly performing funds will be unable to raise new finance from outside investors or, if they are 'captive' institutions owned by a larger financial services group, will be unable to persuade head office that they deserve more money. The decision earlier this year by Hill Samuel, the merchant banking part of the TSB group, to put its development capital arm up for sale, showed that even the captive organisations are not as secure as was previously assumed. Hill Samuel's move reflected a decision to concentrate on activities which provided a quicker pay-off than development capital. The increased vulnerability which the captive funds feel has persuaded their managers that they must be more active in promoting their activities within their own organisations. 'We make sure that we publicise internally any cross-referral business we create,' says one. So which are the most active buy-out funds and those most likely to form the slimmed-down core of the industry in a few years' time? Any list of the leading players active in the UK market would include Candover, Charterhouse Development Capital, CINVen, Morgan Grenfell, 3i, Phildrew Ventures, Schroder Ventures, County NatWest, Montagu Private Equity and Electra. A shorter list of buy-out teams active in continental Europe would also include Candover, 3i and Schroders, but with the addition of other organisations such as Citicorp Venture Capital. Membership of either of these lists denotes a serious commitment to the buy-out field but does not necessarily mean that all the funds have been active recently. Morgan Grenfell Development Capital has not made a large buy-out investment for nearly a year because it has not seen a sufficiently attractive deal, says Mr Robert Smith, chief executive. 3i continues to head the KPMG Peat Marwick deals table, completing 15 new deals in the year to the end of September 1992, but has not been noticeable bidding for the largest deals recently, several other buy-out specialists report. This may reflect a decision by 3i to close what used to be known as its City office and to put more effort into helping its area offices to do larger deals. Other leading funds include Midland Montagu Ventures, which has completed seven deals in the past year, Schroder Ventures with six deals, and CINVen, which manages pension funds for the British Coal, British Rail and Barclays Bank, with four deals. One factor which is likely to lead a further concentration of the buy-out industry is the desire for many players to take a deal completely on their own books or to limit the size of the syndicates they form. The large, unwieldy syndicates put together to finance deals in the late 1980s were not well suited to dealing with the problems experienced by their portfolio companies. So deal leaders are now only willing to work together with small teams of like-minded funds they feel they can trust. Syndicates - such as those which backed the buy-out of Mecca Leisure in 1985 involving 23 members, and that of Mallinson Denny in the same year with 19 members - are unlikely to be repeated. The average number of investors in a Pounds 100m-Pounds 250m in 1986 was 16, Electra has calculated. By 1991 it had fallen to four members. Deals of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 25m involved on average six investors in 1986 but only two in 1991. 'People want to take bigger stakes in companies because they want to be closer to them,' says Mr Hugh Mumford, Electra managing director. 'Investors don't want to be passive.' 'The shortage of larger, high quality investment opportunities has led to the originators of deals hanging on to what they have,' says Mr Gordon Bonnyman, managing director of Charterhouse Development Capital. 'If they do syndicate they choose partners who can reciprocate.' 3i and Prudential Venture Managers went a step further with the announcement in June of a collaboration agreement to underwrite jointly medium-sized and large buy-outs and buy-ins - those with a purchase price of Pounds 15m or more. Five deals have already been jointly funded under this arrangement which actually took effect from the beginning of the year. But to concentrate solely on the impending concentration among the larger buy-out funds would be to ignore the large number of smaller deals. The big transactions have disappeared but considerable activity still takes place in deals valued at less than Pounds 5m. A broad range of equity funds and banks continues to finance these deals, some which use only debt. The shake-up among the banks providing debt for buy-outs has been no less severe than among the equity funds. The banks, many of them from the US, which piled into the highly leveraged deals of the late 1980s, have departed. For the past year or so the debt side of buy-out funding has been dominated by a trio of British banks, the Bank of Scotland, National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank. These three still have a commanding role but there are signs that other banks are starting to revive their buy-out financing teams, says Mr Anton Fawcett, who heads Barclays' buy-out activities. Two UK merchant banks, Morgan Grenfell and NM Rothschild have begun providing buy-out debt while continental European banks, particularly the Swiss, are showing increasing interest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DEAL LEADERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Total    Total value      Av.

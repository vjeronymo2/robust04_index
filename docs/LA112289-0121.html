			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> HONORED PRINCIPAL SOAKS UP PRAISE  </P> <P> Wearing his best suit and a construction worker's hard hat, Principal Gene  Bedley waited for the next water balloon to smash into him.  </P> <P> It was the moment he had asked for -- even created and titled. Bedley had  promised that the "Blast Mr. Bedley With a Water Balloon" award would be  bestowed on each class at El Camino Real Elementary School that raised $700 or  more in a recent jog-a-thon for new school equipment. He even promised to wear  his best suit.  </P> <P> After more than $16,000 was raised, Bedley's best attire on Monday became a wet  suit.  </P> <P> "I even wore light-colored pants so the water would show better," he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the staff of El Camino Real again presented Bedley with balloons,  this time filled with helium, as part of a Mr. Bedley Appreciation Day.  </P> <P> It was the second honor in two weeks. Last Thursday, Bedley received the George  Washington Honor Medal for distinguished service at the El Toro Marine Corps  Air Station. During an Appreciation Day breakfast, Bedley noted that "kids are  our greatest teachers," and he dedicated his George Washington medal to them.  </P> <P> "Gene sets the tone for the entire school with his positive approach to  education," said second-grade teacher Jenni Samuel.  </P> <P> Sixth-grade teacher Sherri Ernst, inspired by Bedley to become a teacher, said  she "would not work for anyone else."  </P> <P> "He's a warm, loving, caring person," she said. "He's my hero."  </P> <P> Bedley said he follows a simple philosophy.  </P> <P> "Respect kids," he said, "and they will respect you." STEVE BILLITER  </P></p>

Thus, the number  of patent right petitions from Taiwan ranks second among those  sent by other provinces and municipalities across the country.    The State Patent Bureau issued a "Circular on the Handling  of  Patent Right Petitions by Taiwan Compatriots" in December 1987,  which met with a warm response among people from Taiwan's  scientific and technological as well as industrial and  commercial circles. In 1988 alone, the State Patten Bureau  received 182 patent right petitions submitted by people in  Taiwan. Since then, the number of petitions for patent rights  have been increased yearly. Over recent years, an 106-percent  increase has been registered in the number of patent right  petitions sent from Taiwan, a most rapid growth rate in the  entire country.    It has been learned that most of the petitions from Taiwan  are sent by individuals. As of the end of 1993, the State  Patent Bureau has handled 11,546 patent right petitions  submitted by Taiwan compatriots, and granted patent right to  6,409 petitioners.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90  </P> <P> Highlights of Los Angeles Festival's films and videos focusing on 25 Pacific  Rim countries are reviewed here:  </P> <P> Sunday  </P> <P> Blood of the Condor  </P> <P> Bolivia  </P> <P>  Sunday at 8 p.m., Melnitz Theater, UCLA; Sept. 14 at 8 p.m. at AFI, 2021 N.  Western Ave., Hollywood  </P> <P>  Reminiscent of "The Bicycle Thief" in both style and structure, Bolivian  filmmaker Jorge Sanjines' "Blood of the Condor" protests the genocide of the  Quechua Indians through a sterilization program administered by the U.S.  "Progress Corps" (read Peace Corps). Its depiction of the dark, irresponsible  side of birth control is shattering in its effect -- especially upon anyone  fervently convinced that curbs on population growth are essential to human  survival.  </P> <P> The stark drama turns upon a Quechuan man who seeks revenge against the  Americans for sterilizing his wife. Throughout, Sanjines matches his red-hot  anger with a fully controlled artless-seeming style and handles  nonprofessionals with the skill of a De Sica. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

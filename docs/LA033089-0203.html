			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO FIRM MISSES 'WINDOW' FOR TOP-NOTCH MINI-SUPERCOMPUTER  </P> <P> Scientific Computer Systems, a manufacturer of mini-supercomputers, has made  the painful discovery that building a better mousetrap doesn't always attract a  world of customers to your doorstep.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Scientific Computer discontinued its mini-supercomputer,  the technical features of which had been lauded by industry observers. The  announcement put an end to an effort that consumed 5 years and $50 million in  venture capital and caused layoffs of 70 of the company's 100 employees.  </P> <P> Stephen R. Campbell, vice president of marketing, maintained Monday that the  company is still a going concern with a valuable asset: powerful networking  software technology called VectorNet. Company officials insist that they intend  to continue developing and marketing the software but concede that an infusion  of new venture capital totaling "less than $5 million" is needed in the next  several months if the effort is to stay alive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Market Window'  </P> <P> Industry observers say the failure of Scientific Computers provides several  object lessons, the most obvious being the high risk inherent in any  high-technology venture. Others are the critical importance of introducing a  product during the timely "market window," and how industry pundits can be dead  wrong in projecting market demand for a given product.  </P> <P> Moreover, the problems of Scientific Computer System illustrate how a company's  fortunes -- and employees' jobs -- can hinge on events beyond the control of  its executives, even those with an abundance of market and technical savvy.  </P> <P> Scientific Computer was founded in 1983 by Bob Schuhmann, formerly an executive  with Floating Point Systems, another pioneering supercomputer manufacturer, and  proceeded to attract venture capital from 2 dozen of the brightest lights in  the investment community including J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., TA Associates,  Adler &amp; Co., and TVI. Local venture firms Henry &amp; Co. and CFB Ventures,  a division of California First Bank, also chipped in.  </P> <P> In 1986, the company brought out its SCS-40 mini-supercomputer on time and just  as powerful as promised. Between a Cray supercomputer and a Digital Equipment  or International Business Machines mainframe in processing power, the SCS-40  could process data at 40 megaflops -- 40 million floating point operations or  calculations -- per second. That's 10 times faster than a top-performing IBM  mainframe and 1/20th the speed of a Cray.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Measure of Success  </P> <P> Scientific Computer had some measure of success, selling 10 units its first  year of sales and 40 all told, at an average price of $550,000. Like other  computers in its class, the SCS-40 was marketed to research institutions and  companies that needed to process vast amounts of data, such as calculations  used in aerodynamic modeling and oil field exploration, but which either could  not afford or didn't need Cray-level computing power.  </P> <P> What distinguished Scientific Computer from its dozen or so competitors was  that it billed its machine as "Cray-compatible" or designed to operate off the  same "compiler" or operating software called COS that drove the giant Cray  machines, said Christopher Willard, senior industry analyst with Dataquest, a  market research firm in San Jose.  </P> <P> (Operating software translates instructions contained in applications  programming into specific data-processing commands.)  </P> <P> The company believed early that it could persuade Cray Research of Minneapolis  to share its operating software. Cray would see the benefit because SCS-40  customers would eventually move up to more powerful Cray machines, suffering  minimal pain in adapting their expensive applications software in the process,  the reasoning went.  </P> <P> At first, Cray's agreeing to "play ball" with SCS was not needed because the  Minneapolis-based company had released an early version of COS to the public  domain, meaning that anyone could design a computer system around it. But, soon  after the SCS-40 was introduced, Cray brought out an advanced version of COS  that it kept proprietary.  </P> <P> Scientific Computer was thus stuck with an outdated Cray compiler that  applications software publishers were reluctant to support, a fact that reduced  the appeal of the SCS-40.  </P> <P> "Cray did not show any favoritism with SCS by cooperating or providing  software," said Jeffry Canin, an independent technology analyst based in San  Francisco who formerly worked at Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment bankers.  "Cray did not perceive it to be in their interest to help start-up companies  like SCS."  </P> <P> SCS then retrenched by developing its own version of COS in cooperation with  Boeing, a system based on another Cray operating software package also in the  public domain called CTSS. At the same time, Boeing bought a number of SCS-40s  and agreed to market the SCS machine. But the partnership fell short of  generating the sales that SCS had hoped for, partly because the Cray-compatible  marketplace was too small a niche and thus unattractive to software publishers.  </P> <P> Asked how the company could, in effect, bet its future on the cooperation and  good will of Cray, former Scientific Computer President Jack Hugus said Monday  that Boeing and Scientific Computer were laboring under the impression that  Cray "would indulge us the functional equivalents" of current Cray software.  Hugus stressed that the Cray compatibility question was decided by Schuhmann of  Floating Point Systems before he joined the company in 1986.  </P> <P> Hugus, who resigned from the company a year ago and is now marketing general  manager for General Electric's government electronics systems division near  Philadelphia, said the relationship with Cray was a "continually murky  situation."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Scientific Computer's archrival -- Convex Computer Corp. of  Richardson, Tex. -- had beaten it to the market by 18 months, introducing a  mini-supercomputer based on UNIX operating software, a system also in the  public domain but which is gaining increased popularity among workstation and  mainframe computer users.  </P> <P> Convex's decision to use UNIX was critical because it gave the company market  access to a host of Digital Equipment mainframe owners using UNIX who would  someday be ready to move up to a "mini-super," Convex marketing vice president  Frank Vince said last week. Even Cray has recently introduced UNICOS, an  operating system based on UNIX that may eventually replace its COS software.  </P> <P> As critical months and Scientific Computer's problems with Cray continued,  Hugus said, it became clear that the mini-supercomputer world was moving to  UNIX-based operating software, Hugus said, not necessarily because UNIX was  inherently a better language but because Convex hit the market window earlier  and was able to establish itself over its competitors.  </P> <P> For whatever reason, the SCS-40 was left hanging in the market with minimal  software support, while Convex could market its machines as having the support  of 200 or more application software programs.  </P> <P> "Yes, SCS has a better mousetrap in terms of its speed and technology. That  wasn't the problem with the company," said Jack Dongarra, scientific director  of the advanced computer research facility at Argonne National Laboratory in  Argonne, Ill.  </P> <P> "The failure was in concentrating on hardware and not devoting enough resources  to software," he said.  </P> <P> By the time Scientific Computer introduced a UNIX-based operating system of its  own last year, it was too late for it to save the SCS-40 product.  </P> <P> Several companies including Scientific Computer got into the mini-supercomputer  business thinking that the market would grow much faster than it has. Projected  by some analysts to reach $500 million in 1988 and $1 billion by 1990, just  $330 million worth of mini-supercomputers were sold last year, said Dataquest's  Willard, adding that the market could reach $1 billion in sales by 1992.  </P> <P> Severe price competition and a much smaller revenue pie to carve up has caused  all but Convex, the mini-supercomputer leader with more than 100 machines  installed, to be money-losers so far. Because of these factors, Willard expects  the number of mini-supercomputer "players" to shrink from 15 in the mid-1980s  to four or five over the next few years.  </P></p>

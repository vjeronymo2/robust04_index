			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Vard quits luxury cruise market Vard, the Norwegian cruise group, has completed its asset disposal programme with the sale of the cruise ship Royal Viking Sun for Dollars 170m to Cunard of the UK. The move, which completes Vard's exit from the luxury cruise market, will improve its balance sheet and liquidity. Cunard, part of the Trafalgar House group, has also acquired the rights to the Royal Viking Line name, the RVL logo and rights to use Royal Viking as the brand name on its vessels. The disposal will enable Vard's Miami-based subsidiary Kloster Cruise to boost its position in the premium cruise market by concentrating on its remaining cruise lines, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Cruise Line. Mr Bernt Karlsen, president and chief executive of Vard, said the sale price of the Royal Viking Sun was about 45 per cent above book value and the disposal would clear a revolving credit facility of Dollars 110m.</p>

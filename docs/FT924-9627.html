			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / BP to sell stake in Australian mine BRITISH PETROLEUM, the UK oil group, yesterday said Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa, had conditionally agreed to pay US Dollars 456m (Pounds 294m) for its 49 per cent holding in the Olympic Dam copper/gold/silver/uranium mine in South Australia. Western Mining (WMC), the Australian resources group which operates Olympic Dam and owns the other 51 per cent, has pre-emptive rights to buy the BP stake within 90 days of being notified of the terms. Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, was not available for comment but a company official said WMC had not been notified of the terms and had not yet decided whether to exercise its rights. However, most analysts expect WMC to allow the Minorco deal to go through. The deal was announced after-hours in Australia but the WMC share price was virtually unmoved in London yesterday. Analysts suggested the price would have fallen if it was widely anticipated WMC would have to find funds for the deal. The sale is subject to approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb) and the state government of South Australia. However, BP is understood to have discussed the sale, which might have raised problems because of Minorco's South African parentage, with Firb before announcing the deal. Minorco would pay USDollars 240m for equity in the Olympic Dam joint venture company plus Dollars 216m for the project financing loans BP has advanced to WMC. The loans have a face value of Dollars 290m so Minorco is receiving a 26 per cent discount because of the risk involved - they are non-recourse loans serviced from WMC's share of the venture. Minorco would inherit from BP an obligation to fund all future expansion of Olympic Dam. Mr Mike Gordon, Minorco vice-president, corporate finance, said WMC was paying a commercial rate on the BP loans and was covering interest payments and some repayment of capital from income from the mine. WMC reported an operating profit (before tax and interest) of ADollars 19m (Pounds 8m) on its Olympic Dam investment in the year to end 1992, on revenue of ADollars 130m.</p>

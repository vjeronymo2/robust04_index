			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes for base rate cut upset by earnings data - Market Report Weakness in the bond market, following news of a sharp rise in average earnings in the UK, cast fresh clouds over base rate hopes and helped drive the UK stock market down below the FT-SE 3,100 mark yesterday. A rally in mid-afternoon was reversed when Wall Street came in lower behind a nervous Federal bond market. Share prices opened firmly and made further ground in early trading after the news that rates had been trimmed by 12 basis points at the Bundesbank repo tender. Even at that stage, confidence was checked by the refusal of bond markets across Europe to respond favourably to the German move. But London share prices tumbled when gilt-edged securities fell on the release of the lastest statistics on average earnings, unit wage costs and unemployment. The underlying rise of 3.5 per cent in average earnings in February, together with a 1.8 per cent gain in unit wage costs for the three months to February, dealt a further blow to hopes for the cut in UK base rates still sought by many analysts. Share prices quickly fell away behind the June stock index future but, although the future contract briefly pierced the 3,100 mark, the underlying market rallied just above this support level. The respite lasted over the lunchtime pause but selling resumed when New York opened on the downswing to show a fall of 14 Dow points in UK trading hours. Traders said that the more significant pressure on sentiment came from the absence of a recovery in US Federal Bonds. Markets remain nervous of a further tightening of credit policy by the Federal Reserve, perhaps after next week's meeting of G7 ministers. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,098.3, with a net loss on the day of 29.7 points. Equity chartists now see little support before the 3,060 area unless there is a move on base rates. Analysts expressed some nervousness ahead of this morning's announcement of domestic retail sales for March, which will flesh out the report from the Confederation of British Industries this week that retail sales appeared to be slowing down. At the time, this was seen as encouraging for a hopes of a base rate cut but, in the light of yesterday's average earnings data, might now be received less favourably. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 23.3 to 3,782.6 as profit-takers moved in on the cyclical stocks which have been among the better favoured equities over the past month. Seaq volume was slow to develop, with most of the institutions confining their attentions to special situations; bid speculation was heard in the oil sector but across the range of equities, activity was restrained by renewed reports of heavy losses in UK bonds. The day's Seaq total of 675.5m shares compared with 769.5m on Tuesday, when retail or customer business was worth Pounds 1.43bn. Around 54 per cent of yesterday's business was in non-Footsie stocks. The biggest losses came among the banks and similar financial stocks, which have been strong in recent weeks as interest rate activity has boosted activity in the securities markets where these companies hold and trade their assets. But analysts agreed that it was the uncertainty in European and US bond markets, reflected in highly erratic performances by UK government bonds, which is unsettling UK equities.</p>

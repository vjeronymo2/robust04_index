			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SHIFT PANAMA AID TO DOMESTIC USES, SENATE DEMOCRATS URGE  </P> <P> Saying "charity begins at home," Senate Democrats took aim today at a bill to  send $720 million in emergency aid to Panama and Nicaragua, seeking to shift  some of the money from Panama to domestic uses.  </P> <P> "Our own people cry out for help," said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), calling  for a national debate on foreign aid priorities.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying there shouldn't be any foreign aid program. But we need a  responsible foreign aid program."  </P> <P> The aid for the new U.S.-backed governments in Central America is the  centerpiece of a $2.3-billion supplemental spending bill adopted this week by  the Senate Appropriations Committee that also includes money for a variety of  uses at home, ranging from food stamps to Hurricane Hugo relief.  </P> <P> The bill, like one passed this month by the House, provides the full $300  million sought by President Bush for Nicaragua and $420 million of the $500  million the President wanted for Panama.  </P> <P> But Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, offered an amendment  cutting aid to Panama by another $120 million. He said the money he wanted to  cut was not going for emergencies, pointing out that it included $30 million to  encourage tourism to Panama.  </P></p>

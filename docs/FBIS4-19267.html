			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aslak Bonde report: "Frontline Figures Reelected </F> in SME"]    [Text] Hallvard Bakke and Tove Strand Gerhardsen were  yesterday reelected as the key figures in Social Democrats  Against the EU [European Union] (SME). Bakke as leader and  Strand Gerhardsen as deputy leader. The leader of the Norwegian  Printers Union, Finn Erik Thoresen, was also reelected as deputy  leader, but he did not play the same role as the other two at  the weekend's national conference in Oslo.    Yesterday it was Strand Gerhardsen who inspired the meeting  with a speech which was more sober than most of the other "No to  the EU" speeches at present. Her main message is that Norway  will have "a little more scope" to pursue social democratic  policies if we remain outside the EU.    She reached few firm conclusions and admitted that she had a  great understanding for the "yes" side's argument that we have  to join the EU to achieve influence:    "This was after all one of the reasons why the labor  movement  entered the Storting. The problem is simply this: What are we  to change and together with whom are we to change it?    ``We have after all accepted the foundation of EU  cooperation  in the form of the Maastricht Treaty. This is something we  cannot change. Also, those who are already members of the EU  have been involved in getting this foundation adopted. There  are many good social democrats in the EU, but I am unable to see  that they have enough strength to change anything in  particular,'' the SME deputy leader said.    She hinted that it would be more difficult to pursue social  welfare policies in Norway, in part because we will have to pay  billions to the EU in membership contributions. She expressed  fears of increased unemployment because she takes the view that  the EU does not give the same high priority to the fight for  full employment as we have done -- and can do -- here in Norway.    She also complained about the lack of democracy in the EU  and  said that in many respects Norway could be a pioneer if we  remain outside.    "Then we would have the potential to try new things, and of  course to go wrong and make mistakes, but perhaps also to  develop new policies which can be the model for policies  elsewhere. It would be nice if we once again could be a  pioneer, as we in the Nordic area were when it came to welfare  policy, and as we in the Nordic area perhaps have been when it  comes to women in political life," Strand Gerhardsen said.    She was rewarded with a lengthy standing ovation from the  delegates at the national conference. In addition to the  central executive board there were two representatives from each  province. SME does not have the money to arrange larger  conferences. [passage omitted]</p>

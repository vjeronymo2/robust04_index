			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Borrowing figures point to upturn BORROWING by UK consumers picked up in October, adding to patchy evidence that a recovery in retail sales is under way. Official credit business figures yesterday showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 76m in October, reversing two successive months of net repayments. New credit advanced by British finance houses, building societies and on bank credit cards was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.84bn, down from Pounds 4.37bn in September. This figure was in line with market expectations, but the growth in net consumer credit surprised economists. They had forecast a rise of only Pounds 20m. The drop in new credit advanced means the rise in net borrowing reflected a slower rate of repayments by consumers rather than a big rise in the number of new debts taken on. Although this latest figure is encouraging and will fuel expectations that the economy is slowly recovering, it is too early to say that the trend in consumer borrowing is upwards. In the three months to the end of October, consumers repaid a net Pounds 20m against net borrowings of Pounds 91m in the three months to the end of July. The monthly growth of Pounds 76m compares with growth of more than Pounds 200m a month at the end of 1990. The figures from the Central Statistical Office account for only about 15 per cent of total private sector debt, as they do not include mortgages. The Central Statistical Office plans to aim its press releases at wider audiences. At a conference on economic and business statistics, Mr Bill McLennan, the director of the CSO, said the office aimed to publish more trend estimates and increase the analytic content of its press releases.

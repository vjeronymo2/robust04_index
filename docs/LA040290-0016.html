			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERCROWDING  </P> <P> After six years of going slowly insane on Southern California freeways, I  recently took a 20% cut in pay for the opportunity to walk to work every  morning. During the same morning hours when I used to gnash my teeth, breathe  carbon monoxide, and be appalled at the inconsiderate driving habits of  pinheads in mini-trucks, I now read the paper over a leisurely cup of coffee,  go for a bike ride and listen to the birds sing.  </P> <P> I hold no illusions that my decision will have any impact on the commuter  situation in general simply because the greed-head developers and the elected  officials that they have bought and paid for will continue to throw up  clone-home "neighborhoods" as quickly as people move here to fill them up.  </P> <P> I know that this part of the country will never again be the beautiful, clean  place that it was when I was growing up, but perhaps the aggravation and stress  that I am avoiding with my job change will help delay my inevitable emigration  for a few more years.  </P> <P> P.S. If you love California, let your water run over the curb and into the  gutter -- drought is the only force that can stop development!  </P> <P> STEVE GARCIA  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Offerings of bonds and equities reach record THE volume of international bond and equity offerings rose to record levels in the first half of 1992, boosted by lower interest rates and bullish world stock markets, but syndicated lending showed a further decline. The decrease in bank financing reflects the shortage of bank credit, as banks try to conserve scarce capital. In addition, they have become more wary of lending to companies which could face financial difficulties, following a series of well-publicised defaults on bank debt. Meanwhile, companies have taken advantage of strong stock markets to restore their balance sheets and widen their shareholder base, while lower interest rates have encouraged a wave of refinancing in the international bond markets. Equity offerings totalling Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.8bn) were sold to international investors, compared with Dollars 9bn in the first half of 1991, and international bond volume rose to Dollars 147bn, a 14.5 per cent increase, according to IFR Securities Data. Meanwhile, syndicated lending totalled Dollars 164bn in the first six months, marking a 32 per cent drop from the first half of 1991, according to Euromoney. The pace of activity in the international bond markets is not expected to ease in the second half of the year. However, the recent malaise of many of the world's stock markets has already caused a number of planned equity offerings to be cancelled or postponed. US groups dominate, Page 19</p>

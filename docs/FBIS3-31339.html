			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to the Association of </F> Swiss Bankers in Wolfsberg on 31 January: "The Czech Republic's  Transformation and the European Context"]    [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus delivered a speech on  31 January in the Association of Swiss Banks' Study Center in  Wolfsberg on general experiences involved in the transformation  of the postcommunist countries. The speech, supplemented by a  discussion, was delivered in German. The addendum on  Macroeconomic Rules, published below, was not contained in the  speech.    The subject of my speech is a discussion on the current  epochal role of the postcommunist countries within the context  of European integration. This role is characterized by a number  of specific national traits and features; however, it also has  its own general laws that are today better understood and better  formulated and that will certainly soon be written down in a  manual entitled "How the Communist System Is Being Transformed."  <H5>  The Domestic View </H5>   There are three prerequisites for successful transformation:    1. Formulating a clear vision--that is, a vision of a social  order in accordance with our own ideals (the ideological role);    2. Creating a general consensus in society, which, of  course,  is impossible without "selling" this vision in a contest among  political parties (within the framework of parliamentary  democracy);    3. Understanding for the peculiarities of the transition  period and then, in particular, for the ability of the political  representatives to put into practice, decisively and  purposefully and, at the same time, sensitively, flexibly, and  considerately, the reform strategy following from this. This  means with regard to the social sectors of the population that  will, in the short term, have to come to terms with certain  negative factors in this process (the economic role).    Of all of the postcommunist countries, the Czech Republic  has  made the most progress in this role, despite the unfortunate  breakup of the state, which we really did not want. We have  already achieved the following:    --we have established a party-political system corresponding  to Western standards, including ideologically "well-defined"  parties;    --we have won reliable support from the public (to date,  there has not been a single serious conflict in the social  sphere);    --we have formulated a sensible and very liberal economic  policy;    --the Czech Republic has the lowest and most controlled rate  of inflation (approximately 10 percent per annum);    --we have a very low unemployment level (3.5 percent at the  end of 1993);    --we have a balanced state budget;    --despite the fact that we introduced a functioning system  for the Czech koruna's internal convertibility, we have a stable  foreign currency exchange rate (for 37 months now, since  December 1990);    --we have a balance of payments surplus and rising foreign  currency reserves, and our exports are increasing rapidly;    --the decline of the gross national product has been halted;    --we have attained a rapid pace in deregulation,  liberalization, and privatization.    These are all factors that plainly differentiate us from the  other Central and East European states.  <H5>  The Obstacles and Twists and Turns of Transformation </H5>   The results of the recent elections in Poland and also the  political disputes in Russia--just to mention two  examples--indicate that the transition process from communism to  democracy and a market economy will not follow a direct route  but will contain obstacles and twists and turns, and also that  this process will take longer in different countries. In the  West, the problems of the postcommunist countries are considered  to be a consequence of the blocking tactics of the supporters of  the old social orders. This is also the view held by a sizable  percentage of the public in postcommunist countries.  Unfortunately, these ideas do not correspond at all to the  facts. Far greater obstacles to the reform process--of course,  not so much in the Czech Republic as in the other postcommunist  countries--are:    --insisting on a negative vision (unity in rejecting the  communist past is a characteristic feature, however) without  establishing a positive consensus (the result is extreme  political atomization);    --a lingering unwillingness to give up state paternalism. Of  course, satisfaction at the demise of political confinement and  the bureaucratic restriction of economic freedom (especially  private ownership) is clearly formulated here, but this is  something else. Preference is still given to security (to a  relatively high level of welfare) over the insecurity that may  be caused by the greater risks of the results of a market  economy;    --the illusions of left-wing intellectuals (constantly  nourished from the West) about various "third ways," about the  possibility of establishing a just and efficiently functioning  world, and about the necessity of managing social processes by a  so-called select intellectual elite;    --petty politicking instead of a realistic and pragmatic  policy. The attempt to achieve the maximum political effect in  the shortest possible time instead of a clear-sighted political  strategy, and political gestures instead of everyday meticulous  political work;    --a misunderstanding of the inevitabilities of the epoch of  transition, inability to cope with reform strategy, and the  incorrect choice of the sequence of the individual reform steps.   <H5>    The Rules for Transformation </H5>   I would like to mention in this regard a few basic but  important rules for transformation. Any attempt to plan the  individual reform steps in detail does not have a chance.  Despite this, certain basic rules should be observed. My  experiences tell me that we have to begin with a considerable  dose of restrictive macroeconomic policy. This way, we will  achieve the basis for liberalizing prices and liberalizing  foreign trade and also, by reducing subsidies, a dramatic  turnaround in the economic climate.    A country that does not initiate this macroeconomic policy  at  the very beginning of the reform process will, inevitably, find  itself in a situation that I described four years ago as a  "reform trap": This is a vicious circle of high inflation (or  even hyperinflation), repeated devaluation of the currency,  rising foreign indebtedness, budget deficits, and so on. I  venture to claim that the CSFR was, and the current Czech  Republic is, a country that unequivocally and without any  pressure from outside introduced, deliberately and more  decisively, these unpopular but essential measures.    Radical and merciless liberalization of prices and foreign  trade is another essential measure. In this way, we will  achieve:    --the opening up of markets;    --a market evaluation of property, goods, and services;    --changes in the former irrational modes of behavior;    --economic balance;    --and the economic entities at the supply side of the market  will receive the right signals.    The exchange rate, at this point, must become a firm nominal  anchor. It must operate like an Archimedes point for the whole  economic system, the only stable nominal value for the economy  that does not succumb to fluctuations. The currency, evaluated  by its purchasing power parity, has to be substantially devalued  on account of the enormous structural defects of the centrally  planned economy, defects that manifest themselves in the form of  a balance-of-payments deficit.    After the government has resisted appeals for help,  subsidies, modernization, and demonopolization, it must commence  a comprehensive process of privatization. This is the only way  to achieve far-reaching changes, this is the only way to find  real (and, therefore, responsible and rationally behaving)  owners, and this is the only way to strike a meaningful blow  against the attempts of bureaucracy to control the economy.    These basic rules for the course of reform are certainly  neither original nor innovative. If they seem original to us,  this is merely because they are often forgotten and ignored.  <H5>  The Foreign Aspects </H5>   All of transformation must be carried out at home, and,  therefore, the role of the "rest of the world" is small. We  need general political support, we also need guarantees for our  external security, and we need financial support in the form of  loans from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.  Otherwise, we "only" need our integration into the global  economy. And this is far more difficult than it seemed at first  glance.    Our former artificial economic integration--the Council for  Mutual Economic Assistance--now, fortunately, belongs to the  past. Economic relations within the framework of this  integration did not depend on the comparative advantages of the  individual member countries; therefore, they cannot be--at  least, without exerting coercive pressure--restored. It will be  many years before these countries are again financially and  economically consolidated; therefore, it is impossible in the  short and medium-time frame to bank on an increase in mutual  trade. For this reason, the proposals from the West concerning  increasing cooperation--for example, within the framework of the  so-called Visegrad Group--are also groundless. Such cooperation  cannot be created from above, but only--and perhaps only--from  below.  <H5>  Futile "Maastricht" Ambitions </H5>   The Western world--first and foremost, West Europe and the  European Union--has its own problems. These problems are  characterized by the current unfavorable phase of economic  development and by the excessive social burden of state  interventionism. They also stem from lofty and, in my opinion,  futile "Maastricht" ambitions, ambitions we can say of a  unitarist or almost unitarist perception of Europe. This all  leads--although the external rhetoric of West European  politicians says otherwise--to less openness toward the  postcommunist world. When I said a few months ago that, after  the 1989 "Velvet Revolution" the West had hung up a "Do Not  Disturb" sign, this was certainly an exaggeration and a extreme  oversimplification. However, the continuing protectionism  applied in multifarious forms represents a considerable threat  to our transformation role. The East is often criticized for  the nationalism of its ethnic conflicts, but I would like to  point out that protectionism is also a form of nationalism.    The collapse of the Soviet empire created a completely new  situation for us, and we are aware of this. Naturally, the  collapse of the Soviet empire also created a completely new  situation for the West. It also brought new uncertainties, new  doubts, and new questions. We observe ambivalent tendencies and  phenomena at both ends of Europe, which we cannot accept  passively. We have to proceed actively against them.   <H5>    Centralization, Bureaucratization, Lobbies </H5>   In the West, we can also see:    --increasing centralization of the economic processes and  the  bureaucratization of everyday life;    --increasing activity by various lobbies asserting only  partial interests, which endangers the entire community (new  feudalization);    --the transfer of decisionmaking to an international level,  the consequence of which is that standard domestic control  mechanisms lose their function and that the key role remains in  the hands of an unelected bureaucracy;    --a certain comfortableness in political life, a loss of  political courage, and giving priority to one's own political  survival instead of to fundamental decisionmaking, which is  unavoidably associated with substantially greater risks;    --certain etatist thinking, ideas about an all-providing  welfare guaranteeing state, while only a few people realize that  the state can guarantee such a function only under the  precondition that its citizens surrender a major part of their  freedom.  <H5>  A Challenge for the Whole of Europe </H5>   Resolving these problems presented by the new situation is a  challenge for all of us--in the West and in the East.    During those periods in which Europe was not fatefully  divided, it always represented unity in abundance. The vision  of European union in the sense of unification was always, in the  better instance, a utopia, a dream bearing no relation to  reality. In the worse instance, for example, in its  "Napoleonic" variant, it involved an attempt by the larger  powers to assert a European hegemony. Such solutions were  always short-term ones, and they were always characterized by  the use of force.    T. G. Masaryk, the first president of the Czechoslovak  Republic before World War II, wrote the following about this  problem in 1922:    "The issue in Europe involves creating harmony between  centralist and autonomist forces. Europe's unity consists of  this harmony. However, unity is not just homogeneity. Europe is  characterized by its ethnic and cultural differences. This  variety was formed by thousands of years of development;  therefore, European unity must be realized, first and foremost,  in accordance with the historical principle and, apart from  this, of course, in accordance with the given natural national  and other differences." Masaryk, in the 1920's, considered the  so-called Balkanization of Europe to be a great  oversimplification. According to him, the issue in fact  involved a historical process and an attempt by entire nations  and countries to intensify their whole political and cultural  life.    The following conclusions are drawn from this: The current  changes in Europe create the need for a new analysis about what  Europe is and what Europe should be.    Europe, whether we like it or not, was opened up to the East  by the collapse of the communist bloc. Europe was in fact  expanded and it must now react to this new situation. The idea  that the postcommunist countries will gradually be  "Europeanized" and the promises that they will then be able to  be gradually integrated into an unchanged West Europe are  inadequate and, in principle, false. We need a new vision and  new initiatives. Truly meaningful European cooperation can only  take place on the basis of openness and mutuality, and that is  something that we in the postcommunist countries perceive and  see only inadequately. We are prepared to take an active part  in this work, and we believe that we will be given an  opportunity for this.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Rules </H5>   Finding the right time to change economic policy  administration from a restrictive to a neutral or even an  expansive policy is a very difficult task. During the radical  transformation process, the economy is anything but a  homogeneous unit. For this reason, the turning point on the  aggregate supply curve--from the horizontal to the vertical part  of the curve--is very acute and lies far below the level of full  employment. Although in this situation there is considerable  pressure to artificially stimulate the economy, we must resist  it.    In the first two years of our transformation, before and  immediately after liberalizing prices, we asserted a restrictive  policy with the state budget surpluses, and only then did we  turn toward a neutral macroeconomic administration with a  balanced state budget. We are sticking to this line today.  According to my estimates, not one of the reforming East  European countries has yet reached the stage at which liberating  fiscal and monetary policy and initiating a Keynesian  demand-oriented policy would be warranted.    The unavoidable inflationary response following price  liberalization must be announced in advance, explained, and  defended, and, first and foremost, the political leadership must  "survive" it. The initial price increases depend on the  inherited level of macroeconomic imbalance; on the whole, it was  slight in the CSFR and huge in Poland, Russia, and the other  successor states to the USSR. On the other hand, the dynamism of  prices later in the reform process is determined by the extent  of the restrictions on finance and monetary policy.    In the CSFR's case, the rise in prices a month after the  start of the reforms was a "mere" 25 percent. In the ensuing  three months, the rate of inflation stabilized at 7.0 percent,  4.5 percent, and 2.0 percent, and, during the next 20 months  (right up to the introduction of the value-added tax), hovered  at just under 1.0 percent per month. In the other reforming  countries, there were--and still are--considerable fluctuations  in the rate of inflation with repeated phases of a more rapid  and then a slower rise in prices, for which the mistakes in  macroeconomic policy are responsible.    This policy can only hope to succeed if two aspects leading  to the vicious circle can be limited: the price-wage and  inflation-devaluation spirals. On the basis of our experiences,  the two phenomena are closely associated with unforced errors in  economic policy. During the phase of macroeconomic restrictions  (1990-91), wages in our country were kept below the level of the  general increase in prices. During the "neutral policy" phase  (1992-93), wages rose rather faster than prices, while no  serious problems arose from this; wages did not lose contact  with the other pan-economic variable quantities.    The same applies for the connections between inflation and  the exchange rate. Reforming countries are, as a rule,  confronted with a considerable macroeconomic imbalance (the  consequence of which is unavoidable rapid price increases),  overvalued currencies (with considerable payment deficits and  exhausted foreign currency reserves), and high state budget  deficits (the consequence of an inadequate restrictive policy).  At the same time, reforming countries do not sufficiently  devalue their currencies. The result of this is that, given  increasing domestic prices, exports decline and imports rise.  This leads to a worsening of the balance of payments situation,  which necessitates further devaluation and so leads to the  import of inflation. This in turn stimulates a rise in domestic  prices, which leads to the vicious circle.    In our country, the situation is and was different. The  original inherited macroeconomic imbalance was slight, economic  policy was cautious and oriented restrictively, and the  devaluation, as it turned out, was sufficient. The substantial  devaluation created enough scope for essential prices and costs'  adaptation in the ensuing period. It seems that it is possible  to avoid the danger of the vicious economic circle--under the  precondition that economic policy pursues a sensible course.</p>

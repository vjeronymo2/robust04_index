			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: SE-Banken sells Swiss unit Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading Swedish commercial bank, has announced the sale of Banque Scandinave en Suisse (BSS) for more than SKr2bn (Dollars 250m). The buyer is the Sandoz Family Foundation of Lausanne. SE-Banken declined to reveal precise terms for the deal, but said it would have a 'significant positive' effect on earnings and a 'limited positive impact' on its capital ratios. BSS, a private Swiss bank specialising in fund and asset management, made a SFr22m (Dollars 15.2m) profit last year and had total assets of SFr1.3bn as at December 31 1993. Mr Lars Isacsson, SE-Banken chief financial officer, said the sale was part of the group's programme to concentrate on core activities. Earlier this year the bank sold three subsidiaries within the Finans-Skandic group to GE Capital as part of the strategy. Mr Isacsson said SE-Banken intended to remain involved in fund and asset management, but the emphasis would be on the Nordic area. 'Banque Scandinave en Suisse developed a less Scandinavian flavour,' he stated, adding that its importance to the group had diminished as European integration had progressed. The bank intends to retain a private bank in Luxembourg to serve international clients. SE-Banken has owned a stake in BSS since 1964 when the operation was set up in partnership with other Scandinavian banks. At the start of this year it held 79 per cent of the bank before buying the outstanding shares from the Northern Trust Corp of the US a month ago. The Sandoz Family Foundation was set up in 1964 to maintain a 10 per cent voting stake in Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group.</p>

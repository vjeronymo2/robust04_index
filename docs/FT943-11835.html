			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Observer: Moan to Woan An exciting February stock market debut for Clinical Computing's shares will have been scant comfort to its investors this week. On Tuesday, the medical software company had a minor emergency of its own - a Pounds 227,000 loss for the first half of the year. At least one shareholder was, however, considerably placated yesterday when he received a letter from Jeremy Woan, the chief executive. Acknowledging that private investors might 'feel isolated' at results reporting time when senior management is rolled out to talk to the institutional investors, the letter proposes a rather simple home-spun alternative. Woan and his colleagues are making themselves available by phone at certain hours today and Monday. Let's hope the company will soon be of a size where it becomes impractical for the boss to bend his ear to shareholder concerns in such a direct fashion. Then he has to come up with an equally refreshing way to deal with the concerns of larger pools of investors.</p>

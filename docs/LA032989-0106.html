			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAZIL STICKS TO ECONOMIC PLAN DESPITE SETBACK;  </P> <P> EARLY REPORTS SHOW BIG INFLATION RISE IN MARCH  </P> <P> A sharp increase in the cost of living has undermined the Brazilian  government's latest plan for controlling inflation, but officials vow that they  will press on with the proposal.  </P> <P> The program of consumer price controls and government spending cuts, imposed  Jan. 15, reduced inflation from an official monthly rate of 28.8% in December  to 3.6% in February. But according to preliminary calculations for the month  ending March 15, inflation resurged to between 6% and 7%.  </P> <P> President Jose Sarney expressed "perplexity" this week at the March rate and  warned that economic stability is important for strengthening Brazil's  democratic institutions.  </P> <P> "If hyper-inflation defeats us, it is the institutions that will be the first  victims," Sarney said through a spokesman.  </P> <P> Finance Minister Mailson Nobrega insisted that the March increase does not mean  that the anti-inflation program, the so-called summer plan, has failed.  "Although worrisome, it is not a threat," he told reporters Monday. "It was an  accident along the way that should not repeat itself in the future."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Spending Blamed  </P> <P> The March inflation rate was strongly influenced by increases in rents, used  car prices and other consumer costs that are not closely controlled, Nobrega  said. In a television interview Tuesday, he promised tougher controls and  added, "We believe we are correct and the results will appear."  </P> <P> Mario Amato, president of the Industrial Federation of the State of Sao Paulo,  blamed the resurgence of inflation on government spending. He said an increase  of 22% in the monetary base since Jan. 15 "indicates that the government  continues to spend more than it should."  </P> <P> Part of the summer plan was a government pledge to eliminate its budget deficit  if the Congress would approve personnel cuts. The Congress declined, however.  </P> <P> Some economists say major causes of official overspending and persistent  inflation are heavy payments on Brazil's $115-billion foreign debt and high  domestic interest rates. In the past month the government has borrowed at  monthly interest rates in the range of 20%.  </P> <P> "The interest rates should have been contained from the beginning of the plan,"  economist Carlos Alberto Longo said. He said the March inflation rate of more  than 6% is "proof that the plan did not work and that once again the workers  are the losers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wages Negotiated  </P> <P> A wage freeze included in the plan has raised waves of labor unrest and  strikes. On Tuesday in Rio, bus drivers and train crews started a strike that  left the city without its main means of public transportation.  </P> <P> Government, labor and business officials are negotiating the amount of a  proposed wage increase that employers could pay without increasing consumer  prices. The increase would be aimed at restoring the purchasing power that has  been eroded from wages by inflation. Business leaders say the increase should  be about 10%, while labor leaders are demanding 50%.  </P> <P> Since it succeeded a military regime in 1985, Sarney's civilian administration  has imposed three price control programs. After the failure of the second in  1987, inflation soared to a record 934% in 1988 and economic output failed to  increase.  </P></p>

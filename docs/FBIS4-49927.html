			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, may 12 (XINHUA) -- More and more inmates  in China have been turned into skillful workers by the time  their prison terms expire through prison training courses,  prison officials said.    Officials attending an ongoing national conference on reform  training here told XINHUA that some 1.2 million prisoners who  have been released since 1984 have acquired different levels of  diplomas and some one million of them have won technical titles  after studying in prison training courses.    Only 5.39 percent of those released have committed crimes  again, according to information at the meeting.    Wang Mingdi, chief of the reform bureau under the Ministry  of  Justice, said that Chinese prisons always respect the dignity of  inmates, and never discriminate against or maltreat them because  China's reformation organs assume that all criminals can be  reformed.    Training courses offering lectures in law, morals, culture  and scientific knowledge have been set up in China's 700 prisons.    "Skills and techniques learned in prison increase  reemployment possibilities for prison inmates after their  release," Wang said. "Re-employment helps cut the rate of crime  recurrences."    He said Chinese prisons have achieved satisfactory results  in  setting up training courses and individual prisoners are  channeled into different courses according to their knowledge  level.    "The training courses have helped turn Chinese prisons into  special training schools," he said.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Japanese PM quips 'I quit' but joke is on him Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's embattled prime minister, has discovered that telling jokes to comedians can backfire. He was obliged yesterday to deny that he wanted to resign after two comedians, also independent members of the upper house of parliament, said Mr Hosokawa had quipped, during dinner, that he was so exhausted he wanted to stand down. The professional comics divulged their revelation in a television interview after dining with Mr Hosokawa in central Tokyo on Tuesday. Mr Yasushi Shimomura - stage name Columbia Top - expressed surprise that anybody took Mr Hosokawa's outburst seriously. Mr Kiyoshi Nishikawa, who performs under his own name inside and outside parliament, said he also took the prime minister's resignation remark as a joke. Under increasing pressure, Mr Hosokawa was said to have told companions that he felt frustrated at not having the freedom to admire the glorious cherry blossoms blooming across Tokyo. Mr Shimomura said he knew Mr Hosokawa was really tired when the prime minister asked if he could finish up the comedian's eels and rice - a dish said to have restorative qualities. Their remarks whipped up an instant storm. A startled Mr Hosokawa called the latest in a series of midnight press conferences which have become a hallmark of his chaotic government. 'I never said anything about quitting,' he said. Mr Hosokawa's slip is the latest blow to his already weakened credibility. It has aroused suspicions that his patience is indeed being worn down and that coalition allies will now start to seek a replacement. It was only a matter of time before Mr Hosokawa does resign, said Mr Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. 'I think he really did say he wants to quit, because it is about time for him to go,' Mr Mori said. Mr Hosokawa is already struggling to disprove LDP allegations of financial irregularities. He has been forced into embarrassing U-turns over the past two months on plans for a rise in consumption tax, a cabinet reshuffle and a merger of the seven parties in his coalition. This latest misunderstanding drew attacks from Mr Hosokawa's own allies and the LDP, which is blocking parliamentary debate on the annual budget until he produces documents or a former aide to testify on an allegedly irregular loan. The budget blockage has caused growing alarm among Japanese businesses. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, yesterday called on the government to give the budget bill top priority and discuss scandal outside the main session. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the prime minister 'must have made a remark that could be linked to resigning'. The coalition should now consider LDP demands for Mr Hosokawa to produce full evidence to disprove the loan allegations, Mr Takemura said.

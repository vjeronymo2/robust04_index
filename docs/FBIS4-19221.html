			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Huge Bomb Found North of Rome"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) - Rome, April 14 - A 70kg bomb discovered by  the side of a road north of Rome was blown up in a controlled  explosion Thursday evening [14 April], official sources said.    The explosive device, consisting of three cartons linked  with  wires and batteries, was spotted by the manager of a nearby  service station, who alerted the police. The bomb had been  placed in the gutter of the via Formellese, a small road leading  into and out of Rome, and had been covered by tree branches.    A special bomb unit was called in to deal with the device.  The controlled explosion was heard for miles around, and windows  were shattered in nearby houses, which had been evacuated.    According to well-informed sources, the bomb was planted  near  the home of Mafia supergrass Salvatore Contorno, but police  refused to comment on speculation that Contorno was the target  for the bomb. Interior Ministry sources said that "at this point  nothing can be ruled out."    Contorno is reported to live about seven km from the point  where the bomb was placed, but does not travel that road every  evening, well-informed sources said.    The device was blown up by a robot after explosives experts  examined it and failed to defuse it manually. The robot directed  a jet of water towards it, causing an explosion, but detailed  photographs were taken beforehand. Investigators are now combing  the fields around the bomb site for the remains of the device  which, the sources said, was probably to have been set off by  means of a radio command.    Contorno, 48, settled down in the area near Lake Bracciano  north of Rome after an unsuccessful attempt at living under a  witness protection scheme in the United States. He was arrested  a first time in the Lake Bracciano region in 1982, when another  supergrass, Tommaso Buscetta, persuaded him to collaborate with  the authorities. His confessions led to 127 arrest warrants, but  the collaboration slowed down and then dried up completely  because, he said, "many of the people I accused were acquiteed  and set free. Today the Mafia is stronger than ever, and Cosa  Nostra's vendetta could strike me at any moment."    Contorno has lost 19 members of his and his wife's family in  Mafia vendettas, and about thirty of his friends have fallen  under Mafia bullets.    In a statement to ANSA this evening, Contorno's lawyer Luigi  Li Gotti said "they predicted this. These mafiosi turned state's  evidence have said many times that there would be bloody attacks  against them."    According to Maria Rita Bonafede, the mayor of Formello  where  Contorno lives, the supergrass has no police escort, unlike  former magistrate Carlo Palermo who occasionally visits the area  to rest in his house outside the town.</p>

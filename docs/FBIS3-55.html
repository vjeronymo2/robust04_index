			<p>The     ouster of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar by five diverse  opposition parties has led to the establishment of an interim  government with no program beyond acting as a caretaker  government until early parliamentary elections, scheduled for 31  September and 1 October.  Meciar, whose ouster was preceded by a  series of defections from his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and its partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS), has  begun his election campaign by portraying himself as the main  protector of the country's independence and deriding his  opponents in the new government as traitors to Slovakia.     Suggesting that substantive changes prior to the fall elections  are likely to be minimal, members of the new cabinet have  indicated that the heterogenous coalition's main goal is simply  to keep Meciar out of office and have emphasized the temporary  nature of the governing coalition.  Introducing his cabinet  members to parliament, new Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, a  former foreign minister and erstwhile Meciar ally, admitted that  not all of the government's objectives "can be fulfilled in the  time available" and that its main goal is "to get Slovakia to  early elections" (Bratislava Radio, 17 March).  Moravcik also  said the formation of the new government was part of an effort to  "unite very divergent and disunited entities" in order to "lay  the foundations for a new political culture" (Narodna Obroda, 16  March).  More pointedly, the government, in its "statement of  intent," described itself as a coalition of "people with  different political opinions" united by the "need to overcome the  authoritarian way of ruling" practiced by the Meciar government  and to "create conditions for respect, tolerance, and cooperation  among citizens" (Bratislava TV, 16 March).      At the same time, the coalition parties appear to be coalescing  in their efforts to prevent Meciar from making yet another  comeback, while calling for a preelection truce among themselves.  Peter Weiss, the leader of the former communist Party of the  Democratic Left (SDL), said that in order to defeat Meciar, the  coalition must "convince the electorate" that it is possible to  govern "by means of cooperation and reasonable compromises" (CTK,  22 March).  Likewise, Christian Democratic Party (KDH) leader Jan  Carnogursky said that despite "different views within the  government" all of the coalition parties have a "joint objective"  and "know what is at stake" (Vienna Kurier, 16 March).     It is far from certain that the coalition parties can be held  together until the elections solely by their common perception of  the dangers of Meciar's return to power.  In the past, leaders of  the coalition parties frequently clashed over programatic and  personal differences.  For example, during Carnogursky's tenure  as Slovak prime minister in 1991, Weiss accused him of being  "blind to problems, deaf to criticism, and asocial when it comes  to people"  (Zemedelski Noviny, 19 December 1991).  In addition,  three current ministers -- including the prime minister, a deputy  prime minister, and the finance minister -- were leading HZDS  members in March 1992, when the HZDS accused Carnogursky's  brother of collaboration with the former communist secret police  (Mlada Fronta Dnes, 26 March).      In ousting Meciar now, the opposition parties--galvanized by  President Michal Kovac's parliamentary speech accusing Meciar of  corruption (Bratislava Radio, 9 March)--appeared to be reacting  to reports that Meciar was rapidly selling off state enterprises  to political cronies  (Narodna Obroda, 15 March).  After Kovac's  speech, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL)  agreed to join the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), along  with three new parties  consisting of former HZDS and SNS members  voted to dismiss Meciar and to form a new governing coalition.  The coalition agreed to give the SDL seven cabinet seats, the KDH  six seats, and the "Center Bloc" of former "Meciarites" five  seats, including the prime ministership.  Calling for an  investigation into the rapid sell-off of state firms during  Meciar's last weeks in office, new Privatization Minister Milan  Janicina called the privatization spree a "form of political  corruption," comparing it to "when William the Conqueror invaded  Britain and handed out property to his beloved Normans"  (Bratislava Radio, 17 March).  Likewise, Finance Minister Rudolf  Filkus, a founding member of the HZDS who was expelled from the  party in September 1993, announced that one of the government's  first acts will be to "depoliticize the privatization process,"  which he contended had "become a tool for the political  concentration of power" under Meciar (CTK, 16 March).     Meciar's Strategy     Using what is likely to be the main theme of his election  campaign, Meciar reacted to his ouster by portraying himself as  indispensable for Slovak independence.  In a parliamentary speech  just prior to the no-confidence vote, Meciar asserted that by  leading the country to independence he has "managed to achieve  what no Slovak has succeeded in achieving in several decades or  even centuries" (Bratislava Radio, 11 March).  Meciar also  contended that as prime minister he frequently had to rectify  foreign policy mistakes made by President Kovac, such as  attempting to sell arms to Croatia, almost provoking an  "international crisis" with China by proposing the recognition of  Taiwan, and "wasting an opportunity" to improve relations with  the United States during President Clinton's January visit to  Prague.  The day before his ouster, Meciar also claimed that by  confronting the chief of the Czechoslovak Army's General Staff in  late 1992, he and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had prevented  a possible "attack against Slovakia" by the Army (CTK, 11 March).      In addition, Meciar and the pro-Meciar daily Republika have also  suggested that the new government represents a threat to Slovak  sovereignty.  After his ouster, Meciar said that the new  government and the puppet government installed by Nazi Germany in  1939 "might be similar" (Bratislava Radio, 14 March).  Republika  chief editor Jan Smolec, a Meciar stalwart, called the prime  minister's ouster a "Czechoslovakist, communist, and Hungarian  conspiracy" (Republika, 12 March)--a reference to the KDH's past  opposition to the split of Czechoslovakia, the presence of the  SDL in the coalition, and the tacit support of the Hungarian  minority deputies for the new coalition.  Emphasizing the  communist past of Moravcik and the SDL, a front-page article in  Republika on 16 March accused the new prime minister of grabbing  the "post that he was modestly longing for around the Leninist  campfire" as a member of the communist "Leninist Spark"  organization in 1989, compared the formation of the new cabinet  to the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, and charged  that SDL leader Peter Weiss "hides badly his longing for the  renewal of communist power."   Outlook     While the opposition parties may have managed to thwart Meciar's  attempts to consolidate his power in newly-privatized firms, the  new coalition's gains will be short-lived if the HZDS, which  continues to top public opinion polls (CTK, 22 March), improves  on its June 1992 performance.  Freed from the burdens of  governing, Meciar may have more success campaigning as an  opposition figure rather than as a defender of the country's  flagging economy, and his bloc of 65 deputies--56 HZDS deputies  and nine SNS seats--in the 150-member parliament may prevent  passage of any substantial reform legislation before the  elections.  Operating against Meciar, however, is the possibility  of further defections from his party, the apparent decline in  popularity of the SNS, and the limited possibility of the HZDS  forming a postelection coalition with the parties that  participated in his ouster.  Although the HZDS will likely end up  with a larger share of seats than it currently holds, having  suffered the defection of 18 of its deputies in the last year, if  Meciar is to regain and maintain the prime ministership, the HZDS  will have to capture a solid majority of the seats in parliament-  -something it did not achieve in June 1992 when it fell one  deputy shy of a parliamentary majority.  If the HZDS again falls  short, the other parties may find themselves in an awkward  marriage of convenience, united only over the danger posed by  Meciar, while he attacks them from his opposition seat in  parliament.

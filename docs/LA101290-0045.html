			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> FORMER MAYOR GETS 9 YEARS IN PRISON  </P> <P> The former mayor of South Lake Tahoe was sentenced to nine years in prison on  drug and money-laundering charges, but not before he tearfully accused federal  investigators of threatening to kill him if he did not commit illegal acts.  </P> <P> "I was told if I went to the police, I'd be killed," said Terry Trupp, his  voice cracking with emotion as he read a statement to U.S. District Judge  Milton Schwartz. Trupp, 47, said he became involved in the illegal scheme  because he thought that he was helping the CIA and that prosecutors  orchestrated the entire transaction. He was arrested in June, 1989, with his  wife, Kimberly, as the result of an elaborate 20-month federal sting called  Operation Deep Snow.  </P></p>

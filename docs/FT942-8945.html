			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / High-wire act in a bear garden: John Plender explores the impact of trading in derivatives and other financial instruments on the US banking system At the start of the year, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was credited with unusual sagacity. His adroit manipulation of monetary policy over the previous four years had restored the capital of the US banking system and averted a credit crunch. Today things look altogether different. The financial community is nervous and critical, following successive increases in interest rates that have rattled global markets. Politicians in Congress fear that the high volume of trading in derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and options could lead to a disaster to match the recent savings and loans fiasco. The stability of the US financial structure is once again being questioned against the background of exceptional market volatility. At first sight, that seems paradoxical. If the banking system has been recapitalised and profits are healthy, why worry? Yet the very success of Mr Greenspan's gigantic market-rigging exercise, in which interest rates were held at negligible levels in real terms while the banks traded their way out of trouble, has distracted attention from a radical change in the structure of the banking system. Of far greater long-run importance than the noisy debate about derivatives and hedge funds is the way the biggest wholesale banks - dealing mainly with governments, institutions and companies - have been shrinking their deposits and loan books as they turn themselves into high-octane global marketmakers and dealers, trading in a vast range of on- and off-balance sheet instruments. The visitor to Wall Street is left with the impression that the pace and scale of financial innovation is such that no one can be sure how much capital banks really need to support these activities. Small wonder that, in a report due today, the US General Accounting Office is expected to call for more stringent capital requirements. The low stock market rating accorded to many big commercial and investment banks also suggests that high profitability may reflect nothing more than increased risk-taking. The falls in the biggest US banks' trading profits in the recent first-quarter figures lend credibility to that view. Much the same applies to the investment banks, which the commercial banks increasingly resemble. Salomon Brothers, says its chairman and chief executive officer, Deryck Maughan, went into 1994 with the largest inventory (of financial instruments) in its history. Others were almost certainly in the same position before the storm struck, when the Fed raised interest rates on February 4 for the first time since 1989. If the investment banks adopted the opposite of Japanese just-in-time inventory control last year, the big US commercial banks are becoming more like their Japanese equivalents. Their capital is increasingly vulnerable to market fluctuations, but without the prop of Japanese-style hidden reserves or the albatross of crippling Japanese bad debts. This stems from an approach to banking which reflects the belief that conventional financial intermediation - raising deposits and lending to borrowers - will increasingly be undertaken by markets instead of banks. A growing proportion of such market activity is driven by high technology and relentless innovation, notably in derivatives. The merit or otherwise of the doubters' concerns about new instruments will be explored in a subsequent article. What matters here is the big transformation in the composition of bank revenues and balance sheets. Consider Bankers Trust, whose visionary chairman Charles Sanford regards run-of-the-mill commercial banks as no more than inefficient mutual funds that do a poor job for their depositors. He expects conventional bank intermediation to have largely disappeared by 2020 and is tailoring his banks' activities accordingly. Between 1989 and the end of 1993, Mr Sanford's loan book shrank from Dollars 18.4bn to Dollars 13.9bn, while the financial instruments that Bankers Trust trades on its own account rose from Dollars 12.2bn to Dollars 48.3bn, equivalent to more than half its total assets. Last year revenue from own-account trading, at Dollars 1.6bn, exceeded net interest revenue of Dollars 1.3bn for the first time; and that understates the dependence on trading because net interest revenue included more than Dollars 600m that was related to own-account trading. Meantime the notional amount of instruments such as derivatives, which do not appear on the balance sheet (and whose absolute value in the accompanying tables and charts is less meaningful than their relative value and the year-to-year trend) has soared from Dollars 461bn to Dollars 1,900bn over the period. Equally striking is that the credit risk in relation to counterparties in these off-balance sheet contracts stood at Dollars 61.8bn in Bankers Trust's latest balance sheet, whose stockholders' equity amounted to just Dollars 4.5bn. Bankers Trust is the extreme case of a bank turning itself into a hugely leveraged (highly borrowed) investment dealing company. But others have comparably radical strategies. The giant of the industry, JP Morgan, has seen its net loan book shrink from Dollars 26bn to Dollars 23.2bn over the past five years, where it accounts for a mere 17.3 per cent of total assets. Yet the balance sheet total has increased from Dollars 89bn to Dollars 134bn, with more than two-thirds of the increase coming from the rise in the value of trading account assets. The notional amount of off-balance sheet exposures has risen more than threefold to Dollars 1,700bn in that time (see chart). Much the same process has been at work in the investment banks. When Morgan Stanley went public in the mid-1980s, its prospectus showed own-account transactions amounting to 13.5 per cent of net revenues. In the latest financial year the comparable figure was 38.9 per cent. There were no figures in the original prospectus for swaps and other derivatives, whose notional value stood at Dollars 629bn in Morgan Stanley's latest accounts. Reporting accountants Arthur Young presumably took the view that they were not sufficiently material in 1986 to require disclosure. There were equally dramatic increases in off-balance sheet activity at Salomon Brothers, which has traditionally been heavily dependent on trading for its own account; also at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch (see table). And the big European universal banks are now following suit, leaving the heavily regulated Japanese far in the rear. Few on Wall Street or in London doubt that the US banks have mapped out the future for wholesale finance. Up to a point, it works. Having lost most of their biggest clients after Mexico's default in 1982, when companies discovered that they could cut out the banking middleman and go direct to the markets for funds, the banks have found a new way of ingratiating themselves with their former corporate clients. Risk management and trading products provide an answer to the shortage of bankable assets that followed the third-world debt crisis. The problem is to identify the nature of the risks and profits involved. Charles Sanford at Bankers Trust argues that, if banks constantly adjust the value of their financial instruments to market value - known as 'marking to market' - credit problems will be perceived much earlier than with conventional bank lending. Most institutions that use derivative instruments will only deal with counterparties who have a respectable credit rating. In this kind of world, Mr Sanford claims, the less developed country debt problem would not have happened. 'Bank lending,' he boldly asserts, 'is the most risky thing we do.' Certainly it is hard to deny that these new-style bank balance sheets, with more trading assets than loans, are inherently more liquid than in the past. All the leading players have developed proprietary computer systems, which are capable of monitoring trading exposures on a variety of assumptions at the press of a button. They have risk-weighted capital disciplines that are far in advance of the current global guidelines laid down by the Bank for International Settlements. As Salomon's Deryck Maughan puts it, the big US commercial and investment banks are running larger market risks than five to 10 years ago. 'But they are better equipped and better capitalised,' he adds, 'and have the capacity to manage these risks.' Salomon, in fact, appears more highly leveraged than most (see table) and it would have taken a fall of only 3.9 per cent in the value of those financial instruments actually on the face of its end-1993 group balance sheet to wipe out the whole of its capital. But the company has long argued that such conventional measures of leverage are misleading, because they give no indication of the quality or liquidity of assets, or the risk in off-balance sheet instruments. On its own preferred measure of working capital to equity, it has managed to reduce its leverage substantially since 1990, a period in which its conventional equity-to-assets ratio deteriorated and its off-balance sheet exposure exploded. These sophisticated apologetics notwithstanding, the stock markets remain sceptical. One reason, according to John Kriz of the credit rating agency Moody's, is that over the past 20 years we have been told 'by statesmen of the banking industry, and by technicians as knowledgeable in their particular areas as any derivatives specialists, that their activities were prudently controlled and did not entail excessive risk'. Then came the third-world and real estate debt crises. Another answer might be that new-style balance sheets, in which capital is perpetually expanding and contracting in volatile fashion, have not been tested in protracted bear markets. Moreover, while banks have reduced their own balance sheet leverage by increasing capital, the leverage inherent in the instruments and markets in which they deal has increased vastly. It is not simply that derivative instruments are, by definition, more volatile than the underlying cash markets. In effect, the banks are involved in a Faustian compact with the markets, whereby their own pursuit of profit can simultaneously jeopardise their capital. Hedging risk through options trading provides an example of the double-edged nature of the game. Because option portfolios continually become un-hedged through price movements and the passage of time, constant trading is necessary to re-establish the hedge. This is a marketmaker's dream. Yet re-hedging requires traders to sell into falling markets, which is inherently destabilising - especially when combined with margin and collateral calls. A reduction in risk for the individual hedger increases the aggregate risk in the market. The leverage in instruments that do not strictly belong in the derivative category can also be huge, points out Stephen Thieke, co-head of corporate risk management at JP Morgan. Mortgage-backed securities are an obvious example. When interest rates rise, fixed-rate mortgage holders are slower to repay. The potential life of a mortgage-backed security is thus extended; and because investors receive their principal later, they lose the chance to reinvest at new, higher rates. The duration of the mortgage component of the Lehman Brothers Bond Index, covering some Dollars 1,200bn of outstanding mortgage paper, rose in March from 3.47 years to 4.35 years following Fed tightening. Morgan's analysts calculate that to offset this increase in the duration of the portfolio - which is important for institutions that have to match their investments to liabilities that fall due over time - investors would have had to sell the equivalent of about Dollars 140bn of 10-year Treasury bonds or nearly Dollars 250bn of five-year Treasuries. Some, says Thieke, would not have had to do so where, for example, they were tracking the mortgage-backed securities index. Even so, the astonishing magnitudes involved help explain why the US bond market has an inbuilt and growing tendency to overshoot. It is a tribute to those who have been playing these new, high-risk games that, in the bear garden that has prevailed since February, bankruptcies have been confined to marginal participants But the test is not over yet. The Fed will continue to raise rates; the banks will shed more of their Dollars 300bn-plus portfolio of public sector debt, as credit demand increases in a stronger economy; and US bond and income mutual funds could face withdrawals after years of positive cash flow. A further article next week will look in more detail at the risks to the system as these high rollers move through uncharted territory.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                          WALL STREET'S HIGH ROLLERS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                   National value                   of off-balance       Total                   sheet contracts,   assets on     Stockholders'                   inc derivatives  balance sheet      equity  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Bankers Trust          1,923             92             4.5 JP Morgan              1,731            134             9.9 Goldman Sachs          1,030            116             5.0 Salomon Brothers         999            185             4.6 Merrill Lynch            891            153             5.5 Morgan Stanley           629             97             4.5  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Annual Reports  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): The good and the not-so-well-managed - Pooled Funds THERE HAS been so much discussion about mammoth pension scheme surpluses built up over decades that it is sometimes easy to forget that for many thousands of small pension schemes that have been going for relatively few years, the outlook is not quite as cushioned. Small pension funds are usually invested in pooled or mixed funds run by life companies and fund management boutiques. Only when they are around Pounds 10m plus do they warrant segregated management where the fund's liabilities and objectives can be taken into account more precisely. Pooled pension funds recorded negative overall returns last year. The average pooled fund fell by 11.8 per cent in 1990, according to the annual survey of 63 funds conducted by Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps). Another survey, by consulting actuary Wyatt, puts the average loss at 12.6 per cent. Such figures are the worst since 1974 when the average fall was about 20 per cent. The figures even compare unfavourably with the performance of segregated funds, which lost an average of 10.5 per cent last year. Unfortunately, these poor results come at a time when all pension schemes face substantially increased costs as a result of the Barber ruling on equality. Final salary scheme costs will also be pushed up by the measures on limited price indexation introduced by the Social Security Act 1990. Experts estimate that these twin burdens will push up pension scheme liabilities by 30 per cent. Clearly, the importance of selecting a good fund management group has never been greater. Topping the 1990 pooled fund charts was National Mutual's fund, valued at Pounds 36m, which fell by 5.7 per cent. The top managers at National Mutual meet fortnightly to set asset allocations. Not surprisingly, the overall strategy was defensive - at one stage the fund held 14 per cent in cash and 7 per cent index-linked. Stock selection concentrated on blue chip companies, particularly in the UK, and the fund was underweight in smaller companies. But the single most significant factor in last year's outperformance was the office's decision to quit Japan in late 1988, though it is now moving back in cautiously. Other good results in 1990 came from Zurich Life (-5.8 per cent), Gartmore (-6.4 per cent), Crusader (-6.7 per cent) and Provident Life (-6.8 per cent). Wyatt also cites AES pooled unit trust, valued at Pounds 2.6m, which lost 6.3 per cent. In 1990 Guardian Royal Exchange's mixed fund, valued at Pounds 370.8m, trailed the field with a loss of 21.8 per cent. This was largely due to over-commitment to equities, particularly smaller companies. Two other, smaller funds also fell by over 20 per cent during 1990. AEtna's managed fund, valued at just Pounds 0.3m, tumbled by 28 per cent and Thornton's fund, worth Pounds 8.5m, dropped by 21.1 per cent. Other disappointing results for 1990 were turned in by Equitable, Fidelity, John Govett, Martin Currie, Midland Montagu, MIM and National Provident Institution. All plummeted by over 16 per cent. But it is not enough to look at the results for just one year. The manager who performed well in last year's tricky conditions may not necessarily be able to pick the most attractive stocks in a bull market. Over the past 10 years, the Caps survey shows that the highest annualised return was achieved by Confederation Life, up 18.1 per cent, followed by Scottish Widows with 17.3 per cent, Stenhouse exempt unit trust with 17.2 per cent and Provident Mutual with 16.8 per cent. At the other extreme, the lowest 10-year return came from Legal &amp; General, up by 13.5 per cent per annum, and Commercial Union, up by 13.9 per cent. Of course, basic annualised returns cannot reveal performance volatility. Certain investment houses are very erratic, and it is no consolation to know that the house can perform superbly in certain market conditions if you buy in just before a bad spell. The best way of judging an investment house's consistency is to look at its quartile rankings over the years, and to examine the fluctuations and success in loss limitation when conditions are tough. This also reveals the underlying trend. It may be, for instance, that a house's greatest gains were made in the first few years of the last decade and performance has since tailed off, or vice versa. Confederation Life, for instance, made it into the upper quartile for six of the last 10 years. But three of the years it failed to achieve the upper quartile were 1981-83. And its return for 1990 was relatively encouraging at  9.5 per cent, ranking it 14th of the 63 funds in the Caps survey. Stenhouse exempt unit trust and Provident Mutual also achieved upper quartile results for six of the past 10 years. This year's market leader, National Mutual, made it into the upper quartile five times since 1981. Mr Jeremy Bishop, National Mutual investment manager, says: 'A key part of our approach is to restrict risk. This means that over the long term, we should get more decisions right than wrong, but more importantly any decisions we get wrong won't penalise us unduly.' Many others have a more volatile record, so the aim should be to select a group with a house style that will work in any market. And as long as a pension fund is too small to warrant segregated management, it cannot be sensible to put it with a house that specialises in particular sectors - the typical specialisms are smaller companies and south-east Asia. The size of the fund should also be taken into consideration. Though two of the three worst performing funds in 1990 were relatively tiny, that is an exception rather than the rule. More often, new funds perform well in the early years because they are more flexible and nimble but this wanes as the fund attracts new money over the years and grows less wieldy. As one manager put it: 'A small fund may take risks and if it all goes well, it soon has a good track record. If it all goes wrong, there is an attitude that you can lose the fund quietly.' Although the 1990 pooled fund results are dire, they are not disastrous. Certainly, the median 10-year annualised return, at 15.3 per cent, is acceptable compared with the 6.4 per cent increase in price inflation and an 8.5 per cent increase in average earnings. But equally, now is the time to throw out the common misconception that investment management involves some kind of mystique. The reality is that a house's performance is more about overall management strength than it is about the whims and fancies of individual fund managers. This is particularly true in an uncertain climate, and so next year's winners are also likely to emerge from a rigorously managed stable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News Conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and </F> President Bill Clinton with unidentified foreign and domestic  correspondents at the White House -- live; President Clinton  speaks in English with simultaneous translation into Japanese]    [Text] [Clinton] Helen, may I say one thing before we  begin: I will call on American journalists first, and the prime  minister will call on Japanese journalists. This is not a  numerical target.    [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into  Japanese] I think the Japanese really thought last July that  they could reach an agreement. Among the industrialized seven  [G-7] nations, Japan has the most tightly closed market. Why?    [Clinton] First of all, the G-7 agreement or the framework  agreement we signed with Japan last summer, was good. Both  sides understood that they had to implement the agreement.  However, the people who signed the agreement last summer are  not here to fulfill their agreement. I do not mean to say that  they were lacking sincerity. However, we ourselves could not  reach an agreement on the basis of the previous agreement.    [Same correspondent] Why?    [Clinton] We could not agree on what kind of evidence we  could use to measure market liberalization, for example.    [Hosokawa] We understand that we have made some progress on  the issues of government procurement or insurance services.  Unfortunately, however, we could not clear the issue of  numerical targets. We deeply regret that we could not reach an  agreement on setting numeric targets. As the president said  earlier, both sides will readjust what we can readjust and try  to buckle down to the task to reach a better agreement.    [Correspondent] When do you think you will reach an  agreement on what you could not do this time?    [Hosokawa] I do not know. As soon as possible, I hope.  However, we may need time to cool off.    [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into  Japanese] Mr. President, let me ask you a question on the  Bosnian issue. There is a possibility that there will be  discord between you and President Yeltsin. He is saying that  NATO does not have the right to launch air raids on Bosnia.  But, you are saying that NATO does. Is there a way to fill the  gap?    [Clinton] We talked about it on the phone today. The  secretary general of the United Nations told President Yeltsin  that NATO is acting on the basis of the resolution the Security  Council adopted last summer. In other words, NATO has the  authority to stop the shelling of Sarajevo. I think NATO will  remove weapons from areas within a 20-kilometer radius from  Sarajevo. However, discussions are now underway. Anyhow, this  will bring about peace in the long run and we agreed, as a  short-term measure, to stop the act of killing civilians.    [correspondent] Now that the trade agreement has failed,  how optimistic is your administration about the possibility of a  future agreement?    [Clinton] I just do not know. As you know, the problem may  be a parlance matter or an emotional matter. But, Japan's  position is that it does not want to set numerical targets that  may lead to managed trade. I understand their position well.  We want some kind of objective standards to measure whether  Japan's market opening is progressing. Without such objective  criteria -- as in the past -- it is quite difficult to measure  progress. For that reason, we want to have qualitative or  quantitative targets. Supposing trade is very imbalanced in the  period from 1992 to 1995, we need to measure whether progress is  being made. We also need to see how foreign exchange and  Japan's economy have turned out, and whether U.S. companies have  made products which have competitive power in quality and price,  and attract the Japanese market. For that reason, we have  stressed that we want objective criteria or standards to measure  whether progress is being made in opening the market. But we  have failed to reach an agreement on that point.    [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into  Japanese] My question is about Bosnia. It has been reported  that the United States said it is willing to give up imposing  sanctions if the Serbians cooperate in talks on peace. Are you  planning to send U.S. peacekeeping operation [PKO] troops? What  will you do about it; and are F-15 fighters heading toward  Bosnia?    [Clinton] In terms of troops, we will send less than half,  although we have not specified the number. Second, we have  never discussed any partial lifting of the embargo. As far as I  am concerned, I have never discussed such a possibility.    [Correspondent] Although the previous governments agreed to  launch negotiations on objective criteria, do you think the  preceding government made the wrong decision, or does it mean  that the Hosokawa government will cope with this issue in its  own, new way?    [Hosokawa] Well, we believe that certain progress has been  made on each issue we have negotiated so far. Therefore, I  think that it does not mean we will start from scratch, and we  need to further promote negotiations with the results of past  negotiations in mind. Does this answer your question? No?    [Correspondent] The Miyazawa government decided and agreed  to start negotiations on objective criteria. What I want to ask  you is whether you think the Miyazawa government's decision was  wrong.    [Hosokawa] No, I do not think so. Our understanding over  the issue of numerical targets was different. We could not  clear up the matter.    [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into  Japanese] Mr. President, what sort of measures do you think  the United States can take to keep a watch on Japan's attitude  or manner, and are you thinking of changing the United States'  position in order to make it difficult for Japanese companies to  continue business activities in the United States?    [Clinton] Until 0400 this morning, we made efforts to come  to an agreement. So, I am not prepared to say. We need to give  further study to what you have said. I think now is the time to  think about many things.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, citizens of Japan strongly  support the Hosokawa government's policy on deregulation or  non-interference by the government. When that is the given  background, if the United States presses Japan to set import  volumes in advance -- which is tantamount to asking the  government to interfere -- do you think the citizens of Japan  will accept this?    [Clinton] We are not asking for that. I think that is the  bottleneck which is making an agreement impossible. We are not  asking Japan to make a commitment to import certain volumes by  certain dates. What we want to do is measure progress on market  opening, using objective criteria. One thing that could be used  as a criteria is the level of imports, another could be exchange  rates, another could be Japan's domestic demand, and how many  U.S. products are being used in the United States, Europe, or  other countries could be used as criteria as well.    What efforts U.S. businesses are making to do business in  Japan or in the Japanese market could also be used as criteria.  We are not asking Japan to practice managed trade. I think  what Japan is concerned about is that if there are numbers among  other criteria, the numbers will take on a life of their own.  That is not what the United States intends, even though, no  doubt, that has become the bottleneck on arriving at an  agreement.    [Correspondent] You two are said to have also talked about  the situation on the Korean peninsula. Around the end of this  month, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] will have  to confirm or deny whether North Korea is developing nuclear  arms. How serious is the situation? What will you and Prime  Minister Hosokawa do if it is determined that North Korea is not  observing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty?    [Clinton] On that question, we discussed various options  including sanctions. Japan, China, South Korea, and the United  States agree that the Korean peninsula should be free of nuclear  arms. The fact that North Korea is unwilling to accept the IAEA  inspections is a cause of very much concern to us. We will see  what options we have. But I think it is clear that the  sanctions are among them.    [Hosokawa] We are also strongly concerned over the issue.  The issue will face a big hurdle soon or within the next 10  days. I hope that North Korea will move in a desirable  direction. As the President just said, Japan wants to work  together with the United States, South Korea, and China in  working on that country more strongly. If a possible economic  blockade or sanctions are discussed at the UN Security Council,  Japan will do as much as it can within the limits of its  constitution.    [Correspondent] I have a question for both of you. To look  back on the negotiations between the two countries, I feel  mutual mistrust has grown between them -- the United States  thinking it has been deceived, and Japan thinking the objective  criteria will be used in sanctions. Do you think such mistrust  will be removed in the course of future negotiations?    [Clinton] I personally trust Prime Minister Hosokawa, and  respect him very much. In fact, my respect has only kept on  growing. I have particular respect for efforts put into  political reforms, the leadership displayed by Japan in the  Uruguay Round of talks, and the leadership shown by Prime  Minister Hosokawa in opening up the rice market. I must note  efforts made in deregulation and tax reductions. I feel Japan  is moving in the right direction.    Both of us came to our posts as top leaders of the two  nations when frustration and irritation was rising after years  and years of trade negotiations. This issue of trust is  certainly important, and is a serious problem that cannot be  overlooked. But this issue of trust can be resolved.    The reason why the trust is being threatened is because the  trade imbalance remains large while the prices of consumer goods  in Japan are high, and because this fact is having a negative  effect on American citizens. Aside from that, my personal  respect for the prime minister and the government is great  indeed.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have discussed many  things with President Clinton. The United States is saying that  even though it wants numerical targets or objective criteria, it  does not want managed trade. Can you believe this?    [Hosokawa] Nobody wants managed trade. This can be said --  commonly -- of all countries. As the President mentioned, we  are afraid lest the numerical targets should take on a life of  their own. If that happens, as it did with the Semiconductor  Agreement, that is in fact the practicing of managed trade. I  told him in today's summit meeting that establishing numerical  targets runs counter to the basic stance of my cabinet, which  promotes deregulation.    [Clinton] If we were asking for the semiconductor  agreement, that would be right. But that is not what we are  asking for. What we are asking for is what we agreed to last  summer, which was a way of measuring by objective standards the  progress being made in opening markets. I want to say we are  not seeking anything for the United States, that we are not  seeking for other countries as well. We sought no special  access or special treatment. We just seek a list, if you will,  of those things by which you could determine whether progress is  being made or progress is not being made, that there are reasons  other than closed market policies for the lack of progress.  There could be other reasons -- no domestic demand, changes in  exchange rates, inadequate efforts by Americans, uncompetitive  products and services.    [Correspondent] I think that opening the Japanese market is  very important. I think Japanese consumers and Japanese people  believe that. But I think the reason you could not come up with  any agreement today in the talks is that the numerical target  approach is not really popular among Japanese people, Japanese  industries, and Japanese bureaucrats. So, I am wondering, Mr.  President, whether you thought it was possible to come up with  any agreement, result, or outcome in near future with the  numerical target approach. I also wonder whether you were  disappointed with the Japanese people. I heard that Mr. Gore  raised a question about Japanese bureaucrats in talks with Mr.  Hata. I wonder whether, Mr. President, you think the Japanese  bureaucracy is a kind of burden or barrier in opening the  Japanese market.    [Clinton] I wish you had never asked that. I understand  that numerical targets are not popular among Japanese people and  the Japanese Government. But Americas trade deficit with Japan  is not popular among the American people and the American  Government -- it is hard to explain it, year in and year out, it  is always getting bigger. I think, in every society, the  permanent government is more unchangeable than the changing  government. I think that is true in every society and, in some  societies, it is more true than in others. And the stronger the  permanent civil service is in making policy, the more likely  they are to become unchangeable. If you look at the history of  Japan after the Second World War, having one system for the last  forty-five plus years in which you produced for your own market  and the world, had high savings rates and low consumption rates,  as well as relatively closed markets and relatively high-value  products, worked dramatically to improve the living standard of  your people. But, at some point, as your growth rates became  more normal as in the last 10 years, and as the capacity and  desires of your people alter, now you have to develop a more  open economy and society. I could not say any more than the  prime minister did in the book that he wrote and gave to me to  read. So, I do not want to pick on any particular section of the  Japanese society. I want to just say that we must process the  change, and we are both committed to it. That is the good news.  I also think it is good news that we did not come up with an  agreement today that did not mean anything. We just have to  keep dealing with the issue and trying to find some way out of  it, because we have to come to trust each other across systems  that are still very different. Thank you very much.</p>

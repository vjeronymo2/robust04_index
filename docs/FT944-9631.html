			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / People: Bebb leaves Senior board David Bebb is resigning from the board of Senior Engineering and leaving the tubular products, ducting and thermal engineering company after 32 years. The announcement comes less than a month after Senior issued a profits warning because of cost over-runs on a significant UK contract, and a shortfall in orders, in its thermal engineering division which Bebb ran for four years until this summer. Then Kevin Gamble, who runs Senior's construction services division, assumed the additional responsibility for thermal engineering, and Bebb, an Australian, was put in charge of developing Senior's Asia Pacific interests.</p>

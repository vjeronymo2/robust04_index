			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Siemens sets up unit to manage pension funds SIEMENS, the Munich-based electronics group, is to become the first German company to set up a separate internal investment management subsidiary, hiving off the management of funds provided to meet its pension liabilities. At the same time, it plans to raise from DM3bn to DM6bn (Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 3.7bn) the amount invested through so-called special funds, dedicated investment funds used by German companies among other things to finance their pension obligations. About half of the DM3bn invested at present is managed by Deutsche Bank. The decision to increase the amount invested through special funds, and to consolidate the management through a new entity, signals a further step in the development of pension fund investment in Germany. The company, whose enormous cash resources are such that it is often labelled a bank with an electronics business attached, intends to transfer DM5bn to DM6bn to the new subsidiary within the next six months. Total cash resources are in the region of DM20bn. Under German rules, there is no obligation for pensions monies to be kept legally separate from the companies' own cash resources, as in the UK and US. Mr Herbert Lohnreiss, one of the new company's two managing directors, said Siemens had decided that over the longer term it would be better to manage this element of its cash resources in house. He said the decision did not reflect dissatisfaction with the performance of the funds under management by third parties, or even a wish to save management fees. The funds will be invested for the long term in bonds and equities. The new subsidiary, to be known as Siemens Kapitalanlagegesellschaft (SKAG), will employ about 12 people. The move, which has already been authorised by Germany's banking authorities, may establish a precedent for other German companies with large cash resources. The move has interesting historical resonances as it was a member of the von Siemens family, founders of the electronics group, who set up the Deutsche Bank 123 years ago. The bank subsequently grew to be Germany's biggest bank. Siemens' financial strength means it is less reliant on traditional banking relationships than other German companies.</p>

			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Observer: A friend in need Poor old David Dinkins. It is a sure sign that the hapless mayor of New York is in deep trouble when he has to ask a Rockefeller for help. The black mayor, who seems to stumble from one calamity to another, needed a new deputy, so he called in David Rockefeller, one of the banking world's most prominent power brokers. Rockefeller, whose stable of proteges is rarely bare, didn't take long to find the right man - Barry Sullivan, who stepped down from the chairmanship of First Chicago in December. Sullivan used to work for Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan before moving up to Chicago. Although he may be a reassuring name to New York City's nervous bankers, his record at First Chicago seems, in retrospect, as mixed as Rockefeller's own career at Chase.</p>

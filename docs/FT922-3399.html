			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Clarke signals further review of police service MR KENNETH CLARKE, home secretary, yesterday sketched out the framework of a further examination of the police service only three weeks after announcing a review of police career structures and pay issues. The new study will cover a number of funding and structural issues. Mr Clarke told the Association of Chief Police Officers conference in Eastbourne, East Sussex, that the review - to be completed by next May  - would go 'beyond narrow adjustments to existing structure and pay arrangements' and examine officers' responsibilities, careers and performance. But, added Mr Clarke, 'funding and wider structural issues' must also be addressed. He was studying those and was likely to produce proposals in due course. Mr Clarke said after his speech that he had wanted to signal that matters of funding and structure were on the agenda. The forthcoming review of local government may affect the structure of police authorities, whose boundaries often coincide with those of counties. On funding, chief constables would like to be released from what they regard as unduly rigid government control. Mr Clarke told the conference that he attached great importance to changes taking place in police management structure. Stripping out intermediate levels of command and focusing on single, local management structures would provide strong and visible leadership. He said: 'I want to see well defined autonomy for local police chiefs and proper support arrangements, including delegated budgets. This means shorter chains of command in the service and a fresh look at many traditional posts. It means new working arrangements for constables, sergeants and supervisory ranks.' However, Mr Clarke said, improving service quality alone would not increase public confidence in the police and criminal justice system, which had been damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice. There must never be cover-ups and the police must accept valid criticism. He warned that 'to a public which feels beset by and often fearful of prevailing levels of crime', discretion was a vital ingredient in police work. 'As many in the service learned years ago, discretion and tact rather than a heavy-handed approach can work wonders on public confidence,' he said.</p>

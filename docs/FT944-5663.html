			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (3): British Gas salaries defence a bit rich Sir, I find it fascinating that Mr Giordano sees it as important carefully to construct a long letter to defend his chief executive's increase in salary to the financial community. What a shame that no member of British Gas's board saw it as equally important to appear on the BBC's Watchdog to explain to its ordinary customers why it is also planning to penalise those who pay it on time but not in the manner that British Gas dictates. But then, as Mr Giordano refutes that British Gas is an arrogant out-of-touch privatised monopoly with overpaid executives, he will no doubt be able to advise me where I can buy my gas elsewhere.

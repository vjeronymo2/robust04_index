			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: South Bank 'Meltdown' AMONG THE composers who have established themselves in British music in the last two decades none has been so widely praised as George Benjamin. Ever since his orchestral Ringed by the Flat Horizon was performed while he was a still student in 1980 Benjamin, born in 1960, has been consistently hailed as the greatest natural talent to emerge in British music since Britten; both his composition teachers, Olivier Messiaen and Alexander Goehr, had been fulsome in their recognition of his gifts. The works that have followed over the last decade have amply confirmed that promise, even though there have been rather fewer of them than many admirers would have liked. Meanwhile Benjamin has found himself drawn ever farther into the performing side of new music. He was a pianist (and a thrilling, explosive one) before ever he became a composer and has continued to relish the occasional opportunity to perform; conducting (his own music first and then other people's) has been a natural extension. And latterly he has become a festival animateur; 'Meltdown' the South Bank's celebration of contemporary music which gets underway in the Queen Elizabeth Hall tomorrow has been planned and programmed by Benjamin, who will also make appearances as both conductor and pianist. He has taken charge of similar festivals before, in Paris and Los Angeles, mixing a few of his own works with music by composers with whom he feels a special affinity. The South Bank initiative (the prototype of what is planned as an annual event) spreads its net wider, bringing in dance events and film. There will be a ballet danced to Boulez's Le Marteau sans matre; the NFT is presenting a season of Japanese films with soundtrack scores by Toru Takemitsu; three Chaplin shorts will be shown with scores written for them by Benedict Mason, while Benjamin himself will improvise a piano accompaniment to a Japanese silent film. Benjamin promotes and explains it all with huge, natural enthusiasm, even though he turns out to be a slightly reluctant impresario, caught between his instinctive desire to be left alone to compose, and the necessity as he sees it to do what he can to make new music available and accessible to the widest possible audience. His 'Meltdown' programmes look to have got the balance between just about right, mixing late 20th-century masterpieces by Boulez and Ligeti with works by younger composers that appeal to Benjamin, such as the Frenchman Tristan Murail and the quirky French-Canadian Denys Bouliane, whose music would rarely have been heard in Britain but for Benjmain's continued advocacy. For London there is the bonus of a brand new Benjamin work - Sudden Time, which the composer will conduct with the London Philharmonic on Wednesday, alongside pieces by Goehr and Messiaen. It promises to be Benjamin's most substantial score since the wonderfully imaginative and lucid Antara he wrote for IRCAM in Paris six years ago. The premiere seems almost as much a pleasant surprise to Benjamin as it is to all his admirers. When the festival was first planned, he did not envisage having anything new ready in time. But a short piece written to a commission from Jerusalem last autumn provided the key to a new way of working, and the orchestral score rapidly began to fall into place. Characteristically, it is not entirely new; it begins with the substance of a short orchestral piece Cascade that Benjamin wrote for the LPO a couple of years ago, but the seamless continuation into a 15-minute study for a very large orchestra is absolutely fresh. The idea of a 'work-in-progress', a torso to which a composer returns to expand and refine an initial idea is characteristic of music in the late 20th-century; Pierre Boulez in particular has turned that whole approach into an art form in itself. Benjamin may reject the serial aesthetic that led Boulez into such a creative impasse, but there is no doubt that he shares the post-war avant garde's concern with organisation and precision. His approach may be different but he celebrates the right of music to be challenging, rigorous, intellectually satisfying. In part that accounts for the elaborate care with which he composes, but Benjamin freely admits that he has had to reassess his approach since Ringed by the Flat Horizon, realising in the mid 1980s that his music was becoming too exclusively grounded in its harmonic thinking and needed a linear element to take his work forward. Harmony had always been intrinsic to his music thinking and the struggle to redefine his parameters was a protracted process, accounting in part for the low productivity of the 1980s. Now in Sudden Time Benjamin feels he may have lit upon a new path; he is cautious of being too bullish about it, but nevertheless suggest that he may have found a technique to sustain his music into the future. The optimism is natural, hard to gainsay; Benjamin's belief in the continued health of contemporary music is unbreakable, and events like 'Meltdown' give him just the right platform to present that faith in the most attractive package.</p>

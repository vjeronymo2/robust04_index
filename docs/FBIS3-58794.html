"Arms must not be silent when they are escorting essential  goods to people who are dying of hunger, medicine for people who  are ill or wounded, or concrete support for the poor," the  pontiff said in an address during a day of prayer for Bosnia in  which he invited all Christians to take part.    The pope expressed pain at "so much cruelty" in the former  Yugoslav republic and issued an "urgent appeal" for road access  to be given to convoys bringing relief to "those who are dying  of hunger" in Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar.    "We suffer at the sight of so much cruelty, the repeated and  very serious violations of human rights, the destruction of  priceless monuments to civilisation. The acts of violence  against women, children, elderly and defenceless people affect  us deeply," he said.    And he told the Bosnian people: "You are not abandoned. We  are with you and we will be with you, we will always be with  you."    Meanwhile in Sarajevo, Bosnia's leading Moslem cleric  Mustafa  Efendi Ceric called on the Islamic authorities of Iran, Turkey  and Egypt to end the suffering of the Bosnian people "whom all  the others have betrayed and abandoned."    In a letter written after the death of six Sarajevo children  killed by a shell as they played in the snow, Ceric said he  could no longer call "either on (UN chief) Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  or on the European or world community, which remain deaf to the  cries of our women and children."    Ceric, whose letter was broadcast by Sarajevo radio, accused  the international community of "looking on with indifference as  the aggressor kills innocent children because the victims are  Bosnian Moslems whom they themselves have deprived of the right  of self-defence."    The latter comment was a reference to the international arms  embargo against the republics of former Yugoslavia which  Bosnians regard as preventing them from defending themselves  against the superior weaponry of separatist Serbs who are armed  by Belgrade.    The radio said the letter was sent to Iran's spiritual  leader  Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, to the chief ulema of Turkey and to  the imam of Al Azhar in Egypt.    Bosnian vice-president Ejup Ganic meanwhile called on U.S.  President Bill Clinton to honour his pledge not to tolerate the  strangling of Sarajevo "which has gone on for 22 months now."    He said he hoped the United States "will not allow countries  which tolerate genocide and reward aggression to dictate the  policy of the international community on Bosnia-Herzegovina."    After the killing of the six children on Saturday Bosnian  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called in a letter to  Butrus-Ghali for airstrikes to break the stranglehold imposed by  Bosnian Serb forces on the Bosnian capital.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Test case due on lost pension rights: Union says 500,000 employees could be affected The GMB general union plans to mount a legal challenge in the High Court in an attempt to win pension rights for thousands of workers whose public-sector jobs have been privatised. The test case has been lodged on behalf of five school catering workers in Preston, Lancashire, who in June transferred their employment from Lancashire County Council to BET Catering Services, a BET subsidiary. The case has been filed under Tupe - the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) - legislation, which protects the terms and conditions of public-sector employees whose contracts are transferred to the private sector. Tupe implements in British law the European acquired rights directive. The five, all women, lost their entitlement to the local government superannuation scheme when they transferred to their new employer. The union is arguing that they should maintain their previous pension rights or be provided with an equivalent pension. Mr Mick Graham, the union's national secretary for local government, estimated that the pension rights of as many as 500,000 employees could be affected if the union won a ruling that was allowed to be applied retrospectively. He said: 'Under the law your pension is part of your pay. It is outrageous that someone's pension can be removed through no fault of their own.' One of the women, Ms Barbara Adams from Ribbleton Hall High School near Preston, said: 'It seems unfair that I can't get a pension even though I'm doing the same job as before.' Two previous attempts to bring the transfer of pension rights within the directive both foundered when they were pursued at industrial tribunals. The GMB has opted to take a different tack by going to the High Court. The union pointed out that the government was itself urging companies seeking to tender for newly privatised public-sector contracts to provide equivalent pension rights. The Department of Employment said: 'The government's view and recommendation is that when transfer of undertaking rules apply the new employers should undertake to offer a similar or equivalent pension to the newly transferring employees. This is not an obligation but a recommendation.' BET said last night that it was unable to comment since it had not received notice of legal action.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> AIR SMOKING BAN MAY BE EXTENDED  </P> <P> Two lawmakers proposed legislation today to make permanent the ban on smoking  on airline flights of two hours or less.  </P> <P> The law will expire in 1990 unless Congress votes to extend it or make the ban  permanent, as Reps. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Bill Young (R-Fla.) have  proposed. They were the original sponsors of the measure first passed in 1987.  "The American flying public not only has accepted this smoking ban, they  welcomed it," the two said in a statement. "Experience shows the law has worked  extraordinarily well."  </P></p>

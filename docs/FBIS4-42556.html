			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cyprus Government believes that, after the  Butrus-Ghali report, the neutralization of the Turkish side's  lack of political will is feasible if negotiations with the  European Union [EU] for Cyprus' accession are immediately  opened. In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation], Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that,  once a decision is made to begin the negotiations, the Turkish  side will find itself facing a dilemma.    Referring to the visit he will begin in Moscow tomorrow, Mr.  Mikhailidhis described it as important, because it will take  place immediately after the Butrus-Ghali report, which includes  some of the suggestions submitted by the Russians. Responding  to a question, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that the time has come for  Russian intervention in the process to promote a Cyprus  solution. He also noted that Russia plays an important role and  added that at his talks in Moscow they will examine the options  proposed by the UN Secretary General in his report and will also  discuss the Russian proposals toward promoting a Cyprus solution.    The foreign minister further said that the consultations,  which the Secretary General proposes in his report on  alternative ways to promote the Cyprus issue, should be based on  the finding of the lack of political will on the Turkish side.    Referring to his meetings with the ambassadors of the five  permanent members of the Security Council, Mr. Mikhailidhis said  that some people continue to believe that there are  possibilities in the confidence-building measures. Mr.  Mikhailidhis added that he stressed to the ambassadors that it  would be a tactical error to ignore the findings in the  Butrus-Ghali report, which he described as a landmark.</p>

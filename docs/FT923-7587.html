			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Mortgage debt traps one million households one in every 10 homeowners with a mortgage - may be trapped with homes worth less than the value of their loans, according to the Bank of England. The total value of this 'negative equity' amounts to about Pounds 6bn, an average of Pounds 6,000 per household affected, the Bank estimates in its next Quarterly Bulletin to be published tomorrow. This assessment of the depth of Britain's housing market crisis provided further evidence of the obstacles to a consumer-led recovery as the Confederation of British Industry announced a sharp year on year fall in retail sales in July. This was the second successive monthly fall. Retailers said sales for the time of year were more depressed in July than at any time since the CBI distributive trades survey began in 1983. Sales linked to the housing market were among the worst hit sectors. 'Furniture and carpet retailers are among those reporting the sharpest annual declines,' said Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI economics director. The Bank of England report suggests that households will have to maintain high savings ratios for some years to rebuild their balance sheets. If house prices were to rise by 1 per cent per quarter, the value of negative equity would fall to around Pounds 2 1/2 bn by the end of 1993, although 600,000 households would still face a shortfall. If they fall by a further 1 per cent a quarter, the value of negative equity would rise to Pounds 10 1/2 bn by the end of 1993, affecting more than 1.6m households. A recent research paper by Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank, forecast that house prices would fall by an average 2.5 per cent next year, and by 4.5 per cent in the south-east. The two reports together painted a 'devastatingly bleak' picture for the economy, said Mr Roger Bootle, economist at Midland Montagu, the investment bank. 'There is a direct conflict between the government's policy for near-zero inflation and the prospects for relief for hard-pressed home-owners,' he said. 'If the impotence of the housing market remains, consumer spending is going to be weak not for one or two quarters but for many years to come,' Mr Bootle said. Analysts expect official figures for retail sales volumes for July, released on Wednesday, to be flat compared with June and down 0.1 per cent year on year. Shadow Chancellor Mr Gordon Brown called for Mr John Major, the prime minister to meet mortgage lenders to consider new measures to lift the depressed housing market. He told the Fife Regional Labour Party the Tory Party was in 'disarray over its mishandling of the economy'. Britain should use its EC Presidency to urge 'co-ordinated action to expand the economies of Europe and get interest rates down,' he said. Nominal house prices in the south-east have fallen by 25 per cent from a peak in the last quarter of 1988. The Bank estimates that 876,000 households were caught in the negative equity trap by falling house prices - 523,000 are in the south-east. But at least a further 100,000 households are in the debt trap because their mortage payments have fallen into arrears, or they have undertaken another loan secured against their property. Retail fall hits recovery, Page 4 A way out of recession, Page 11 THE Bank of England expressed surprise that UK companies chose to raise their aggregate dividend payments by 7 per cent last year and again in the first quarter of this year, against a background of restrained profitability and cost-cutting.

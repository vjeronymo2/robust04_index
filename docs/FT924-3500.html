			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Shots in war for Clinton's ear THE FIGHT for the soul of President-elect Bill Clinton has begun. Yesterday the market-oriented Progressive Policy Institute, one of the Washington think-tanks closest to him, published 'Mandate for Change', a 380-page tome billed, immodestly, as a 'new governing philosophy for a new era in American politics'. In trying to set a governing agenda for the Clinton administration, the institute is following a trail blazed by conservative think-tanks, such as the Heritage Foundation, which heavily influenced the policies of Republican administrations in the 1980s. 'Mandate for Change' sets out detailed policy proposals on everything from economics and health care to crime and foreign policy and tries to define a new brand of 'progressive politics' that transcends the old philosophies of both Democrats and Republicans. On many issues, however, it appears to lean heavily toward the kind of policies advocated by conservatives in the 1980s. It favours tough controls on government current expenditure (as opposed to investment) and urges Mr Clinton to revitalise the economy by relying more heavily on free markets. It advocates reforms, stressing choice and competition in both healthcare and education, and proposes the phasing out of conventional forms of welfare. The institute is an offshoot of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), a reformist group of moderate Democrats chaired by Mr Clinton from 1990 until his bid for the presidency last year. It has already established strong ties with the incoming administration. Mr Al From, DLC president, and Mr Bruce Reed, one of his deputies, are among Mr Clinton's top transition advisers. Mr Robert Shapiro, the institute's chief economist, seems likely to get a top economic post, probably at the Office of Management and Budget. The cover of 'Mandate for Change', moreover, carries a warm endorsement from Mr Clinton. Mr From and Mr Will Marshall, the institute's president, argue that the Clinton administration should base its policies on five core principles: Opportunity: The old Democrat emphasis on redistribution must be dropped in favour of free market policies that stimulate growth and opportunity. Reciprocal responsibility: Right-wing social neglect and left-wing belief in 'entitlements' are both misguided. They should be replaced by contracts which emphasise reciprocal responsibilities: the emblematic example is a voluntary 'national service' scheme under which college students would get subsidies if they agreed to serve the community, as, for example, police officers or nurses. Community: In social policy more emphasis should be placed on the 'third sector' of voluntary organisations and on 'empowering' families and individuals to solve their own problems. Democracy: In the aftermath of the cold war, the promotion of democracy and free markets should be the new unifying theme in US foreign policy. This offers the best hope of stabilising an uncertain world and in settling disputes nonviolently. Entrepreneurial government: The old model of centralised government in which monopolies offer standardised services no longer works. A revamping of the public sector involving the wholesale introduction of choice, competition and market incentives must form a central part of the Clinton programme. 'Mandate for Change' also sets out a detailed programme for rebuilding the US economy dubbed 'enterprise economics'. This seeks to go beyond the 1980s stalemate in which conservatives tended to call for more tax cuts and liberals for increased government spending and regulation. The institute argues that increased government spending is required in one area only: the 'common economic resources that can enable all workers and firms to be more productive'. It thus advocates increased federal support for education and training, research and development, national infrastructure and new business formation. The main innovation on training is the proposed issue of career opportunity cards, a kind of voucher that would give workers flexibility in purchasing education and training relevant to their advancement. In most respects the economic policies proposed are free market in tone. The one equivocal note is in trade policy, where the institute advocates a 'new commercial diplomacy' to expand trade opportunities aggressively that some may interpret as covert protection.</p>

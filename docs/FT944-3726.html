			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Bruno on a roll at Credit For Egidio Giuseppe Bruno, managing director of Credito Italiano (Credit), it must seem a long time since November 1993, writes Andrew Hill. That was when he led a road show to London to promote the privatisation of the Milan-based bank; it is even longer since the 1950s when he first joined what was then a staid, state-controlled institution. In the last year, IRI, the Italian state holding company, has successfully sold its 67 per cent stake in Credit, Bruno has added the titles of deputy chairman and chief executive and he now finds himself in the front line of a battle for control of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna bank. The staid state bank has become a hungry private company. There is no doubting Bruno's knowledge of the peculiarities of the Italian banking system. He is on the executive committee of the Italian banking association and is a director of Mediobanca, the secretive and influential Milan merchant bank. But for more than a decade he has also been prominent in international banking circles, one reason (apart from his fluent English and excellent French) why he is always a key member of international road shows promoting the Italian financial markets. In the 1980s, Bruno managed Credit's London branch - established in 1911 as the first London offshoot of an Italian bank - and was chairman of the Association of European Banks and the Association of Foreign Banks operating in the City. Returning to Milan eight years ago, he quickly accumulated responsibility for the Americas and Asia, for international business, and eventually for the management of the whole Credito Italiano network in Italy and abroad. If anybody can convince Rolo's shareholders of the advantages which a deal with Credit would provide at home and abroad, it is probably Bruno.</p>

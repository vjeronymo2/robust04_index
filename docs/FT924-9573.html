			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Change of course in the economic mainstream: The new administration's policies are unlikely to represent a return to earlier Democratic creeds For two long decades, conservative political and economic philosophies have been in the ascendant. Following the electoral triumphs of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the industrialised world seemed to change gear, increasingly accepting the rationality of free markets, limited government and less generous welfare policies. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s and the conversion of much of the third world to market economics supposedly completed this historic transformation. Does Bill Clinton's stunning victory change anything? Is this the end of the conservative revolution? It is tempting to say yes. Mr Clinton has criss-crossed America, attacking 'trickle down' economics and the greed of the 1980s. He has dismissed tax cuts that favour the rich as unjust and ineffectual. He has not been afraid to proclaim his faith in government's ability to solve economic and social problems. At the very least, the US will thus undergo a 'course correction'. Although the true character of a Clinton administration cannot be judged until the main White House and Cabinet appointments are announced, we are most unlikely to witness a reversion to an earlier Democratic era. After the second world war, conservatives were able to govern only after they had come to terms with the social and economic upheavals of the 1930s: they did not attempt to repeal the New Deal or the welfare state. In the same vein, Mr Clinton's victory represents an accommodation by the left to the conservative revolution of the past two decades. Mr Clinton may slightly increase taxes on the rich but he will not return to the sky-high marginal rates of the pre-Reagan years. Mr Clinton is basking in an historic victory largely because he convinced Americans that he is indeed a 'New Demo crat'. Like many conservatives, he stresses the importance of economic opportunity and personal responsibility; he has also pledged to 'reinvent' government, making it less bureaucratic and more entrepreneurial. American pragmatism has also played a role in Mr Clinton's victory. Many who voted Democrat on Tuesday favour lower taxes and less govern ment: Mr Clinton's victory is less a rejection of the values of the 1980s than of Republican economic performance. By the standards of many countries, such as Britain, the US may appear to have had a mild recession. It has been growing sluggishly for 18 months. Yet the Bush years as a whole were a period of economic stagnation. Per capita disposable incomes did not rise. Unemployment went up. Debt burdens - public and pri vate - seemed intolerable. For Americans this was totally unacceptable; memories of rapid growth under President Reagan were obliterated. Worse, Americans began to doubt their longer-term economic future. Historians speculated about a US version of the celebrated 'British disease'. Economists pointed out that productivity growth had been sluggish since 1973 and that much of the population had experienced static or falling wages for two decades. This, some warned, might be the first generation of Americans to face lower living standards than their parents. Matters came to a head last December when Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a pillar of the establishment, told Congress: "There is a deep-seated concern out there that I must say to you I haven't seen in my lifetime.' How is Mr Clinton planning to overcome this entrenched mood of pessimism? All the signs suggest he will follow fairly conventional macroeconomic policies. He seems unlikely to interfere with the conduct of monetary policy. During the campaign he declined an invitation to blame the recession on the Fed, which he believes should remain independent of the executive arm of government. On fiscal policy, there is an inherent conflict between his desire to invest more heavily in education, training and infrastructure and his promise to 'cut the deficit in half' by 1996. Few analysts believe his hopes of raising large sums from rich individuals and foreign corporations are realistic. However, it would be wrong to assume that the deficit is bound to rise now that Democrats control both the White House and Congress. Mr Clinton is likely to look for ways of restructuring both sides of the federal balance sheet. The rate of growth of spending could be substantially reduced if he has the courage to curb the benefits that wealthy Americans receive from entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions. He may also opt for a bold reform of taxes: a shift towards consumption-based taxes could raise revenues while increasing incentives for savings and investment. Some form of investment tax credit seems certain to form a central plank of next year's budget. Mr Clinton's cure for the American economy, however, is likely to look beyond short-run macroeconomics. His talk of investment in 'people-based economics' is not just a rhetorical flourish. In a world of intense global competition, he believes that governments can best promote higher living standards by focusing on the factors of production that are relatively fixed, such as the workforce and infrastructure. Additional investment in education, training and infrastructure is thus an integral part of a long-term strategy to improve the competitiveness of the private sector. For Mr Clinton economic and social policies are interwoven. He is the first president-elect in recent his tory to argue that the US is doing poorly because government is failing to provide services that other leading nations take for granted. He points out that every other industrial nation spends much less than the US on healthcare yet manages to offer universal coverage. He contrasts the US's patchy training programmes with Ger many's famed apprenticeship system and argues that more has to be done for the non-college-bound majority. And he compares simplistic laissez-faire economics unfavourably with the more active industrial policies of Japan and continental Europe. The stress on social policies and workforce skills or 'human capital' should not be seen as of secondary economic importance. This, rather than monetary or fiscal policy, is the heart of 'Clintonomics.' He genuinely believes that the US will prosper in the 21st century only if it makes fundamental reforms in these often neglected areas. When President-elect Clinton claims to be seeking a new "third way' that respects market forces yet also places emphasis on social solidarity, he should be taken at face value. He is not a throwback to the past but part of an unfold ing revolution that is more liberal - in the 19th-century sense - than dirigiste in its fundamental values. Americans have voted for a technocrat rather than an ideologue; what remains uncertain is his ability to translate academic theories into practical programmes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 13 (AFP) -- The foreign ministers of  Russia, the United States and five western European countries  ended a meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina Friday with a call for a  ceasefire, and negotiations between the warring parties in two  weeks, a French diplomatic source reported. He said the  ministers had called for the ceasefire to be "unconditional." A  communique due to be published later in the evening would  reiterate the ministers' support for a European Union proposal  to divide the former Yugoslav republic on the basis of 51  percent for Moslems and Croats and 49 percent for Serbs, the  source said.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: BASEBALL, MONEY SOON PART  </P> <P> About all these baseball deals, I was just wondering:  </P> <P>  -- Why don't the San Francisco Giants take some of that money and put it into  a park?  </P> <P>  -- Were I a baseball fan in Toronto, the trading of Fred McGriff, Tony  Fernandez and Junior Felix for Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar and Devon White would  immediately convert me into a hockey fan.  </P> <P>  -- Can't those New York teams keep anybody?  </P> <P>  -- Any Dodger game pitched by Kevin (Sandpaper) Gross and Jay (Pine Tar)  Howell probably will be played under protest.  </P> <P>  -- Attention, parents: Bud Black makes $10 million and you want your child to  do his homework?  </P> <P>  -- If they have another exploding scoreboard at the new Comiskey Park, Cory  Snyder is going to make that baby go bang-zoom about 20 or 30 times.  </P> <P>  -- Shouldn't the commissioner set a quota on how many Japanese players the  Detroit Tigers can have?  </P> <P>  -- Attention, you parents again: Zane Smith will make $3 million a year and  you're letting your child use his right hand?  </P> <P>  -- I want to see if I have this straight: Dave Righetti left the New York  Yankees after George Steinbrenner lost control of the club?  </P> <P>  -- Oh, never mind. The important thing is that Steve Farr is a Yankee now and  it's like 1927 all over again.  </P> <P>  -- Well, here it is Friday and the San Diego Padres haven't traded any  All-Stars for several hours.  </P> <P>  -- To the New York Met executive who said he preferred having Vince Coleman to  Darryl Strawberry anyway, I have only 10 words to say: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho,  ho, ho! Good one!  </P> <P>  -- Hey, we'll take Kevin McReynolds off your hands, too, pal. Give you $100  cash. You'd probably rather have $100 cash.  </P> <P>  -- I have this recurring nightmare in which Bo Jackson and Kirk Gibson are  heading toward one another at full speed, chasing the same fly ball. Owwwwwwww.  </P> <P>  -- Well, Brett Butler reportedly has reduced his contract demands to what  Strawberry makes instead of what Jose Canseco makes. Oh, and he's dropped his  demand that Peter O'Malley buy him Malibu.  </P> <P>  -- Let's see, the Oakland Athletics can afford to lose Willie McGee, and they  can afford to lose Bob Welch. Boy, they really do think they're better than the  Cincinnati Reds, don't they?  </P> <P>  -- I have seen the Boston Red Sox pitching and I don't care where that  left-field fence is . . . these guys could still use Fernando.  </P> <P>  -- The Chicago Cubs continue to offer Mitch Williams to any manager in  baseball who doesn't suffer from nerve or heart trouble.  </P> <P>  -- You know who could really be good someday? Ken Griffey III.  </P> <P>  -- I have been thinking a little more about that Boston Red Sox pitching, and  come to think of it, they could use me.  </P> <P>  -- Attention, parents of girls: Do not let your daughter grow up to be a  sportswriter. It isn't the locker room I'm thinking about; it's the money. Put  a bat and glove in her hands, and I mean today!  </P> <P>  -- Come on, you can tell me: Jack McKeon is secretly running the Toronto Blue  Jays, isn't he?  </P> <P>  -- Do you suppose the Giants are telling all these new players of theirs to  check out homes and schools in Denver or New Orleans?  </P> <P>  -- Let's see, who appeared in more Padre games: Joe Carter or Roseanne Barr?  </P> <P>  -- You have seen what the Reds, Dodgers, Padres and Giants have been doing,  but hurry over to Vegas and put a bundle on those fast-improving Atlanta Braves  to finish fifth.  </P> <P>  -- Now that Joe Torre is managing the St. Louis Cardinals, he's making plenty  of changes: Third-base coach -- Joe Garagiola; First base -- Bob Starr.  </P> <P>  -- New incentive clause for Roger Clemens: $50,000 for every playoff game he  isn't kicked out of.  </P> <P>  -- New incentive clause for Eric Davis: Round-trip air fare for all postseason  play.  </P> <P>  -- New incentive clause for Darryl Strawberry: Free pork chops if his barber  carves "Farmer John" onto the sides of his head.  </P> <P>  -- Attention, parents: Major league baseball is considering expansion!  Pitchers are desperately needed! No experience necessary! Right-handed,  left-handed, underhanded, backhanded! We don't care! If your kid can kick a  ball 60 feet 6 inches with his or her feet, give us a call! Operators are  standing by! We provide uniforms, shoes, supporters (if applicant is male),  rosin bags, soap for shower, everything your child will need! Big $$$$$  possible!

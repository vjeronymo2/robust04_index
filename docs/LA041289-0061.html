			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH CLAIMS HE IS BEING UNFAIRLY PROSECUTED;  </P> <P> NO ONE ELSE HAS EVER FACED SIMILAR CHARGE, HE CONTENDS ANGRILY  </P> <P> Oliver L. North, with his defense that he was merely a political pawn under  intense attack, declared in federal court Tuesday that he had been singled out  unfairly for prosecution and told his chief accuser, prosecutor John W. Keker:  "You know it."  </P> <P> Bristling under Keker's caustic cross-examination about false statements he had  made to Congress, the retired lieutenant colonel said that he had been involved  in "political warfare" between the White House and Congress for which he was  ill-prepared.  </P> <P> He exclaimed that candor has never been the rule in such exchanges between the  White House and Congress and that "nobody else has ever been prosecuted" for  sending a misleading letter to Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> For weeks, the trial of the former White House aide has been dominated by dry  recitations of events and citations of documents by persons who worked with  North, the fired National Security Council aide and a central figure in the  Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggestions Shake North  </P> <P> But Keker, like North a former Marine who served in Vietnam, Tuesday pushed up  the emotional temperature of the proceedings, shaking the defendant's stolid  bearing with suggestions that he had betrayed the principles of his military  education and lined his own pocket with money that had been collected for the  Nicaraguan rebels.  </P> <P> North's anger began to swell as Keker pressed him on his experience at the U.S.  Naval Academy, where North had proudly told jurors that he had been educated.  </P> <P> "At the U.S. Naval Academy, you would be kicked out for this, wouldn't you?"  Keker asked, referring to North's admissions that he had sent "factually  incorrect" letters to congressmen about his secret efforts to support the  Contras.  </P> <P> "At the Naval Academy," North retorted hotly, "no one taught me how to run a  covert operation. I was trying my ever-loving best to get it done. And nobody  in the U.S. Naval Academy teaches you about internecine political warfare."  </P> <P> He noted that then-National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane had asked him  to write the misleading letters. "I did not consider the fact that any letter  from a Cabinet officer to a congressman could possibly be unlawful," North said  evenly.  </P> <P> Then, glaring at Keker with his voice rising, he added: "Nobody else has ever  been prosecuted for it, and you know it."  </P> <P> "How about McFarlane?" Keker replied calmly.  </P> <P> "He pleaded guilty," North said.  </P> <P> "And Admiral Poindexter is being prosecuted, isn't he?" Keker asked, referring  to former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, whose separate trial in  the Iran-Contra scandal is scheduled to follow North's.  </P> <P> "That's the first two that I know about," North said.  </P> <P> North reiterated that he had only reluctantly drafted false and misleading  answers for McFarlane to send congressmen who were asking about his activities.  He said he had argued that McFarlane should provide no information at all and  should cite then-President Ronald Reagan's right to withhold answers on grounds  of executive privilege.  </P> <P> But North, for the first time Tuesday, contended that his draft answers were  not original. He said that McFarlane had told him what to say.  </P> <P> North has claimed that McFarlane and William J. Casey, the late CIA director,  both authorized his efforts to help raise private funds for the Contras and to  help resupply them with weapons purchased abroad at a time when Congress had  prohibited U.S. military aid for the rebel forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asked About Moral Qualms  </P> <P> The two officials told him also that former President Reagan did not want to  share information with Congress about private fund-raising for the Contras, he  has testified.  </P> <P> In taking North line by line through a written draft of one of his letters to  Congress, Keker asked at one point: "Did you have any moral qualms about being  mixed up in this? Did any moral bells go off in your head?"  </P> <P> "It would not be proper to use the word 'moral,' " North said, then used the  question to explain why he had worked so hard for the Nicaraguan rebels after  Congress had banned military aid for them.  </P> <P> "I thought it was extraordinarily immoral for the United States to put forces  in the field, to equip them . . . and then to leave them in the lurch. I  thought it was heinous."  </P> <P> When North repeated that McFarlane knew all about his activities but still told  him to draft responses to Congress, Keker asked: "Did he tell you he wanted the  answer to be a lie?"  </P> <P> "I don't recall his using those words," North said with some irritation.  </P> <P> "Did he say he wanted the answer not to be truthful?" Keker continued.  </P> <P> "I don't recall those words," North said.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell interposed his own question:  </P> <P> "Did you ever in your mind consider not doing it, just saying: 'No, I won't do  it?' "  </P> <P> "No, I did not," North replied.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMMONIA LEAK FORCES EVACUATION, SNARLS  TRAFFIC  </P> <P> A Skid Row day-care center was evacuated and streets in downtown Los Angeles  clogged with traffic when 30 gallons of ammonia spilled from a refrigeration  tank Tuesday afternoon, city Fire Department officials said.  </P> <P> The leak occurred about 5 p.m. from a malfunctioning tank belonging to Youngs  Market Co. in the 600 block of Gladys Avenue. Most of the liquid became gas and  dissipated into the air, officials said. But a nose-wrinkling odor enveloped  two Skid Row blocks, leading school officials to evacuate 25 children from the  Para Los Ninos day-care center.  </P> <P> "The smell got so strong, just like a big laundry," said day-care center worker  Wendy Sanchez.  </P> <P> Fire officials said no one was injured. Police blocked off 5th and 6th streets  while firefighters mopped up the spilled liquid.  </P></p>

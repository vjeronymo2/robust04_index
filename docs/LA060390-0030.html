			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 TRANSPORTATION PROPOSITIONS  </P> <P> Thank you for your editorial "Making a Case for Car-Pool Lanes: Prop. 111 Would  Aid Riverside and Orange Counties" (May 14). There are unrecognized but  reasonable reasons why car-pooling is not as easy to develop as planned for.  </P> <P> However, the primary reason for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes -- the hope  of reducing the number of cars on the freeways -- can be achieved by use of  buses in HOV lanes.  </P> <P> I believe that the El Monte busway, which is nothing but a separate car-pool or  HOV lane on the San Bernardino Freeway from El Monte to Los Angeles, carries as  many passengers as a light-rail line. The Southern California Transportation  Action Committee has advocated running buses on the freeways for years. Buses  can do what trains cannot -- leave the freeway and deliver passengers to  airports, places of employment, shopping centers, etc. Just think, HOV lanes  with buses on the 91 and 55 Freeways might make Ontario Airport a feasible  alternative to John Wayne for Orange County passengers.  </P> <P> ALBERT ZORASTER  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> STABBING VICTIM REFUSES TO COOPERATE  </P> <P> A man who was stabbed as he apparently attempted to break up an armed robbery  in a Santa Paula park has refused to cooperate with authorities, police said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jose Robles, 40, was listed in stable condition at Santa Paula Memorial  Hospital Tuesday after he was stabbed about 5 p.m. Monday at Veterans Park at  100 S. Mill St.  </P> <P> Santa Paula police said Robles apparently tried to stop a robbery attempt in  which several people, one armed with a handgun, had confronted James Fuller,  39. Robles was stabbed and Fuller received a minor abdominal injury. The  suspects fled on foot.  </P> <P> Anthony Servin, 25, of Santa Paula was arrested and booked for robbery and  assault with a deadly weapon. Police said further arrests and prosecution have  been hindered by lack of cooperation from the participants in the altercation,  including Robles.  </P> <P> "The parties directly involved know what's going on, but they won't tell us  anything," said Cmdr. Bob Gonzales of the Santa Paula Police Department.  </P> <P> Police said the park is used regularly for narcotics transactions. Fuller made  a statement to police but did not identify any of the suspects, Gonzales said,  and Robles has said "very little."  </P> <P> The detective investigating the case, Sgt. Mike Saviers, said that Robles  apparently approached the altercation and shouted at the robbers to leave  Fuller alone, and that he "got stabbed for his efforts."  </P> <P> "We're not really sure we're getting the whole story," Gonzales said.

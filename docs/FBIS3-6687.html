			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking to reporters in Vietnam yesterday about the  Finance Ministry's plan to give loans to the Indochinese  countries for infrastructure development, Deputy Finance  Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri said:    [Begin Trairong recording] Our foreign reserves now amount  to  over 600 billion baht. Singapore aside, we are the richest  country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The  amount exceeds the optimum [preceding word rendered in English]  point. Under normal circumstances, the foreign reserve is  maintained at a level just high enough for buying two or three  months worth of imports. The present amount is sufficient for  five or six months. This concerns us, because the money is just  doing nothing at the national bank. For this reason, we want  our business people to use this money to invest in other  countries so that we can earn interest. We encourage our people  to invest in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Wichit Suphinit, governor of the Bank of  Thailand,  said that Thailand's foreign reserves are excessively high and  enough to cover as much as seven months worth of imports. The  Bank of Thailand will use the money to provide loans to its  neighboring countries in line with the Finance Ministry policy.</p>

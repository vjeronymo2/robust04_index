			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taba, 17 Jan (MENA)--Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the  Palestinian team at the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Committee,  a subcommittee of the Gaza-Jericho talks, has told MENA that the  Palestinians and Israelis have not reached agreement on 18  points concerning the transfer of civilian authority, services,  and public facilities from the Israelis to the Palestinians in  accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles.    The Palestinians and Israelis, however, agreed on 20 points  in the last round of talks. These, al-Tarifi added, include  education, health, social affairs, electricity, and postal  services. The points on which no agreement have been reached  include taxes, tariffs, city planning, and water supply. The  talks, which will resume tomorrow in Taba, will focus on these  unresolved issues, he pointed out.    The Palestinian people have a big problem concerning water,  because Israeli settlements are exhausting the water resources  in the occupied territories, particularly Gaza. Only these  settlements, al-Tarifi said, are allowed to dig for water. The  Palestinians are not, he noted.    Al-Tarifi said: We insist on our right to issue Palestinian  passports and ID's. The Israeli side does not agree to the  issuance of a Palestinian passport on the grounds that it is a  mark of state sovereignty and therefore unacceptable.    Al-Tarifi said that the Palestinians can exercise civilian  authority successfully and without technical or administrative  glitches. There are already Palestinian employees working for  and running the civilian services and departments. Al-Tarifi  pointed out that the number of Palestinian teachers and  employees working in the education sector in the occupied  territories amounts to 6,800 people, compared with 150 Israelis.  We only want them to give us the files and computer data. We  can run life in the West Bank and Gaza on our own.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Sterling and the fund managers At first sight, the events of last Friday make both the chancellor and his critics look pretty silly. Interest rates were cut again and sterling rose again within the ERM. This makes apparent nonsense of the dire warning from the six monetarist letter-writers to The Times, who said that sterling would have to be devalued to make interest rate cuts possible (MLR was then at 14 per cent). However, the chancellor's sober warning that future cuts would depend on the ERM looks equally pessimistic. Sterling has risen ever since he started cutting rates, just as the dollar rose, seemingly without end, in the mid-80s when rates were cut. Can we conclude, then, that the economists are wrong and have the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates upside down? Only up to a point. We need only look south across Europe and see that the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira are so strong on the basis of high rates that only massive intervention can keep them within their ERM bounds. Equally, look back a few months to the run-up to sterling's ERM entry: the exchange rate against the ERM rose as interest rates were pushed up. Meanwhile, however, the D-Mark is weak despite the expectation of higher rates. All most confusing. Some of the confusion may melt away if we remember the one clearly sensible assertion of the once-fashionable rational expectation hypothesis: that markets move only in response to surprises. (The rest of the theory is largely forgotten, because nobody regards today's volatile markets as rational.) The rate cut in London last week was no surprise at all: the market had been talking of little else for days, and so lower rates were clearly discounted in the exchange markets, just as they were in the futures market. It is perfectly possible, indeed, that the sterling rally reflected relief that the politically-pressed government had not cut by a full point, which would put the relationship the 'right' way up again. There is an alternative theory, however, which is equally persuasive - and equally impossible to prove. This would offend John of Occam, the schoolman who said that one phenomenon could only have one cause; but in the markets, things are not so rigorous. This rests on the distinction between 'hot' money and long-term investment funds. Footloose money simply seeks the highest rates of return, if the risk looks acceptable; the higher the money market rate, the bigger the inflow. It was a movement of this kind that financed the peak British current account deficits and the large investment outflows of last year; and the rise in Spanish and Italian reserves despite large deficits looks like the same story. Long-term investors, by contrast, look for expected real returns in the long term. When they are dominant, exchange rates behave like equity prices: they rise on lower credit costs, or the expectation of them. That, broadly, is the British and American story for most of this year. This does not mean that international investors are constantly losing sleep over the cost of credit in London: the investors who make the weather are mainly those based at home. It is because fund managers like UK equity returns, especially with ERM insurance against exchange rate risks, that the market moves as it does. And where else can you get a government-guaranteed real return of 4 per cent? Answer: invest at home. Other things being equal, this suggests that there is one rule for countries with large and liquid equity markets and no exchange controls  - Japan, the US and the UK, in that order. This, indeed, seems broadly to be the case. The yen the dollar and sterling tend to move in the same direction as equity markets; most other currencies respond more to relative interest rates, especially where foreign investment is unfamiliar or hampered by law. This simple insight might have prevented some of the more spectacular recent mistakes in judging exchange rate and interest rate futures; but it is still terribly over-simplified. First, the relationship can break down when the market appears to doubt the judgment of the monetary authorities; in other words, when the yield curve steepens. It is now particularly steep in Wall Street; and it is probably this fact, rather than the known prejudices of some regional Fed presidents left over from the Volcker era, which restrained the Fed last week from responding to lower inflation with a further rate cut. This is a warning that investors may before long conclude that they are safer in Japan, where the next interest rate move must surely be down, rather than in the US, where it just could be up. It is also a longer-term warning for sterling: if investors start to concentrate on the core rate of inflation rather than the headline numbers, they could lose their present confidence - especially after an autumn election. There is a longer-term danger, too: where prices are based on expectations rather than on current returns, they tend to overshoot once any move is established, as every schoolboy must know by now. The dollar and the yen, both sharply undervalued in purchasing power terms at the moment, clearly have a long way to rise: equally clearly, they will rise too far. Sterling is or will be over-valued; but its volatility will be limited by ERM membership - though not eliminated: it could drag the whole system up for a time. Furthermore, exchange rate movements have what may appear to investors a perverse result: the exchange rate strength which results from the hope of high returns tends in fact to reduce those returns. In fact, this is not perverse at all: the market is simply doing its job of equalising expected returns, partly through asset prices, and partly through competitive pressures. It all adds, though, to the hangover when the market does overshoot. This is only the merest sketch of the true complexities of the credit-exchange rate nexus: we should also factor in perceived financial fragility, politics and demography, for a start. Is it any wonder that the forecasters make such a hash of it?</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Management: Sculptors in jelly - The misunderstandings and challenges surrounding process re-engineering Organisations are rather like giant jellies, says Richard Heygate, a partner at McKinsey &amp; Co, the consultancy. If you resculpt too limited a part of them, they wobble back into their old form. But if you try to remould too much at once, the whole effort becomes unmanageable and they collapse into a quivering heap. The jelly may even become rock-solid and resistant to further reshaping. Heygate's simile is imperfect: jellies seldom wobble back into place when tampered with. They usually emit rude noises, and topple sideways. But it does give a taste of why many companies are finding it so hard to succeed at the 're-engineering' of business processes - or what he calls 'core process redesign'. It also helps explain why a widespread chorus of rude and cynical noises is already bursting forth in the US and Europe about the fashion for re-engineering. James Champy, co-father with Michael Hammer of the re-engineering concept* and chairman of CSG Index, a McKinsey rival, puts the problem in more down-to-earth terms. Many re-engineering exercises fall flat, he says, because an organisation's senior managers 'do not really have an appetite for discontinuous (radical) change, and all the pain that goes with it'. Many do not appreciate the degree of change required - not just in business processes, but in managerial behaviour and organisation structure. These are some of the reasons why Champy says that only 5 or 10 per cent of the companies which say they are 'doing re-engineering' actually are - even though he says the rest will have to follow suit over the next five years 'or else they'll be out of business'. 'The term re-engineering is misapplied widely - almost to any sort of change programme', Champy complains. People even mistake it for 'downsizing' - laying people off. At best, says Heygate, 'what all but a few companies are doing is really just total quality management - fixing certain processes from the bottom up. So it's not surprising that well-publicised gains in individual processes are failing to be translated into dramatic improvements in the performance of the whole organisation'. CSC Index and McKinsey probably have more experience in process redesign on both sides of the Atlantic than any other global consultancy, except possibly Gemini. Some of the Boston Consulting Group's extensive work on 'time-based competition' is also re-engineering under another name. CSC Index and McKinsey may be arch-rivals, but they concur reasonably closely on the main points where companies are tending to go wrong with re-engineering (or 'core process redesign'). Champy's checklist of re-engineering 'do's' and 'dont's' is dauntingly long. In addition to those already mentioned, he says failures occur when top management neglects to redefine clearly what he calls the organisation's future 'operating model', the extent to which its competitive edge needs to come from superior customer service, manufacturing efficiency, or innovative products and services - or a mixture of all three. McKinsey consultants call this a company's 'value proposition': a statement of the distinctive value it proposes to deliver to customers. From this should flow an analysis of which business processes are 'core' to its competitiveness, and which therefore need the most urgent attention. 'Too often re-engineering addresses non-critical elements of the business', agrees David Hall of Boston Consulting Group. Management may also harbour inadequate ambitions for the organisation's performance in its core processes, continues Champy. For re-engineering to have a chance of working, he says, a series of specific targets must be set for increases in market share, quality and service standards, and for reduced costs and capital. These targets must be enumerated and articulated in a way which challenges the organisation effectively. Champy sees other snares - failure to grasp the need for the organisation's management style to change entirely, from command and control to empowerment; and the tendency to get waylaid into 'mapping' all the organisation's existing processes before re-engineering any of them. The mapping snare may seem relatively trivial, but it 'creates a lot of useless work that delays you from getting on with what needs to be done  - sometimes for years', says Champy. He blames the failure of a big IBM re-engineering exercise several years ago partly on this tendency. Process mapping is 'an invention of the consulting profession to keep a lot of junior consultants busy', he says. Champy's advice is augmented by John Hagel, a colleague of Heygate's at McKinsey, who has produced one of the most useful checklists of tips about 'keeping core process re-design on track'**. He lists a string of 'red flags' which provide early signs that something is going wrong. They include: Inadequate management attention. For a redesign to be successful, the chief executive and several other senior managers must devote up to half their time to it, for its entire duration; Inadequate urgency and stamina. Between a third and half of the total performance improvement should be deliverable in the first six to 12 months of implementation; such 'early wins' are key to sustaining the effort's momentum. But the rest may take two or three years to achieve. Inadequate focus. When a company says 'we've defined 40 or more core processes' (as Xerox did at one stage), this is a strong warning signal. Most businesses can be broken into three to five core processes (Xerox now lists only seven); any further subdivision means big cross-functional performance improvements may be missed. By the standards of conventional 'change management' programmes, Hagel's target of completion within three years looks over-optimistic for anything more than the redesign of a single core process; most companies have found from bitter experience that it takes far longer than that to accomplish successfully a broad programme of radical change. The challenge of re-engineering is 'to learn how to do big change fast', says Champy. Disarmingly, he admits that consultants have almost as much to learn as clients. * See Re-engineering the Corporation, Nicholas Brealey, Pounds 16.99. ** Published in The Case for Core Process Redesign.

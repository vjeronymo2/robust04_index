			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (15): Laptop users: senior managers and directors top the list - Increasing interest being shown in insurance, banking, auditing and sales and marketing sectors one group of end-users seeks high-performance and highly-functional desktop machine substitutions, while another group demands smaller, lighter weight, battery-powered computers for more simple solutions. These trends are highlighted in a report on portable computer markets by the Market Intelligence Research Corporation (MIRC), which estimates that world sales for these machines this year could be more than Dollars 5.6m. This represents an annual growth rates of 10.2 per cent, rising to 11.8 per cent next year.* PROFILES OF TYPICAL USERS But who are main users of portables - particularly laptops? In the US, there is a higher percentage of users among direct sales teams and mobile workers than in the UK, but this will change with the lively interest being shown in Britain in such sectors as insurance, banking, auditing, sales and marketing, field engineering and management consultancies. A survey in the UK of computer-users working in companies with more than 500 employees, the majority of users - for the moment - are senior managers or directors, (54 per cent). One-in-five are professionals and consultants, according to the report by AST Europe, the personal computer manufacturer, and IDG Communications. The percentage of portable computer-users and their job titles were as follows: Director, partner: 18 per cent. Managing director, principal: 11 per cent. Data processing manager, information technology manager, 11 per cent. Other managers: 14 per cent. Professionals, consultants: 19 per cent. Engineers, scientists: 5 per cent. Administrators, 8 per cent. Analysts, officers: 11 per cent. In companies where users have both desktops and portables, they spend an average of 3.52 hours a day on the former and only 2.35 hours a day on the portable. But those without desktop machines use the portable for an average of 3.8 hours a day. In a survey of use by locations, portables were used for 37 per cent of the time in the office, 34 per cent at home and 19 per cent in other people's offices. More than half of users said they found their portable to be 'even more valuable' than they originally expected. One-in-five said they were also using the portable for new applications. While portability was considered the main benefit of the machines (35 per cent); the executive's ability to work outside the office was rated at 10 per cent, with increased efficiency and ability to work more productively rated at eight per cent. MANAGEMENT RESEARCH PROGRAMME Despite the increasing number of managers who use portable computers, surveys of senior executives attending development courses at a leading management training centre in the UK show that 'only a small percentage have any realistic appreciation of information technology in the management process.' Monica Seeley, programme director of the Sundridge Park Management Centre at Bromley, Kent, says that information processing tasks, traditionally performed by middle managers, can now be undertaken by the senior manager on his or her laptop, wherever they may be. 'The power and ease-of-use of today's portables leads to the radical conclusion that only the computer-aided manager will survive and flourish in the 1990s,' says Ms Seeley. Now the centre has begun a three-year research programme to study the impact of information technology (IT) and how managers should organise their career paths in order to acquire IT and managerial skills to operate more effectively.*** This research will be conducted jointly with Professor John Beaumont at the School of Management at Bath University. 'Analysis will identify what exactly are the skills and mind-set of managers who use IT effectively in business,' adds Ms Seeley. 'This will be done by comparing the career paths of 'IT advanced' and 'IT retarded' managers. 'A comparison will also be made of the organisational frameworks which advance and retard the effective use of information technology.' BARCLAYS GOES PORTABLE In one of the largest portable computer contracts ever placed in the financial services industry, Barclays Life Assurance - part of the Barclays group - has ordered 1,500 Toshiba computers for its entire sales force. The machines will be used to help build Barclays life assurance, pensions and investments business. The company made a six-month appraisal of portables computers on field tests from various manufacturers before deciding on the Toshiba model T2000SXe. The machines will run tailor-made 'Supercasp' software, developed by Microlex Systems of Derby. The system enables Barclays Life sales staff to make swift and detailed presentations and forecasts for customers. Toshiba's researchers claim that executives 'can expect around a 30 per cent improvement in sales performance using the latest in portable sales technology.' SALES FORCE COMPUTES ON THE MOVE Life Association of Scotland, (LAS), the financial services company, has bought 260 Tandon Notebook portable computers for use by its direct sales force who need lightweight machines while on the move. The LAS evaluated eight models of notebook computers from various suppliers before selecting the Tandon NB/386sx which runs at 20 MHz and weighs just 6.6lbs (3.1kg). The model has a 10 ins VGA monochrome backlit LCD display which allows the user to operate industry-standard software while on the move. FAST-GROWING PORTABLE PRINTER MARKET More than 300,000 portable computer printers are likely to be sold in Europe this year, according to a new survey by Citizen Europe, the computer printer and monitor manufacturers. This figure is likely to rise to 550,000 units a year in 1995. 'At least one-in-four buyers of portable computers also require a printer,' says Anthony Odhams, a senior manager at Citizen. 'Our forecasts suggest an overall market growth from 1990 to 1995 of nearly 244 per cent.' What is claimed to be one of the world's smallest A4 portable printers has been launched by Citizen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Citizen Watch company of Japan. At 1.17kg, the PN48 Notebook Printer is half the weight of many of its competitors and easily fits into a standard briefcase. The machine is a non-impact device with a high resolution printhead to give letter-quality print, comparable with the output of some laser printers. Text and graphics can be combined on one page at print speeds of 53 cps in letter-quality. The UK retail price: Pounds 325, plus VAT; (includes NiCad battery). Among innovations in the sector, the Irish-based company, Ferrotec has plans to produce its new plain paper portable printer (the H200PM) both in France and Ireland. Serrib, part of Groupe Bull, has the capacity to produce 3,000 printers a month. Ferrotec's new printer will be launched at next month's CeBIT '92 exhibition in Hanover. Among contenders in the portable printer market - they include Toshiba's 201, Canon's stylish Bubble Jet (BJ-10ex), the Kodak Diconix 150+, the Seikosha dot-matrix LT-20 and the Mannesmann Tally MT-735 - small is beautiful in the race to win market share. The compact, high-quality Mannesmann printer can emulate both dot-matrix and laser printers. Toshiba claims to have the smallest and lightest portable printer on the UK market in the ExpressWriter 201, which weighs 1.9lbs (0.85kg) and measures 11.9 by 3.1 by 1.7 ins. It uses 24-dot thermal transfer and prints on thermal or standard office paper, using a ribbon, to produce letter-quality output. The ExpressWriter is priced at Pounds 265. It will print continuously for an hour using a detachable battery (weighing 0.55kg), available as an option for Pounds 40. *Opportunities in Portable Computer Markets: Market Intelligence Research Corporation, 45 Rue Vandenhoven, 1150 Brussels, Belgium. **AST Europe, 2 Goat Wharf, Brentford, Middlesex, TW8 0BA, tel.(081) 568 4350. *** Sundridge Park Management Centre, Plaistow Lane, Bromley, Kent, BR1 3TP.</p>

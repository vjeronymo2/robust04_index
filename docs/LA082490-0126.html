			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN REVIEW / DESIGNERS;  </P> <P> HE TENDS TO BUCK THE TREND  </P> <P> Richard Tyler is a designer who always dances to the beat of his own drum.  </P> <P> While the rest of the fashion world touts casual dressing, Tyler opts for  elegance. As silhouettes loosen up in other collections, his are form-fitting  and body enhancing.  </P> <P> It is this anti-Establishment approach to design that has earned the Los  Angeles-based Tyler a growing reputation as the "West Coast's Jean Paul  Gautier," the Paris designer known for classic tailoring and eccentric details.  </P> <P> The introduction of his fall collection of men's and women's tailored suits,  sport coats and dresses, shown to a standing-room-only crowd in the designer's  Beverly Boulevard store last week, will hardly change that perception.  </P> <P> Australian-born Tyler was primarily a menswear designer, who apprenticed with  Leo Granger, the tailor and outfitter to the late Australian prime minister,  Sir Robert Gordon Menzies.  </P> <P> Tyler adapted his British tailored approach to women's wear during his last  five years in Los Angeles. He added a theatrical division to his company, Tyler  Trafficante (named for himself and wife/business partner Lisa Trafficante),  that produces clothing for entertainers like Rod Stewart, Elton John, Janet  Jackson and Sinead O'Connor.  </P> <P> For fall ready-to-wear, his preoccupation with Sherlock Holmes'  Edwardian-inspired tailoring continues as a Tyler trademark reflected in long  coats with cinched waists and flared hems. Many of his women's designs play off  classic English equestrian wear -- skintight stirrup pants and hourglass-shaped  jackets.  </P> <P> His three-color satin jackets and red velvet coats for men and women show the  more severe side of his designs. Likewise, his black gabardine,  broad-shouldered, peaked lapeled jackets with matching fitted trousers for men  and coat dresses for women illustrate the designer's more controlled design  philosophy. Prices range from about $325 to $2,000.  </P> <P> "I am not following any trends with my collection," states Tyler. "All I want  to project is quality fabrics and well-cut clothing."  </P></p>

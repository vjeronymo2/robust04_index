			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Governor Ruan Chongwu presided  over the 34th executive meeting of the provincial government,  which examined and adopted in principle Hainan's  help-the-poor-through-development program, whose goal it is to  solve the problem of food and clothing for people in the  impoverished areas by the end of this century, and Hainan's  detailed rules and regulations of implementation concerning the  management of family planning work among the floating  population. Present at the meeting were Vice Governors Wang  Xueping, Chen Suhou, and Liu Mingqi, as well as Liu Xuebin,  Standing Committee member of the provincial party committee and  special assistant to the governor. Persons in charge of  relevant government departments attended the meeting as  nonvoting delegates.    Since the founding of Hainan Province and the establishment  of the Hainan Special Economic Zone, Hainan's economy has  developed rapidly and its work to help the poor has made  relatively great progress, with over 1.1 million people having  managed to shake off poverty. Nevertheless, as our province has  a weak foundation for development and development varies from  locality to locality, the task is still very arduous. To speed  up the pace of shaking off poverty and achieving common  prosperity in the rural areas, the provincial government has  decided to spend seven years (1994-2000) to reach the goal of  raising the rural areas out of poverty. Governments at all  levels and departments were urged to regard the help-the-poor  work as part of their work, make concerted efforts, do solid  work, and contribute to the realization of the help-the-poor-  through-development program.    This year our province has registered a drastic increase in  the floating population, and the number of births outside the  state plan among the floating population has reached serious  proportions. According to the state's family planning management  methods and the requirements of Hainan's family planning  regulations, the provincial government has formulated and will  promulgate Hainan Province's detailed rules and regulations of  implementation concerning the management of family planning  among the floating population, so as to effectively manage  family planning work among the floating population.</p>

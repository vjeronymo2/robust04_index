			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Paris Results will continue to drive the market, with first-half figures expected this week from BNP, Michelin, Pechiney and Credit Lyonnais. UBS also expects indications this week of an attractive price for the partial privatisation of Renault, but warns that international investors risk disappointment. 'Whether it will be to appease unions or to appeal to voters, the majority of the Renault deal is likely to be distributed in France to employees, French institutions and corporates (Elf, BNP, Lagardere) and private investors,' the bank says.</p>

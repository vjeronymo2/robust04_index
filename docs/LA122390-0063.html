			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES  </P> <P> In reality, the same ranchers and hunters John Balzar consulted ("Animal  Populations Put Parks in a Bind," Part A, Dec. 17) are the source of the  problem.  </P> <P> Until they drop their opposition to the restoration of the gray wolf to  Yellowstone, we can look forward to annual scenes of hunters lined up like  firing squads and mowing down buffalo.  </P> <P> For tens of thousands of years the wolf has been the key component in keeping  prey base populations in balance to any ecosystem the wolf is indigenous to. We  can no longer plead ignorance in barring his return to Yellowstone. It is  simple stupidity.  </P> <P> RICHARD DUNKERLY, Whittier  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (14): Facing up to an about turn - Efforts to attract the civil service IN THE middle of January, General Sir David Ramsbotham, adjutant-general of the army, was guest at a lunch given in his honour by the city of Glasgow. The aim was to celebrate the decision by the army to locate its new personnel centre handling army pay and pensions in the city, creating 700 jobs. The idea involved closing several smaller offices around Britain. In addition to the new jobs, some 400 existing ministry of defence jobs in the city would be safeguarded. The MoD would do everyone a favour by occupying Tay House, a large new office building standing empty in the heart of the city. But the celebrations proved premature. In early March, Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, said the army was now considering an alternative building at Stockport, near Manchester. Its consultants had overlooked it originally but the MoD had to face the fact it was on the market for Pounds 4m against the Pounds 20m the Glasgow site would cost. The apparent about turn by the MoD infuriated Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and dismayed and puzzled the Glasgow Development Agency which had persuaded the army that Glasgow was the army's best choice. Mr Hamilton said it had always been stated that the original decision was 'subject to review and further consultation'. He indicated that Stockport was likely to win the re-opened contest. The GDA still believes it has a good chance of saving the project for Glasgow, believing that the costs of refurbishing the Stockport building and the other advantages of Glasgow mean that its case outweighs that of Stockport. No final decision has been made. But the affair has been a poor demonstration of the government's stated policy of showing greater consideration to Scotland. The policy was summed up in a white paper issued in March entitled Scotland in the Union: a partnership for good. It said that since 1979 more than 4,000 civil service jobs 'are recorded as having been moved or being about to move to Scotland'. The day the white paper came out the government announced that the department of trade and industry would move part of its oil and gas division from London to Aberdeen. This was a partial victory for leaders of the Aberdeen oil services industry who have been arguing for several years that the government should move the Petroleum Engineering Directorate (PED) (once part of the former department of energy) to Aberdeen. The PED handles drilling and production licence applications by oil companies. Scottish Enterprise, in a detailed study in 1991, endorsed the theory that by moving the whole PED to Aberdeen enormous benefits would follow. Oil companies, it said, would transfer the staff who dealt with the PED to the northern city, and engineering design companies would follow them. The split in oil industry expertise between London and Aberdeen would end. Aberdeen would become the unchallenged centre of European oil expertise. Exports of services and equipment would increase and the UK share of the world offshore oil market might double. Eventually, an extra 15,000 jobs might be created in the UK. Many people said at the time that Scottish Enterprise was spoiling a good case with exaggeration. The Scottish media did not help, repeatedly saying that the 15,000 new jobs would all be in Scotland or even in Aberdeen alone, rather than in the whole of Britain. There was evidently intense reluctance by the oil industry civil servants to move north. After much prevarication the government commissioned a study of the issue by Ernst &amp; Young. The Ernst &amp; Young report, released last month, will have made uncomfortable reading for Scottish Enterprise. It said there was 'no clear case' for moving the whole of the PED to Aberdeen. It would mean a loss of business efficiency to the DTI. The impact on the location of other organisations would be 'small'. It acknowledged that there would be a 'small gain' in promoting an agglomeration of industries and skills in Aberdeen, which 'should improve the UK international position in offshore supplies and services'. The government has decided to move 60 geologists and engineers of the PED from London to Aberdeen to provide services previously only available in London. The Aberdeen office would take 'the nationwide lead in the issue of field development consents' and process development applications from companies based in Aberdeen. If more oil companies moved the office would be expanded to 80 staff. It was a partial victory for Aberdeen but also an overdue dose of realism. The civil servants start moving towards the end of this year.</p>

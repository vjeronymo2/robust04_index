			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Arcadian deficit cut sharply Arcadian International, the leisure development group, cut its pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 853,000 for the year to April 30. Exceptional credits of Pounds 187,000 compared with previous provisions of Pounds 1.94m. Net interest payable was cut to Pounds 171,000 (Pounds 484,000). Turnover totalled Pounds 6.34m (Pounds 10.7m) and losses per share 10p (32.2p). The board, chaired by Sir Peter Parker, said the improved results reflected continuing strong progress in the European leisure operations and the group's now low exposure to the UK commercial property market. The 'strong balance sheet' and negligible gearing at the year-end was helped by the commercial property disposal programme. There were only two properties remaining with an aggregate book value of Pounds 2.95m, he said. The board believed that with a portfolio of 'outstanding projects' the process of increasing shareholder value 'was already underway'.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Ex-Montedison chairman held by Rome police Police in Rome arrested Mr Mario Schimberni, 70-year-old former chairman of the Montedison chemicals group, early yesterday and charged him with deception and illicit distribution of dividends. One of the most high-profile business figures in the late- 1970s and the 1980s, Mr Schimberni was forced from the chairmanship of Montedison in 1987 when the Ferruzzi family, led by the late Mr Raul Gardini, took control. His arrest is part of the ever expanding investigations by Milan magistrates into Montedison's affairs. The group was used first by Mr Gardini and then by other Ferruzzi family members to make illicit payments to political parties and to syphon funds into Ferruzzi overseas bank accounts. The significance of the latest move is that the magistrates now appear to be examining Montedison's books in the period before Mr Gardini assumed full control. According to usually reliable leaks from Milan magistrates, the charges relate to the period 1984-86. The magistrates are attempting to trace some L500bn (Pounds 202m) removed from Montedison's books and transferred to accounts in the Netherlands Antilles. There has been no previous mention of such a sum being missing so far back in Montedison's accounts. Indeed, this is the largest single sum discovered to be missing. According to Ansa, the national news agency, investigations into Mr Schimberni followed the discovery by Mr Guido Rossi, current administrator of Ferruzzi-Montedison, of documents prepared by Mr Gardini. Further arrests are expected. Mr Schimberni, who was granted house arrest because of his age, was the protagonist in some of the most controversial takeovers of the past decade, including that of the Bonomi family's financial holding, Bi-Invest. Milan police yesterday arrested Mr Alessandro Patelli, former treasurer of the populist Northern League, on charges of violating party financing laws. This is the first time the League has been implicated in the corruption scandals.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE THE SPURS OF THE MOMENT  </P> <P> There is hope for the hopeless, life for the lifeless, maybe even a home for  the homeless, at HemisFair Arena these days. The San Antonio Spurs are living  proof that the 98-pound weakling with braces, acne and a lisp can grow up to  get the girl. The day cannot be far away when any self-respecting gym rat wears  a wristwatch, black socks and generic sneakers.  </P> <P> Think of the possibilities, now that the most-improved basketball team on this  planet owes its success in part to:  </P> <P> An ordained minister-keyboard-player-songwriter who takes medication to ensure  that his heart beats regularly;  </P> <P> The world's tallest known Navy Lieutenant, who is as likely to practice on the  keyboard as on his jump shot;  </P> <P> One failed trumpet player;  </P> <P> A guy who answers to Brick and, for fun, collects guns;  </P> <P> A 22-year-old rookie whose heroics once allowed his ninth-grade team to get  beat "only" 100-18;  </P> <P> And a little old guy named Cheeks.  </P> <P> From the ruins of 21 victories and 61 defeats in 1988-89, Spur Coach Larry  Brown and assistant to the chairman Bob Bass have built a team that ranks among  the National Basketball Association's elite.  </P> <P> The Spurs return from the All-Star break with the sixth-best record in the  league (32-15) and are on pace to go 57-25. Such a turnaround would be the  biggest in NBA history, surpassing the 32-game improvement the Larry Bird-led  Boston Celtics made from '78-79 to '79-80.  </P> <P> Imagine how high the Spurs can climb once they finish learning each others'  names and games. Only three current Spurs were on the active roster at the end  of last season. Two rookies, David Robinson and Sean Elliott, are accounting  for 31% of the scoring, 34% of the rebounding and 52% of the shot-blocking. And  here the Spurs are anyway, within dunking distance of catching the Lakers in  the race for the best record in the NBA.  </P> <P> "This," Brown admits, "is a shock."  </P> <P> This is a far cry from last year, when Brown was about ready for shock  treatments. Brown, remember, came to the Spurs last season fresh off having  guided the Kansas Jayhawks to the 1988 national championship. He had a  five-year, $3.5-million contract and visions of taking a 7-foot-1 David and  building a Goliath of a team. The Navy sunk those plans two weeks before the  season, ruling Robinson had to serve another year before joining the Spurs.  </P> <P> Without Robinson, the Spurs suffered a team-record, 13-game losing streak en  route to the worst season in franchise history. Brown clashed with the best  player he inherited, All-Star Alvin Robertson. Brown clashed with the best  player he brought in, 6-7 rookie swingman Willie Anderson. Brown, in short,  crashed and burned to his first losing season in 17 as a head coach.  </P> <P> With Robinson -- plus veteran reinforcements Terry Cummings, Maurice Cheeks and  Caldwell Jones -- home attendance is at a franchise high of 14,071 per game.  The HemisFair crowd usually gets what it comes to see, too. The Spurs are tied  for the best home record in the league at 21-2.  </P> <P> "Things have definitely turned around," Anderson says. "A year ago, I wouldn't  have believed it if someone had said we would be 32-14. But then if someone had  told me the team would consist of the guys it does now . . . "  </P> <P> The Spurs were a revolving door leading to nowhere last season, using a  league-high 22 players -- to used the word loosely. A May 28 trade that sent  Robertson to the Milwaukee Bucks and brought Cummings proved to be a step in  the right direction. Exactly three months later, the Spurs acquired the 6-1  Cheeks, swingman David Wingate and center Chris Welp from the Philadelphia  76ers for guard Johnny Dawkins and forward Jay Vincent. The draft brought  Elliott. Free agency brought Jones, a 39-year-old settling influence for  Robinson. Just like that, Brown had purged himself of the team even he had to  have been tempted to boo.  </P> <P> "I looked at our team at training camp," Brown says, recalling the dark days,  "and I honestly thought the University of Kansas could have beaten that team  because of our attitude and work habits and stuff. It was a terrible feeling  going into the arena and going around town. People were upset. You know, a lot  of people get pretty personal with it. I'd never been in a situation where the  fans didn't appreciate what we were doing. It has always been like a honeymoon  for me."  </P> <P> Now it's like one wedding night after another for the Spurs. A lovefest.  </P> <P> "The chemistry is right," Cummings says. "The attitude is right. People will do  whatever it takes to win. We have people who have accepted their role."  </P> <P> Cummings is a proven All-Star-level player, an eight-year veteran whose 22.4  points and 8.1 rebounds per game are right in line with his career figures. He  is unflinching in tough situations, fortified, no doubt, by having overcome  early in his career a scare caused by having an irregular heartbeat. Anderson  made the right decision to give up the trumpet, if his versatility on a  basketball court (16.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, 4.1 assists) means anything.  Cheeks, at age 33, is elderly by point-guard standards. He is around as much  for his steadiness and unflappability as his 11.1 points and 6.0 assists per  game.  </P> <P> Frank Brickowski is "Brick," though his shooting touch is nothing of the sort.  Since taking over for Elliott as a starter at forward two weeks ago, Brickowski  has averaged 10 points and five rebounds on 68% shooting.  </P> <P> Robinson is the anchor of it all, an ominous defensive presence Golden State  Coach Don Nelson likens to Hall of Famer Bill Russell. For good measure,  Robinson contributes 23.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.1 blocked shots and 2.2  assists per game. Cheeks credits Robinson for making all of the Spurs' pieces  fit together. The pressure defense. The passing game on offense.  </P> <P> "David has a lot to do with it," says Cheeks, who touts Robinson as the  league's Most Valuable Player. "When you have a big man to go to, a lot of  things around here get easier. He makes everyone around him better."  </P> <P> Robinson arguably has outshined the rookie performance of the NBA's most highly  acclaimed big men, Patrick Ewing and Akeem Olajuwon. Ewing averaged 20 points,  nine rebounds and two blocks as a rookie, compared to 20, 12 and three for  Olajuwon. Keep in mind, also, that Robinson hasn't had the luxury -- except for  a stint on the 1988 Olympic team -- of honing his skills against top-flight  competition the last two years.  </P> <P> "I need to play defense and rebound," Robinson says. "They don't need me to  score 30 points and do everything.  </P> <P> "Once I get into double figures in points, I don't think about it anymore.  Rebounding, I think of constantly because I never know how many I have --  unless I only have two rebounds at halftime. Then they'll say, 'You've only got  two rebounds.' So if I know how many rebounds I have, I'm in trouble."  </P> <P> Suffice it to say, Robinson isn't in trouble often. He had 33 points, 21  rebounds, six assists and five blocked shots, for instance, in a 112-111 home  victory against Chicago Feb. 3. He more than held his own in Sunday's All-Star  game with 15 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> "I knew he could be great," Brown says, "but I had no idea it would come this  quick."  </P> <P> All Robinson has going for him is intelligence (1,320 on his SAT),  Olajuwonesque quickness, deceptive strength near the basket, a deft left-handed  touch. He has enough respect from the referees to rank second in the league in  free-throw attempts. Best of all, he expects even more from himself. All-Star  as a rookie? He shrugs.  </P> <P> "I hope it's not the greatest thing that ever happens in my career," Robinson  says. "Or my career won't be very long."  </P> <P> In all likelihood, the Spurs will have to wait a bit for greatness as a team.  They are just getting to know each other, they lack scoring punch off the  bench, and Brown considers them vulnerable on the boards. Cheeks is playing 35  minutes a night on legs that aren't 25 anymore. At times, Elliott has looked  like the guy whose team got beat, 100-18, and the Spurs don't figure to be at  their peak until he has established himself as a prime-time starter.  </P> <P> Still, the Spurs already are a light-year way away from the days of Anderson  saying, "This isn't a team. This is a soap opera." Winning cures a lot of ills,  including tense player-coach relationships.  </P> <P> "I think what coach Brown and I went through last year gave us an understanding  of each other," Anderson says. "I know now that he says things negative to  motivate you and improve you. I understand him now and our relationship is  better because I know he's trying to help, not bring me down. That's what I  thought last year. I thought I was playing against him and the other team."  </P> <P> Brown knows the feeling. There were times it seemed like he was taking on the  world. The boos still ring in his ears of a 49-year-old man who is perpetually  in between homes.  </P> <P> "I learned about people," Brown says. "I will never take winning for granted. I  appreciate the success that we've had so much more."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 24 (CTK) -- Egyutteles Party  Chairman Miklos Duray said he had discussed the need to solve  the bilateral relations of post-communist countries with the  government but found its attitude to the problem no less  "distressing" than the previous government.    "We will make one last attempt in the framework of the  coalition," Duray said at a press conference today. If they are  unsuccessful the party will probably issue a statement asking  the international community to take account of their requests,  he said. Egyutteles is the largest party in Slovakia,  representing the half a million members of the Hungarian  minority.    In Duray's view, the stability pact, proposed by French  Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur, should also resolve the problems of  minorities. Bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries  should address the problem and legitimate representatives of  minorities should participate in the negotiations, he said. The  status of minorities should be defined in a definitive bilateral  agreement, such as exists between Austria and Italy in the case  of the South Tyrolean minority.    The Hungarian politicians are requesting that Bratislava  grant collective rights to the Hungarian community in Slovakia  but the government refuses, preferring that individual rights be  accorded to them as to all other citizens.    The stability pact envisages the signing of bilateral  agreements between countries, but this aspect has been rejected  by certain politicians in Slovakia and Romania, Duray said.    The pact is an elaboration of the original Balladur plan of  last September, and stems from Western fears that the tragedy of  Yugoslavia may be repeated in other countries of the former  communist bloc. It is designed to prevent international  disputes over national minorities and joint borders. European  countries begin to debate the adoption of the pact in Paris on  Thursday [26 May].</p>

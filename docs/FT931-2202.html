			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Banks may seek customers' consent for credit checks HIGH STREET banks may soon end the 150-year-old custom of disclosing information about customers' accounts without their permission . Confidential proposals drawn up by the British Bankers' Association would end the practice by most banks of automatically providing personal credit references when they receive a 'status inquiry' from another bank acting on behalf of a third party. The custom has been criticised for potentially allowing private detectives and companies to mount 'fishing expeditions' about individuals' accounts. The association is proposing a system under which banks would stop disclosing information to each other. They would instead respond directly to inquiries from individuals or companies about a customer, but only with the customer's written consent. The new arrangement could be launched later this year, if approved by banks on the association governing council. It may lead to an amendment to the banking code of practice, which says only that banks will give details of their status inquiry policy on request. It is common for landlords to make status inquiries about potential tenants to ensure that they can pay rent. Status inquiries are also believed to have been used by private detectives to establish individuals' creditworthiness in cases such as divorce settlements. Although banks traditionally reply to inquiries in coded language, it has been thought possible to obtain a reasonable level of account detail by making a series of inquiries about whether an individual can afford various levels of payment. Barclays and National Westminster are among banks which currently give coded replies to other banks that inquire about their customers' creditworthiness. They do not disclose precise details of accounts, and do not charge the bank making the inquiry. The status inquiry system has become fragmented because both Lloyds and the Co-operative Bank no longer respond to inquiries from other banks. Lloyds will only provide credit references directly to customers, for a Pounds 20 fee. The association, which represents all the large clearing banks, admits in an internal paper that gradual attempts by some banks to change the custom has now led to a 'somewhat mangled system, largely misunderstood by customers'. A change in policy could lead to banks starting to charge customers for providing credit references. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association, said it was concerned that charges could restrict competition among banks. The association's paper says that the new system would be 'customer driven' and would allow banks to respond to 'any and every status inquiry direct so long as the customer concerned has consented and authorised the giving of a reply'.

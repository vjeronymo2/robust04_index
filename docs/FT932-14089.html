			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Waigel calls for EBRD to be more accountable: Attali told of bad image and need for 'good housekeeping' A CALL for greater account-ability and openness in the way decisions are made at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was made yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister. At the same time, Mr Waigel, who is chairman of the EBRD'S board of governors, told Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, he was concerned about criticism directed specifically at its expenditure on new offices in London. 'Mr Waigel stressed his concern about the (press) criticism of the bank and how it was creating a bad image,' a finance ministry official said. 'He also said there was a need for 'good housekeeping'.' Mr Attali faced further criticisms from Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner and an EBRD governor, who said yesterday that reports on EBRD spending decisions were 'embarrassing' and that the Commission was very worried about apparently 'insensitive expenditure'. In London, one of the bank's directors, who represent the countries which own the bank, said Mr Attali had only with great reluctance agreed that the bank's audit committee should conduct a thorough review of the Pounds 55.5m (Dollars 84m) spent on fitting out its new London offices. The review is expected to take less than three months, a director said, and its findings are likely to be published. Last week the directors made three other demands: That the three board committees, covering audit, remuneration and finance, should have more powers to scrutinise bank executives' actions and consideration should be given to setting up a special budget committee; That Mr Pierre Pissaloux, director of the budget, corporate planning and also Mr Attali's chef de cabinet, should give up some responsibilities; That the budget-making process should start earlier in the year. Directors said they were disappointed Mr Attali wanted to negotiate on these points rather than agreeing to them immediately. At the board meeting on Monday, the US director, Mr William Curran, criticised Mr Attali for not apologising for the high spending. He said it was 'the minimum' he would have expected. Mr Christophersen said the question of low disbursements to central and eastern Europe was 'particularly preoccupying'. The EC had 'already taken steps to strengthen the bank's budgetary control processes, to ensure that expenditure will be easier to justify'. The commissioner also told MEPs last night that shareholders should be given more information about the day-to-day running of the bank, and that 'if necessary' they would order an inquiry. However, shareholders would await the management's explanation of the budgetary situation at next week's annual meeting. Mr Waigel's meeting with Mr Attali, which had been planned before last week's revelations about the bank's spending on decorating its London headquarters, was more concerned with the EBRD's record in the former Soviet Union and in eastern European countries. The meeting appeared to have allayed German finance ministry suspicions that the EBRD replicates the World Bank and other international financial institutions, and so is superfluous. 'If you ask me if the bank is necessary now, well, this used to be a hard question to answer,' an official said. 'We have this institution. We should work with the bank. It is useless to say we should abolish it. The key thing is to maximise its efficiency, and make it more flexible.' Although finance ministry officials admitted EBRD disbursements in eastern Europe had been slow, 'the bank should not be criticised for taking too little risk', an official said. 'Being careful about investments is a good thing.' But the official believed the focus could be more on money for small and medium-size enterprises in Russia and east Europe.</p>

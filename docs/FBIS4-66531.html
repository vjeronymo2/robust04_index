			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radhe Shyam Yadav: "Should the Prime Minister Go </F> to America?"]    [Text] We are so accommodating of the United States that  questions about our lack of pride are raised even in U.S. Senate  committees. However, our foreign ministry and the Parliamentary  committees dealing with foreign affairs never pay any heed to  it. Recently, the Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs,  Robin Raphel, was grilled in a U.S. Senate sub-committee as to  why the Clinton Administration has not appointed an ambassador  to India. However, this question was never raised in the Indian  political and administrative circles. The Clinton Administration  has not appointed an ambassador to India after more than one  year in office. Despite this, Our ambassador is also making  plans for Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to the United  States. When all this is happening, the question arises as to  whether India's prime minister should visit that country.    Several important persons, including four former foreign  secretaries, have reacted in support of and in opposition to the  visit. Two of them support an immediate visit by the prime  minister (so that misunderstandings and miscommunications are  removed and an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation is  created). The other side says that it is the United States that  has stained the relations (and is not willing to appoint an  ambassador soon). Why should the Indian prime minister visit the  U.S. before the Clinton administration makes the first move?  This is especially true when the Clinton administration does not  recognize Kashmir's joining India as complete and final and  calls it disputed territory. In such a political climate, Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao's visiting the United States would mean  that India has knelt down to the United States because of its  kind deeds done through the World Bank and India has no  alternative but to play the U.S. game of keeping India and  Pakistan at odds with each other. Is it necessary for India to  inform the United States, the rest of the world, and, most of  all, Pakistan about this submission? If it is not necessary,  then how can the Indian prime minister visit the United States  before a U.S. ambassador is appointed to India? Such a step is  taken only by countries that are economically and politically  slaves.    It is true that the United States has invested more money in  India than any other country and has provided technology to  India in many areas. At the same time, it is also true that it  has been regularly encouraging Pakistan to sink its teeth into  India's heels. The U.S. President's comment on Kashmir in the  United Nations, reference to human rights violations in Punjab  and Kashmir, and U.S. officials' declaring Kashmir a disputed  region are actions which cue the Pakistani government (and its  intelligence agency--Interservices Intelligence) [ISI] and the  terrorists and separatists in Kashmir and Punjab to accelerate  their activities against India. These hints are followed up. The  groups active in this region and Benazir and her government in  Pakistan accelerate their activities against India. Therefore,  the Indian prime minister's visit to the United States in the  midst of the U.S. government's anti-India activities is nothing  but an insult to our country and its people.    There was a time when governments formed by the opposition  parties used to be involved in such actions. When the government  of a coalition of opposition parties was formed, its cabinet  members began to dash to the United States (and then-U.S. friend  China's capital, Beijing). No Congress Party government has  taken a step in the past that embarrassed our nation. We do  remember Indira Gandhi's visit to the United States when she was  allowed to meet with Reagan only after she was checked with a  metal detector for security reasons. (This insult was meted out  perhaps to avenge her for her actions that broke up Pakistan in  1971). However, at that time, Indira Gandhi needed the  President's support because she wanted to borrow money from the  World Bank. However, at this time when India's foreign exchange  reserve is satisfactory and India has also agreed to the Dunkel  proposals, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has no such exigencies  that are forcing him to visit the United States. It is not  appropriate to try to improve relations when the United States  is involved in damaging Indo-United States relations by putting  on different kinds of pressures.    In addition, this tension in the relationship did not occur  suddenly. The U.S. government has been creating this tension  methodically. Its goals are to have India sign the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty] after it has agreed to the Dunkel  proposals, and to stop it from having better relations with  China and Iran. The United States does tolerate India's  relations with Russia to a level where it is in a position to  help India make progress in science and technology. For example,  the United States is not only worried but also alarmed by  India's progress in its space program, energy projects, defense  implements such as rockets, tanks, radars, fighter planes, and  naval vessels. Additionally, if India is able to make economic  progress independently, the United States will not be able to  control its huge market. Therefore, it is important for the  United States to control India's scientific progress and  economic development through the World Bank. When this plan is  transparent, is it appropriate for the U.S. government to hint  to India that it show its willingness to make this plan  successful?</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Tories' real conflict comes to the surface: Kevin Brown previews elections for the influential 1922 Committee Deep in the bowels of Westminster a guerrilla war is raging. The outcome will show how far the Conservative party has recovered from the deep divisions of the Maastricht debate. Some Tory MPs say it could even determine the future of Mr John Major's government. The conflict has little to do with the legislative programme announced in last week's Queen's Speech, or the debate over the contents of next week's Budget. It does not even involve opposition MPs. It is far more important than that. The battleground is the annual elections, due tomorrow, for the executive of the 1992 Committee, the backbench organisation which represents all Conservative MPs who have failed to find, or have lost, a place in the government. The battle lines are clear cut. On the right stands the Thatcherite 92 group led by Sir George Gardiner, which provides a ideological home for the party's Euro-sceptics, hardline free marketeers and social conservatives. On the left stands the newly formed Mainstream Group led by Mr Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 Committee, which comprises a mixture of social liberals, economic interventionists and enthusiasts for the European Union. Mainstream regards itself as a 'loyalist' group, seeking to ease pressure on the prime minister from the sometimes caustic 92 Group. Its guns are trained on five main targets: Sir George, Mr John Townend (Bridlington), Mr James Pawsey (Rugby), Mr Ivan Lawrence (Burton) and Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent North). A leading leftwinger said: 'The stakes are very high. This election is symbolic of far greater things than just a few backbench committee positions. What this is about is setting the stage for John Major to start showing some leadership.' Traditionally, the 18-strong executive of the committee has sought to act as a conduit to Downing Street for the views of both wings of the parliamentary party. But the traditional role required a fragile balance between left and right. The balance started to break down in 1989, when Sir Anthony Meyer, the leftwing MP Clwyd North West, stood against Mrs Margaret Thatcher for the leadership of the party. Sir Anthony lost heavily. But the election precipitated a more serious challenge a year later from Mr Michael Heseltine, another leftwinger, which led to Mrs Thatcher's replacement by Mr Major. The right, which dominated the party throughout the 1980s, extracted its revenge in last year's elections for the 1922 Committee executive, when candidates backed by the 92 Group swept the board. But leftwingers are crying foul. They say the right cheated by enlisting the support of Conservative candidates in winnable seats before the 1992 general election. When the newly elected freshmen arrived, most of them duly backed the rightwing slate. The left says the right has misrepresented the balance of opinion in the parliamentary party, and added weight to its own minority views. A leftwing activist said: 'Many of them have misused their positions to cause trouble for the government over Maastricht, and to wield undue influence on issues like the content of the Budget.' This year the left is better organised. The long-standing Lollard group (named, like the 92 Group, after the address where its first meeting was held) has joined hands with the pro-Brussels Positive Europe group to field a single Mainstream slate. On paper the Mainstream group has about 100 votes, compared with about 90 for the 92 Group. But protagonists on both sides say that it will not be as simple as that. Observers say the ideologically-focused 92 Group can probably rely on most of its members to follow voting instructions. But the less cohesive Mainstream group has found it difficult even to produce an agreed slate. In addition, a small number of MPs who attended Mainstream's inaugural dinner a couple of weeks ago have shown signs of drifting back to the rightwing camp. On the other hand, Mainstream can count on the votes of many of the 60 or so parliamentary private secretaries - unpaid assistants to ministers - who are entitled to vote. Ministers deny rightwing claims that Downing Street has organised a discreet campaign to corral the PPS vote. But there is little doubt that most of the PPSs will vote for candidates loyal to the government. A victory for the Mainstream group would be a significant boost for Mr Major. But it might not end the simmering Tory civil war. A backbencher said: 'We have never been more divided in our history than we are at the moment. We are trying desperately to get over it. But if the right loses and turns into a sort of detached rump, they will not only split the party, they will destroy it.'</p>

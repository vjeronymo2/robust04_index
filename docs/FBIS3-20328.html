			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann at the </F> "Bundeswehr and Society" forum held by WELT AM SONNTAG in Berlin  on 22 March: "The Bundeswehr Is Undergoing a Change Equal to a  New Beginning"]    [Text] Germany is no longer a frontline country and no  longer lies within the scope of plans by an enemy capable of  staging an invasion. Therefore our country is no longer a  battle zone. It is now a communications zone, insofar as  conflicts can be prevented or offset.    This is an opportunity that we have never before had in our  history. Taking advantage of this opportunity is a challenge  for German politics. German politics requires armed forces as a  means of implementing a policy that prevents conflicts. The  shape of the armed forces must correspond to this changed  situation.    To this end, one must consider what constants and what  variables determine the development of the armed forces, so that  we may reach planning decisions accordingly.    The following factors have medium-term and long-term  validity:    -- The need to be able to defend German territory remains  valid. This is the primary task for all sectors of the armed  forces. In the future, however, this task can only be  accomplished following mobilization, and only together with the  alliance partners.    When one considers the armed forces of Europe in relation to  the defense capability of each of them, one concludes that the  only serious land-based threat to Germany is Russia.  Theoretically, any country not allied to us could pose an  aerial threat if it possesses nuclear, biological, or chemical  weapons of sufficient range. A serious maritime threat to  Germany could only occur if all maritime links were broken off.  But this is pure theory, because such a measure would also  affect our NATO partners, and as far as one can judge there is  no force on earth that could defeat, now or in the future, a  NATO sea-based military operation.    To defend itself, Germany requires the following:    -- The ability to reconnoiter in good time any developments  that could develop into a crisis;    -- Land forces that, following a period of mobilization and  military preparations, are fully capable, in cooperation with  our alliance partners, of defending Germany against a potential  danger from the East;    -- Air forces capable of surveilling German air space in  peacetime, and defending this air space in a time of war or  crisis, following mobilization, and in cooperation with the  alliance partners.    -- Naval forces that, acting in cooperation with the  alliance  partners, can keep sea lanes open and prevent landings on the  German coast.    These are our defense measures against a situation that our  politics must be aimed at preventing. This defense capability  has a preventive effect. But conflicts can really only be  offset when one conducts negotiations at an early stage and thus  prevents the conflicts from developing further. Therefore,  participation in alliance activity, especially in the  containment of crises and prevention of conflicts, remains a  constant for us. For this purpose, Germany needs army, air  force, and naval units that can be rapidly mobilized and  deployed, and can maintain their positions. These units are to  be deployed in such a way that our country can meet its  obligations vis-a-vis NATO and the WEU [Western European Union]  and exercise its full responsibility as a UN member.    Finally, the supply of modern, high-quality equipment to our  troops is also a constant, for technological developments in the  sphere of armaments are continuing, albeit at a somewhat slower  pace. However, hopes that reduced quantities of high-quality  military equipment would be sufficient for today's times have  turned out to be somewhat naive.    Here are some of the variable factors. The development of  the situation in and around Europe can no longer be accurately  predicted, unlike during the era of confrontation. But for the  foreseeable future, it must be assumed that:    -- An offensive by the strongest military power in Europe,  the 1.5-2 million-strong Russian Army, would be possible only if  there were a complete change in Russian politics, and there is  no sign of such a change. But even in such a case, an offensive  could not take place without extensive prior preparations,  including at least a partial mobilization. Therefore, for the  time being, one can expect advance warning of such a danger of  at least 12 months. But we would only have a fraction of this  time to prepare ourselves militarily.    -- Europe must be prepared for the new risks and dangers. On  the one hand, these risks can be explained by the fact that a  new order has arisen following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  But on the other hand, they can be attributed to the  innumerable unsolved national and ethnic disputes in Europe;    -- Our principle of security policy, defense measures, and  armed forces activity will no longer be geared to just alliance  commitments. Henceforth they will be determined by a mixture of  our national security interest in offsetting conflicts together  with our partners and our international commitments.    Guaranteeing security in Europe is no longer sufficient. It  is necessary to achieve security for Europe. Therefore, when  assessing the situation, we must consider the problems that are  spreading to Europe from the highly unstable peripheral areas of  Africa and Asia. It is necessary to eliminate the causes of  conflicts in security policy.    For this purpose one requires armed forces that can be set  in  motion without a long period of preparation, and that can be  used in various ways, from humanitarian missions to fighting  operations.    Our alliance commitments are as variable as the development  of risks and the effects thereof on the shape of the armed  forces. The basic commitment of contributing to collective  defense remains unaltered, but the German contribution no longer  consists of merely defending Central Europe.    The Bundeswehr's "new" set of tasks is as follows: This  fundamentally revised political framework shows the extent of  Germany's increased international responsibility. It also  indicates the need for a conceptual orientation of the  Bundeswehr that acknowledges the fact that support for and  participation in international moves to contain and prevent  conflicts and crises is a task equal to the primary function of  collective defense.    This means having to maintain three categories of tasks for  the armed forces, while adhering strictly to the principle that  only the three categories together make up the Bundeswehr, and  no category can exist without the other.    The first category of tasks serves a protective purpose. It  involves being at the disposal of NATO allies beyond German  territory, and includes crisis management within the NATO  framework. This is how we interpret the defense of Germany  within the NATO alliance, whereby the defense of NATO territory  is placed on a par with that of Germany.    As part of the second category of tasks, the German armed  forces must be in a position to contribute to the international  prevention of conflicts and crises.    The third category of tasks involves Bundeswehr  participation  in humanitarian and special missions, as well as preliminary  training, and logistical and medical work.    With this broad spectrum of tasks, the point is no longer to  marshal the armed forces in the face of a broad-scale  aggression, as was the case during the period of East-West  confrontation. We will continue to be an army of unity, but we  shall dispense with the idea of being a unified army, for we all  know that the Bundeswehr was never unified in the past, and was  unable to perform all its tasks independently. What is  manifesting itself today is a "Bundeswehr of variety" not  because of resources, but because of the altered political  situation.    Concerning the restructuring of our armed forces: Generally,  the point is to gear the Bundeswehr more strongly than before to  the two large but different tasks; a defense of the alliance on  the one hand, and the containment of crises of the other. This  will not lead to a separation, for military personnel must be  interchangeable between each set of tasks.    In the defense of the alliance, the hitherto broad-scale and  rather static principle of frontal defense must make way for the  principle of a flexible counter-concentration of forces. This  requires even greater cooperation between the air, sea, and land  forces, as well as mobility and flexible military structures.  But the troops must be geared to a single form of operations,  and they must achieve full operational ability only after an  extensive period of training.    In crises and conflict prevention, however, NATO-wide means  of action will be implemented in the form of army, navy, and air  force contingents that can be mobilized quickly and deployed  rapidly and at great distances. In the sphere of planning, the  fulcrum of our activity lies in the following fields:  leadership, electronic command systems, wide-scale  reconnaissance, helicopters, long-range artillery, air defense,  air transport, first aid, and logistics.    Our experiences from earlier operations are to be taken onto  consideration. The following can be said:    In the army, it is expedient to adhere to a balanced  combination of mechanized, light, airborne, and air-mechanized  forces, in other words, forces that are capable of providing  fighting power for the air, coupled with ground support,  logistics, and first aid. However, one must consider how to  reconcile the considerable differences between NATO defense and  crisis prevention in terms of structure, equipment, training,  and logistics. This reconciliation cannot take place without  changes to the infrastructure.    The air force is faced mainly with the duties of air  defense,  precision weapons, and air transport, whereby it also has to  face adaptation and modernization.    The navy's main task will be to contribute to anticrisis  operations without any geographic or time limitations. It will  deliver supplies to personnel serving in destroyers and frigates  distant from our shores. In addition, one must examine whether  the navy can supply platforms serving as command, supply, and  first aid bases for combat units.    For the air industry, this involves even greater  international cooperation, and at the same time a greater  concentration on national production capacity of the following,  which we need on account of defense capability: armored  fighting vehicles, conventional submarines, sensor and  transponder technology, aviation, and information technology.    Concerning training in the Bundeswehr: Not only is training  and equipment undergoing changes on account of the broader  spectrum of tasks and operations for our Bundeswehr, but  training also requires changes, something I have been  emphasizing ever since I took office.    Until now, the entire Bundeswehr has been geared to the  task of deploying troops for defense purposes after a relatively  brief period of preparation and, at the same time, commencing  general mobilization. We must abandon this uniformity as well,  as a result of the altered situation, in order to save money for  investments.    Training for national defense requires the adoption of a  priority method of operation, in other words defense in a  predetermined geographical area, under operational conditions  that have largely been determined beforehand. This requires a  period of intensive training of at least one month in advance of  deployment, following partial mobilization.    The training of units to counteract crises must be shaped in  such a way that efficient units can quickly be formed out of  larger closed units and quickly be sent to their area of  operations. The training must involve all types of combat and  all operational scenarios, cannot take just one area of  operations into consideration, and must take into account the  fact that there must be a fluid transition between all types of  operations, whether humanitarian missions or peacekeeping  operations according to Chapter VII of the Basic Law, and that  any operation can develop into a combat one.    There is good progress in facing up to the new spectrum of  tasks. Motivation and dedication have risen in an impressive  manner, and there is a broad-scale readiness to go into action  even at great risk and at the expense of personal comfort,  something one does not encounter too often in our country.    But, on the other hand, military service has a bad  reputation, and our society views soldiers as compelled to play  a special part in the alliance. There is a lack of consensus in  our country about the deployment and future role of the  Bundeswehr.    I am no longer capable of explaining to one of our marines  in  the Adriatic why a German ship or aircraft cannot enter Albanian  waters or air space, even though Albania has permitted NATO to  use its territorial areas to enforce the embargo against  Yugoslavia. As a German, I also feel embarrassed when I imagine  a situation where an aircraft flying over the Adriatic receives  a radioed order to identify a ship in Albanian waters, followed  by the sentence: You are a German aircraft, are you not?    These are the expectations vis-a-vis society: A readiness to  accept duties. Military service means a readiness to accept  duties and risk one's life in discharging them.    If we succeed in achieving a broad social consensus on this  matter, then it will be easy to hold a debate about the  Bundeswehr, its tasks, and its operations.    Soldiers require support. We require a broad social  consensus about the role of the Bundeswehr. The population must  stand by the side of its soldiers and their families whenever  they have to enter combat operations as a result of a political  decision.    The implementation of German unity must be the unequivocal  priority of our country. It is also unequivocal among our  soldiers.    Nevertheless, reliable long-term financial planning for the  Bundeswehr contributes to the credibility of our security and  NATO policy.    Just like the rest of society, our Bundeswehr is in the  throes of a profound transformation. The armed forces are  undergoing a change that is equal to a new beginning.</p>

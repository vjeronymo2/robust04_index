			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (1): A daunting task ahead - Angola could play a key part in the development of the southern African region, given peace and the right policies. But the task of rehabilitating an economy shattered by war is enormous, while political divisions may prevent post-election co-operation needed for Angola's recovery AFTER three decades of conflict, Angola has embarked on a revolution which could at long last realise the potential of the most richly endowed country in Africa. Marxism has been replaced by a market economy, one-party rule has given way to multi-party elections scheduled for late September, and two exhausted rival armies have begun to demobilise, paving the way for a single, integrated national defence force. Unlike many of the African states hit by man-made or natural disasters, Angola can generate, or attract, much of the capital its recovery requires; or as much as its weak administration can efficiently use. Oil production exceeds 500,000 barrels per day and is rising. Its diamond wealth is already being exploited, other mineral and marine resources are barely tapped, there is plentiful fertile land and a relatively small population - 10m people in a country five times the size of Britain. Given peace and appropriate policies, Angola could play a key part in the development of the southern African region. That said, the scale of the task is nevertheless daunting. Most assessments of African countries which stress potential have to acknowledge a backdrop of disaster. Angola is no exception. Thirty years of conflict, exacerbated by economic mismanagement by an autocratic, avowedly Marxist MPLA government, has left the people exhausted. Drought has compounded their misery and at least a million Angolans urgently need food aid. Much of the infrastructure is ruined or in disrepair, including the 1,300km Benguela railway. The exodus of some 350,000 Angolans of Portuguese origin during the chaotic run up to independence in November 1975 was a trauma from which the country has still to recover. Angola was deprived of the bulk of its skilled personnel - an indictment in itself of Portugal's colonial legacy. From the elegant office blocks along Luanda's palm-fringed marginale to factories in Benguela, from grand plantations on the fertile plateau to the network of rural stores, nearly all were abandoned. Today Angola's cities and towns show some signs of recovery: restaurants and bars reopening, a few buildings being renovated. But, overall, Angola seems a vast African version of a Potemkin village, the eye deceived and reality kept at bay until the observer gets closer. From a distance, the leafy streets, with their traditional red-tiled houses, and elegant shop fronts seem to have survived the ordeal. But the houses and flats are often without services, display cases are usually empty, and urchins scrabble through the rubbish. These are the comparatively fortunate towns. In the south, where fighting was heaviest, some centres are little more than rubble. It is all part of the incalculable cost of three wars: the struggle for independence and a civil war which grew into a battle between proxies of the super-powers, with invading South African forces supporting Mr Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement and 50,000 Cuban soldiers reinforcing the MPLA government army. Directly or indirectly, the conflict is reckoned to have accounted for hundreds of thousands of Angolan lives. Many fled the countryside to the relative sanctuary of the towns and cities where the densely-packed shanties are as impoverished as any in Africa. Their flight was a further blow to the agriculture sector, already hard hit by the loss of nearly all of the large-scale commercial farmers. From being the world's fourth-largest coffee producer, output plummetted from some 210,000 tonnes in 1973 to a few thousand tonnes. Once self-sufficient, Angola soon had to import food. Today Angola is virtually a mono-economy, dependent on a quasi autonomous off-shore oil enclave for more than 90 per cent of its export earnings. The country's unofficial market, whether in goods or hard currency, dominates an economy in which corruption is widespread. To outsiders at least, a post-election coalition seems essential if Angola is to recover from this tragedy. The task of rehabilitating a shattered economy is enormous, and skilled personnel are at a premium. Yet officials from both main parties appear to rule it out, and the score or more of smaller parties are expected to make little impact in the poll. Opposition to the concept stems not from fear of alienating hard-line supporters, but out of an antipathy hardened by the war, and reflecting ethnic rivalries: Unita draws considerable support from the Ovimbundu, who make up an estimated 35-40 per cent of Angola's population, while the MPLA gets strong backing from the Mbundu, about a quarter of the population. This antipathy is one of the factors that makes many observers uneasy about Angola's chances of clearing the first hurdle on the path to recovery: completion of the transition programme. Some of the concern stems from the belief that Angola has bitten off more than it can chew. Preparations for the elections on September 29-30 are running behind schedule: the director-general of elections has yet to be appointed, for example, while voter registration will not start before late May. In a country with a derelict infrastructure, a ineffectual civil service and a far-flung electorate, this may be too late. The demobilisation process is also in jeopardy. Not only is it making painfully slow progress, but it seems probable that arms are being stockpiled by both sides in secret caches before soldiers enter the assembly camps. It is now accepted that demobilisation will not be complete by the end of September. The new integrated national army is unlikely to be adequately trained or at full strength. The prospect of Angola going to the polls under these circumstances is potentially disastrous. It also seems clear that the UN team, due to total 450 soldiers and policemen and 400 observers, operating on a budget of about Dollars 100m, is understaffed and under-funded. The contrast with the resources available for the UN role in Namibia's transition to independence is striking. UN officials point out that their duties in Namibia included the organisation of the poll: in Angola this is supposed to be the government responsibility. But it took a 6,500-strong force and a budget of more than Dollars 450m to ensure fair elections in Namibia, with a population of one-tenth Angola's, an excellent transport network and working telephones. As the election date draws closer, tensions seem to be growing between the country's two key politicians and the parties they lead: President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of the ruling MPLA party, and Mr Savimbi's Unita guerrilla movement. Driven more by the imperatives of a new world order than inspired by a spirit of compromise, the two men last May signed an agreement to end the civil war which began in 1975, but soon took on a new dimension as super power rivalries helped bring South Africa and Cuba troops into the arena. Inter-party enmity remains not far below the surface. At Huambo, in central Angola, a major in the United Nations contingent monitoring Angola's peace process, shakes his head in dismay over the rivalry between government and Unita forces: 'They cannot even agree on an agenda at their meetings'. For many, such tension raises the fear that Angola is set to repeat the disaster of 1975. Outbreaks of fighting, initially between the MPLA and Mr Holden Roberto's FNLA, were followed by clashes between the MPLA and Unita. The pre-independence interim administration, established after the coup in Portugal led to Lisbon's surrender of its African colonies, collapsed. By the time the late Dr Agostino Neto, the MPLA's founding president, proclaimed independence on November 11 1975, the schism in Angolan politics had become unbridgeable. Some Angolan politicians discount the fears. 'The world is a different place today,' argues a senior Unita official. 'We can no longer turn to Pretoria or Washington; the MPLA has lost Moscow, the Cubans won't come back. . . and we both know that if we break the (transition) agreement Angola won't get foreign aid.' This is almost certainly true. But Angola's off-shore oil wealth may be temptation enough should democracy not have taken root by September.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Arts: The elite of the art world is still blinded by ideas - William Packer sorts out the good from the bad and the over-esteemed in a difficult year for painting and sculpture Horrible as it has undoubtedly been in so many other ways, 1992 has not been as bad as it might have been for fine art. There have been difficulties and a few galleries have closed, but reports of the death of Cork Street, that serves so conveniently as the image of London's contemporary art market, have been much exaggerated. One or two have changed hands and names, and a brave new art-bookshop has lately opened, but only one gallery space remains empty, where John Kasmin had stood for so long under the Knoedler banner, and, last summer, made so much noise at his going. The lesson is that confidence built up over decades may be talked away in a few days. If Cork Street stands for anything, it is surely less for the more outre and challenging expressions of current avant-garde activity than for the solid professionalism of the more established dealers. Such galleries as the Mercury, the Piccadilly, the Redfern and Browse &amp; Darby are all in Cork Street, and have been there since long before the present storm blew up. They may not be doing so very well during this recession, but they are well run, founded on good stock, and they are surviving. Dealing in contemporary art, they are yet hardly likely to supply a winner of the Turner Prize. If there are villains to be discovered in the present crisis, they must be the banks which, in the heady days of the late 1980s, threw money into yet another market they evidently did not understand, but when they came under pressure, drew back as fast as they had earlier gone in. David Messum and Nigel Greenwood were respected galleries, dealing seriously and sensibly in their different fields and not, it seemed, in terminal crisis. Fischer, faced with terms which it could not accept for a renewed lease, chose rather to close the gallery and deal privately. These are sad losses. The art world's crisis, if crisis it is, has not been altogether of its own making. But the art market perhaps needed to be chastened. Some higher-flying dealers are still apt to be influenced by uncritically by an international market reputation rather than real quality. Thus to be forced down to earth with a few singed wings is no bad thing. Where have Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Baselitz, Clemente, been this year? Ou sont les neiges d'antin? A thoroughly pretentious show of Anselm Kiefier, at d'Offay in midsummer, suggested he too is much over-rated. By far the worst show of the year for me was the Tate gallery's retrospective of the work of Richard Hamilton, who is to be our standard-bearer and sole occupant of the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale next summer. In his work, he, more than anyone, stands for the propensity of our art-administrative elite for choosing unfailingly that which is supposedly about ideas, rather than the well-drawn, well-painted, well-made; art which is intuitive in its expression and beautiful in itself. The Turner Prize, too, was as depressing an affair as ever, more so perhaps for the clear evidence that all criticism visited upon it in previous years had been disregarded. And the Damien Hurst band-waggon rolls on, he of the fish in formaldehyde, his shark at Saatchi's a window-dresser's coup de theatre presented as somehow the creative equivalent of Picasso's 'Demoiselles', or 'The Night Watch', or 'The Last Judgement'. I started by saying this this had not been a bad year. Oh dear. But the good things have been very good. For sculpture the high spots were Anthony Caro spectacularly installed in the Trajan Markets at Rome, and the most beautiful Henry Moore exhibition to date, in the gardens of the Bagatelle in Paris. At home, Phillip King at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, and the Peter Randall-Page touring show, which I saw at the Arnolfini in Bristol, were memorable, with the Eduardo Chillida show at Annely Juda a wonderful autumn bonus. Painting began well with Alan Davie at Glasgow in January, and ends no less so with Paula Rego at the Marlborough; the grossly under-recognised veteran, Norman Blamey, at the Fine Art Society; Patrick Caulfield at the Serpentine; Munch magnificent at the National Gallery and Sickert in splendid pomp at the Academy. In between we have had Allan Ramsay at Edinburgh and the National Portrait Gallery, Otto Dix at the Tate, Juan Gris at Whitechapel, Magritte at the Hayward, Sisley at the Academy, Boudin at the Burrell in Glasgow, and the great Rembrandt exhibition to end its European tour at the National Gallery and the British Museum. We have had Swagger Portraits, Alfred Wallis, John Wonnacott, Bridget Riley, Wyndham Lewis. Abroad there was Leonardo in Venice and Braque at Martigny. For me the most delightful exhibition was the comparatively modest study at Brighton of Dieppe in its relation to British painters in the modern period. My greatest disappointment was to miss the extraordinary Matisse exhibition in New York: my greatest treat and exhibition of the year, the still-lifes of Picasso, in Paris at the Grand Palais. No, it has not been a bad year.</p>

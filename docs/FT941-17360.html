			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / CBI and EEF halt merger move The Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation have dropped a controversial plan to merge their central activities, but are to continue talking about co-operation. The plan, which has been under discussion since the summer, would have created the UK's largest single lobbying voice for manufacturing industry. But it has fallen victim to opposition from the EEF's 14 powerful regional associations. Mr Nick de Jongh, the federation's director of external affairs, confirmed yesterday that a merger of the two organisations' central functions was now 'off the agenda'. But over the next few months the CBI and EEF will hold talks to identify precise areas where they could work together to industry's advantage. The CBI said: 'The talks are still continuing and we still expect some sort of proposals to be formally put to the councils of both bodies in due course. Until then, there is nothing further to add.' Cancellation of the plan for a merger of the central parts of the two organisations will come as a relief to staff at the much smaller EEF. But it is likely to disappoint big companies, which would have had one fewer organisation to join. As a federation, the EEF could not have approved a merger without backing from its regional associations, which provide a range of services to 5,000 member companies based on policies produced centrally. Although the associations would have retained their identity, Mr de Jongh said they were worried that policy might no longer be 'tailor-made' for the engineering industry if the central functions of the EEF were subsumed into the CBI or its National Manufacturing Council. Both organisations had been hoping that a tie-up would enable them to lobby more effectively and efficiently for industry. But Mr de Jongh said this was still possible, as the EEF would be put on its mettle to identify when it should work together with the CBI and when separately. Some EEF functions could still be combined with counterparts at the CBI, he said. 'But any change is likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Our members did not want a 'big bang'.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Out of Control"] </F>   [Text] Learning of the existence of a Red Command barricade  right in the middle of Tijuca Forest, Minister of the  Environment Rubens Ricupero put his finger on one of the most  serious problems in Rio today. A tree trunk lying on the ground  near the Borel hillside marks the point beyond which no one can  enter. This is how a physical assault on the city--i.e., its  division into two parts, one of them controlled by criminals--is  sanctioned.    For some time now, the Red Command has been establishing  outposts in the forest reserves. After clearing trees from  different areas, the bandits can control the entrances to the  shantytowns [favelas] by installing observation posts  in the trees. The clearings also serve as miniature  concentration camps where enemies can be tortured and executed.  A few months ago, the police broke up an encampment in Tijuca  Forest where traffickers from the Andarai, Divineia, and Casa  Branca hills used to meet to outline plans for distributing  drugs. But when the police leave, the traffickers return.    By demarcating autonomous territories, preferably inside the  favelas, and setting parameters for behavior, the  outlaws have challenged this society directly. The authorities  must not continue to stand idly by while shantytowns spread out  in all directions and the traffickers and numbers-game tycoons  set up shop there, creating parallel societies that are out of  control. In the no-mans-land of a favela, the rights  of other citizens who pay taxes and submit to social and  economic rules are being violated. With the dizzying growth of  the favelas, everything escapes the control of the  authorities--from melees in broad daylight to the nightly "funk"  [preceding word in English] dances, interspersed with the  bloodbaths of gang warfare. The Red Command and its explosive  offspring, the Third Command, can exist and prosper only with  the collusion of the police, who allow themselves to be  corrupted and even blend in with them on their extermination  missions.    The gangs live outside the law because the law exists not to  be enforced. Day after day, the outlaws advance in a sort of  organized looting of the wealth of the State astride the  favelas, under the eyes of compliant policemen. A survey done by  IPLAN [Planning Institute] in 1991 listed 545 favelas  in Rio, but now there are many more, because IPLAN's criteria  excluded the minifavelas (not that "mini" after all) under the  overpasses and the illegal and clandestine housing developments.  There are also favelas that are extensions of others  but have grown so big that their communities have started  organizing themselves separately.    Favelas have existed in Rio for 101 years, but  this does not mean they have to be considered as inevitable and  eternal. Now they house the underground third of the city's  population. They began modestly when the soldiers who had fought  at Canudos came to the capital city to ask for government help  and camped on Providencia Hill near the military headquarters.  As promises remained unkept, the soldiers started building  shacks. The hill came to be called "Favela Hill" (later changed  to Providencia) because the hills that surrounded Canudos had  been covered with a typically northeastern plant known as  "favela."    A century later, the scenario is much worse. With hegemony  between the Red Command and the Third Command at stake, the  radius of criminal activities has expanded in the direction of  new paiois [strongholds]. The narcotics traffic has  now taken over Niteroi, Sao Goncalo, and a large part of the  Western Zone, besides the hills and smaller housing projects  downtown, in the South and North Zones, and particularly in the  wooded areas where the military-style camps that shocked the  environment minister are set up. Even the smaller hillsides have  at least 15 AR-15 rifles apiece, not to mention 12-caliber  shotguns, automatic pistols, and grenades. Most of the weapons  in the hands of the traffickers arrive by sea. More than  two-thirds of the ships that bring weapons to Rio fly the  Liberian flag. Guns manufactured in different countries arrive  via Africa, while drugs move in the opposite direction.    The Red Command controls 80 percent of the narcotics traffic  in Rio, but the Third Command, although it has only the other 20  percent, controls strategic hillsides that are coveted by the  Red Command. The shootouts, killings, and corruption--all this  characterizes an intolerable situation. The violence is  insupportable, society cannot withstand such a deterioration in  its standards of respectability, but what is worse is the  lenience exhibited by the authorities while traffickers based in  the favelas continue to reap profits of $100 million  every year with impunity--a sum they split fraternally with the  rotten portions of the police force and the political structure.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT on building societies IS IT possible to establish a capital gains loss in a building society account? Does this apply to share and deposit accounts? Does the account have to close for this purpose? We take it that your first question does not relate to share accounts passing on death etc. That being so, the answer is no - except where the share account was opened before March 1982 and a universal rebasing election has been made (under section 96(5) of the Finance Act 1988). If this is so and you wish to make a rebasing election (if the time limit has not yet expired), ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14. Only share accounts are within the scope of CGT (as they have been since CGT was introduced, on April 7 1965). Deposit accounts are excluded by section 134(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, in conjunction with section 29(2) of that Act, (as they have been since 1965). The account would not have to close for this purpose. Remember, indexation of share accounts (which was introduced on April 6, 1982, and extended to losses on April 6, 1985) was withdrawn by the Finance Act 1988 retrospectively from July 4, 1987. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

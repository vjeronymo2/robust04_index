			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> IRVINE'S HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE;  </P> <P> NO: LAW WOULD BE A SETBACK -- NO ONE'S RIGHTS ARE SECURE UNLESS EVERYONE'S  RIGHTS ARE SECURE.  </P> <P> What's happening in Irvine? Apparently a host of accomplishments. Business  leaders rank Irvine as No. 1. Irvine's schools are judged best in the county  and nation, and UCI boasts prestigious scholars and growing research  endowments.  </P> <P> In addition, Irvine's city government is being acclaimed statewide and  nationwide for its model programs in child care, recycling, open-space  preservation, protection of the ozone layer, and for its public/private  partnerships in building a theater, creating a new transportation authority,  and establishing international trade opportunities and exchanges. And, of  special importance to me, Irvine is applauded for its comprehensive human  rights ordinance.  </P> <P> Thousands of us choose to live in Irvine because of these exemplary programs  and innovations. We know our city is a special place because we've worked and  learned and legislated to make it so. I'm proud of all that Irvine is and of  the diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-religious gathering of citizens who call  Irvine home.  </P> <P> Because of this pride in what Irvine is and who we are, I am disturbed by the  small group of misguided neighbors who have placed an initiative on our  November ballot -- known as Measure N -- that seeks to legalize discrimination  and destroy the human rights advances we've worked so hard to secure.  </P> <P> The Human Rights Ordinance is very simple and easy to understand. It outlaws  discrimination based on "race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age,  sexual orientation, marital status and physical handicap" in the business of  housing, employment and commercial transactions. Churches, small businesses and  homeowners who rent rooms are granted exemption.  </P> <P> The ordinance is a simple and beautiful statement of the right of all persons  to be free from discrimination. In addition, it tells all citizens that they  are needed and welcomed and are encouraged to participate in the life of the  city. It is supported by both the previous and current City Council members, by  ministers, rabbis, congregational leaders, community volunteers, our  award-winning teachers of the year, and by civic, cultural, educational and  business people who are the builders and keepers of the Irvine dream.  </P> <P> The ordinance bestows no special rights on anyone, only the right to be free  from discrimination. Let me state emphatically that this human rights ordinance  is not about gay pride festivals, homosexual hiring quotas or imposing a San  Francisco gay culture on Irvine. It is not about AIDS or any other sexual or  health issue, or about promoting gay role models for our children. The Irvine  Human Rights Ordinance does not apply to schools, since they already follow  state education codes regarding non-discrimination.  </P> <P> Quite simply, this election is about keeping Irvine's year-old human rights  ordinance in place. Proponents of Measure N seek to destroy the ordinance by  legalizing discrimination against one specific group of people -- gays and  lesbians.  </P> <P> A yes vote on Measure N means that gays and lesbians will be singled out for  discrimination in jobs and housing. We can't permit this to happen. We can't  permit discrimination that denies our neighbors their right to a job or to keep  a roof over their heads.  </P> <P> If we allow certain fear-mongers to pick and choose who belongs in Irvine,  where does their discrimination stop? What about Latinos, Japanese, blacks,  Jews, Koreans or unmarried couples living together? We must not surrender to a  campaign of rejection and intolerance. As we have learned in Nazi Germany,  South Africa and China, no one's rights are secure unless everyone's rights are  secure.  </P> <P> Sponsors of Measure N contend that the City Council has a "homosexual agenda."  There is absolutely no truth in that charge. The Irvine City Council has no  racial agenda, or homosexual agenda, or religious agenda. In fact, the agenda  before the City Council is non-ideological and plain for all to see. We seek to  maintain the current high level of services and programs, providing for  expected growth while meeting our need for roads, open space, cultural  activities and human services. The goal of the City Council is a city of  inclusion, not exclusion; a city free from discrimination for all who live or  work in Irvine.  </P> <P> As American citizens, we can't permit a few misguided extremists to turn back  the clock on human rights. We must continue to reaffirm our heritage of  democratic inclusiveness, building an even better community.  </P> <P> I've found that my religious beliefs and commitment to democratic principles  influence the actions I take as a public official. Accordingly, I have joined  with Irvine Citizens United Against Discrimination to work for the defeat of  Measure N. I encourage my friends and neighbors -- builders and keepers of the  Irvine dream -- to join me on Nov. 7 in voting no on Measure N.  </P></p>

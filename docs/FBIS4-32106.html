			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Petrovac, June (TANJUG)--Heavy fighting between  forces loyal to Bosnia's Moslem fundamentalist leader Alija  Izetbegovic and those of the Autonomous Province of Western  Bosnia (APZB) continued Monday in the Moslem enclave of Cazin  Krajina in Western Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The radio station in Velika Kladusa, the APZB centre, said  Izetbegovic's forces had attempted to infiltrate a terrorist  group and had opened artillery and small arms fire on APZB  troops.    Bihac radio, controlled by Izetbegovic's forces, said the  forces of the Sarajevo Moslem government firmly controlled all  their positions despite continuing attacks by the APZB army.    APZB leader Fikret Abdic is opposed to Izetbegovic's policy  of war and wants Moslems, Serbs and Croats to live peacefully  side by side. Immediately after the proclamation of the APZB in  autumn last year, Izetbegovic's troops attacked the forces and  population of the new autonomy. The conflicts, which have so  far claimed hundreds of lives, did not stop after the latest  Bosnia ceasefire came into effect on June 10.</p>

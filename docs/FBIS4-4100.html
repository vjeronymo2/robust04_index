			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Hong (1776 3126) and Wang Huicun (3769 1920 </F> 1317): "Wu Yi Expresses Appreciation for the Efforts Made by the  Hong Kong Authorities and Businessmen To Lobby for China's  Most-Favored-Nation Status"]    [Text] Macao, 27 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yi, Minister  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said here that she  would like to express appreciation for the efforts made by the  British Hong Kong Authorities and many personalities from Hong  Kong's industrial and commercial circles to lobby for China's  most-favored- nation (MFN) status in the United States.    Wu Yi said that MFN was the foundation for developing trade  and economic cooperation between China and the United States.  China has always maintained that MFN status is purely a trade  issue. China has never accepted linking MFN with other issues  which have nothing to do with trade.    Wu Yi said: We hoped there would not be confrontation  between China and the United States on the MFN issue. If  confrontation were to emerge between the two sides on the MFN  issue, it would not be in the interest of either country.  Besides, the impact on Hong Kong and the losses the territory  would suffer would be even greater. Therefore, we hope that the  U.S. Government can properly settle the MFN issue between China  and the United States.    Wu Yi pointed out: We have expressed our appreciation to any  country or stratum which has lobbied the United States to renew  China's MFN status. The British Hong Kong Authorities and  personalities from Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles  have lobbied in the United States for China's MFN statue, and we  would like to express our appreciation for this.    At seven o'clock yesterday afternoon, Wu Yi arrived in Macao  from Hong Kong for a three-day visit. She had just returned  from a visit to the United States and had come to Macao via Hong  Kong to attend a meeting of the Board of Directors of the  Nanguang Holdinqs Company Limited. Wu Yi will meet Macao  Governor Rocha Vieira and will attend a meeting of the Chinese  Enterprises Association of Macao tomorrow morning. At noon  tomorrow, she will attend a welcome banquet held in her honor by  Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of  Commerce, at the Manyuen Restaurant.</p>

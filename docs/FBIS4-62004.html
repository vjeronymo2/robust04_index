			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Riga, May 11, BNS -- The decision of the Western  European Union [WEU] to grant "associate partnership" to nine  former Warsaw Pact members, including Latvia, Lithuania and  Estonia, stands an important diplomatic success of the Baltics,  the Latvian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday [11 May].    The getting closer to the European Union's fledgling defense  group opens a new stage in the road of the Baltic countries to  comprehensive integration into European structures.    The cooperation will allow the Baltics to build multilateral  military and political contacts with WEU countries with a  prospect of becoming full-fledged WEU members in the future,  according to the statement.    The associate partner status was also offered to Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.    Latvia was represented to the May 9 meeting of WEU foreign  and defense ministers in Luxembourg by Defense Minister Valdis  Pavlovskis and Acting Foreign Minister Egils Levits. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> JUDGE UPHOLDS 1987 MURDER CONVICTION  </P> <P> An Orange County judge Friday refused to set aside the 1987 second-degree  murder conviction of a Huntington Beach man who won an appellate court decision  to temporarily overturn his conviction for selling the drug PCP to a surfer who  later drowned.  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana had found errors in the  instructions given to the jury that convicted Mark Taylor, 34, in the death of  Adrian Obregon, 18.  </P> <P> In April, 1987, Obregon bought PCP from Taylor shortly before entering the  water at Huntington State Beach, where he drowned. The case marked the first  time Orange County prosecutors had ever sought a murder conviction against a  drug supplier when the drug was not directly the cause of death.  </P> <P> Prosecutors successfully argued that even though Taylor, now serving a sentence  of 15 years to life in prison, did not intend to harm Obregon, death would not  have occurred if Obregon hadn't been on PCP. But the appellate court found that  Judge Richard J. Beacom had not properly instructed the jurors on what the  standard for guilt should be in such a case.  </P> <P> So the district attorney's office asked the state Supreme Court to reconsider  the appellate decision. The high court agreed and defined the standard for  guilt in such cases: that the drug supplier in such a situation knows there is  a "high probability" of death. The high court then sent the case back to  Beacom..  </P> <P> On Friday, Beacom found that the case met that "high probability" standard and  refused to reverse Taylor's conviction. Taylor's lawyers indicated they would  appeal Beacom's ruling. JERRY HICKS  </P></p>

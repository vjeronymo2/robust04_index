[Ichikawa] There are three factors that will affect the  course of political realignment. One is how the ruling parties  should form a political force strong enough to compete against  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. The other is how  to select recognized candidates for single-seat constituencies.  The last is when the next general election will be conducted.  None of them has been given apparent answers. However, if the  budget bill is passed during the current Diet session, the pace  of political realignment will be greatly accelerated. If this  happens, the chief factor that gears up the realignment will be  the way to select candidates.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How does Komeito intend to deal with the  realignment?    [Ichikawa] We characterize the new electoral system as a  tool to select a force that can take the reins of government.  The change of government is the most effective measure to  prevent political corruption. Together with other ruling  parties, we want to establish a new political force that can  compete against the LDP and has only one name.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There are also moves within the ruling  coalition to unite social democrats and liberals.    [Ichikawa] Right now, it looks as if the ruling parties were  announcing their own ideas at separate studios. We will be able  to understand each other if we discuss at the same studio and  the same table. We all know that, unless the ruling parties  unite, the Hosokawa reform government will collapse. I think  the ruling parties will be merged into a large political force  under the goal of promoting reforms together.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of the idea that Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP] should form  a parliamentary group first?    [Ichikawa] It is ideal that all the ruling parties form a  parliamentary group at one time. But because there is still  concern, which has been caused by misunderstanding, that the  realignment of political parties might be promoted under the  initiative of Shinseito and Komeito, I think it is favorable if  Shinseito and the JNP play a major role in uniting the ruling  parties.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How will the ruling parties select  candidates for the next general election?    [Ichikawa] Leading Diet members of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan and other ruling parties all think that "the  ruling parties will not be able to win in the election unless  they cooperate" and that "it is better to begin as soon as  possible the work to select candidates." Once the budget bill  is passed, down-to-earth arguments of this kind will crop up all  at once and arguments over whether Japan should take a bipolar  or tripolar political system in the future will fade away. A  block of frozen ice melts quickly once it begins to melt.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is also an opinion that because the  ruling parties find it difficult to unite themselves, they  should only cooperate in the election.    [Ichikawa] Under the new electoral system, it is impossible  for the ruling parties to win in the election unless they  campaign as a single party. When the work to select candidates  actually begins, those who say "I should be separated [from the  other group that supports a bipolar system] in the selection  because I advocate a tripolar system" will be excluded from the  selection. Sakigake [Harbinger] has power only because the  party, in cooperation with the JNP, can hold the post of chief  cabinet secretary. If Sakigake stands by itself, it will become  just like the now-defunct Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club. Unless  the party is free from emotion and ideals, it will take a wrong  course.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Some people are critical of the alliance  between you and Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, saying  you two act high-handedly.    [Ichikawa] After its inauguration, the ruling coalition was  urged to make decisions on important issues, such as the partial  liberalization of the rice market and political reform. Who  made the decisions? While others were arguing, Mr. Ozawa and I  made the decisions and took the blame for it. It is the people  who evaluate what we have done. As a politician, I do not  regret what I have done. Mr. Ozawa and I have different  political ideas and styles. Mass media's reports on our alliance  are based on their imagination.</p>

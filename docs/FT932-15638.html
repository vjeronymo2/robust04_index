			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Beggars can be choosers THERE IS a worrying quarter of an hour or so at the start of The Beggar's Opera when one fears that it is not going to work. The scenery on the large Barbican, London, stage is so intricate and pervasive, and the voices and the text so thin, that it looks as if John Caird's production will be overwhelmed by the set. It is only with Polly Peachum's wonderful air, 'Oh what pain it is to part', at the end of the first act that you realise you are watching what was once a theatrical revolution. The reaction was much the same on the original first night at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1728. About 1,300 people turned up, including the first minister Walpole, whom the piece partly satirises, for what was billed as a great occasion. They took the opening coolly, but began to cheer as soon as Polly got into her singing stride. The production ran for 62 performances, then easily a record for a first run of any work on the English stage. John Gay the author, and friend of Pope and Swift, made a lot of money out of it: around Pounds 800. He became the Andrew Lloyd Webber of his day. The revolution was multiple. The piece is a satire on Italian opera. It also attacks the English upper classes for preferring foreign works to domestic and shows that English beggars can have just as good tunes. As satire, it suggests that there is not much ethical difference between a community of thieves and a community of politicians. The Beggar's Opera was the forerunner of the modern musical. Much of the satire has been inevitably lost with time. I do not think that it is anything like as good a musical as the Brecht-Weill Threepenny Opera, which it inspired. But the RSC production should not be seen in that comparative light. Here is a loving reconstruction of a once major work with some modern embellishments. Ilona Sekacz, the present composer, has changed some keys, added a few instruments and a touch of rock, yet it still seems essentially faithful to the original. The distinction from Italian opera, as the beggar says at the beginning, is that there is no recitative: beggars can be choosers. Otherwise, there are some lovely lilting lyrics and a remarkable musical variety. Gay originally thought that there should be no orchestral accompaniment, but was rightly overruled and continues to be so. Caird's production was originally seen at the Swan Theatre in Stratford a year ago. The Barbican gives it the greater space it deserves. Exuberance bursts out all over. If you sit in the front row of the stalls, you may be directly subject to the charms of David Burt's captivating Captain Macheath. Singing and speaking he has a marvellously controlled voice. Elizabeth Renihan's Polly and Jenna Russell's Lucy are good separately and even better together. The Beggar's Opera is a bit of an historical curiosity, but that is an additional reason for seeing it. * * * The other new arrival at the Barbican, this time in the smaller Pit Theatre, is Peter Whelan's The School of Night, which looked interesting but slightly rambling when it was first shown at Stratford in October. It has become much tighter. Possibly it is a shade esoteric. The author has done an immense amount of research on Shakespeare, Marlowe, their contemporaries and the darker side of the Elizabethan court. But the play confirms my impression that set in with The Bright and Bold Design two years ago that Whelan is potentially the best of modern British playwrights. Richard McCabe is now a magnificently self-confident Christopher Marlowe, even when he is exhibiting self-doubt.</p>

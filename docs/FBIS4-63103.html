			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 12, RIA -- The State Duma's Committee on  CIS Affairs and Liaison with Fellow-Countrymen, plans to propose  a law on the granting of most favoured nation treatment,  Konstantin Zatulin, committee chairman, told a news conference  today.    This law, in his view, and also the use of a Russian  military  presence and economic levers could help to resolve conflicts in  hot spots of former Soviet republics.    Zatulin told a RIA correspondent that such a regime could be  granted to Byelorussia [Belarus], Turkmenia [Turkmenistan],  Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.    "I would not grant it to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,  while  in the case of Ukraine it is necessary to hold appropriate talks  at first," noted Zatulin.    He further said that the committee he heads is now working  on  a declaration on principles of relations with former Soviet  republics.    The document is planned to be completed by parliamentary  hearings on problems of fellow-countrymen in the near abroad,  scheduled for the end of June.</p>

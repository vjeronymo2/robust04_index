			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN AIMS TO EXPEDITE AIR BASE CLEANUP;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AGREE TO TACKLE 35 TOXIC WASTE SITES  AT EDWARDS.  </P> <P> State and federal officials have reached agreement on a plan to expedite toxic  waste cleanup at Edwards Air Force Base that may take decades to complete and  cost nearly $83 million.  </P> <P> The Air Force has already spent 10 years and an estimated $21 million on  cleanup efforts at the base, located about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles.  But that effort has thus far cleaned up only one of 36 contaminated areas, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The new agreement between the Air Force, the federal Environmental Protection  Agency and state health and water officials will govern most of the actual soil  and ground water cleanup, a task officials expect to cost another $62 million  and take 30 years or more.  </P> <P> "It's not an easy process. It requires a great deal of investigation. It's a  long, tedious, technological problem," said Capt. Daniel Bowholtz, head of the  base's environmental planning and compliance branch. Edwards is the  second-largest Air Force base in the continental United States.  </P> <P> The agreement, finalized Thursday night when it was approved at a California  Regional Water Quality Control Board meeting in Barstow, followed the base's  addition in late August to the EPA's National Priorities List.  </P> <P> Edwards officials said the contamination stems from years of leaking  underground tanks, jet fuel spills, landfill and industrial activities. They  said the contamination poses no immediate health danger either on or off the  base but could pose a long-term threat to drinking water.  </P> <P> Bowholtz said the base's placement on the National Priorities List and the  ensuing agreement should help make the base eligible for more cleanup funding.  He said base officials have earmarked $10 million for cleanup work in the  coming fiscal year.  </P> <P> The 36 identified contamination sites at Edwards are divided into 20 geographic  areas of the base, which covers about 300,000 acres in the Mojave Desert near  the border of Kern and Los Angeles counties. Most are in the main base area or  near the base's astronautics lab.  </P> <P> EPA documents say "large amounts of fuel" have been spilled at the Main and  South base areas of Edwards over the years, and cite "poor disposal practices"  that allowed solvents to seep into the ground. They also cite an abandoned  landfill containing pesticides and heavy metals.  </P> <P> EPA documents also say a variety of solvents -- trichloroethylene, methylene  chloride and others -- are present in the ground water under the base. But  Bowholtz said the pollution is in an upper-level aquifer that is separate from  the deeper aquifer that supplies the base's water.  </P> <P> Bowholtz also said there is some concern that contamination from the abandoned  landfill could migrate to the base's main water well about three miles away.  But he said base officials believe the migration would occur very slowly, if at  all.  </P> <P> The agreement gives state and federal agencies the power to oversee and advise  on the cleanup and provides for the resolution of disputes among the agencies.  It also mandates a community relations program to inform the public of  developments.  </P> <P> Bowholtz said the Air Force developed its latest cost estimate for the cleanup,  $82.8 million, in the last several months. Officials said there is no  time-frame for completion of the work because investigative work remains  unfinished.  </P> <P> During that period, Edwards will have to regularly seek funding from a special  federal account, the Defense Environmental Restoration Account, which is  similar to the Superfund program that the EPA uses to clean up non-federal  hazardous waste sites.  </P></p>

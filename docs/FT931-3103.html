			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Companies' liquidity ratio falls THE short-term liquidity position of Britain's large companies deteriorated in the final quarter of last year as falling interest rates encouraged companies to boost borrowings and run down their bank deposits. The Central Statistical Office reported that the seasonally adjusted liquidity ratio for large UK industrial and commercial companies fell to an estimated 111 per cent at the end of last year from 119 per cent at the end of the third quarter and 121 per cent at the end of 1991. The ratio, measuring current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was the lowest since the first quarter of 1991. The liquidity ratio for large manufacturing companies fell to 100 per cent from 109 per cent in the previous quarter and 118 per cent at the end of 1991. The ratio for large non-UK manufacturing companies fell to 125 per cent from 132 per cent in the quarter, but was still higher than the 123 per cent at the end of 1991. City economists were untroubled by the apparent deterioration of UK companies' short-term finances. Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist of Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the figure reflected balance-sheet restructuring as interest rates fell. It should not impinge on companies' ability to invest using retained earnings. Non-seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO showed that companies ran down their short term deposits with UK banks to Pounds 22.3bn in the fourth quarter from Pounds 24.5bn at mid-year while increasing their overseas assets.</p>

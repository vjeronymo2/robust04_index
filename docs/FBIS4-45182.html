			<p>BFN     [Text] The antidrug brigade made a spectacular seizure of  cocaine at the Port-au-Prince Airport by intercepting 143 kg of  cocaine going to the United States on board an American Airlines  plane. The cocaine was being carried by two Haitians residing in  the United States, who were arrested. Another person, a Canadian  of Haitian origin, was also apprehended with one kg of cocaine  and three pounds of marijuana while he was getting ready to  travel abroad. Clarence Renois questioned Colonel [Antoine]  Atouriste, who is in charge of the Antidrug Service. [begin  recording]    Atouriste: [Word or words indistinct] only cocaine  yesterday. It was very unusual. We have never had such a case at  the airport before.    Renois: Where did those drugs transiting through  Haiti, that you fortunately succeeded in intercepting, come  from, Colonel?    Atouriste: Just like for the other Caribbean  countries, the drug comes from Colombia. We are situated on the  international axis for the international traffic from south to  north--meaning from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia to the United  States or Europe. It is therefore indispensable for the drugs to  go through Haiti. Of course we know that many measures have  been taken in Haiti. We have been in control of the situation  for many years, despite certain false allegations by certain  sectors or by the opposition, which is continuing its campaign  of denigration. [Word or words indistinct] in the Caribbean, and  it is done as well in Haiti.    Renois: Could you say today, Colonel, that the  antidrug brigade controls the drug-trafficking situation in  Haiti totally?    Atouriste: I tell you sincerely that to see what  we have been able to accomplish with the support of the  authorities concerned constitutes our greatest satisfaction. The  system is under control and they [not further identified] know  that. You have heard about the latest report of the  international observers in that regard, how they congratulate  Haiti despite the embargo. We have accomplished without much  money what the Haitian Government was never able to accomplish  in the past, before 1991.    Renois: Indeed, Colonel Atouriste, there is a  report from the U.S. Justice Department that calls into question  high-ranking Army officers, who are allegedly involved in  protecting this trafficking from Colombia to Haiti to the United  States. An investigation has been opened, in that regard. Is the  Haitian Army or the Antidrug Service concerned about that?    Atouriste: Your question is quite political. We  are technicians. I will simply say to you that the Haitian Army  is now the dog to kill. When one wishes to kill his dog, he  accuses it of being rabid. But we are from the Army and we have  been fighting drugs for more than a quarter of a century in  Haiti. The Haitian law on narcotics dates from 1971. To my  knowledge, the Haitian Armed Forces are in charge of fighting  drugs, and continue to do so. I want to believe that what you  hear on the media nowadays is again this sick sector of the  national life that is continuing its campaign of denigration, or  that it is this sector of the international community that is  affected by this virus that you know. That is my opinion on  that. [end recording]</p>

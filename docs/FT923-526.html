			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: When the Kissing Stopped - Theatre Theatre managers often wonder what visual improvements they can introduce to make their theatres more appealing. My demands are simple: just put a river beside your theatre, and I will be happy. If the river also runs under the theatre, and if there are also a mill pond and an old mill wheel on display, well, so much the better. Last year, I fell in love with the small and exquisite Watermill Theatre, just outside Newbury Now I have fallen for the somewhat larger (seats approx. 212) Mill at Sonning, four miles outside Reading: as I arrived, a heron flew slowly past. Such venues appeal to one's fantasy of traditional England. The title of the Mill at Sonning's current production, When the Kissing Stopped, suggests, however, other kinds of England. The prurient England of sex comedy, maybe; or the wistfully elegiac England committed to autumnal resignation. In the event, the play turns gradually from the former into the latter, and here lies its charm. Morry and Brenda run a joke shop which is also a costume-hire and kissogram business. They are an unlikely couple - he a relentlessly jolly and bawdy prankster, she a demure, refined, grey-haired spinster. You soon learn much about them; they become remarkably real characters. Their most striking habit is that, despite their incongruities, they have frequent bouts of play-acting in which, as other characters, they can talk about their real selves in the third person and even address otherwise insoluble problems. The play's sex-comedy aspect promises to flower when the shop is visited by, first, Sarah and then her husband Laurence - separately. Sarah is quick to begin a sexy flirtation with Morry; Laurence finds himself drawn to Brenda. There are numerous farcical moments, with characters hiding and overhearing infidelities, or entering to discover couples in compromising positions. But this is not farce, because farce depends on panic - and these two couples are beyond panic. Stroke by stroke, Morry emerges as an amiably helpless charlatan; and Brenda starts to reorder her life. The director, Ian Masters, deserves praise for the naturalness with which all this is handled. Morry and Brenda are excellently realised by Linal Haft (though a trimmer, sexier man would make more sense of the plot) and Frances White. There are passages when the situation hovers on the brink between laughter and tears so effectively that the play gets deep under your skin. But Jefferies cannot always keep the play on that level. It's not hard to see how much more comedy could be made from the plot without sacrificing its poignancy; and eventually it rolls downhill into limp sentimentality. The most obvious flaw is Laurence, too much of a fairy-godfather to be credible. Everything he does fits neatly into place - whereas what makes Morry and Brenda interesting and unusual is that they are not neat. The Mill at Sonning, Berkshire, until October 24</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: UK needs to lift costly artificial barriers to employment Sir, Percy Barnevik expresses his concern about the large-scale job losses which will result from the industrial restructuring the single market will bring about ('Life in the Single Market', January 4). In any normally functioning economy, such surplus labour would be promptly re-employed. Most of us could compile a long list of jobs which need to be done. Pavements need mending, supermarket checkouts are under-staffed and hospitals have pared down their workforce of ancillaries to a bare minimum. Bus conductors and station porters vanished long ago even though many of us would still welcome their services. Probably the most important reason why labour is difficult to re-employ is the overall shape of the tax and benefit system. This sends the wrong signals both to the individual who is unemployed, and to any potential employer. The combination of means-tested benefits and low tax thresholds effectively acts as a very high marginal rate of tax for anyone moving from unemployment to employment. This creates an artificial barrier to employment which amounts to a lock-out of labour. In the beleaguered public sector, this mechanism means that it is apparently very costly to take someone out of unemployment into a low-paid job. The necessary reform would ensure that, however little a worker was paid, he would be better off than not working at all. It is a matter of getting the arithmetic right. The issue was discussed in detail in Beyond the Welfare State, by Samuel Brittan and Steven Webb, who concluded that what is required, among other things, is a change to some form of universal benefit, not means-tested, on the lines of the basic income or negative income tax schemes. This is the only way of reducing the present barrier to employment. Henry Law, 19 Queen's Gardens, Brighton BN1 4AR</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> You may recall the stories of parents discovering to their horror that their  children had fallen prey to advertisements for 976-prefix, dial-a-porn numbers  and had run up hundreds of dollars in telephone bills.  </P> <P> Now City Hall is having the same problem.  </P> <P> An internal audit has revealed that city phones may have rung up as much as  $8,000 in charges in the last year for calls to such nongovernment concerns as  "Adult Fantasy Line," "Call Me, I'm Michelle -- Live" and "Gay Introductions."  </P> <P> So, as of June 25, the General Services Department plans to block access to all  pay-per-call numbers on the city's lines.  </P> <P> "It's been an ugly part of the operation," conceded Don Keith, director of  communications for General Services. "But we had to wait until the (state)  Public Utilities Commission gave Pac Bell permission to block those lines."  </P> <P> Most of the naughty calls were made during off hours, including some traced to  one city councilman's phone. The culprits turned out to be employees of a  company that had installed carpet in the councilman's office.  </P> <P> Keith pointed out that dial-a-porn has ballooned the city's multimillion-dollar  phone bill only slightly.  </P> <P> "I'm sure the city wastes more money in other areas," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sales of a T-shirt that says, "Long Beach Police -- We Do Windows," have been  halted, according to its designer.  </P> <P> Sue Gorba, an emergency room clerk at a hospital, said that she would donate  the $800 in profit she has made to charity, inasmuch as the shirt has drawn  criticism from dozens of residents as well as the city's mayor and police  chief.  </P> <P> The slogan refers to a January incident in which Long Beach Police Officer Mark  Dickey allegedly pushed Don Jackson, a black civil rights activist, head-first  into the window of a motorcycle shop. Dickey, who is white, faces a charge of  assault in the case, which was secretely videotaped and drew national  attention.  </P> <P> Gorba said the T-shirt represented "a kind of gallows humor around the  emergency room. It was tongue-in-cheek stuff."  </P> <P> Dickey and Officer Mark Ramsey, who are also charged with filing a false police  report, had previously rejected use of the profits for their defense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In the midst of a search for 4,000 species of birds, author Jim Clements  stumbled upon a yellow-feathered, 8-foot-tall giant at the County Museum of  Natural History. Clements, whose quest is intended to raise money for the  museum's Hall of Birds, dubbed the one-of-a-kind creature Megagallus humongous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley's aides vowed recently that he'll soon unleash some major  policy proposals to show that Hizzoner isn't being hampered by the myriad  investigations into his personal finances.  </P> <P> It was just a coincidence that a film crew was stationed on the mayor's floor  Monday, shooting a film called "Vital Signs."  </P></p>

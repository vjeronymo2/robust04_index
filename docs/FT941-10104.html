			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Japan urged to introduce tough budget The Japanese finance ministry yesterday asked the government to follow its record Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) pump-priming package with an austere budget for the coming year. The ministry's draft budget for the fiscal year, starting on April 1, calls for a 1 per cent rise in total outlays to Y73,081bn. Ostensibly an improvement on the previous year's 0.2 per cent budget growth rate, it represents a small decline after stripping out accounting changes, according to finance ministry officials. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said he expected the US to support the budget, which is likely to be part of trade and economic talks today between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US President Bill Clinton. Ministries will negotiate on the draft over the next few days, before the government adopts a final budget on Tuesday, which will then be debated by parliament next month. Separately, the cabinet yesterday adopted a Y2,185bn third supplementary budget for the current year, needed to fund part of the recent stimulus package. The government will probably need at least one more supplementary budget this year, because yesterday's draft is unlikely to cover the its needs, said economists. 'It is clearly insufficient,' said Mr Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. The figures might change slightly in the bargaining to come, but the draft is a general guide to the government's plans. General spending, the core of the budget, is to rise 2.3 per cent, the smallest increase for six years, within which defence is set to rise by 0.8 per cent, the lowest growth for 34 years. Overseas aid is set to rise by 4 per cent, the smallest increase ever from one of the world's largest donors - and only just over half the foreign ministry's request for a 7.9 per cent increase. However, public works spending is to rise by 29.6 per cent, in line with the government's pump-priming policies, a point welcomed yesterday by the Keidanren business federation. On the revenue side, the government expects tax receipts to fall by 12.5 per cent, because of the income tax rebate at the heart of the stimulus package. Its tax revenue forecast is, however, based on the Economic Planning Agency's target of 2.6 per cent growth in gross national product for the coming fiscal year, widely seen as over-ambitious. This high economic growth target, however, reduces pressure on the finance ministry to commit itself to issuing deficit bonds, to which it has strong objections, pointed out Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. The finance ministry has already had to swallow its pride by agreeing to issue Y3,134bn of deficit bonds, the first for five years, to fund much of Mr Hosokawa's tax rebate. The drop in tax revenue and the demands of an increased public works programme means the government plans a 68 per cent increase in bonds issued next year, to a record Y13,643bn, or 18.7 per cent of government revenue. Of that, Y10,509bn will be so-called construction bonds, destined for public works only - to which the ministry has no objection - with the rest in deficit bonds.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (8): Retreat from the brink - Trade union militancy loses some of its edge On paper the proposal looked startling. The workforce was to face a 20 per cent cut in pay. Half of the employees would be Chinese, And as further provocation the would-be purchasers were demanding partial exemption from employers' social security contributions. But when a group of Chinese bidders made precisely these demands earlier this year, as part of their bid for the bankrupt New Tubermase steel mill in Liege, Flanders, the local union's response was even more surprising. In place of public protests, the local branch of the FGTB, Belgium's main socialist union, quietly started negotiations with the Chinese bidders. 'We can't accept a 20 per cent pay cut. But between 0 per cent and 20 per cent there is a lot of room for negotiation,' explained Mr Jean Potier of the FGTB, who explained that the union was simply being 'pragmatic', given that the plant's 700 former workers had already been laid off five months ago. In the event, the Chinese offer fell through. But the episode highlights a shift in Belgium's labour relations where, after decades of wielding formidable political power, the unions are increasingly on the defensive. On paper at least, their numbers remain impressive, with union membership rates of some 70 per cent. Although the proportion of active workers who are unionised is rather lower - the 70 per cent figure includes members who are currently unemployed and on early retirement - this nevertheless leaves Belgium one of the most unionised countries in Europe, second only to Scandinavia. But the ongoing erosion of Belgium's heavy industries is leading to an erosion of the unions' power base and bargaining power. Almost two thirds of Belgian employees now work in the service sector, with almost 13 per cent of the total workforce part-time. Unemployment stands slightly above 13 per cent, after almost touching 14 per cent last year. Meanwhile, the Belgian Christian Democrat government of Jean-Luc Dehaene has started to wage a new war of fiscal austerity. This is designed to curb not only the country's huge public debt but also its high labour costs, currently calculated to be almost three times higher than average labour costs in France, Germany, UK, Italy and Netherlands. The unions, split three ways between Christian Democrat, liberal and socialist groups, are not taking the shift quietly. Last November, the unions called the country's first general strike for 58 years in protest against the new austerity package, which proposed a BFr75bn cut in Belgium's social security expenditure - including a reduction in employers' social security contributions - and a pay increase limit of 2 per cent for the next three years. Allowing for inflation this 2 per cent limit amounted to a virtual wage freeze. The one day strike effectively paralysed the country, prompting an angry response from employers, who are now demanding tougher government controls to prevent a repetition of the rough picket tactics used last year. Mr Jan van Holm, director of labour relations at Federation of Belgium Enterprises, the main employers group, said: 'At first we (in the FBE) were astonished and then very upset about these new tactics, which seemed to breach the usual range of human freedoms.' But after a few brief flashes of violence, the protest subsided and the government pushed through most of the controversial points of its austerity package - including the 2 per cent freeze on wages increases for the next three years. According to Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque, that the main outcome of the strikes may have been to illustrate the union's dwindling influence. 'The strikes were more of a symbolic nature. The general feeling we have is that they proved that the unions were not very combative,' he says, adding that the most powerful pressure against the 2 per cent wage increase ceiling may finally come not from the unions but employers themselves. If the Belgium economy picks up later this year, as predicted, companies may start to demand that the ceiling is dropped to allow them to attract the best labour, he suggests. The unions themselves strongly disagree. 'Talk of the union's decline is exaggerated. The strikes showed we could mobilise the workers - and could force the government to negotiate,' insists Mr Roland DeWulf of the CSC, the Christian democrat union. Although he concedes that the results of the strike 'were not exactly desirable', he insists that the unions have no intention of changing their tactics or campaign. At the same time none of the unions expects a this type of industrial conflict to recur this year, although they say protests could be stepped up when negotiations are re-opened on a proposed inter-professional agreement at the end of the year. Meanwhile, interim negotiations between the employers and employees have achieved a small, but symbolically significant breakthrough. After years of wrangling, unions have finally officially accepted that Belgium does face a labour costs competitiveness problem - although they remain at loggerheads with the employers about how to define it.</p>

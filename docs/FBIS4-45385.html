Deputy Prime Minister Michel  al-Murr chaired a meeting for the ministerial Antinarcotics  Committee. The meeting was attended by Ministers Michel  Samahah, Marwan Hamadah, and 'Adil Qirtas; representatives of  the Army Command, the Internal Security Forces, and the Social  Affairs Ministry; and a delegation from the UN antidrugs bureau  [name as received]. Al-Murr explained the importance and  details of the meeting: [begin recording]    al-Murr: In the latest 1993 report published by  U.S media and cited by some Arab press, Lebanon was considered  first in the world in exporting, producing, and growing drugs.  The report specified the amount produced as 65,000 tons of  hashish, opium, and others. In that report Lebanon was given a  leading place in this dirty international activity. We stressed  Lebanon's position to the UN representatives concerned with the  drug issue. We told them that the figures mentioned in the  report are incorrect, unrealistic, and baseless. We asked the  United Nations, through its representatives who met with us  today, to give us the information they have about Lebanon. They  were here a year ago and we gave them accurate information and  figures indicating that all rumors about Lebanon, disseminated  to serve certain international objectives, are false.    There are no more opium or hashish plants in al-Biqa'. If  security agencies occasionally seize some smuggled drugs, these  are from old stock--more than three years old--hidden in secret  places. The plants were destroyed and they no longer exist.    The UN officials told me that they have evidence that these  plants no longer exist in Lebanon and that Lebanon is being  wronged by media rumors that it is the primary exporter of drugs  to the world. In the name of the government, I stressed our  demand for a clear UN report telling the truth. We do not want  a favor; we want them to tell the truth that Lebanon is no  longer a producer or exporter of drugs. They promised that at  the end of their visit to Lebanon this week--we gave them a  chance to visit all concerned ministries and departments to  collect facts and figures--they will forward a report. They  became convinced after the documents we presented in the  meeting. But this is not enough; we insisted that they present  a report to the United Nations so that it, in its annual report,  can say that Lebanon does not plant, produce, or export drugs.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Observer: Damned publishing Britain's cliquey book trade will be agog at hearing that Terry Maher, recently ousted as boss of Pentos, owner of Britain's second biggest bookstore group, is already at work on his memoirs. Mind you, putting pen to paper is the easy bit. Finding a publisher could be more difficult, given Maher's long crusade against the publishing industry's biggest perk - the 100-year-old Net Book Agreement. And if Maher is as rude about rival booksellers as he is about the NBA ('an organised conspiracy against the public's interest') then he might find it hard to get prime place on the shelves. Early days yet, admits Maher, 58 next month. He has only written 4,000 words and has yet to come up with a snappy title. However, he already has two tomes to his credit - Counterblast (1965) and Effective Politics (1966) - which date back to when he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Liberal candidate for parliament. Maher's enemies in the City and the book trade may be unnerved to hear that he is finding the writing . . . 'very therapeutic'.</p>

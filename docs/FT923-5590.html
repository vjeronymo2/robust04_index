			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Markets: A case of defending the indefensible - London Markets It was a week for agonising dilemmas. Take the one faced by the retired bank manager who taped what was alleged to be a conversation between Princess Diana and a male admirer. He was a staunch royalist, he said, and had to decide whether to send the tape to Buckingham Palace or the Sun newspaper. It was one of those finely-balanced moral issues. Norman Lamont, though not a bank manager and not yet retired, must have sympathised, as he wrestled with a problem of similar complexity on Tuesay night. The pound was sliding inside the ERM; short-term interest rates were rising; the gilts auction was going badly; the stock market had given up the ghost; the Bundesbank was wondering aloud why everyone didn't devalue their currencies against the D-Mark. The chancellor had to choose between putting up interest rates, starting to plan for a sterling devaluation, or appearing on television. For a politician, the choice was obvious. At 8.20 on Wednesday morning, he addressed the cameras outside the treasury. 'There are going to be no devaluations, no leaving the ERM,' he said. 'We are absolutely committed to the ERM. That is our policy. That is the centre of our policy. We are going to maintain sterling's parity and we will do whatever is necessary.' With that statement, and a lot of expensive intervention in the currency market by the Bank of England, sterling just about scraped through the week, though it was close to the bottom of its permitted ERM band for most of the time. By Friday, sterling was still the weakest currency in the ERM, though much of the market's attention seemed to be switching to the lira. Doubtless the chancellor can continue to scrape by, though at considerable cost in terms of foreign exchange reserves and - perhaps - of higher interest rates in the weeks to come. Scraping by leaves the stock market unimpressed, however. As the chart shows, since the end of the Gulf War sterling weakness in the ERM has been by and large associated with a declining stock market. This week, as the pound dropped another pfennig, the FT-SE 100 index closed down 53.1 points at 2312.6, though it had dropped as low as 2260.6 on Tuesday afternoon. One top fund manager argued on Friday that the government is simply muddling through, hoping to be bailed out of its problems by the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht or a recovery in the dollar (which would take some of the pressure off the pound). The government's policy, he said, is 'mostly a matter of keeping its fingers crossed'. Meanwhile, investors have faced their own set of dilemmas, and have been crossing their fingers just as ardently. When times are hard, they traditionally fall back on 'defensive' stocks, shares in the sort of company that do well come rain or shine. After all, they tell themselves, everyone's got to eat. Not any more. Food processors are doing just as badly as anyone else. Shares in Hillsdown, one of the biggest UK-oriented food companies, have halved since early May, though they closed on Friday at 99p, up 2p on the week. My colleague Maggie Urry revealed in the FT this week that even baked beans, perhaps the ultimate defensive commodity, are sticking to the shelf. Other traditional defensive stocks were also offering investors little reassurance. Grand Metropolitan, which now owns food brands, burger bars and pubs, gave a formal profits warning on Tuesday. Its shares ended the week at 388p, down 32p. On Thursday, the brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle reported a further deterioration in trading conditions, with signs that the hardy beer-drinkers of the north were at last following their southern cousins into recession-induced sobriety. Its announcement sent several other beer stocks down, and S&amp;N closed the week at 383p, down 49p. One analyst said the bad news 'shows that the drinks sector 'is not the defensive division it has been painted'. But what is? Dividends are under threat across the market, as finance directors, emboldened by BP's example, reach for a weapon they have hitherto been too scared to employ. Companies as varied as Slough Estates, Guardian Royal Exchange and Bridon announced interim dividend cuts this week; the practice is becoming routine. There are only two truly defensive sectors left: the water and electricity utilities, which have outperformed the market by 15-20 per cent since the slide started four months ago. Utilities are classic defensive stocks, propped up even in bad times by their high yields. But part of the impetus behind the water stocks, at least, lies in what the market interprets as favourable rulings by the industry's regulator. Today, his rulings help the sector; tomorrow they may hurt it. In this still formative phase of UK utility regulation, there is a greater element of chance in the shares' performance than the truly defensive investor would find comforting. British Gas - illustrating the point perfectly by its dispute with its regulator - announced half-year results this week. On a current cost basis, it lost money in the second quarter. This is traditionally one of its weaker periods, since the weather is warmer and central heating boilers are turned down. However, utilities are not supposed to lose money whatever the weather. The shares closed on Friday at 241 1/2 p, down 2 1/2 p. Perhaps the most apposite quotation of the week came from Lord Weir, chairman of the Scottish engineering group that bears his name. Announcing, to general acclaim, higher interim profits and an increased dividend, he said people should not think this achievement was effortless: 'Although we are doing better, it is bloody difficult'. Difficult indeed.</p>

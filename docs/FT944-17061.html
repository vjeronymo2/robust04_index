Mr Antonio Sampaio Melo, head of economic research, told foreign bankers in Oporto yesterday that average annual inflation was also expected to drop to 5.5 per cent from 6.5 per cent last year. Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, trade and tourism minister, said inflation would be less than 2.5 points higher than the European Union average by the end of 1994. Figures for September, to be officially announced later this week, would show a further drop compared with August. Average annual inflation in 1995 should be 3.5-4.5 per cent.</p>

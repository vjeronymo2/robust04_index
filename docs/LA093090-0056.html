			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S PERDURABLE POWS;  </P> <P> BOUNCING BACK; HOW A HEROIC BAND OF POW'S SURVIVED VIETNAM BY GEOFFREY NORMAN  (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 256 PP.; 0-395-45186-8)  </P> <P> It was ironic that Al Stafford wasn't supposed to fly the bombing mission at  all that morning. He was just a backup, waiting in the flight line aboard the  carrier USS Oriskany in case one of the other A-4 jet bombers malfunctioned on  that hot summer day in 1967. Sure enough, one did.  </P> <P> Within minutes, Lt. Cmdr. Stafford was airborne, streaking across the South  China Sea toward the coast of North Vietnam where his air group had been  assigned to destroy a military bridge used to transport arms and men into South  Vietnam. As the formation neared the target, Stafford's missile-warning device  buzzed. From the cockpit he could see the giant SAM Russian missiles roaring  toward and past him, looking for all the world like giant flying telephone  poles.  </P> <P> Suddenly there was a horrific explosion as a 300-pound SAM warhead exploded  just behind his cockpit, igniting the four tons of bombs he was carrying, as  well as his fuel tanks. The plane literally disintegrated in midair.  </P> <P> By all rights, Stafford should have been dead, but somehow the automatic seat  ejector had been set off and he awakened floating gently down toward the lush  but hostile greenery of the Vietnamese countryside. His flight suit was on  fire; his arm was broken, as well as several ribs, and a shoulder was  separated. He was bleeding heavily from head wounds. But he was alive, a  condition which, very soon, even he would come to regret.  </P> <P> Stafford was quickly captured and force-marched in his condition several miles  to an interrogation center, where he was immediately beaten, tortured, starved  and jammed upside down for 24 hours into a sewer pipe set in the ground -- all  because he would not reveal the name of his ship. In those days, that was  standard treatment for captured pilots, and virtually all of them, Stafford  included, broke under the pressure -- to one degree or another.  </P> <P> "Bouncing Back" is the story of Stafford and many of his comrades who spent up  to six years in the grisly dungeons the North Vietnamese called "prison camps."  It is the story of how they coped during those awful times, and it recalls such  works as "King Rat," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and "Papillon." "Bounce  Back" was the phrase the men used to describe their recovery from the  consistent torture their captors inflicted to exploit the POWs for propaganda  purposes.  </P> <P> It also is the story of their return and how now, 20 years later, they have  "bounced back" into a society from which they were so long removed.  </P> <P> Maltreatment of American prisoners at the hands of the North Vietnamese has  been chronicled before, mostly in autobiographies, but the author of this book  probably does more justice to the subject than most, having solicited  information from a wider body of sources and subjects.  </P> <P> Treatment of U.S. war prisoners, even by the Nazis, pales by what is described  here: constant slow starvation, isolation, vermin, exposure, beatings, little  or no medical treatment and the frequent use of medieval-style engines of  torture. Only the Japanese barbarism toward POWs in World War II or some of the  bizarre goings-on in northern China toward the end of the last century come  close by comparison. How these men persevered is remarkable.  </P> <P> Use of the POWs for propaganda purposes was a common tactic. "Confessions"  needed to be signed; appearences were demanded at "press conferences" to  repudiate American policy. The POWs drew up their own set of rules for these  occasions, since it was obvious no man could withstand the consequences if he  followed to the letter the official U.S. Armed Forces Code of Conduct.  </P> <P> Most, though not all, initially refused and let themselves be subjected to  torture first, but when the torture became too great they would give in.  Stafford, for instance, was strung up, whipped, beaten and kicked for hours on  end before he consented to tape a "confession" and have it played before a  crowd of journalists, including a photographer for Life magazine. Even so, he  managed to betray his captors by bowing stiffly four times like some character  out of "The Manchurian Candidate," so that the Americans, at least, could tell  the statements were coerced. Then he went back to his cell to begin the process  of "bouncing back."  </P> <P> The prisoners devised an elaborate code and message system, which has been  described by others but is an integral part of this book. Much of their time  was devoted to this endeavor, since communication of any sort was so important.  Reduced to pitiable, malnourished wretches, most survivors managed mainly  because of this code and the consequent ability of senior officers to command,  to keep the faith.  </P> <P> Toward the end of the war, when the treatment eased somewhat and the POWs were  allowed to mingle, the men bucked up their spirits by organizing classes for  each other, each man teaching his specialty, whether engineering, cooking,  literature, mechanics or gardening.  </P> <P> In 1972, the POWs were released and each man faced a different sort of crisis.  Some wives had filed for divorce -- one on grounds of desertion. Relationships  had to be renewed; infant children were now half-grown. Some POWs, so badly  injured they no longer could fly, faced an uncertain job market years behind  their peers. Stafford, for instance, learned that his wife had moved to Hong  Kong and did not much desire to return to America.  </P> <P> But one lesson the ordeal in prison had taught most of them was that they could  Bounce Back. A study conducted by the military indicated that 15 years after  their release, there were no long-term psychological problems. While there was  one suicide, and others suffered bouts of depression for a while, all in all  they proved incredibly resilient.  </P> <P> Stafford himself stayed in the service and ultimately took command of the Navy  survival school in Pensacola, Fla. The concept of Bouncing Back was  incorporated into the program with great success.  </P></p>

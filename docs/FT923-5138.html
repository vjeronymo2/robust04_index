			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Ulster talks to resume at crucial stage ROUND-TABLE talks on the political future of Northern Ireland resume in Belfast today after a 40-day recess, entering what the participants believe to be the most crucial stage of the three-strand talks process which started last April. The aim of the process is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland, to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will include representatives from the four main political parties in the province as well as the British and Irish governments. Sir Ninian Stephen, the former governor-general of Australia, will chair the meetings. Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure. The discussions will involve three days of meetings each week, initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast, then moving to Dublin, probably in the last week of September. It will be the first time since partition in 1922 that Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin. The talks are part of 'strand two' of the three-strand process. Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, during which the six groups laid out their positions and faced questioning by others. The real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, whether the Irish government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional territorial claim to Northern Ireland, and whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede some role for Dublin in a future Ulster administration. Strict confidentiality and a news blackout have been imposed on the discussions, as it is feared that any leaks before a final agreement is reached could endanger the talks. In spite of some breaches of confidentiality, there is a sense that progress has been made, if only to bring the main Ulster political parties together with the two governments. The three-strand political talks are based on a complex programme agreed by the participants in April last year. In 'strand one' local politicians discussed devolution in Northern Ireland with the UK government. In 'strand two' the Dublin government has entered the discussions on the relations between north and south Ireland. This round of talks is scheduled to finish by September 28, after which a new meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, set up under the 1985 Hillsborough agreement, is due to be held. Unionist leaders refused to participate in the current talks unless the Anglo-Irish conference was suspended, which it has been since April.</p>

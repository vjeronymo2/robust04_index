			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Books: Poetic reputation ripe for reassessment - Anthony Curtis re-reads C. Day Lewis THE COMPLETE POEMS by C. Day Lewis Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 25, 746 pages POETIC reputations have fluctuated over the years as unpredictably as shares on the stock exchange. What would your holding be worth today if you had bought equity in the 'MacSpaunday' (modern poetry) sector in, say, 1930? You would have done awfully well with your Audens. In spite of some gloomy forecasts during the American takeover in 1939, the upward curve has been steadily maintained and they are worth many times over what you would have paid for them. As for your MacNeices, they have been quietly firm for some time and are due soon for a revaluation which should show a considerable discount on the underlying assets. The Spenders have been dullish for decades but, with the original chairman still in charge, they do continue to find buyers. It is the Day Lewises that have been the big disappointment in spite of the cachet of royal warrantry. After performing extremely well in the period from 1929 to 1933 - the lively experimental period of Transitional Poem, From Feathers to Iron and The Magnetic Mountain - they seemed to cut back on resources, and following a series of devastatingly adverse reports by a leading analyst called Geoffrey Grigson, never to recover the confidence of the market. Now with the welcome appearance of C. Day Lewis: The Complete Poems, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the poet's death, we have the chance to read his work as a whole and to consider whether the low rating was justified. The first thing that strikes one is the sheer quantity of work here, much more than one had realised. Historically, Day Lewis emerges as an accurate recorder of national moods. After the optimism of the 1930s, the poet revelling in the new landscape of arterial roads, he feels a sense of paralysis at the imminent war. Then comes the mood of wartime solidarity well conveyed in a poem about fire-watching with a local farmer. After V-Day there is a blessed sense of release at war's end, only to be followed by guilt at the mess of the post-war world combined with further guilt at the mess the poet seems to be making of his private life. After the war he pursued several careers at the same time - director of, and literary adviser to, Chatto &amp; Windus; public performer of poetry with his second wife, Jill Balcon who contributes an introduction to the volume; and most lucratively that of a successful writer of detective stories under the nom de plume Nicholas Blake. But Day Lewis never relaxed his commitment to his chosen last of writing poetry. The book does not include his translations from Virgil. They must, surely, be reckoned a strong plus in any assessment of his poetic achievement. What the volume does contain, happily, is the translation he made of Paul Valery's poem Le Cimetiere Marin, a version he called The Graveyard By the Sea. The original captures the French poet's musing beside the tombs of dead sailors in the cemetry at Sete (Herault); at its deepest level, it is a poem about re-birth, through which the pounding rhythm of the sea beats continually. It is rendered into superbly eloquent English with a minimum of loss of meaning by Day Lewis. If one had to sum up what Day Lewis stood for as an artist, what he came to believe in his heart of hearts, it would have to be a paradoxical credo of being through not being, close to that of Valery. But if Day Lewis arrived in middle age at a quietist outlook, in his youth the thrust and tenor of his poetry had been riotously iconoclastic and aggressive. The Magnetic Mountain was dedicated to Auden and hailed him as a winged explorer hovering like a bird over the landscape of England: Look west, Wystan, lone flyer, birdman, my bully boy . . . Gain altitude, Auden, then let the base beware] Migrate, chaste my kestrel, you need a change of air] This advice was, as we now know, taken literally. Auden did migrate, if not chastely, to New York. The 1930s pylon poets of which Auden had been the leader broke up as a group and Day Lewis was left isolated and insular. His response was to revert to more traditional forms, to embrace a neo-Georgian style in which rural pursuits, friendships, love-affairs, the joys and trials of parenthood, homage to other poets like Hardy or Edmund Blunden, formed the staple subject-matter. Some of these poems still make pleasant reading even though they lack the Audenesque fizz of the early ones. The most moving tend to derive from some private experience, such as his sense of the slow decline of his first marriage. The grief that inspired a poem often remains submerged beneath its surface. The reader who is not in the know feels excluded. Short footnotes by Jill Balcon help one to get one's bearings about many of the more public poems, but one day there will need to be an edition elucidating all the personal references and allusions. Meanwhile a glance at Sean Day Lewis's frank biography of his father C. Day Lewis: An English Literary Life (1980) will illuminate some of them. The impressive long poem in several sections A Visit To Italy was written in 1948-9, but not published until four years later. This was because - as Jill Balcon points out - 'Rosamond Lehmann with whom CDL had a long liaison until 1949 laid an embargo on its publication, which she lifted in 1953'. That explains the 'we' who are travelling and experiencing post-war Italy together in the poem and the elegaic note that sounds through its exaltation  -their great affair was indeed coming to an end. The section about Renaissance paintings gains from learning, from the biography, that part of the time they went to I Tatti to stay with Berenson. Day Lewis could sustain a long poem, but Noah and the Waters written in 1935 at the end of his dalliance with communism suggests he was wise to eschew verse drama. His strength lay in formal lyrics, odes and sonnet-sequences, as in the celebrated 'O Dreams O Destinations' and latterly in shorter, occasional poems. The book has a final section called Vers d'Occasion containing work published for the first time in collected form where, as poet laureate, Day Lewis wrote to fulfil a request - a poem in support of the I'm Backing Britain campaign, another heralding National Library Week, and yet another commemorating the Investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales. Day Lewis was a good poetic journalist, and at times rather more than that. Grigson's rusty hatchet should now be buried and the poems allowed to speak for themselves.</p>

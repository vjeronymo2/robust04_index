			<p>CSO     [Text] Rapid progress is being made on feasibility studies  envisioning the commercialization of personal handiphone systems  (PHS) touted as low-priced next-generation portable telephones.  Applications for licenses will be accepted for processing before  yearend and, if all goes well, PHS services will begin in fiscal  year 1995. They estimate that PHS unit installations will reach  10 million units in the 21st century, but the question is, will  the industry develop as anticipated by communications operators,  manufacturers, and government officials? The second installment  of this article will examine the issues which must be overcome  in the commercialization of PHS by analyzing the advantages and  disadvantages of PHS.    The Communication Equipment Industry Council-sponsored  "Communication Tokyo 94" opened on 5 April at the International  Exhibition Center at Harumi, Tokyo. The event was attended by  about 120,000 visitors during the four-day event ending on 8  April, but elaborately designed manufacturer display booths were  disregarded as crowds thronged to see demonstrations of PHS.    A total of 23 PHS units supplied by 20 different firms was  made available by the Feasibility Study Council, the sponsoring  agency, but interested parties swarmed the loan booth and there  was a 30-minute wait throughout the event in order to get to a  PHS unit for personal testing, and units on display could be  reached only by navigating one's way through the crowds. During  the event, PHS units were loaned out a total of 2,702 times,  meaning that each unit was checked out an average of 120 times.  Council sources say, "Conspicuous among the interested parties  were individuals who are not communication specialists." "PHS  fever" is expanding in breadth.    All the enthusiasm currently displayed in PHS is being  stimulated by news on feasibility studies underway in Tokyo.  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT[ and Dainidenden Inc. (DDI),  which initially ran experiments in Sapporo, started tests in  Tokyo in April and the Tokyo Electric Power Company group  started tests in Tokyo about the same time.    However, it appears that individuals visiting the displays  and using the PHS units on loan did not grasp their difference  from cellular units. Although they say the quality of voice  communication is better with the PHS, the basic telephone  functions are the same. The units are supposed to be smaller and  lighter than cellulars, but the advent of the outright sales  system in April was accompanied by the release of smaller and  lighter versions of cellulars, and differences between the two  types of telephones are hardly noticeable and difficult to  distinguish.    The foremost attraction of PHS is that user rates can be set  at a much lower level than that for cellulars. Industry sources  estimate the basic charge will be set at around 3,000-5,000 yen  compared to 7,000-9,000 yen for cellulars, and call charges will  be 20-30 yen per minute compared to 60-70 yen per minute for  cellulars. You might say that the foremost distinguishing factor  for PHS is that both basic charges and call rates are expected  to be 33 percent to 50 percent cheaper than for cellulars.    The low costs are attributable to the estimated cost for  installation of communication infrastructure for PHS, which, for  the 23 wards in Tokyo, is estimated to be one-sixth of that for  cellular systems on a per subscriber basis. The cost for  installing an operating station runs about three times that for  cellular for the same service areas, but a 20-fold increase in  subscriber capacity provides for a structure wherein an increase  in subscribers allows lower service rates.    Because of the high rates, cellulars are used primarily for  commercial purposes, but PHS provides conditions which make it  conducive for household use. Feasibility studies are underway in  Takamatsu city which have focused on that particular quality.    Principles involved in the feasibility study include six  electrical power company-affiliated communications firms such as  the Shikoku Telecommunication Network (STNet). Takamatsu city  has a population of about 400,000 and the feasibility study  covers an area of about five square kilometers including  commercial, retail and residential areas, thus enabling an  examination of use by household units. Tests in the Tokyo and  Sapporo areas did not include residential zones.    President Hajime Mizuguchi of STNet displays much enthusiasm  as he says, "The telephone business is indispensable in  expanding the operational scope of our firm. We hope to deal in  PHS systems on an independent basis to reduce the time it takes  for the exchange of information with Tokyo." The STNet test will  involve 132 stations, 500 PHS units, and 1 billion yen in  feasibility study costs.    An advantage for electrical power company-affiliated  communications firms is that they can use optical fiber networks  installed jointly with the electrical power companies. PHS  requires a digital network for location marking, but services  can be provided without using public digital networks, because  of the availability of an independent network.    Of the nine electrical power company-affiliated  communications firms, only the Tokyo Telecommunications Network  (TTNet) provides telephone services, but the systems is such  that a call cannot be made from the NTT side to the TTNet side.    In contrast, PHS is a two-way system and has the potential  of  growing into a system separate from that of the NTT system.  Electric power company-affiliated communication firms show an  interest in PHS for this very reason.    Needless to say, a boost in the variety of services provided  would translate into an increase in service fee revenues for  NTT. Even in the case of DDI, which plans to use NTT circuits,  President Takamura Okuyama states there is the advantage of  "providing integrated telephone services based on wireless  communication." Common among the interested firms is the strong  determination to realize corporate growth through the creation  of new demand.    All of the primary communications firms are participating in  feasibility studies because unlimited potential rests with PHS  systems which are expected to represent a huge market. The  battle to realize those dreams still lies ahead.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Gaza Strip work deal The Israeli army has struck a deal with Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip which will allow youths aged 18 and up to work in Israel, the head of Gaza's trade union said yesterday, Reuter reports from Gaza. In return, the Palestinian trade union in Gaza agreed to drop a Supreme Court case to force the army to lift age restrictions on workers. The army has banned Gazans under the age of 20 from working in Israel since a Gaza youth stabbed to death an Israeli schoolgirl in the city of Bat Yam last May.</p>

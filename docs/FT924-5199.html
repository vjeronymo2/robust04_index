			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: C &amp; W in renewed demand A RANGE of positive stories helped drive shares in Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W), the telecoms group, to a 10-year high of 678p. They closed a fraction off the top, settling 19 firmer at 675p. Among many stories in the market was a suggestion that Cazenove, the company's broker, had adopted a much more positive stance on the stock. C &amp; W is currently making presentations to Scottish institutions and is also due to embark on a trip to the US next week to address US investment institutions. But suggestions that the group might be about to make a secondary issue of ADR's were treated with scepticism by telecoms specialists. There were also rumours that Cable may be considering the sale of another substantial block of shares in HK Telecom in which it retains a near 60 per cent stake. Other dealers said the shares had absorbed some sizeable selling pressure triggered by the recent strains between the Chinese and the UK Government over the handover of power. Forte focus Acquisition talk once again focused around Forte as the trade press suggested that the hotel group was considering bidding for the Sheraton international chain. However, the rumour was dismissed by industry observers as highly speculative, given Forte's debt position and its current attempts to sell the Gardner Merchant catering subsidiary. There were also suggestions that the death of Sir Hugh Wontner, a main shareholder and president of the Savoy group, might revive Forte's bid to control the luxury hotel chain. Sir Hugh was the principal protagonist against the bitterly contested bid for the Savoy group by Forte which ended in 1989 with Forte controlling 42 per cent of Savoy and having boardroom representation. Significantly Forte agreed not to buy any more Savoy shares until 1994. Savoy shares jumped 40 to 485p yesterday while Forte was a penny firmer at 173p. GKN under pressure Shares in GKN came under pressure after several brokers downgraded profit expectations following cautious remarks from the company chairman regarding the near term trading outlook. His remarks came at a dinner for analysts in France on Wednesday evening. The early damage appeared to have been wrought by Hoare Govett, now said to be predicting current year profits of Pounds 140m, and by Kleinwort Benson which reiterated its negative stance on the stock. At worst, the shares were down 9 at 390p but later recovered to end 6 1/2 p lighter at 392 1/2 p. However, Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney favoured the stock. ICI shares were weak on reaction to a stock overhang and a sell recommendation from Baring Securities. Baring argues that after the company's planned split the new chemicals and pharmaceuticals groups will each pay only 20p in dividend, reflecting a 27 per cent dividend cut and that shares in the two groups will have a combined value of 1025p. That is 75p higher than the figure suggested by recent Smith New Court analysis but Baring says the stock is vulnerable ahead of results in February and the shares should be sold down to 900p. ICI fell 13 to 981p. Wellcome was weak in early trading falling to 1012p at one stage on profit-taking following strong rises over the past week. However, the shares recovered as the selling died and closed 4 better at 1032p. Seton Healthcare dropped 11 to 281p after announcing a one-for-four rights issue at 240p a share to raise Pounds 13.1m. The company will use part of the cash to buy pharmaceutical group Cupal for Pounds 8.2m. Both classes of BT shares, the fully-paid and partly-paid, staged a determined advance with some dealers taking the view that the shares will soon launch an attack on the all-time high of 421 1/2 p, reached last October. Specialists said the market was reflected perceptions that the proposed sale next year of some or all of the Government's remaining 21.9 per cent stake in the group, some 1.35bn shares, could be preceded by a build up of institutional demand for the stock. 'There is the possibility that institutions may have their allocations of BT III shares linked to their existing holdings,' said one analyst. BT fully-paid closed 7 1/2 higher at 406 1/2 p on turnover of 2.1m while the partly-paid ended 6 higher at 301p on 9.4m traded. Critchley, the manufacturer of electrical cable accessories, made a successful market debut, climbing to 240p and closing at 237p, compared with the placing price of 220p. Plasterboard manufacturer BPB shocked the market by chopping the interim dividend by a third. 'All the the market bulls of the shares and most of the bears had been confidently expecting the company to hold the payment,' said one dealer. The reduction in the payment was made all the worse by the company announcing interim profits up 14.5 per cent at Pounds 27.5m - at the very top of the range. There was little respite for the shares despite a reasonably polished post-results meeting between the company and building analysts. Full-year profits estimates were being reigned in to the low to mid-Pounds 50m's with a consensus figure for next year of around Pounds 80m. The dividend total for this year is generally expected to be 7.5p. BPB closed 18 down at 172p. Turnover in Cannon Street Investments leapt to 7.1m shares and the share price jumped by more than 40 per cent as selling pressure on the mini-conglomerate was taken up. The stock rose 2 to 6 3/4 p but still a long way below its 80p level a year ago. Results in line with expectations initially lifted shares in Northern Foods, although they later faded following the post-results meeting. Marking the shares a 'dull hold', Mr Carl Short at Nomura said that worries had emerged over the stock's premium rating but sub-market earnings per share growth. The stock retreated 8 to 279p. However, remarks by Northern's chairman over food price inflation were interpreted as good for food retailers. Argyll rose 10 to 373p, Sainsbury 11 to 509p and Tesco 9 1/2 to 248p. Bumper turnover of 25m in Asda saw the shares edge 2 3/4 on optimism that the group may be admitted to the FT-SE 100 in the near future. International drinks group Allied Lyons was hit by speculation that its broker Cazenove had unofficially downgraded the stock, although official confirmation was said to be held back until after the Allied's results next week. Cazenove refused to comment on the rumour. The shares tumbled 15 to 643p. Whisky distiller Macdonald Martin slid 70 to 400p after revealing a profits slump. Big turnover and continued takeover speculation helped Queens Moat Houses climb 3 to 46p with 12m shares traded. The market remains convinced that the hotel group will announce a tie-up with the Bass's Holiday Inn operations. Fresh buy notes on Thorn EMI from Hoare Govett and County NatWest helped the leisure conglomerate continue its post-results surge and gain 12 to 816p. Rank Organisation bounced back from recent weakness adding 19 at 625p. Tentative optimism over US recovery helped stocks with North American exposure. Among them, Reuters Holdings lifted 13 to 1294p as it rebounded after weakness prompted by a convertible bond redemption announcement on Wednesday. Among engineers, APV were in favour and the shares added 3 to 104p. Broker Albert E Sharp which was reported to have visited the company earlier this week is said to favour the stock. Talk that the company would soon make disposals also benefited the shares. Also in demand was British Steel in which some 9m shares were dealt. The shares firmed 4 to 53 1/2 p. Rolls-Royce continued to be a busy trade with volume reaching 7m as the shares eased  1/2 to 95 1/2 p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (88). AMERICANS (14) Amer. Express, BankAmerica, Beth.

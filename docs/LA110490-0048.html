			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR BY JAMES DICKEY  </P> <P> Air, much greater than the sea --  </P> <P> More basic, more human than the sea: all that air  </P> <P> Is calm:  </P> <P> unpeopled, wearing the high lucidity  </P> <P> Of vigil. Maybe one day the mere surface  </P> <P> Of the earth will feel you.  </P> <P> But the air  </P> <P> You can never keep doesn't know  </P> <P> When it lived in your chest:  </P> <P> Mindless, nerveless, breathless,  </P> <P> The air glitters  </P> <P> All the outside, and keeps carrying  </P> <P> You from within.  </P> <P> From the poem, "Immortals," excerpted from "The Eagle's Mile" by James Dickey  (University Press of New England: $20; $9.95, paper; 65 pp.). "What I looked  for here," Dickey says about this collection, "was a flicker of light 'from  another direction,' and when I caught it -- or thought I did -- I have followed  where it went, for better or worse." 1990 by James Dickey.

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / People: Seeboard Seeboard is adding to its complement of non-executive directors with the appointment of Peter Dean, deputy chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Jim Ellis, chief executive, says that as well as lowering the average age of the board - Dean is 53 years old and two of the five non-executives are over 65 - the new recruit will have a valuable input on all MMC-related matters in the future. In another area of the business, industry regulator Offer has already warned it may refer the two privatised power generators, National Power and PowerGen, to the MMC. Dean was known to Seeboard because its non-executive chairman Sir Keith Stuart is chairman of Associated British Ports where Dean is on the board. A freelance business consultant, he has been a member of the MMC since 1982 and deputy chairman since 1990. He was on the board of RTZ from 1974 to 1985, having joined the company as a solicitor in 1966. Among other current appointments, Dean lists his directorship of Liberty Life Assurance Company and chairmanship of Highgate Counselling Centre.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MURPHY CLEARS WAIVERS, MAY GO TO PHILLIES  </P> <P> Atlanta Braves outfielder Dale Murphy has cleared major league waivers for a  possible trade to the Philadelphia Phillies, but the veteran slugger said  there's a lot of talking to be done before he agrees to a deal.  </P> <P> "I haven't talked contract yet.  </P> <P> No firm decisions have been made," Murphy said. He is in the final year of a  three-year contract and could become a free agent at the end of the season.  </P> <P> As a veteran of more than 10 years who has been with the same team for more  than five years, Murphy has veto power over any trade.  </P> <P> "There are some discussions that have taken place. A lot of things have to be  weighed. I really couldn't tell you when something might happen," the Atlanta  Constitution quoted Murphy as saying in Houston, where the Braves open a series  with the Astros today.  </P> <P> The trade talk says Murphy would go to Philadelphia for right-handed reliever  Jeff Parrett and a second player.  </P> <P> Phillies General Manager Lee Thomas confirmed that such a trade has been  discussed.  </P> <P> If completed, it would end a 14-year relationship between Atlanta and possibly  its best-loved athlete of the '80s.  </P> <P> Parrett also cleared major league waivers Wednesday afternoon. Had any other  team claimed either player, the trade would have been off.  </P> <P> Murphy, 34, joined the Braves in 1976.  </P> <P> He is a two-time National League most valuable player and a seven-time  All-Star.  </P></p>

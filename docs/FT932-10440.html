			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Allied consensus on Bosnia close, says Clinton PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that he thought the US and its allies were close to reaching 'a common policy' on the next moves in the Bosnian conflict. 'I think we have to turn up the heat and keep the pressure on,' Mr Clinton said, adding that he had the 'feeling' that an allied consensus could be reached 'fairly shortly'. He dismissed differences with Europe as 'disagreement round the edges of what tactical steps should be done'. In Rome, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said that 'some military action' could be justified under existing United Nations authorisation but a wider engagement would probably require additional Security Council approval. He said he had found broad agreement in Europe on the need for an 'assertive, effective programme' of action. The new Italian government threw its weight behind firmer action against the Bosnian Serbs but insisted any initiative had to be within the context of the UN. In Bosnia, the eastern Moslem enclave of Zepa, declared a 'safe zone' in a Security Council resolution on Thursday, was yesterday again reported to be under heavy fire from the Bosnian Serbs. Sarajevo radio said more than 200 people had been killed and 300 wounded since the assault began on Tuesday. Despite promises by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, that his men would comply with the UN resolution, General Philippe Morillon, the UN commander, was again unable to reach agreement with General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military chief, to send unarmed UN observers to Zepa. Lord Owen, the EC negotiator, urged the US to send troops to join the UN humanitarian operations. He argued that US negotiations with European allies would have been 'much easier' if US forces had already been on the ground. Air strikes could help tilt the military balance but only if conducted 'with great skill and care'. Any further announcement is likely to depend on weekend talks between Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher. Doubts on sealed border, Page 2</p>

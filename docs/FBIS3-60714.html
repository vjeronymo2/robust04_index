			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Solomenko report: ``No Nuclear Criminals </F> Discovered in Kaliningrad'']    [Text] St. Petersburg -- Two articles that have appeared  recently in the Russian press have the potential to sow panic  among the populations of a number of countries and cause a major  international furor. They present their readers with a  ``megatonne'' sensation: A breakdown situation has developed at  five nuclear weapons storage facilities located on Russia's  western border near Kaliningrad. These items also reported  another rather sinister episode: Apparently, the chief engineer  at the Ignalina Nuclear Electric Power Station ``was caught  introducing a virus that he had developed himself into the  computer that regulates the station's work; his intention was to  knock out the security system.''    Moreover, this staggering information came from a fully  competent official source--Dmitriy Sorokin, chief of the Russian  Gosatomnadzor [Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation  Safety] North European District Inspectorate--who, it is  alleged, had just carried out an inquiry into defense storage  facilities off his own bat. These articles, which quoted the  ECO DEFENCE INFORM information bulletin published in  Kaliningrad, were published by the SEA digest.    More than anyone else, the people who were most shocked by  these sensational reports were...the actual staff of  Gosatomnadzor's North European District.    A special investigation was commissioned by the district  leadership. It showed that the clamorous ``facts'' cited in the  interview were actually arrant nonsense. It turned out that  Dmitriy Sorokin had of course not inspected the local military  storage facilities. And he had basically not made any  statements to the press.    Who would have benefited by organizing such a provocative  hoax? Here is the view of Yuriy Khripunov, chief public  relations specialist with Gosatomnadzor's North European  District:    ``The information (or, to be more precise, disinformation)  fed to the correspondent was given out by a man impersonating  Sorokin. We have `figured out' this impostor. To be more  precise, he is a businessman from Kaliningrad who in exchange  for good money would take radiation pollution measurements of  dacha plots and market goods without having appropriate  permission to do so, without possessing a specially certified  apparatus, and without having the slightest professional  knowledge in the field of radiation monitoring. Sorokin had  unmasked this enterprising shyster and brought his illegal  `business' to a halt. Whereupon the latter clearly decided to  take revenge on the chief of the inspectorate in such an elegant  manner.''    But it is still too early to close the file on this story  for  another reason. Even having exposed this scandalous  disinformation, Gosatomnadzor finds itself unable to calm public  opinion. Because Gosatomnadzor itself does not know the real  state of our nuclear defense storage facilities, are they not  fraught with the danger of full-blown accidents? Unfortunately,  nobody knows whether this is true except the military themselves  who are religiously keeping their military-departmental secret  and do not allow Gosatomnadzor inspectors into their  installations.    Meanwhile, back on 5 June 1992, the Russian president  approved the Statute on Gosatomnadzor: ``Gosatomnadzor...makes  decisions within the limits of its competence which are binding  for...military units stationed on Russian Federation  territory....''    And on 9 April 1993 a new presidential directive was  published. It states the task even more specifically: ``Before  1 December 1993 Russian Gosatomnadzor is to investigate  enterprises, organizations, and military units...under the  Russian Ministry of Defense in order to check the maintenance of  nuclear and radiation safety.''    But neither the first nor the second directive from the  state's highest executive officer was implemented.</p>

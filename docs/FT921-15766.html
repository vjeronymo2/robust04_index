			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Farmers relieved as Bush takes heat off rice imports JAPANESE farmers welcomed US President George Bush with an invitation to visit the 'beautiful, pastoral side of Japan' and a warning that they remain determined in the fight against the opening of the country's rice market. In an unusual full-page newspaper advertisement, the Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives, which represents 5m farmers, expressed its support for a 'new world order'. However, they insisted this new order should not include rice imports by Japan. Japanese farmers are relieved that the motor trade has become the most important issue on the Bush agenda, having feared that they would be the prime target of US criticism and that the Japanese government would be under heavy pressure to make a concession on rice imports. Instead, Japanese car makers have been pressed to increase purchases of foreign parts and to remove obstacles to the sale of foreign cars in Japan, while concern over opening the rice market has eased. Several Japanese politicians have suggested that the rice market should be opened, but Tokyo is now confident that the issue will be settled in the longer-term through the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Before Mr Bush's arrival, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, proposed that Japan examine the possibility of replacing the import ban with a tariff regime, but gave no pledge on this politically sensitive issue. Japanese negotiators, who want to convince the domestic audience that they are resisting foreign pressure, intend to wait until the US and EC reach agreement on farm trade before making a concession. This is, in part, because farmers' groups say they will vote against the ruling Liberal Democratic Party at an Upper House election this summer if the government allows imports. In spite of the farmers' threats, Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister and an LDP faction head, has insisted that Japan introduce tariffs, but suggests that it could effectively limit the opening to 5 per cent of the 10m-tonne market by imposing a 700 per cent tariff on imported rice. The shift in US attention to the Japanese car industry is particularly welcomed by the farmers' groups, which have argued that they are threatened by imports because the aggressiveness of Japanese manufacturers has created a huge trade surplus. The advertisement described the 'farming regions of the US Midwest' and the rice paddies of Japan as the 'heartland' of each country. 'We may be able to import automobiles from your country, but farmlands of such immeasurable value just cannot be imported.'</p>

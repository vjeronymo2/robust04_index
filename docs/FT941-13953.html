			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): LVMH extends decline as Paris slips back Bourses were lower on balance, but seemed unaffected by the news from Japan, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS slipped back, having tested 2,260 at one point. The CAC-40 index closed down 13.84 at 2,243.97, a week's loss of 0.8 per cent. Turnover was FFr5.2bn. Investors continued to focus on LVMH following Thursday's restructuring of its cross shareholdings with Guinness of the UK. It weakened FFr50 to FFr3,849, some 5 per cent lower over the week. The group commented yesterday that its sale of a 34 per cent stake in Moet Hennessy to Guinness would help long-term profitability. James Capel, sceptical about the group's strategy, commented that a further de-rating of the stock could be expected, particularly as it had sold one of its prized assets at the bottom of the cycle. Among related issues Christian Dior gained FFr10 to FFr370 and Bon Marche fell FFr15 to FFr720. St Gobain was among the most active stocks after reporting better than expected 1993 figures. The shares gained FFr46 or 7.4 per cent to FFr664, with some switching out of Lafarge Coppee seen as the building materials group lost FFr13.30 to FFr459.20. Suez dropped FFr3.30 to FFr344.50 and had no comment to make on reports that it might be considering the sale of its Groupe Victoire unit. FRANKFURT's nervous depression was exaggerated by falling DAX futures prices and selling on the DTB options expiry deadline. The DAX index closed 40.59 lower at 2,075.61, down 3.1 per cent on the week. Turnover, inflated by the 'double-witching' in options and a large, associated sell order from a foreign investment house, rose from DM9bn to DM13.7bn. The Ibis-indicated DAX eased only slightly in the post-bourse but Mr Jens Wiecking, at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that there had been big afternoon corrections, indicating US selling, three times in the last ten days. In addition, he said, there was weakness in the bond market, with the bund future breaking a medium term uptrend. AMSTERDAM was swayed by technical factors on the expiry of futures and options, and the AEX index closed the day up 3.54 at 428.42, a week's rise of 1.8 per cent. The major issues diverged widely with Royal Dutch, for example, rising Fl 1.90 to Fl 212.00 and Unilever down 70 cents at Fl 226.20. Among the smaller issues, Sphinx, the sanitary ware and ceramic tile manufacturer, added to Thursday's Fl 4.00 gain with a rise of Fl 4.50 to Fl 51.50, on news that it was to acquire Gustavsberg of Sweden, which operates in the same sector. MILAN picked up from early losses as domestic and foreign investors resumed buying. The Comit index finished 4.10 lower at 613.61, for a 1.8 per cent rise over the week. Montedison added L31.40 to L996.50, in volume of 97.3m shares: this week's huge volume figures have prompted speculation that one investor might be building a hefty stake, although analysts note that many institutions are rebuilding their holdings, having been short of the stock in recent months. Insurers began lower, continuing the trend of recent days amid concerns about delays in reimbursements from the state insurer INA. Generali picked up late in the day to finish L380 higher at L38,470 and SAI was L115 higher at L17,679. ZURICH was easier before lower January inflation data for the city triggered some buying during the afternoon. The SMI index finished down 6.6 at 3,039.3, 1.6 per cent higher on the week. Oerlikon-Buhrle picked up SFr2.50 to SFr140 in response to its forecast of higher 1993 profits after the market closed on Thursday. STOCKHOLM rallied in late trading helped by strong overseas interest, but the Affarsvarlden general index still lost 13.5 to 1,546.2, up 2.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr2.8bn. Volvo B slipped another SKr10 to SKr634. After a firm share price rise since December, the carmaker has been affected recently by worries over its long term direction and, particularly, its relationship with Renault of France. ATHENS recovered after the corrections of Wednesday and Thursday, the general index rising 17.26, or 1.5 per cent higher at 1,149.37, up 3.9 per cent on a volatile week. ISTANBUL dropped 3.5 per cent amid profit-taking triggered by a surge in short-term interest rates to prop up the lira. The composite index fell 951.94 to a provisional 26,072.92, down 9 per cent on the week.

Bezkorovaynyy.    He expresses thanks in it to the bankers for their patriotic  attitude toward the problems of building the Ukrainian Fleet.  The sailors also provide assurances that the funds sent by the  bank will be utilized to build housing for Ukrainian sailors and  provide social protections for them. The telegram from the  vice-admiral is a reaction to the noble deed of the employees of  the Prominvestbank administration, who at the end of last year  allocated a hefty sum to one of the military units for the  construction of housing and other needs of the sailors.</p>

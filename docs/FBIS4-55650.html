			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anca Lazarescu: "What Is the Special </F> Telecommunications Service, What Does It Aim To Do, and To Whom  Is It Subordinated?"; all figures as published]    [Text] On 7 June 1993 MONITORUL OFICIAL published  Government Decision No. 229 of 27 May 1993 "on certain measures  related to the organization and functioning of the Special  Telecommunications Service" [Serviciul de Telecomunicatii  Speciale -- STS]. Assuming the very likely hypothesis that our  readers have never heard of that so-called "special" service  before, we have to reassure them that there is no reason for  them to be excessively worried or surprised, because it had  already functioned before the aforementioned government decision  was published -- originally within the DIE [Department for  Foreign Intelligence] and, after the revolution, within the  Ministry of National Defense. Aside from this, our readers can  be "relaxed" also considering that our parliamentary  representatives know exactly as little about STS as they do.  Or, at least, that is what some of them claim. Being aware or  not of what the STS actually is, quite soon our representatives  will have to take a vote on the budget of that institution. In  the draft law on the state budget, the government earmarked 21  billion lei for the STS. Is that a lot or is it little? It  depends on the angle from which one looks at it. Making a  simple comparison, let us merely remark that for the Ministry of  Telecommunications the 1994 state budget allots 8.4 billion lei.  I let you reach your own conclusions.    Article 1 of the government decision signed by Prime  Minister  Nicolae Vacaroiu, Finance Minister Florin Georgescu, [former]  Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu, and Telecommunications  Minister Andrei Chirica stipulates: "The STS is a special  central body in the domain of special telecommunications."    Thus, as a "central body," the STS is actually a kind of a  governmental structure. As a matter of fact, Article 4  stipulates: "The STS is led by a director, the office of whom is  equivalent to those of secretaries of state, while the office of  his deputies to those of undersecretaries of state."    Basically, "the organization, the functioning, and the  principal attributions of the STS are established by the Supreme  Defense Council of the country." (Article 2)    The STS cooperates with the institutions belonging to the  national defense system, but also with the Ministry of  Telecommunications, in accordance with Article 3, carrying out  the following activities:    a) Administers, develops, and exploits special telephone  communication networks and data transmission networks;    b) Administers, develops, and exploits the TO  [Telecomunicatii Operative] interurban teleconference network;    c) Administers, develops, and exploits the special  radio-communications network, which consists of stationary and  mobile radio-communication networks and radio relays;    d) Manages the radio-electric frequency spectrum used by the  government;    e) Ensures the protection of the telecommunication networks  being responsible for the carrying out of the activities of  radio-electronic surveillance, special technical checking  measures, and the introduction of appropriate codifying  [aparatura secretizata] equipment;    f) Carries out or approves all investments and equipping  works in the domain of special telecommunications listed in the  appendix of the present decision;    g) Carries out collateral activities needed for the  achievement of the goals of its activity: Ensures its own  technical-material supplies, including importations in  concordance with the current legislation, engages in technical  and informational research and design, and ensures training,  medical assistance, and social-cultural activity for its  personnel;    h) Ensures liaison with international bodies in that branch.    To this lengthy list of clouded and uncontrollable  activities  (the National Defense Council can supplement them by assigning  it further tasks!) the STS is to carry out, let us add the  explanations given by Tatiana Francu, the head of the STS  Department for Relations with the Public, explanations that were  published in the review EXPRES in virtue of the right to reply:  "The STS is a special military body in the domain of  telecommunications, working for the public authority and the  central and territorial bodies of the state administration, and  which ensures the cooperation link among the institutions  belonging to the national defense system."   <H5>    The Special Telecommunications Service </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The State Budget Over 1994 (in thousands of lei)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total expenditures                    |20,995,700                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Running expenditures                  |13,390,300                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Personnel expenditures                |7,092,200                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Expenditures for materials and servic-|6,298,100                             |  |es                                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capital expenditures                  |7,605,400                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  The Ministry of Telecommunications </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The State Budget over 1994 (in thousands of lei)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total expenditures                    |8,400,356                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Running expenditures                  |841,900                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Personnel expenditures                |367,425                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Expenditures for materials and servic-|474,555                               |  |es                                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capital expenditures                  |7,558,376                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PUBLIC AUTHORITIES                    |484,000                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Running expenditures                  |459,000                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Personnel expenditures                |362,700                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Expenditures for materials and servic-|96,300                                |  |es                                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capital expenditures                  |25,000                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Will the STS Take Over One Part of the "Tasks" of the </H5> Romanian Intelligence Service?    Everything would be all right, as it is normal that such a  service should exist, if there were no doubts in connection with  the way in which the STS was founded and the goals it actually  pursues. The mystery surrounding it and the lack of any  democratic control over its activity obviously generate  suspicion.    According to the report elaborated by the APADOR [expansion  unknown] Association--Helsinki Committee, Government Decision  No. 229 of 1993 is unconstitutional, because according to  Article 107 of the Constitution, "government decisions are  issued to organize the carrying out of laws." However, in this  case there is no law the implementation of which would make  necessary the setting up of the aforementioned service. What is  even more, Article 1 of the government decision does not even  mention the setting up of the service, but rather resumes purely  and simply to define it.    On the other hand, if this service is really a military body  working for the institutions of the national defense system, in  that case, according to Article 117 of the constitution, the STS  could not possibly have been set up without Parliament's passing  an organic law on its establishment. However, if the STS does  not have a military nature, then why does the government  decision fail to define what "special telecommunications" are  and why is it that "the special telecommunication networks  detailed in the appendix to the present decision are sent to the  interested persons, only"? Regardless of how one looks at it,  Government Decision No. 229 contradicts the Constitution.    Unfortunately, Parliament can in no way exert control over  this service. According to the Law on National Security, the  number of intelligence services is limited to six. The STS is  not mentioned among them. Until now Parliament has been  exerting control solely over one of them, namely the SRI  [Romanian Intelligence Service].    Could it be that the STS was founded especially to take over  one part of the SRI's activity (such as the wiretapping of  telephone conversations) and thus bypass any control? Under the  circumstances of the total lack of openness and the numerous  ambiguities they make use of, everything is possible.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Some roubles more equal than others: The implications of a controversial currency decision on economic reforms in Russia It had been going so well. Though the Russians are masters of illusion, much economic news over the past two weeks has been good, with a basis in reality. The inflation rate came down from the near hyper-levels of early this year to about 17 per cent a month. The central bank raised its interest rate 10 days ago to 170 per cent - which, because of the Russian system of charging interest on a monthly basis, makes the yearly rate close to the annual inflation rate of about 750 per cent. As important, said one western banker in Moscow, was the breakthrough in the bank's intellectual stance: its actions were an acknowledgement that money has a cost, and the cost should be borne by the borrower. Other measures were starting to take effect: the coal price had been liberalised (though its effects have been delayed); a government budget had been prepared with a Rbs11-12 trillion deficit which - assuming foreign assistance of not less than Dollars 3bn this year - was consistent with a deficit target of 5 per cent of gross national product by the end of the year, the level agreed with the International Monetary Fund; sharp falls in production were levelling off and in a few sectors a modest rise had even appeared; the rouble had appreciated against the dollar, hauling itself back over the 1,000 to 1 level. But the economy remains at a delicate turning point and the shoots of reform are still fragile. As Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance, said recently, high inflation discouraged investment, and was still capable of soaring. Privatisation has driven ahead, but few companies have been restructured and there has been little change in management behaviour. Russian exports are now almost wholly based on industries such as oil, diamonds, gold, gas, coal - and the greatest of these, oil, is rapidly declining as oil wells fall out of production and there is a shortage of investment capital to get them working again. The criminalisation of Russian business takes on huge and dangerous proportions. There have been three highly publicised shoot-outs between gang members in central Moscow in the past month. Businesses at the very least avoid tax, while state companies are stripped of their assets by their managers, who often 'own' parts of them following privatisation. Most of the money is shipped abroad to foreign bank accounts at a rate estimated this week by Mr Oleg Lobov, first deputy prime minister for economics, to be running at Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn a year. Foreign investment is, considering the size of the country, negligible - in spite of there being 15 to 20 different committees, associations and companies created to 'assist' foreign investment. Energy prices are still minuscule, and it is proving increasingly difficult to raise them. A sustained effort on the part of the government, led by President Boris Yeltsin, to persuade the European Community to drop quotas aimed at Russian commodities flooding into member countries, has had no effect: the EC still considers Russia to be a 'state trading nation'. Politically, the reformists within the government are few and under siege - their one (and considerable) support is the president himself. Last week, the Russian parliament passed a series of measures aimed at bringing the radical State Privatisation Committee under ministerial control: taking licences away from foreign banks; and fixing the budget deficit at Rbs22 trillion, or 25 per cent of GNP. Though the government has relied increasingly on presidential decrees to push through legislation and on a weakening of parliamentary influence to continue the momentum for reform, the political gridlock remained unsolved. Thus the announcement on Saturday that the central bank had decreed all pre-1993 roubles as worthless from Monday and that citizens had two weeks in which to exchange a maximum of Rbs35,000 (Dollars 35) for new notes, came in a highly charged political context - in which some confidence was starting to return both to Russian citizens and foreigners working here, but only just. The main issue is whether the move signals a return of what have been termed  -by (the unconsulted) Mr Fyodorov - as 'Stalinist, socialist' methods. Or is it an aberrant decision, damaging but not fatal? As details began to emerge of how the decision was taken, it seems that it may have been cleared at the top before it was announced. Mr Victor Gerashchenko,the central bank chairman, told the daily Izvestiya in a typically ambiguous interview that 'the highest responsible officials of the country were informed about the issue'. He told the newspaper that the parliamentary administration had been told, and drew its attention to the fact that Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, had not directly said he did not know in advance. (Mr Khasbulatov's original comment, reported by the official Tass news agency on Sunday, was a mild request that citizens should not suffer unduly from the move: only on Monday did he emerge in full-throated opposition, blaming the government and its 'crazy monetarist policy' for it.) Mr Gerashchenko also obliquely drew the president into the sphere of those who knew, noting that Mr Yeltsin's 'softening' of the original bank decree, by extending the limit of money changed to Rbs100,000 and the time period to the end of August, did not include a hint that 'in principle he did not approve of these measures'. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, was reported to have been the only senior figure who - in the inner cabinet meeting of last Friday night during which ministers were informed of the decision - voiced criticism of it. In the republics, the decree appears to be having its intended effect. Some five apart from Russia - Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - have said, with a good or ill grace, that they will continue to use the rouble and will, sooner or later, exchange the old notes for new. Four - Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Turkmenistan - are to hasten their introduction of a new currency. An unambiguously Russian currency has been created, but the 'good' in this may be hugely outweighed by the bad. It is likely that old notes will flood back into Russia, to be exchanged at a present rate of 2:1 with the new, thus at least temporarily stoking inflation. Second, the republics which are staying within the rouble zone have agreed no new 'rules of the game' with the Russian government and the central bank. No mechanism of control of the currency has been created, no new financial practices set in place. Without these, life can be expected to go on much as before. The trust of the population in their money and in authorities which would safeguard its value has been gravely damaged, if not lost. The pensioners struggling to change bundles of greasy Soviet roubles in the crush of the grimy Savings Banks, the holidaymakers stranded in the Black Sea with worthless old roubles, the harassed women in the queues at state shops having their money refused and unable to get change for their purchases because the shop has no new notes - all have been reminded that those at the top remain careless of citizens' rights and convenience. In the ranks of the foreign governments which had jointly presented Russia with a package of support costed at some Dollars 44bn earlier this year, the fear is now that the government is hopelessly split and cannot deliver a stabilisation of the currency which some foreign experts and officials believed was possible this year. Mr Fyodorov, who inherited Mr Yegor Gaidar's mantle as the main burden-carrier of economic reform, has been publicly humiliated by being so casually bypassed in a crucial financial development. He returns from Washington today, having blasted the decision in terms so unambiguous that it seems all but impossible he could be reconciled to the president's compromise. As of yesterday evening, he had given no sign of his intentions. However, he is thought to be in fighting mood and determined to return to Moscow to attempt to reverse the decision. At the very least, the affair demonstrates that the Russian power structure is thin, disorganised and lacking in the reflexes of a truly civil governance: and that the pull to reform is fraught with the danger of reaction. A struggle within the government, subterranean for the past month, is now openly joined and on its outcome depends the fate of the economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [[Editorial by General Manager Luis Miro Quesada G.: "And </F> Where Is the Democratic Contract?"    [Text] If a State governed by law does not exist or the law  is not observed, if a balance and independence of powers does  not exist or is not observed, if human rights do not exist or  are not observed, then governmental democracy does not exist.  Nor does it exist if the rights of persons are disregarded and  abused. And that is what is happening today in Peru and what has  been borne out in the recent "La Cantuta" and "Vaticano" cases.    In suddenly passing a law to prevent the "La Cantuta" case  from being ventilated in the court of original jurisdiction,  what the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] has perpetrated  signifies, to my understanding, that the 5 April 1992 breach of  constitutionality continues in force, that the CCD is a  formalism, and that we are continuing under a civil-military  regime. The responsibility for this, in history, must be borne  by Mr. Fujimori.    Not only the congressmen of the minority but also recognized  authorities in matters of constitutional law fully agree on the  legal flaws in the act that was recently passed by the CCD  majority. Basing my comments on their authoritative opinions, I  shall refer succinctly to each of these flaws.    First, the scandalous and illegal parliamentary procedure  invoked to pass that law. Scandalous because it was introduced  suddenly for immediate enactment, without going through  committee proceedings, and was reported out for promulgation  without awaiting its enactment, and without even awaiting the  minority's motion for reconsideration. Illegal because,  according to the Constitution adopted recently by those same  congressmen: "Absent an exception stipulated in the By-Laws of  the Congress, no bill shall be given the force of law without  having been previously reported out by the Standing Committee  concerned." I do not know, but it would be absurd were the  by-laws to contemplate such exception for a law of this  importance to the country's judicial institution.    Second, the intrinsic unconstitutionality of the law that  was  passed, in that it was enacted not because of the nature of  things but specifically to satisfy a special interest in an  immediate political action. It is public knowledge that,  following Pease's denunciation in the CCD, the top military  echelon has been maneuvering to bring the investigation of the  "La Cantuta" case under the military's special jurisdiction. In  the view of all the jurists, it is more than evident that the  case of the La Cantuta massacre does not properly fall within  the competency of the military tribunals, because it does not  derive from the military's functions, for it is not credible  that those functions include the assassination of students. The  case clearly falls within the competency of the ordinary courts,  involving as it does the assassination of civilians. And this is  set forth in the Penal Code.    For these reasons, the civil investigating judge, Cubas  Villanueva, placed an official written request on the military  tribunal that it transfer the case to the court having original  jurisdiction. This request, having been refused, produced a  jurisdictional dispute. As set forth in the law, the solution of  that dispute devolves upon the Criminal Division of the Supreme  Court of Justice, and requires four votes in favor of one  jurisdiction or the other. In executive session, the Criminal  Division vote was three for the military jurisdiction and two  for the ordinary jurisdiction, thus requiring under the law that  another Supreme Court magistrate be called in to cast a vote. At  this point, however, the Congress stepped in and passed a law  providing that for the determination of competency only a simple  majority is required, and stipulating, in an incredible  aberration, that this provision "is applicable to all  proceedings presently in course, without requiring new voting."  Thus, under its true name, it is a law determining that the La  Cantuta case is to be tried by the military tribunals.    Third, the law thus passed is illegal and therefore not  enforceable, because it cannot replace the provisions of an  organic law, which is of a higher category and specifies that  the deciding votes must be four in number. It is contrary to the  Constitution, in that, according to Article 139, "No authority  may take over a pending case that is before the courts"--which  this is--"nor interfere in the exercise of the functions of the  courts." It is doubly contrary to the Constitution because,  according to Article 103, "No law has retroactive force nor  retroactive effect..."; and to stipulate in the new law that it  is applicable immediately to proceedings in course is to enact a  retroactive provision.    Fourth, and gravest of all, the CCD's action obviously  constitutes an intolerable intrusion by the Legislative Power  upon the Judicial Power. As the CAL [Lima Bar Association] has  aptly put it: "The intrusion by Congress, with a lack of  conscientiousness that contradicts its constituent nature, and  contradicts the brand new Constitution of 1993, is inadmissible,  representing as it does a virtual coup d'etat by the Legislative  Power against the independence and freedom of the Judicial  Power."    But the Judicial Power could have asserted its freedom and  independence by disavowing such an aberrant law. And to this  end, the Supreme Court justices need only have met in Plenary  Session and declared that they would continue with the procedure  for defining competency in accordance with the norms set forth  in the Court's organic law. Lamentably, and despite the public  outcry, they did not do so; and in an act of submissiveness  rather than of independence, they again permitted the Judicial  Power to be trampled under foot, as they did on 5 April. This  attests to the fact that, in Peru, independence of the Powers is  nonexistent; that a democratic State governed by law does not  exist; that, beyond mere formalisms, the Legislative, bowing to  an Executive dictum, hastens to pass a law that violates the  very Constitution the Legislative has enacted; and that the  Judicial hastens to accept it as valid. It is repulsive, but not  surprising; because the magistrates who voted in favor of  military competency to prosecute the case-Pantoja, Iberico, and  Montes de Oca--were appointed during the current regime, as was  also the current president of the Supreme Court, who throughout  his term to date, and specifically in this case, has shown an  absolute lack of a sense of the dignity of the position he  occupies.    Except for the innermost circle of governmental authorities,  since even the pro-Fujimori group "Renovation" has distanced  itself, and as I write these lines the rumor persists that  Ministers Camet and Bustamente have resigned, public rejection  of that aberrant law by the media as well as by the political  groupings and opinion makers has been total. Some, not I, hoped  Fujimori would not take personal responsibility for its  promulgation, leaving that task to the Congress. But it did not  happen that way, and following the repeated presence of the  Commanding General of the Army in the Palace of the Government,  the promulgation of the law was published last Thursday in EL  PERUANO.    A few months ago, with reference to the La Cantuta  proceedings, I wrote that the last thing the military would  permit would be the denying of the military tribunals'  competency to hear the case. The recent "Vaticano" case, in  which members of the military are also implicated, and which is  another example of the trampling of the Judicial Power, provides  further evidence that the Army exercises a determinative  policy-making role in the running of the country.    To any thinking person, it is obvious that the scandal of  bringing "Vaticano" to trial as a traitor to the country, thus  circumventing a public trial, and the recent enactment of this  aberrant law attacking the integrity of a State governed by law,  are actions that damage the legal image of Mr. Fujimori's  government, that damage the possibilities of external aid, and  that therefore can hardly be believed to have originated in Mr.  Fujimoro's personal opinion, but rather in pressures being  applied by the Joint Command of the Armed Forces.</p>

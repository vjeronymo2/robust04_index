			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea threw its  support behind China's admission to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Wednesday but emphasized that Beijing's  trade laws should be made compatible with those of the GATT.    Beijing, on the other hand, asked Seoul to lift adjustment  tariffs on agricultural products imported from China and for  sufficient advance warning and negotiation before anti-dumping  duties are slapped on Chinese farm goods.    Seoul and Beijing sat down for a second day of working-level  trade talks here led by Chong Ui-yong, director-general for  international trade for the South Korean side, and Shi Weisan,  director-general for Asian affairs at the Chinese Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation Ministry.    Seoul supported Beijing's bid to become a GATT member while  noting that China should conform to GATT rules on trade.  Officials here said Seoul placed special emphasis on China's  lowering of customs duties.    Seoul asked Beijing to provide information on construction  projects and to strengthen inspection of foodstuff exports, to  expedite completion of the Korea business center and to allow  more Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) offices in China.    Seoul made it a point of demanding that China open its  distribution market, a preliminary step to individual market  opening.    Bilateral trade totaled 9.1 billion U.S. dollars last year,  with Korea posting a 1.2-billion-dollar surplus in direct  exchanges: The surplus is an even larger 3.3 billion dollars  when indirect trade via third countries such as Hong Kong is  included.    Officials predicted that two-way trade will increase to 28  billion dollars by 1997 and to 50 billion dollars by the year  2000.    Beijing showed keen interest in South Korea's agricultural  market opening after conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Seoul  officials said.    It specifically asked Seoul to leave room for ample  negotiations if any possibility of anti-dumping charges arises.    The next round of working-level talks is scheduled for the  first half of next year in Beijing.</p>

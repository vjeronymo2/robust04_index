			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAT BRAINS  </P> <P> The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has protested the Defense  Department's research program at Louisiana State University Medical Center in  which cats are shot in the head in order to study the injured brains (Aug. 19,  Part I). Perhaps the $2 million could be better spent to study the brains (or  lack thereof) of Defense Department officials.  </P> <P> HARRY CIMRING  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: African maize needs 'up 75%' DROUGHT in Africa will force the continent's imports of maize to more than 11m tonnes in 1992-93 from a projected 6.3m tonnes in 1991-2 and 4.3m tonnes in the previous season, according to the International Wheat Council's latest market report, writes Our Commodities Staff. South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia, which normally export to neighbouring countries, have been forced to import. The IWC expects the former Soviet Union's wheat crop to rise by 14.5m tonnes to 93m in 1992, still well below 1990's 108m tonne crop.</p>

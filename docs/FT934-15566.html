			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: Volatility a derivative of the new US accounting standards US BANKS and insurance companies will have more market risks to manage when new US accounting standards come into effect in January. The rules require countless capital-sensitive institutions to reconsider the assets in their portfolio, and in some cases, mark them to market for the first time, , that is, price a position or portfolio at current market prices. Assets not intended to be held to maturity must either be classified as 'available for sale', and marked to market, with unrealised gains and losses reflected in equity, or counted as 'trading' with unrealised gains and losses affecting income. That is a shock to the more conservative banks that value assets at historical amortised cost. If a bank has long-term bonds in its portfolio and cannot prove they will be held to maturity, the securities must be marked to market quarterly. Since the current low interest rate environment has been kind to long-term investments, the initial effect on most institutions' equity will be beneficial. But under the new rules, profitable portfolios will be subject to the whims of the market, and even a small increase in interest rates at the end of a reporting period could mean marking down asset values. The new standards, dubbed Financial Accounting Standards Board rule 115 (FAS 115), will skew the true picture of the nation's banks and introduce unnecessary capital volatility, according to the American Bankers Association, the US banking lobby. Part of the ABA's objections are based on the fact that FAS 115 addresses only one side of the balance sheet. Even if a bank has perfectly matched assets and liabilities, only the assets will be marked to market, conveying an inaccurate picture of its capital position. The reaction by small banks has been to shorten their capital holdings. Maturities of four years or under are far less volatile than long-term bonds, though not nearly so profitable. With the yield curve at its steepest level in years, shortening maturities could mean sacrificing 200 to 300 basis points in income, trimming earnings. Given the recent history of US banking, bankers say they will gladly forgo income to preserve capital and public confidence. Derivatives specialists argue that the trade-off need not be so costly, and proper hedging can insulate a portfolio from market volatility. Mr Craig Schiffer, managing director for fixed income derivatives at Lehman Brothers, says he has seen a big pick-up in interest in off-balance sheet products since FAS 115 was announced in June. Most popular with banks, he says, have been index amortising swaps, and collateralised mortgage obligation (CMO) swaps. Where standard interest rate swaps exchange coupons while principal remains unchanged, both of these products allow for the principal to be drawn down if interest rates fall, imitating mortgage prepayments. Mr Richard Lodge, a senior vice president with Ohio-based BancOne, a rapidly-expanding super-regional bank, says derivatives allow a bank to customise its portfolio. 'You can get the kind of risk you want, and the kind of maturities. That isn't available in the bond market. In the cash market, you have to buy what's on the shelf.' He admits his bank's enthusiasm for derivatives is rare and that invariably, when BancOne buys a regional affiliate, it comes with little experience or understanding of derivatives. Valley National Bank of Arizona, with Dollars 12bn in assets, had barely dabbled in derivatives when BancOne bought it a year ago. A designed programme of derivatives stabilised its assets, and with a recent subordinated debt issue, boosted capital ratios. Still, Mr Lodge worries that FAS 115 will drive uninitiated bankers to derivatives use for the wrong reason, and draw the attention, and ire, of regulators already uneasy with the systemic risks associated with structured securities. 'My fear is they will rush into these things headlong,' he says, 'Most small and medium-sized banks don't have the means to manage them.' Wall Street, he adds, has the responsibility to make sure the derivatives they sell are suitable for these new customers.</p>

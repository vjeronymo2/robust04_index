			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> FUND TO HELP PAY VICTIM'S MEDICAL BILL  </P> <P> A fund was established Tuesday to help pay the medical expenses of a  44-year-old Seal Beach resident who died Sunday from burns she suffered in a  fire at her home.  </P> <P> The fund was established by friends, relatives and co-workers of Gay Kenyon,  who spent eight days in the UCI Medical Center burn unit before dying.  </P> <P> Kenyon's insurance will cover 80% of the medical bills, leaving her family to  pay what could amount to thousands of dollars, said her mother, Mary Griffin.  </P> <P> Kenyon was single and had been living in Seal Beach for a year. She worked as a  legal assistant at a Century City law firm.  </P> <P> Kenyon and her boyfriend, Ralph Royston, were critically burned earlier this  month when they ran through a wall of flames in an attempt to escape the flames  that had engulfed a second-story duplex.  </P> <P> Royston remained in critical condition Tuesday, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> A memorial service for Kenyon is scheduled at 6 p.m. Thursday at the Manhattan  Beach pier in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Donations to the fund can be mailed to Pam Chase, 920 E. Hatch Road, Suite 10,  Series, Calif. 95351. SHELBY GRAD  </P></p>

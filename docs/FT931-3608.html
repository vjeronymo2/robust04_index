			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Senior BBC staff rally behind Birt BOTH THE BBC board of management and a group of senior BBC journalists have rallied publicly to the support of beleaguered director-general Mr John Birt. The moves follow the intervention of Sir Tim Bell, the public relations guru who tried, unsuccessfully, to save Mr David Mellor from having to resign as national heritage secretary last year. The arguments now being used, and endorsed by senior journalists such as Mr John Simpson, Mr Peter Jay, Ms Polly Toynbee and Mr Martyn Lewis in a letter in today's Times newspaper, is that Mr Birt has to be supported to save his programme of reform at the corporation. Mr Birt, who joined the BBC staff only last week after revelations he had been a freelance consultant with his own private company for the six years he was deputy director-general, is committed to making the BBC more efficient. There was growing speculation last night that attempts to save Mr Birt may be at the expense of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman. The Daily Telegraph newspaper today quotes an influential BBC governor, Mr Keith Oates, managing director of Marks and Spencers, saying he made clear a month ago that he disapproved of Mr Birt's freelance status and tax arrangements. It is noticeable that not a single governor has so far publicly endorsed the position of either Mr Birt or Mr Hussey. The issue will be discussed at a BBC board of governors meeting on Thursday. Friends say that Mr Birt has been deeply shocked by the events of the past week but that with the support of Sir Tim, who has been a public relations adviser to the BBC for some years, he is determined to fight to keep his job. Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, yesterday admitted in a BBC radio interview that both Mr Birt and the corporation had been damaged by the revelation that Mr Birt he had been paid through a private company, John Birt Productions. But Mr Wyatt insisted that the director-general should not lose his job. His comments followed calls by several Sunday newspapers for the resignation of Mr Birt, and of Mr Hussey. Mr Hussey last week vigorously defended Mr Birt. It later emerged that several BBC governors had not given their support to his statement, and some had not known of Mr Birt's freelance status.</p>

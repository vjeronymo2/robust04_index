Zhang Yishan, the Chinese representative, said at the 50th  session of the U.N. Commission that some people's way of  thinking remains the same as that of the Cold War era, although  the world has already entered a new era.    "They don't try to create and develop an atmosphere of  cooperation, but follow their old way of doing things, which is  to make attacks and create confrontation," said Zhang.    He stressed that to help the Chinese people enjoy human  rights in all fields has been the unwavering goal of the Chinese  Government in the past several decades, and China has made a  great many efforts in this area and has achieved a lot.    He said that China was known as a "land of hunger" in the  world before New China was founded in 1949, and in 1946 alone,  10 million Chinese died of hunger.    But now, China has succeeded in supplying food to 22 percent  of the world population with only 7 percent of the world's  arable land, he said.    Moreover, the average life age of Chinese people is 72,  compared with 35 before liberation.</p>

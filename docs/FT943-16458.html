			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Alcatel chairman questioned over use of funds Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, one of France's largest companies, was detained for questioning yesterday by magistrates investigating alleged misuse of corporate funds and over-billing by a subsidiary of the telecoms and electrical engineering group. Alcatel described the detention as 'scandalous' and said Mr Suard did not exercise any functions at Alcatel CIT, the subsidiary under investigation. Alcatel shares plunged on the news, falling 8.3 per cent to FFr541 and pulling the Paris stock market lower. The CAC-40 index of leading shares closed at 1,866, compared with the day's high of 1,907. The detention of the Alcatel chairman, who was being questioned at Versailles, is the latest blow to France's industrial establishment. In May, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the electrical engineering group, was arrested in Belgium and detained for 12 days as part of an investigation into alleged fraud concerning the treatment of minority shareholders in two of the group's subsidiaries. Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who has been released on bail, has denied the accusations. Mr Suard is one of France's best-known businessmen, credited with the rapid expansion of the group since 1986 when he took the helm of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, later Alcatel Alsthom. The company, with 196,500 employees and reported profits of FFr7.1bn (Pounds 844m) last year on sales of FFr156.3bn, is one of the world's largest telecoms and engineering groups. It has a joint venture with GEC of the UK and manufactures the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse. Mr Suard's detention, which can last for 48 hours, is the latest step in an investigation into alleged over-billing of France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications operator, by executives of Alcatel CIT. The origins of the investigation date back more than a year to an inquiry into two former employees of Alcatel CIT who were accused of manipulating prices for equipment ordered by France Telecom for their own benefit. According to Alcatel, the employees accused senior executives at the company, including Mr Suard, of having work done at private properties at the company's expense. Alcatel Alsthom has strongly denied any wrongdoing. In a letter to employees in May, Mr Suard condemned what he described as 'a campaign of defamation'. He said he had paid for all personal work at his home, except security measures, and Alcatel had never engaged in over-billing, false billing or double accounting.

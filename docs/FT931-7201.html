			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Construction slump hits St Lawrence THE LONG recession and slump in major construction activity in eastern Canada and the north-east US deepened losses at St Lawrence Cement, the Swiss Holderbank's Canadian arm, in 1992. Fourth-quarter loss deepened to CDollars 18.2m (USDollars 14.2m), or 43 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 925,000, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales at CDollars 136m were little changed. The year's loss was CDollars 39.9m, or 94 cents, against a loss of CDollars 5.7m, or 14 cents, in 1991. Sales dipped 7.5 per cent to CDollars 467m. The results include a CDollars 13m restructuring provision. St Lawrence said it did not see any resumption of growth in construction for several years.</p>

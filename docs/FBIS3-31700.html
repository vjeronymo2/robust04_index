			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, Feb 22 (TANJUG) -- Aleksa Buha, the  foreign minister of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS), said on  Tuesday that the talks on reopening the airport in the Moslem  enclave of Tuzla should shortly begin and that this had already  been discussed with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin in Sarajevo.    "However, the conditions for reopening the airport cannot be  those proposed by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe," because  "his scenario for RS is unacceptable," Buha told Novi Sad radio.    Juppe has said that the west would even use force to reopen  the Tuzla airport and threatened the Bosnian Serbs with NATO air  strikes if they oppose this.    "Isn't the experience of the Sarajevo ultimatum sufficient  warning to Mr. Juppe," Buha asked.    NATO threatened to launch air strikes against the warring  sides in Sarajevo unless they withdraw their heavy artillery  around Sarajevo to 20 km or place them under U.N. control but,  in practice, these threats were directed against the local Serbs  only.    However, the Bosnian Serbs started pulling out their heavy  weaponry from around Sarajevo on Friday only at the initiative  of Moscow and after it guaranteed to deploy its U.N. troops  along the separation line with the Moslems.    The Bosnian Serb Republic agrees to reopen the Tuzla airport  only if it receives guarantees that it will not be used to  supply the Moslems with arms.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Shell seeks Singapore expansion SHELL Eastern Chemicals, Shell Chemicals' Asian subsidiary, has announced it intends to ask its board next year to approve a SDollars 1bn (Pounds 385m) styrene monomer and propylene oxide complex in Singapore. The complex, one of the most important recent investments in Singapore's rapidly growing chemicals industry, would start production in 1997. It would have an annual capacity of 320,000 tonnes for styrene monomer, 140,000 tonnes propylene oxide, 80,000 tonnes polyols and 30,000 tonnes propylene glycol. Shell hopes to build it at Pulau Seraya, one of four islands designated for Singapore's petrochemicals expansion. Trichem, the London-based consultants, said the Asian propylene oxide market was fairly healthy, although South Korea had recently brought on line a plant and Japan was planning capacity expansion. However, although there was a shortage of styrene in Asia, global overcapacity remained a problem. Styrene operating rates could fall to about 80 per cent in 1995, after which they should rise at between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent a year. Meanwhile, Shell Overseas Investments, a holding company owned by Royal Dutch Shell, said it was extending its shareholding in Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The shares were previously held by Temasek Holdings.</p>

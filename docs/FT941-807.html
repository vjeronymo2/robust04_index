			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Europe's chemicals sector hopes to pool research An initiative to promote industry-wide collaboration on research and development in Europe's chemical sector is to start next month, it emerged in Brussels yesterday. It would mark the first attempt by companies to pool their research resources to combat the growing US and Japanese threat. The sector has been suffering from chronic overcapacity especially in petrochemicals and bulk chemicals. Some unprofitable European plants are protected from closure by national governments even though their prices are deeply undercut by newer plants especially in Asia. Mr Dirk Hudik, ICI's manager of European affairs, said yesterday that research directors from European companies would meet next month to identify suitable areas for sector-wide research. Programmes would probably centre around environmental research, to develop waste management technologies, greater energy efficiency and sustainable production. Another possibility could be the use of information technology in process control, Mr Hudik added. Two more meetings are likely over the next six months, and the companies aim to submit concrete proposals to the European Commission by the autumn in the hope of attracting funding. Under its research programme, the Commission usually provides half the funding for joint industry projects, which have hitherto been limited to pre-competitive research. With the European chemical industry facing shrinking margins and mounting research development costs, there has been growing interest in exploring collaboration. Mr Peter Schwarz, head of research at the Italian chemical group Enichem, said yesterday: 'We believe co-operation will be a large part of operations in the future, particularly in the situations of high risk of financial exposure which are present in the chemical area.'</p>

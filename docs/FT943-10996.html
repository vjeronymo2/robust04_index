			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Value in investigations Sir, Inspections by the Department of Trade and Industry form a valuable function ('Bin those reports', July 28). My experience is that businessmen and institutions alike are concerned not only to comply with the law but also to avoid criticism. The City has a long memory. The fact that the DTI receives a thousand requests for investigations each year suggests that investigations are widely regarded as important and useful. Reports are usually made public where there is a genuine public interest involved. They are an important influence on standards of corporate behaviour. In one case, a solicitor who accepted an appointment as a non-executive director of a listed company was the trustee of a settlement owning a significant proportion of the company's shares, and his firm acted as legal advisers to the company. Criticism in a DTI report has resulted in solicitors being far more cautious about allowing themselves to be placed in a position where conflicts of interest create problems. You suggest inspectors' reports are too expensive to be accessible to students. At Pounds 35, the Atlantic report compares well with the cost of many leading company law and accountancy textbooks; how many of those are the results of Pounds 6.5m-worth of research?

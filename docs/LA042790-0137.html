			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRESS REHEARSAL;  </P> <P> FANS OF JANET JACKSON PAY HOMAGE TO HER BY SHOWING UP AT CONCERTS IN LOOK-ALIKE  CLOTHES  </P> <P> The mountain of curly black hair, the motorcycle-style leather jacket, the  basic black outfit underneath. And oh yes, the signature house-key as earring  were all out in full force this week as Janet Jackson wanna-bes swarmed to see  her perform at the Forum.  </P> <P> Hey, was that Janet Jackson standing in line for her own concert? No, but you  sure could have fooled most people.  </P> <P> The look-alikes were all ages -- from 10 to thirtysomething. Vanessa Simmons,  10, wore all black with an "1814" pin, the name of Jackson's latest album, and  a baseball cap with the words "Rhythm Nation" printed on it. That's the name of  Jackson's tour. Lisa Hewett and Beatricz Giraldo wore Jackson's big-hair style  and key earrings.  </P> <P> D'LaVance, Rea Black and Arnold Brown, other concert-goers this week, could  pass for a Jackson family portrait. From the silver buckles on D'LaVance's  leather jacket to Black's oversized key earring, their wardrobes were exact.  </P> <P> "Janet is my favorite singer and dancer," explained Betty Maine, 9, who wore a  Janet Jackson T-shirt to the show. "I want to be just like her."  </P> <P> Once the show began, there was no mistaking the real Janet Jackson. She was  definitely the one on stage.  </P></p>

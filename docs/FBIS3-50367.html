			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Vladimirovich Yastrzhembskiy, Russian </F> ambassador to the Slovak Republic, by Stefan Sugar; place and  date not given: "Democracy Will Not Be a Springboard for  Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] [Sugar] Mr. Ambassador, the visit by U.S.  President Bill Clinton to Brussels, Prague, and Moscow had a  dramatic prelude in the diplomatic war that Russian President  Boris Yeltsin provoked with his letter to the governments of  Western states. He indicated in it that the rapid admission of  the Visegrad Four states into NATO could have unfortunate  repercussions for the fate of democracy in Russia. From this  point of view, what is your assessment of President Clinton's  visit to Moscow and the Partnership for Peace plan?    [Yastrzhembskiy] I would like to turn first to President  Yeltsin's letter, from which it is obvious that we are not  opposed to individual countries choosing their allies according  to their own way of thinking or to their joining  military-political organizations. We wanted to make sure,  however, that the interests of Russia are also taken into  consideration in any measures to guarantee peace and security in  Europe. In my opinion, the rapid admission of the Visegrad Four  countries into NATO would mean a new division of Europe, whose  lines would be drawn on the borders of the former Soviet Union.  Therefore, we have proposed that security in Europe be  discussed with the Russian Federation, and the course of  President Clinton's visit to Brussels, Prague, and Moscow shows  that the West has taken our point of view into consideration.  The outcome of this is the Partnership for Peace plan, which,  in many respects, is identical to our views. We rate the visit  to Moscow by President Clinton very positively, and we see it as  a heartfelt sign of the solidarity of Washington and the U.S.  President with Russia. We think that the decision made by NATO  in Brussels is sensible and realistic because it respects both  the interests of NATO and those of the postcommunist countries  in East Europe and the Russian Federation.    [Sugar] The Atlantic Alliance was established after World  War II as a defense against the penetration of communism into  Western Europe. This danger has passed because the Soviet Union  has collapsed, and its ideology has been discredited. Where  does Russia see the mission and purpose of NATO in today's  postcommunist Europe?    [Yastrzhembskiy] This is an apt question. The former  military and ideological adversary of the West, organized within  the Warsaw Pact, has indeed disintegrated, and the question now  is with and against whom NATO intends to devise Europe's  security.    We consider NATO to be an important partner, and we support  all of its measures to bolster peace in Europe. NATO is still  needed in Europe because a new threat to peace has arisen. The  war in Yugoslavia is the most tragic example of where aggressive  nationalism--which is rearing its head in many European  countries, including the states of the former Soviet Union--can  lead. In some countries this aggressive nationalism is even  beginning to manifest itself in military actions, and that is a  challenge worthy of NATO.    The second question is, with whom. Partnership for Peace  answers it because it expands the sphere of partnership not only  to the members of the Visegrad Four but also to the other  countries of the former socialist bloc. It is in the common  interest of all of us to ensure that the transformation of  postcommunist Europe proceeds calmly and in peace by civilized  means without bloodletting and tense relations.    [Sugar] This is true, but on both sides there is a certain  mistrust founded in historical experiences. The Visegrad Four  countries are concerned that democratic developments in Russia  may spin out of control, and, therefore, they want to join NATO  quickly. On the other hand, the idea that NATO military  structures would be on the borders of the former Soviet Union is  unacceptable to the Russian Federation. What is Russia afraid  of? Of future developments in Germany, perhaps, against which  Margaret Thatcher is also warning?    [Yastrzhembskiy] As far as Germany is concerned, it is  forgotten that NATO was also established to guarantee democratic  developments in the former Nazi Germany and to prevent any  return by Germany to its aggressive past. It seems to me that,  in this concert of states, the German voice is a democratic one.  Today's Germany is completely new and is one of democratic  Russia's closest partners. Of course, in Germany--and in other  countries--there are also extremist forces that make themselves  known from time to time. Today's Germany, however, very sensibly  nips these manifestations in the bud.    [Sugar] What danger did President Yeltsin have in mind when  he recommended in his letter that the Visegrad Four states not  be admitted into NATO?    [Yastrzhembskiy] We have already discussed this issue  several times with our Slovak colleagues. The democratic  leadership and a certain part of Russian society do not consider  NATO to be their adversary. In politics, however, we have to  take into consideration the psychology of the whole of society  and the intellectual orientation of the army. Namely, we cannot  claim that Russian society is united in its assessment of NATO.  A certain part of society would view the presence of NATO  military structures on the borders of the former Soviet Union as  a threat to Russia's national interests, and the postcommunist  forces would immediately use this course of action by NATO  toward the East to unleash a campaign against Russia's  democratic leadership and to discredit it. Under the current  conditions, pushing NATO's borders toward the East would,  objectively speaking, be directed against the interests of  democracy in Russia because this would place President Yeltsin  and his colleagues in a very delicate situation. The decision  made by NATO in Brussels has sent us a signal that it accepts  the interests of democratic Russia and that Europe's security  cannot be resolved at variance with Russia's interests.    [Sugar] Concern about further democratic development in  Russia is aroused in particular by Zhirinovskiy's statements  about Russia's aspirations for power and about the new division  of the world. Zhirinovskiy is reminiscent only of Adolf Hitler  in his tactlessness. Some Russian politicians make light of the  Zhirinovskiy phenomenon, but Hitler was also just a figure of  fun at the beginning. On what wave is Zhirinovskiy riding?    [Yastrzhembskiy] We could devote the entire interview to  this man because a whole series of issues is associated with  him. It seems that several factors played into Zhirinovskiy's  hands in the elections. For example, the factor of national  humiliation. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the withdrawal of  Soviet troops from East Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet  Union, and the apparent decline--temporarily, I am convinced--of  Russia's political importance in the world have all had a very  painful effect on the self-confidence of the Russian people.  The mood was just as depressing in the Weimar Republic  following the acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles.  Zhirinovskiy is using this mood to propagate an  ultranationalistic and ultrapatriotic program.    Zhirinovskiy is also making use of the cruel aftermath of  the  shock treatment on the population's standard of living and is  scoring points with his very simple recipes for dealing with  problems. If we take a closer look, we can easily convince  ourselves that this is demagoguery, but, during elections,  citizens do not normally seek reality in election promises. For  example, Zhirinovskiy declares that he would resolve the crime  problem in three months. This really is just demagoguery  because the crime rate is associated with the overall economic  decline, and there are no miraculous solutions. After 70 years  of the Soviet Union, our people have learned to believe in fairy  tales, and they also believed Zhirinovskiy and his fairy tales  about painless solutions to problems. He concealed the fact  that the situation is really grave and complicated and that the  government, if it wants to improve the situation, has to adopt  unpopular measures. There is no other way.    [Sugar] In the democratic elections, Russia adopted a  constitution that executes the so-called presidential principle  of government. However, isn't this system just a trap for  democracy? What if Zhirinovskiy wins the next presidential  election?    [Yastrzhembskiy] In the situation in which Russian society  finds itself, the best solution is, in my opinion, a  presidential republic. Incidentally, strong executive power is  a tradition in Russia, and it would be impossible to push for  economic reforms and systemic changes in Russia without it. By  the way, perhaps unity and internal stability are also best  guaranteed by strong presidential--but democratic--power.  Perhaps there will be a new constitution in Russia when the  reforms make progress and democracy is bolstered. However, if  it were to turn out that this presidential constitution could be  a springboard for Zhirinovskiy, it would be in our common  interest to prevent this.    [Sugar] Russian politicians say that, following the  elections, the social interests of the population will also be  taken into consideration in the economic reforms. Can we also  interpret this, in a certain way, as a kind of self-criticism on  the part of the initiators of the shock treatment?    [Yastrzhembskiy] I think that the strategic course of the  Gaydar government's reforms was correct. Its failing was,  however, that it did not devote enough attention to the social  aspects of reform and that it also forgot to provide information  on the economic policy. Macroeconomic schemes are quite  incomprehensible to ordinary people, and, therefore, it was  necessary to present them in ordinary language so they could be  understood. The election results also revealed that, in a  country like Russia, with the social habits of its population,  the shock treatment should have been accompanied by stronger  social assistance for the socially most dependent sectors of the  population. The new government will do more as far as social  policy is concerned.    [Sugar] I would like to return to what you said about the  aggressive nationalism that, as in the case of Yugoslavia, fans  conflagrations on other territories by means of its ethnic  minorities. The Russian Federation also faces this danger  because there are strong groups of Russian inhabitants in many  of the former Soviet republics. What will Moscow's policy be in  this sphere?    [Yastrzhembskiy] We will strive to ensure that the  Russian-speaking population feels like an organic element of the  state in which it lives and not an autonomous element. We are  not advocating any special collective rights for them. We are  asking, first and foremost, for individual civil rights that  correspond to the world standard. We are interested in ensuring  that these people continue to live where they were born, where  they work, and where they gain recognition for helping the state  to prosper through their work.    [Sugar] When the Slovak prime minister or minister of  national defense visit Moscow, some of the mass media begin to  sound the alarm that Slovakia has ulterior motives and that it  obviously does not belong to the camp of democratic countries.  However, when the Hungarian prime minister or minister of  national defense visits Moscow, the aforementioned mass media  keeps quiet about this. Tell us, Mr. Ambassador, is there  something dangerous for other countries behind good  Russian-Slovak relations?    [Yastrzhembskiy] If there are good relations between the  governments of two countries, this will begin to alarm certain  people and even arouse some jealousy. This jealousy has various  motives and various aims. As far as the relations between  Russia and Slovakia are concerned, I admit that we harbor warm  friendly feelings toward Slovakia and that, in our relations  with Slovakia and its young state, we are also following up on  the cultural and spiritual ties that reach deep into the past.  I will make no secret of the fact that, with regard to our  current strategic interests, cooperation between Slovakia and  Russia has great prospects, first and foremost, in the technical  and economic spheres. We all know that a major part of Slovak  output was oriented toward the Soviet market and, whether people  like it or not, it is therefore in Slovakia's interest to make  use of this orientation. This does not mean that Slovakia  should forge good relations only with democratic Russia. There  is a proverb: In order to fly, a man would need two wings.  Therefore, I think that good relations between Slovakia and the  East and Slovakia and the West would best suit Slovakia's  national interests. Let me reiterate: The Russian market is  very promising for Slovakia and, on the other hand, it is very  important for us to have Slovakia as an economic partner.    [Sugar] Thank you for the interview.</p>

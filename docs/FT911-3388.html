			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Suzuki to set up car assembly plant in Hungary SUZUKI is to become the first Japanese car maker to assemble cars in eastern Europe. It is to take a 40 per cent stake in a joint venture in Hungary, Magyar Suzuki, to produce up to 60,000 cars a year. Its partners in the venture are C Itoh, the Japanese trading group, with an 11 per cent stake, Autokonszern, a Hungarian consortium (40 per cent), and International Finance Corporation, a World Bank affiliate (9 per cent). The total project cost of more than Y32bn (Pounds 136m) makes it Hungary's largest joint venture undertaking to date. Magyar Suzuki will have an equity capital of Y10bn. Production is due to start at end-1992, Mr Osamu Suzuki, Suzuki Motor president, said. Viability depended on promoting local production of components and improving quality, he added. The company said output would be about 15,000 in the first year, rising to 50,000 after the third. The workforce will total some 1,100 when production reaches 50,000 a year. Suzuki aims to reach a target of 60,000 cars a year by 1997. The venture will be located at Esztergom, north of Budapest. Suzuki said it would assemble its small 1- and 1.3-litre Suzuki Swift hatch-back range at the plant. The Japanese car maker is giving local parts suppliers a stake in the success of the project by taking them on as equity-holding partners. It is encouraging them to link up with its own suppliers in Japan through joint venture or licensing agreements. Up to 1997, it aims to increase local content to some 70 per cent. Suzuki seeks to sell about 60 per cent of output in the Hungarian market, with some 40 per cent exported mainly to western Europe. Like Fiat's small-car production at FSM in Poland, Suzuki will seek to export from its Hungarian plant to the whole of the European market. Hungary was chosen because it had the most market-oriented economy in eastern Europe and a home market free of domestic competitors, Mr Istvan Lepsenyi, Magyar Suzuki president, said. The Suzuki investment in Hungary follows moves by General Motors and Ford of the US to set up manufacturing operations in Hungary. General Motors has formed a joint venture with Raba, the Hungarian state-owned maker of trucks, diesel engines, and tractors, to build Opel car engines and to assemble Opel cars with an investment of around Dollars 150m (Pounds 88m). It has a 67 per cent stake and management control. It aims to produce up to 30,000 Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra cars and 200,000 engines a year at a plant at Szentgotthard, close to the Austrian border. Ford plans an investment of Dollars 80m in a wholly-owned plant in Szekesfehervar producing ignitions. Plans by western car makers are now advanced for moving into eastern Europe, with Volkswagen investing heavily in Czechoslovakia and eastern Germany, and General Motors establishing operations in eastern Germany and Hungary. Fiat is still the dominant force in Poland but GM is also expected to begin negotiations shortly for an assembly venture in Warsaw with FSO. Fiat has led western car makers' moves in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Hungary has granted favourable tax and customs duty treatment for the the Suzuki project. Yesterday's signing marked the belated end of a six-year gestation for the venture. Suzuki's insistence on a 10-year tax holiday had postponed agreement. Analysts also said the delay and the scaling down of the Japanese car maker's earlier ambitions had followed a change of strategy. Previously, the company had intended to use Hungary as a base for deliveries to the rest of the region. After the disintegration of the Comecon system of trade between east European countries, Hungary has no preferential access, however.</p>

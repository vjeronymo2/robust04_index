			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister  Francois Leotard and his counterparts from the three Baltic  states Wednesday [11 May] signed the first military cooperation  accord among their countries in Paris.    Leotard said the agreements "open up new perspectives in  relations between France and each of the three (Baltic) states"  allowing bilateral exercises as well as joint manoeuvres within  the framework of the NATO Partnership for Peace, a military  coooperation agreement recently signed by several East European  states.    Estonian Defence Minister Indrek Kannik stressed that his  country and Latvia and Lithuania attached great importance to  participation in all international forums.    Leotard said Wednesday's accords would provide for young  soldiers to attend training courses in French military schools  and for wide-ranging exchanges of military personnel.</p>

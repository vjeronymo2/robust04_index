			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 79m buy puts Sidlaw in packaging big time SIDLAW, the Scottish oil services group, is to become one of Europe's leading flexible packaging companies with the Pounds 79m purchase of a business from Courtaulds, the chemical materials group. The acquisition of Courtaulds Flexible Packaging, with 11 operations in four countries, marks Sidlaw's first significant move overseas and will more than double group turnover. The purchase will be funded partly by a Pounds 53m rights issue, on a 4-for-7 basis at 275p,pushing Sidlaw's market value from Pounds 108m to about Pounds 180m on yesterday's share price of 328p, down 17p. The balance will be funded by debt, increasing gearing from 38 per cent at the end of March to 62 per cent. A dividend is forecast of not less than 10.5p for the year to the end of September, against 10p last year. Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said the purchase was 'about market positioning and long-term opportunity.' Once combined with Sidlaw's existing packaging operations, the group would rank in the top five European flexible packaging companies by sales, he said. The total market was estimated to be worth about Pounds 2bn annually. The new business would bring several benefits, including a strong management team and a pan-European presence in the snacks, biscuits and confectionery markets. This would complement Sidlaw's packaging operations serving the frozen and processed food sectors. The acquisition was expected to have a neutral effect on earnings in its first full year, but would be enhancing afterwards. Courtaulds said yesterday that the disposal formed part of a strategy to focus on worldwide corporate development, which was unsuited to the European focused flexible packaging businesses. Mr Michael Pragnell, Courtaulds' finance director, said the disposal would leave the group with a Pounds 12m exceptional gain in the current year. Courtaulds Flexible Packaging made Pounds 6.1m profits from continuing businesses on Pounds 108m sales in the year to March 31. Sidlaw reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m on sales of Pounds 71.5m for the six months to March 31. The rights issue is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. COMMENT Sidlaw, until now known for small niche acquisitions, yesterday thrust itself into the limelight with uncharacteristic vigour. The deal certainly appears to be tax efficient, with benefits in Spain, the Netherlands and at home. The rise in gearing is expected to come down shortly, while there also seem to be respectable cost savings to be made. However, there remains the simple fact that this is bigger than anything Sidlaw has attempted to date. Furthermore, it exposes Sidlaw to the vagaries of the continental European market, where many other UK companies have stumbled. Sidlaw's track record on acquisitions offers a certain degree of comfort, although this one may take slightly longer to settle in. Pre-tax profits this year are forecast at Pounds 11.3m, leaving the shares on a prospective p/e of 14.6. On a medium to longer-term view the purchase makes sense and the rights appear worth taking up.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Papua New Guinea votes THE 2.5m voters of Papua New Guinea (PNG) are voting this week in an election which is being watched closely by the international resources companies which form the backbone of the country's economy. A record 1,653 candidates are contesting 109 seats in the unicameral parliament in the fourth election since independence in 1975. Mr Rabbie Namaliu, prime minister, says he is confident voters will prefer his six-party coalition government, led by the Pangu party, to its main opposition, a four-party alliance led by Mr Paias Wingti. However, the likely outcome is unclear because of the number of candidates and parties and a tradition of voting against sitting MPs which could cause the defeat of up to 60 per cent of incumbents. The resources industry has emerged as an important issue in the campaign because of discontent in some areas about land rights, royalty payments, and environmental controls.</p>

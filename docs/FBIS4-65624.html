			<p>BFN     [Text] Montpellier, France, May 20 (AFP) -- French  Socialist leader Michel Rocard late Thursday [19 May]  recommended lifting the ban on supplying arms to Bosnian Muslims  as the only way to bring the Bosnian Serbs to their senses.    Rocard told a campaign rally for next month's European  parliamentary elections that lifting the ban on weapons sales  was "from now on, given the attitude of the Serbs, the only way  to attain a political settlement, which will prove elusive for  as long as the aggressors think they have more to gain through  force of arms."    "Lifting the embargo only as far as the Muslims, the victims  of the aggression, are concerned is a decision we no longer have  the right to reject."    But he added it would be a "grave decision."    "We cannot on the one hand prove incapable of protecting the  Bosnians and on the other hand refuse them the means to defend  themselves against the aggression to which they are falling  victim.    "We should use air strikes every time the (Serb) attacks  start again. As for the embargo, the U.S. Senate itself has  proposed lifting it. But in that case we would have to be sure  that NATO could provide all the necessary cover."    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is on standby  to provide air cover as and when requested by the United Nations  to protect UN aid convoys and UN peacekeepers, and to enforce a  ban on Serb artillery on the hills overlooking the Bosnian  capital Sarajevo.    Rocard, a former prime minister, was responding to an  initiative by French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who has  entered a list of candidates for the Euro-elections with a  manifesto urging intervention in Bosnia, including the lifting  of the ban on arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems.    Meanwhile French Premier Edouard Balladur, on a visit to  France's Caribbean departments, defended his government's policy  in Bosnia, where French soldiers have been the mainstay of the  UN peacekeeping effort.    Speaking in Pointe-a-Pitre, capital of the French Caribbean  island of Guadeloupe, Balladur said that thanks to French  involvement in the peacekeeping mission, "the worst was avoided,  humanitarian aid got through and talks aimed at reaching a  peaceful settlement began."</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Speaker rebukes Indian group Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Commons speaker, yesterday rebuked a group based in India which has urged a boycott of goods manufactured in the constituencies of 16 British MPs. She told the Commons in a statement the call was an 'undoubted contempt of the House' and it would be a 'a serious offence' for anyone to carry out the boycott. The boycott threat appeared to be targeted against people in Britain who have campaigned against human rights abuses in India.</p>

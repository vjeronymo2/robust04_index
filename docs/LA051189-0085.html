			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES CONTINENTAL CAN SCHEMED TO DENY PENSIONS  </P> <P> Continental Can Co. developed a secret and sophisticated computer program used  nationwide to deny longtime employees pension benefits, a federal judge ruled  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In a sharply worded opinion against the company, U.S. District Judge H. Lee  Sarokin directed Continental Can to begin negotiating settlements with about  2,500 Continental workers. Costs to the company could approach $500 million.  </P> <P> "The plan was shrouded in secrecy and executed companywide at the specific  direction of the highest levels of corporate management," Sarokin said in a  written opinion.  </P> <P> "It was intended to save hundreds of millions of dollars in unfunded pension  liabilities," he wrote. "The evidence of the plan, its secrecy and its  execution comes from the files of the defendants themselves. The documents are  more than a smoking gun; they are a fusillade."  </P> <P> Continental Can has a plant in Wayne, N.J., and 45 others nationwide. The  company is based in Norwalk, Conn.  </P> <P> Several cases have been brought against Continental by aggrieved employees,  including one in Sarokin's court, but he said in his ruling that there was no  need for all to be heard.  </P> <P> "What the judge has said is that this should end all the cases everywhere,"  said Robert Plotkin, an attorney for the workers.  </P> <P> "This is not a case of a class-action suit where plaintiffs each have a claim  to $10," he continued. "What we're talking here is, you have many former  employees who have individual claims worth in excess of $100,000."  </P> <P> Attorney Douglas G. Eakeley of Chicago, who represented Continental Can, did  not immediately return a reporter's calls. The pensions in question were  negotiated in 1977 by the United Steelworkers for employees subject to periodic  layoffs. They were designed to protect employees with long years of service who  had not yet reached normal retirement age.  </P> <P> But attorneys for the workers have maintained, and the judge agreed, that  Continental management adopted a secret computerized plan to prevent employees  from vesting in the costly pensions by laying them off before they became  eligible.  </P> <P> A federal pension law, called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act,  prohibits employers from taking any action against workers for the purpose of  interfering with their pensions.  </P> <P> "For a corporation of this magnitude to engage in a complex, secret and  deliberate scheme to deny its workers bargained-for pension benefits raises  questions of corporate morality, ethics and decency which far transcend the  factual and legal issues posed by this matter," the judge said.  </P> <P> Plotkin said that Sarokin's ruling should convince the company to stop dragging  the suit on but that he wasn't counting on it.  </P> <P> "Continental's continued efforts to avoid its obligations to those employees  any way it can are deplorable," he said.  </P> <P> Company attorneys had argued that there was no secret plan in place, and that  even if there were, the employees would have been laid off anyway.  </P> <P> Sarokin rejected that argument. He appointed George L. Priest, a professor at  Yale Law School, to assist the two sides in settling individual claims, and he  ordered the money to be paid promptly.  </P></p>

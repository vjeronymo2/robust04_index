			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Beijing agrees industrial pact with S Koreans South Korea and China yesterday agreed to co-operate in the development and production of cars, aircraft, telecommunications equipment and high-definition television under an industrial pact signed during President Kim Young-sam's visit to Beijing. South Korea has been eagerly seeking Chinese economic co-operation, believing that China's abundant and cheap labour, natural resources and technology complement Korea's strengths in finance and production methods. The combined resources of the two nations 'will produce great results,' Mr Kim said. Korean officials believe industrial links will help open up the large Chinese market to Korean products and gain Chinese support for the marketing of jointly produced high-technology products in other developing countries. A main area of co-operation will be the aircraft sector. Seoul plans to finance the development of a 100-seat airliner by the year 2000 that will use Chinese aerospace technology, which is considered more advanced than Korea's. Samsung and Daewoo have already signed preliminary agreements with Aviation Industries of China. The aircraft project is to take advantage of an expected increase in demand for regional airliners in the two countries in the next decade. The agreement on car production will open the way for Korea's three main motor companies - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - to establish joint venture production facilities in China within two to three years. The Korean car companies view China as an inexpensive manufacturing site and a potentially large market for vehicles. Korean carmakers will initially have to produce automotive parts with Chinese partners before being permitted to assemble vehicles. In telecommunications, South Korea will adapt versions of its TDX automatic telephone exchange system for both rural and urban networks in China. The two nations also plan joint development of HDTV, facsimile machines and large colour television sets. Co-operation in the four technology sectors will be supervised by a new bilateral industrial committee, which may eventually promote links in other areas, such as nuclear power generation and satellite development. South Korea is also seeking orders from China's ambitious infrastructure project; it promised Dollars 40m (Pounds 27.3m) in economic aid for the programme. Korean companies are hoping to win construction orders for electric power facilities and also plan to manage and operate existing nuclear power plants in China. President Kim asked China to improve laws to protect foreign investment, which has been a source of concern for Korean manufacturers. The German airline Lufthansa said yesterday it would train 76 Chinese air force pilots at its flying school in the US to become commercial pilots, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The Chinese pilots will join Air China, one of seven regional airlines that emerged from the breakup of the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Demand for air travel in China is so great that the country needs to train thousands of new pilots in the next few years. It has one of the world's worst air safety records.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Excerpts] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has stated that the first  meeting of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF], which was  formed in the Syrian capital on 5 January, will meet in Damascus  today. In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Ghawshah said that  the alliance's 20-member leadership (two members from each  faction) will discuss the results of the Syrian-U.S. summit and  its implications for the Palestinian people's cause at this  important and serious stage. [passage omitted]    Answering a question, Ghawshah described the Syrian-U.S.  summit in Geneva as "an important political meeting but we do  not expect quick or direct results from it. The first result  could be an improvement in Syrian-U.S. relations." [quotation  marks as published] Any developments in the Middle East problem,  will be premature for the following reasons among others:    1. The Syrian track is a major track with many obstacles.  The U.S. Administration, represented by Clinton, does not hold  sway over the Zionist entity. There are two major power centers  for this entity: one inside the Zionist entity itself and the  other in the United States, represented by the Zionist lobby.    2. The ball of fire has moved quickly to the Zionist side.  The Zionist Knesset is in permanent session and the settlers  and rightists, especially the Likud and religious parties, have  made quick moves against withdrawal from the Golan, forcing  Rabin to announce through his deputy Mordekhay Gur that he is  prepared to hold a referendum on full withdrawal from the Golan.  This in itself will create other contradictions. Some are  demanding fresh Jewish elections. All this indicates that any  hopes that caused some to be optimistic will collapse. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / US flooding disaster area grows: Rain is expected to ease, but east coast heatwave adds to weather problems THE US government yesterday declared 44 more Missouri counties disaster areas, adding to the six-state area in the upper Mississippi basin that has been devastated by weeks of rain and floods. While weather forecasters predicted the rain would slacken over the next few days in the upper Midwest, Mr Elbert Joe Friday, director of the National Weather Service, warned there was now so much in the river basins that flooding could last for weeks. 'It could very well go toward the end of August,' he cautioned yesterday. The heavy rains have soaked acres of farmland and driven the Mississippi to levels that in many locations surpass the peaks recorded in the 1973 floods, the most devastating in recent memory. Flooding has also closed the water purification centre in Des Moines, Iowa, depriving 250,000 people of clean water. At the same time, the east coast of the US is caught by a heatwave. A week of temperatures above 95 degrees has taken more lives so far than the flooding in the Midwest. At St Louis, just below the Mississippi's junction with the Missouri, floods are expected to crest at 45 feet this week, higher than the 43.3 feet peak recorded in 1973. River flow at St Louis is expected to reach 1m cubic feet per second. The great floods of 1844 are believed to have reached a flow of 1.3m cubic feet per second, but the destruction they caused was much less. Some critics say developers have invited disaster by building in the flood plain, instead of up on the river bluffs as in the past. Efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to control flooding with a programme of dams and levees may only have worsened the situation by confining the Mississippi within a narrower channel. 'Rivers are supposed to flood. You cannot control a river the volume and the size of the Mississippi,' comments Ms Susie Wilkins of American Rivers, a Washington-based conservation group. Other critics say the federal government has exacerbated the problem by not enforcing planning restrictions to divert development away from the riskiest areas as a quid pro quo for the cheap insurance it has provided since 1968.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on press conference by Jean-Pierre Cot, </F> leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament on 5  May; place not given: "Cot: Fini Must Say He Disowns  Mussolini"; first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Strasbourg -- Jean-Pierre Cot has not changed his  mind, even after the high feeling caused in the Strasbourg  parliament by the protests from President Scalfaro, Senate  Speaker Scognamiglio, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Pivetti  over the motion urging Italy not to include fascist ministers  among its representatives.    After a very turbulent morning, the chairman of the  Socialist  Eurodeputies called a press conference in mid-afternoon to  reaffirm his position, without yielding an inch. He confirmed,  first, that it was he personally who initiated the paragraph in  the resolution voted on by the PSE [European Socialist Party],  which so offended some people in Italy.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you not think that the initiative  constitutes interference in Italy's internal affairs?    [Cot] No interference. It is a document addressed to the  Community's heads of state and government. We addressed them to  emphasize a problem that exists and that is not without  importance. The possible future presence of Italian fascist  ministers in the EC Council would be unacceptable to us. We  could not engage in dialogue with fascist ministers. And if  there were any fascist members of the European Commission we  would deny our approval of that Commission. Let us consider  another country; let us suppose an Italian-type situation were  to occur in France. Well, I would be very glad if my country  received from Europe a precise and strong reminder of the  sacrosanct nature of the principles of antifascism.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But do you not think that it could be  considered antidemocratic to criticise the Italian electorate's  free vote?    [Cot] The Italians may vote however they want; but they  cannot demand that we engage in dialogue with fascist ministers.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Have we in some sense reached a new form of  limited sovereignty?    [Cot] No. We are freely joined by an agreement. If someone  violates the fundamental principles that underlie that  agreement, then the union is violated. Our Europe was born from  the defeat of fascism and Nazism. If someone who identifies  with fascism enters a government, we consider the original  agreement to have been violated.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But who are the fascists? How are we to  define a fascist today? In Italy there will be ministers chosen  by the leaders of the party that won a normal election. Where  does fascism come into it? In what way have the democratic  rules been violated?    [Cot] Our issue has to do not with legality but with  legitimization. Hitler too acceded to power legally and was not  challenged because there were no legal bases for doing so. I  thought that everyone had learned that lesson.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But Mr. Cot, who is Italy's Hitler?    [Cot] I am not saying that there is a Hitler, but am  pointing  out that in the coalition that is about to come to government in  Italy, one of the allies identifies with fascist principles.  Mr. Fini describes Mussolini as a great statesman, he does not  disown fascism and its principles. If Fini rejects the  principles of fascism, if he considers Mussolini an expression  of antidemocratic principles, let him say so clearly. I will be  pleased to hear it.    [LA REPUBBLICA] After the intense reaction in Italy, would  you submit the same motion again today?    [Cot] I know that some people are surprised by the tone of  that paragraph and by its content. I am surprised by their  surprise. I have no problem in engaging in dialogue with  conservatives. But fascists are another matter. A fascist  minister or a fascist commissioner speaks on my behalf, too; he  represents me too when he travels around the world, and I really  cannot accept that. Here we have Le Pen, and there are Italian  fascist deputies, and we tolerate them. But fascist ministers  are another matter.</p>

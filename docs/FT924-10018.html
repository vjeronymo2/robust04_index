			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / London Brick to shed 340 more jobs LONDON BRICK, Britain's biggest brickmaker, is to make another 340 workers redundant by the end of the year because of a continuing fall in demand from the construction industry. The redundancies, some of which may be compulsory, are at the company's Stewartby and Kempston works in Bedfordshire. London Brick is owned by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate. It has cut its workforce from about 4,000 in 1989 to 1,750 and blamed the latest cut directly on the recession.</p>

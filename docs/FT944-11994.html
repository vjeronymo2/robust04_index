Mr Sainsbury said the group had experienced selling price deflation of about 0.6 per cent in the first half of the year largely as a result of its 'Essential for Essentials' price-cutting campaign, involving permanent price reductions on own-label goods. So far in the second half, sales inflation was running at 0.2 per cent, and the rate was likely to increase slightly as Sainsbury reached the anniversary of the 'Essentials' campaign.

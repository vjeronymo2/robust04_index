			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Santer pledges to run strong Commission: New Brussels chief assures MEPs on single currency and social chapter Mr Jacques Santer last night defended his selection as the next president of the European Commission and pledged to run a strong Brussels bureaucracy in support of a single European currency and the social chapter. In response to hostile questioning from newly elected members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Santer, prime minister of Luxembourg, tried to dispel concerns about his emergence as compromise candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Delors. Mr Santer, who faces a vote of approval in the European Parliament tomorrow , used his meeting with MEPs to distance himself from the UK government, which last month blocked Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier whose candidacy for president was backed by France and Germany. 'There is no difference between me and Mr Dehaene,' he said in a remark that led to a flurry later among Euro-sceptic MPs at Westminster. During his appearance before the European People's Party and the Socialist group, Mr Santer adopted a semi-apologetic tone about his selection and made clear he had accepted the nomination only after appeals from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. 'I never sought this job. I have a perfectly good job in Luxembourg,' he told Socialist MEPs, several of whom voiced outrage that Mr John Major, UK prime minister, had torpedoed Mr Dehaene through the exercise of a lone veto at the Corfu summit last month. But Mr Santer expressed sentiments more in line with the UK Conservative party by pointing to a gulf between the political class in Europe and people in the street - a gap that was exposed in the debate over the Maastricht treaty and that was opened last month in the Euro-parliamentary elections from which nationalist splinter parties gained. 'I don't want to introduce a Napoleonic Europe or a centralised Europe,' he said. 'I want a Europe where the regions have a role to play.' But he added he would never have accepted the nomination if it meant being party to a weakening of the European Commission. 'I am for a dynamic, efficient and solid Commission,' he said. MEPs, generally more federalist-leaning than their governments, drew up a test of issues for Mr Santer. They grilled him on the desirability of the single currency, Britain's opt-out of the social chapter in the Maastricht treaty, and subsidiarity - the code-word for devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate level in the EU. In response, Mr Santer said he knew of no genuine single market that existed without a single currency. He voiced reservations about the UK not participating in the social chapter, and he said there was no question of using subsidiarity to roll back EU social and environmental laws. German Socialist Klaus Haensch was elected president of the European parliament yesterday.</p>

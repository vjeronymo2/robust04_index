			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Anglo American The 55 per cent increase in net assets per share reported by Anglo American Corporation is indeed striking. But it is also a reflection of the strength of the Johannesburg stock market on which many of its investments are quoted. That strength contributed to earnings as well, since high stock market values allowed Anglo to raise more from sales of investments. The R250m increase in the surplus on such sales offset setbacks in both coal and platinum. One issue raised by Anglo's results is thus whether buying in anticipation of the change in government pushed the stock market to levels that now limit its attraction. Having more than doubled in the final quarter of last year, Anglo's share price needs more good news to propel it forward. The group may have difficulty repeating last year's strong performance in diamonds, but there is a chance of gold adding some further lustre. Though the dollar price of gold has been slow to respond to the revival of inflationary fears in the US, a weaker rand and careful cost containment have helped boost mining margins. One risk is that high wage demands following the elections could undermine these cost advantages. It would help if the international bullion price were to show signs of stirring. Since they are subject to the vagaries of the financial rand, foreign investors in particular may increasingly need comfort on this score.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Medeva enters Europe with French acquisition MEDEVA, the pharmaceutical company, yesterday announced the acquisition of Institut de Recherche Corbiere, a French company that distributes a range of ethical products. The acquisition is Medeva's first in Europe and will provide a platform and a sales force for the launch of other products. Medeva is paying FFr93.8m (Pounds 11.6m) - FFr40m immediately in cash with the balance payable after a year. IRC shareholders have the option to receive 81 per cent of this balance in Medeva shares. In addition Medeva is paying FFr16.3m over five years in bonuses and possible performance fees to directors and the sales force. Mr David Lees, finance director, said IRC directors would be able to help Medeva with registration of its flu vaccine in France. The vaccine, once registered, would be sold through the existing sales force to general practitioners. This could open up a market, worth about Pounds 40m a year, which is overwhelmingly dominated by Institut Mereire. Based in Paris, IRC has 67 employees, and had sales of FFr50m in the year to end-December 1991. That year it lost FFr4.74m after bearing the cost of building the sales force. Medeva said it expected IRC to be profitable and to enhance earnings in 1993. Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, chief executive, said the deal was consistent with the strategy of expanding the product range through acquisition and internationalising the group's activities.</p>

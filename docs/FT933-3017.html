			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: EC's textile imports 'will rise' TEXTILE and clothing imports from outside the EC will increasingly dominate European markets over the next few years, says a market report*, writes Daniel Green. Commissioned by Messe Frankfurt, organiser of one of the world's largest textile exhibitions, the report says that by 2001, 70 per cent of the EC's consumption of 8.8m pieces of clothing will be imported. In 1991, 54 per cent of the 6.4m garments sold in the EC were imported. Much of the change will result from new retailing patterns in southern Europe, where only a small proportion of clothes is now imported from outside the EC. Some 64 per cent of clothes imported from outside the EC are today sold through price-conscious chains prepared to organise large-scale imports. While such chains dominate in northern Europe, they are only beginning to penetrate Mediterranean countries such as Spain and Italy. Rising wages in southern European countries will also help to push production to lower-wage countries. European manufacturers are responding through outward process - in which up to 49 per cent of the manufacturing is in low-labour-cost countries, usually in eastern Europe or north Africa. This still allows the garment to be labelled as being manufactured within the EC. * The Textile and Clothing Industry in the EC until 2001. Kurt Salmon Associates. Pounds 100.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / El Greco reaches auction record: Saleroom CHRISTIE'S in London yesterday auctioned paintings by the four most celebrated Spanish artists - El Greco, Murillo, Zurbaran and Goya. It sold the works of the first two, but failed with Zurbaran and Goya. The auction totalled Pounds 6.6m, with 27 per cent unsold. 'The Disrobing of Christ', a smaller version of the celebrated painting by El Greco in Toledo cathedral, sold for Pounds 1.87m, within estimate and an auction record for the artist. A 'Madonna and Child' by Murillo went for Pounds 770,000, at the bottom of its estimate. Bids for the Goya, a recently rediscovered portrait of Dona Maria Teresa de Vallabriga, the wife of Infante Don Luis, Goya's patron, stopped at Pounds 600,000, half the expected level. Interest in the Zurbaran 'Christ and the Virgin in the House at Nazareth', also a recent discovery, stretched to Pounds 900,000, quite close to the Pounds 1.2m low estimate. More stretching of a very different kind featured at Christie's South Kensington, which sold the Forman Archive of Crime and Punishment for Pounds 97,944. The top lot was the previously unpublished execution record book of Albert Pierrepoint, the UK's chief executioner until 1956. In it he recorded details of the hundreds of executions he presided over. It sold for Pounds 19,800 to Derek Stevens, a former racing tipster. Among the buyers was the former chief executioner of Algeria, who is setting up a museum of justice in France. He paid Pounds 2,860 for the records of Syd Dernley, who was Albert Pierrepoint's assistant, and Pounds 3,080 for a leather strap invented for hanging a one-armed man by Henry Pierrepoint, father of Albert and also a chief executioner. Henry's execution book made Pounds 7,700. An 18th-century scold's bridle for sealing the mouths of gossips sold to the Bavarian Crime Museum for Pounds 2,530, well ahead of the Pounds 300 estimate, and a German executioner's axe of 1634, with the blade stamped with 16 punched stars, recording the number of aristocratic beheadings it carried out, also far exceeded estimate at Pounds 4,180.</p>

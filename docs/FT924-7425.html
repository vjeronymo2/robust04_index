			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Lloyd's in Russian insurance scheme UNDERWRITERS at Lloyd's of London are backing a new billion-dollar insurance scheme aimed at boosting foreign investment in Russia. The Russian Investment Insurance Programme, launched yesterday, covers investment risks from property expropriation to blocks on dividend repatriation, and should ease a shortage of political risk insurance for foreign investors. The scheme was developed by the European Investment Guarantee Agency (EIGA), a London-based political risk and trade credit insurance consultancy, with the Russian Agency for International Co-operation and Development, a government body for investment promotion. The European Commission and the Russian government have been closely involved in the scheme which should boost available international capacity by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from the present Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn. One recent estimate shows international investors seeking cover for projects worth up to Dollars 40bn. Mr Robert Lyle of EIGA expects companies investing in Russian port renovation, hotels, the conversion of weapons and munitions factories and mining projects to be among the first customers. Premiums would average 1.5-2.5 per cent of the value of an investment, with the sum insured related to the amount of capital exposed. The rate is only slightly dearer than charged by government-owned agencies, such as the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, and cheaper than other private market rates, Mr Lyle says. Maximum exposure which can be insured for any one investor is normally Dollars 75m, rising to Dollars 150m for any one project. Policies will be written for three years and are renewable annually. Trade credit insurance is separately available up to Dollars 10m per risk. Lloyd's underwriters specialising in political risk will lead policies, with 30-40 of the market's 250-plus syndicates taking part.</p>

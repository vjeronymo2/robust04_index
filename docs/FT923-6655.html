			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall sharply STERLING futures prices fell sharply yesterday after the pound fell below the DM2.80 level on the foreign exchanges. Shortly before lunchtime, the September short sterling contract dipped 13 basis points from its opening level to 89.52, in expectation of dollar and sterling falls during the day. At that level, dealers are probably pricing in a rise in base rates of  1/2 a percentage point. The contract, which is very sensitive these days to currency movements, was stopped in its tracks as the Federal Reserve and European central banks intervened in the foreign exchange markets to support the dollar, pushing sterling up half a pfennig within several minutes. But, for the fourth time running, the effect of the intervention appeared limited and the contract failed to rally. The dollar fell through its all-time low against the D-Mark, bringing sterling down with it and dealers grew pessimistic about the prospects for a base rate rise. The September contract closed at 89.45, down 20 basis points from its opening level. The December contract closed down 24 basis points, at 89.42. Period rates in the sterling cash market also firmed in the morning, as dealers grew more concerned about sterling's plight. By lunchtime, three month money, a key indicator of where the market thinks base rates are moving, was offered at 10 7/16 per cent from a previous close of 10 5/16 per cent. After the dollar's fall, period rates firmed to levels that price in a 1/2 a percentage point rise in UK base rates. Three month-money closed at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 5/16 per cent. One-year money closed at 10 9/16 per cent on the offered side, its highest level since base rates have been at 10 per cent. The gloomy sentiment in the cash market was not helped by another large shortage forecast, of Pounds 1.1bn, by the Bank of England. In the event, the market took most of the day to make up the deficit. In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 71m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 12m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 30m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. Later, the Bank bought Pounds 13m of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 714m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 56m of Band 2 bank bills, all at 9 7/8 per cent. There was late assistance of Pounds 390m.</p>

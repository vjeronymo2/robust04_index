			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Channel Islands dalliance may yield unexpected offshore rewards - Finance If you are going across to the Channel Islands this summer, you could choose to include among the various diversions on your itinerary, a brief visit to one of the establishments for which they are famous. Banks and building societies are ten-a-penny in Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. They are the ideal spot for those who enjoy their tax havens to dally. The dalliance need not be confined to the wealthy and famous. Anyone with savings in a UK bank or building society can seriously consider moving their funds 'offshore', not just for the glamour of it but in pursuit of actual tangible benefits. Some of the highest onshore rates are found among postal accounts, but, depending on the size of your deposit, it is often possible to secure higher rates offshore. One of the advantages of investing offshore is that interest is paid gross. While UK residents are liable to tax on the interest, they have the flexibility of delaying tax payment by as much as two years, depending on whether interest is paid early in the tax year. That option effectively increases the 'advertised' rate of interest. Moreover, many banks and building societies pay a higher rate offshore than for an equivalent onshore account. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's instant access onshore Gold Deposit account pays 3.25 per cent gross on Pounds 10,000, while its offshore instant access Guernsey Gold pays 4.35 per cent gross on the same amount. The society's London postal account (onshore) pays yearly interest of 5.45 per cent gross on Pounds 100,000 while the monthly interest rate on its offshore Guernsey Gold account is 5.79 per cent gross. Similarly, Portman Building Society, which has one of the most competitive offshore rates, pays 5 per cent gross on Pounds 20,000 on its onshore instant access account and 6.2 per cent gross on the equivalent amount offshore. The highest offshore rates are paid to expatriates. Leeds Overseas has two instant access offshore accounts paying annual interest. Its Liquid Gold Overseas account for UK customers pays 5.1 per cent gross on Pounds 100,000, while its Overseas Gold account, open only to expatriates, pays 6.5 per cent on the same amount. The usual argument is that rates are set in order to be competitive with other offshore institutions. Although offshore does not necessarily mean shady, be wary of institutions paying significantly higher rates of interest as you could be entering risky waters. It is also worth remembering that of the three main offshore islands, only the Isle of Man has its own deposit protection scheme. The UK's building societies Deposit Protection Scheme, which guarantees to pay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in an account, does not apply outside mainland Britain. However, the Building Societies Act requires all the liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the parent.</p>

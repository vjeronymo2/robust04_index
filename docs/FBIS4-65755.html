			<p>BFN     [Text] In Alain Juppe's opinion, lifting the embargo on  arms to the Bosnian Muslims would hasten their destruction.  Such a measure would also run the risk of launching a drawn-out  war, with its attendant deaths, ruin, refugees, and deep-rooted  hatreds, the foreign minister said.    Let me remind you that the lifting of the embargo on arms is  being called for notably by the U.S. Senate, and in France by  Michel Rocard and intellectuals like philosopher Bernard-Henri  Levy.</p>

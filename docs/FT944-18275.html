			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE drops after disturbing economic news - Market report A combination of disturbing economic news from both sides of the Atlantic, plus a worrying profits warning from SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, cast a shadow across the London stock market. The FT-SE 100 Index once more plunged through the 3,000 level, closing a net 42.8 lower at 2,983.5. The retreat by the market front-line stocks was matched by the second-tier issues, where the FT-SE Mid 250 Index dropped 45.2 to 3,449.6. Adding to the gloom surrounding the market was news emerging from the Labour party conference in Blackpool that a Labour government would introduce a windfall profits tax on the privatised util-ities such as electricity and water companies whose profits have surged since being taken out of public ownership. The pattern of trading in the market was set at the outset when dealers chopped their opening prices after SG Warburg, regarded as the most successful integrated securities house in the City since Big Bang, issued a warning that interim profits would be severely affected by the extreme turbulence in international markets in recent months. This news, which followed warnings last week of low turnover from Sharelink, the execution-only stockbroker, saw marketmakers carve around 16 per cent from the Warburg share price and triggered a broad mark-down of prices across the market, especially in the financial areas. Shortly after the market had absorbed the Warburg news, it had to cope with worrying money supply figures. MO, the narrow money supply indicator, expanded by 1 per cent during September, well ahead of the expected 0.4 per cent increase and giving a year-on-year rise of 7.1 per cent. This brought additional pressure to bear on a gilts market which opened in good shape but was quickly worn down by a poor performance by German bunds which, in turn, reflected growing unease after the latest opinion poll ratings for the October 16 federal election. With gilts slipping away, the gloom in the stock market deepened and the FT-SE 100, which opened only two points easier, quickly fell to show a drop in excess of 32 points by midday. Debt markets fared worse with the announcement of a higher than expected National Purchasing Managers' index, which served to increase worries in the US of further inflationary pressures. Dealers took the view that evidence this Friday of increasing economic activity in the US, via a steeper than expected fall in unemployment, would push the US Federal Reserve into another increase in US interest rates. The general consensus was that a rise of more than 250,000 in US non-farm payrolls on Friday would produce steep falls in world markets unless the Fed moved to lift US rates. At its worst, the FT-SE 100 Index was down 43.9, affected by an early slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, before its subsequent close. But there remained very little confidence in a UK market which one strategist said is being 'tortured by fears of inflation across the globe'. Marketmakers, bruised by the recent excessive volatility in markets, remained bearish in the short term. 'We are reaching a climax of bearishness in this market but you would have to be very brave to call the bottom,' said one weary dealer. He expected support for the FT-SE 100 at the 2,950 level. The Warburg warning produced hefty losses across the merchant banks and clearing banks with big trading teams, while shares in Smith New Court, the UK's premier marketmaking firm, were badly affected. Reports of a Pounds 5bn flotation of BSkyB produced strong support for Pearson and Granada, two of the big shareholders in the satellite television group.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Watchdogs off the scent SINCE SIR Kenneth Clucas first put the case for a single watchdog for retail financial services in a report for the Securities and Investments Board earlier this year, the debate on the proposed Private Investment Authority (PIA) has sunk into a dismal stalemate. The banks and building societies have little financial interest in signing up, since they would then risk being saddled with a bill for the shortcomings of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation (SRO) chiefly responsible for independent financial intermediaries. Life assurance companies are reluctant to sign up unless the banks and building societies are on board, because they do not want to bear a disproportionate part of the regulatory costs of the system. And Fimbra's members, who are unable themselves to bear the full cost of compensating the victims of the black sheep in their own flock, are a large and disparate bunch whose readiness to vote Fimbra out of existence in favour of the PIA is open to question. Such a deadlock would test the mettle of a game theorist. It poses a potentially overwhelming challenge for Mr Andrew Large, the head of the Securities and Investments Board, who has been asked by the chancellor to review the workings of the system instituted by the Financial Services Act. If leading practitioners are to be believed, the PIA is limping before take-off. The chief executive of the Prudential recently declared: 'It has become apparent beyond reasonable doubt that PIA does not enjoy the support necessary among potential constituents to achieve its successful launch as the sole regulator of private investor business.' In dealing with Fimbra, Mr Large has a fundamental problem with the voluntarist nature of the system. Practitioners are entitled to choose their own SRO. Yet the SIB does not have many carrots with which to induce voluntary compliance with its wishes. Short of offering total immunity from infection by Fimbra, which would make a nonsense of the Clucas proposals, it is hard to see how sufficient banks and building societies could be persuaded to come in. And they can reasonably argue that if there is a public interest in keeping a large number of independent financial intermediaries in business, then the bill should fall on the public purse. The sticks are more impressive, but not much more. The SIB has the power to derecognise individual SROs. But that is a realistic threat only for Fimbra, and its effectiveness might be hard to gauge. The more draconian sanction is closer government oversight. Yet when the chief executive of the Prudential is already arguing for precisely that, the threat scarcely looks daunting. Nor is the government anxious to add the task of controlling predatory life assurance salesmen to its problems. All this points to a messy outcome, and there is a risk that the whole purpose of the system will be lost from view. While the practitioners argue about issues of competitiveness and regulatory cost, there is evidence that a disproportionately large number of savers incurs painful losses as the result of its unsolicited encounter with the insurance industry - a sorry comment on the four years of operation of the new system. To bring insurance companies and salesmen to cleanse their act will probably require more rigorous enforcement and tougher penalties than anything seen so far. Adequate compensation arrangements will continue to be vital. Whether a practitioner-dominated system can deliver on those counts is questionable in the light of the row over the PIA. The incremental approach to reform which Mr Large instinctively favours may well be right for the wholesale markets. But in retail finance tougher medicine is called for.</p>

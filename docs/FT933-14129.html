			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilt prices leap ahead as inflation falls to 30-year low ECONOMIC data showing the lowest inflation for almost 30 years sent UK government bond prices shooting upwards and yields dropping below 8 per cent for the first time in more than 20 years. The yield on ultra-long gilts maturing in 2017 fell to 7.98 per cent with prices leaping forward by a full percentage point, building on the strong rally that has been developing since May. Long-dated yields have not been sustainably below 8 per cent since 1968. The rise in prices at first reflected a technical readjustment by marketmakers, but the shift was sustained by heavy interest from domestic funds, which have been shy of the gilt market compared with their overseas equivalents. UK funds have feared a return to the 'boom-bust' economics of the past two decades but there is a growing belief that low inflation might have taken hold. Mr Chris Anthony, UK economist with UBS, said the data showing headline inflation down to only 1.2 per cent were 'totally contrary to the consensus and reinforced the bullish argument for gilts at the long end.' Another economist said: 'We have economic recovery with no inflationary pressure.' Short-dated government bond yields, reflecting the market's expectations on interest rates, remained virtually unchanged because the latest improved manufacturing output data pushed back hopes for monetary easing. Meanwhile, the Bank of England announced an additional Pounds 700m tranche of existing 7 1/4 per cent stock maturing in 1998; the partly-paid issue was priced at 102 1/4 and the issue will be available today. The Bank also announced the issue of Pounds 300m in tranches of index-linked bonds, consisting of Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2003 and Pounds 200m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked due 2030. SURPRISINGLY generous supply from the German central bank at its weekly repo sent strong signals that the Bundesbank was keen to cut interest rates again and pushed government bond prices higher. Bund futures for September rose 0.24 to 96.27. Commercial banks needed DM68.5bn to cope with their day-to-day management. The market had been expecting around DM72bn as a gesture of goodwill, and the final figure of DM78bn at 7.28 per cent and above surprised most analysts. Ms Alison Cottrell, economist with Midland Global Markets, argued that the recent intervention to support the French franc made the oversupply even more generous. The Bundesbank has been buying francs for D-Marks fairly aggressively over the past two days. This has shifted more German money to the commercial banks and might have encouraged the central bank to maintain a tighter hold on supply. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that the Bundesbank is unlikely to cut rates at its council meeting today and will prefer to wait until its next meeting, its last before the summer recess, in a fortnight's time. DISAPPOINTING money supply figures put pressure on Spanish government bonds yesterday. There was further pressure from a weak peseta as the strains within the European exchange rate mechanism grew and the September Bonos futures contract fell 0.33 to 92.42. CONTINUING pressure on the French franc sent the currency to within a centime of its floor against the D-Mark, but the French government bond market was closed for the Bastille Day holiday. US Treasury prices rose strongly at the long end of the market yesterday, sending yields to new record lows, following a bullish consumer prices report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 107 5/16 , yielding 6.559 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 3.957 per cent. After the market produced a muted response to good producer prices data on Tuesday, yesterday there was no doubt about dealers' and investors' attitudes to the consumer prices figures. The consumer prices index for June was unchanged, and the 'core' measure (excluding food and energy prices) was up only 0.1 per cent last month. The figures confirmed that after several months of worryingly high inflation at the start of the year, inflationary pressures in the economy have abated. Bond prices moved higher after the CPI was released, and the 30-year yield dropped below 6.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] London--Britain has become an important center for  political lobbying as well as fund-raising for an anti-India  campaign on Kashmir, even though earlier acts of terrorism,  aimed against Indian targets here, have not been repeated in  recent years.    The British Muslim youth is being radicalized by several  organizations whose agenda includes a Jehad against disbelievers  in many countries. They receive funds from abroad and, in  Britain, seek to capture the control and management of mosques.  Western counter-terrorism experts say that the past five years  have seen an explosion in the number of Muslim charities, not  dedicated to purely humanitarian aims.    The Kashmir connection of two of these organizations has  been  disclosed in a report in THE GUARDIAN entitled, "The Young  Muslims" and "Islamic Foundation" headed by Prof Kurshid Ahmed,  known in Pakistan as the vice-president of Jamaat Islami, which  has connections with extremists parties in Afghanistan and  Kashmir.    The Islamic Foundation gave nearly 90,000 pounds sterling to  a fund for Kashmir, according to the last published accounts in  1990. Details of the expenditure were not given. Britain now has  a law to curb the flow of charity money for terrorist activities  abroad but its enforcement is not that easy. Jammat activists  were said to be behind the original burning of Salman Rushdie's  book in Bradford.    At the political level, some British politicians take an  unusual interest in the Kashmir problem even though currently  they are all critical of the meddling by American politicians on  the issue of Northern Ireland. These MPs [members of Parliament]  are not even of Kashmiri origin but are guided by the  anti-Indian lobbies active in their constituencies.    Recently, both the Indian community as well as the Indian  high commission intensified their efforts to present India's  case on Kashmir with some notable results reflected in the last  debate on the issue in the House of Lords. The Pakistani lobby  has been able to enlist the services of a couple of academics  also. At one time, very little reference material was circulated  by the Indian side on the Kashmir issue among the political and  media circles. The high commission has now circulated a series  of backgrounders and brought out a compilation of articles on  Kashmir in a book form.    The task of the Indian lobby is growing while it is not  certain whether the British government will extend the same  cooperation to India in checking Kashmiri extremism as it did in  the case of Sikh extremism in Britain. The attempts to mobilize  British Muslims for holy wars in foreign lands are a wider issue  because these also take the form of anti-semistic propaganda and  an assault on multi-culturalism. The new fervor has a distinct  West-Asian flavor. The active groups are funded from outside  Britain.    It is the point about outside funding that has become an  additional irritant in the current controversy over the plans to  establish a Hindu temple in Southall. The dispute involving the  local council has divided the Asian community in the area on a  religious basis. The controversy on buying a disused townhall  continues to rage and the extent of bitterness about a  provocative advertisement in a Pakistani newspaper here was  revealed in a long phone-in program run by an ethnic radio  station.    That a mosque can become a center of political program has  been highlighted by THE GUARDIAN report which says that some of  the literature being distributed by Islamic groups openly  outside mosques incites violence against disbelievers. The  radical groups argue against integration, saying that British  Muslims are part not of British society but of the Islamic Ummah  or world community. The Commission for Racial Equality has  warned that the radical groups are planting a time-bomb under  harmony between Muslims and British society.  *</p>

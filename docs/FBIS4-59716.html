			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan's decision to ease travel arrangements  across the King Husayn Bridge was taken after the Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel agreed to allow  Palestinians who were residing in the territories on June 4,  1967, a day before the six-day war broke out, to return  gradually to the territories under Palestinian jurisdiction,  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said Saturday.    "Our policy in Jordan has always been that we are committed  to the Palestinians' right of return," Mr. Hammad told a group  of Jordanian journalists, adding that when the Kingdom was  assured of this right, "we simplified the crossing procedures at  the bridge while still maintaining our commitment to that right.    "Our principle of countering Israeli attempts to empty the  territories of Palestinian citizens was finished with this  signature (by the PLO and Israel)," he added.    Mr. Hammad said that initial statistics showed that movement  across the bridge had already indicated a decrease in the  number, by almost half, of Palestinians who cross the bridge  into Jordan, an indication which he interpreted to mean that the  measures did not backfire as was feared by some Jordanians.    Conceding that the PLO-Israel agreement will have to be  implemented in stages and after tough negotiations between  Israel and the PLO, and that Jordan cannot merely rely on  Israeli good intentions, Mr. Hammad stressed that the "principle  of return is there."    "The preliminary indications, until now, is that these  measures have contributed to increase the return of Palestinians  to the occupied territories and not the other way around," Mr.  Hammad said.    Some Jordanian politicians and analysts have warned that  facilitating the crossing into Jordan from the West Bank may  encourage Palestinians living under occupation to flee to the  Kingdom where they may later lose their right to return to their  homeland.    The minister was careful to point out that these regulations  will continue to be "updated and amended to go along with the  developments across the bridge."    He said that if Jordan continues to receive guarantees that  protect the Palestinians' rights of staying in their homeland,  "Jordan may feel that there will be no need for the department  of inspection and control."    The department was established in 1982 as the authority at  the Ministry of Interior directly in charge of the affairs of  West Bank citizens and those carrying family reunification  papers for the occupied territories.    Mr. Hammad pointed out that the new crossing measures,  issued  at the instructions of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan  when he met with the secretary-generals of the different  ministries two weeks ago, are a mix of easing up of measures  adopted in 1988, when Jordan severed legal and administrative  ties with the West Bank, and others that were taken since then.    He said that one of the procedures that was stopped by the  new regulations was taking travellers' documents at the bridge  to make them visit the inspections and control department to  follow up on their cases.    "We initially took these measures when Israel allowed only  10,000 to 15,000 Palestinian labourers, out of around 120,000 to  work in Israel," Mr. Hammad explained.    "Israel at that time started giving young Palestinians exit  permits but after making them sign a commitment not to return  for a number of years," Mr. Hammad said, pointing out that  Jordan's measure at the time was to guard against Palestinian  youth running away to better working conditions only to find  that they had lost their right of return.    He said the Ministry of Interior had already prepared  studies  on ways to facilitate the crossing of the King Husayn Bridge in  anticipation of any improvement on the Palestinian front.    "When His Royal Highness raised the issue with us we were  prepared to take the necessary steps," Mr. Hammad said.    "We announced the easing up of procedures at the bridge but  we continued to guard the principle that has always guided us  and that is to protect the rights of the Palestinians," he said.  "We want our procedures to be humane and civilised," he added.  <H5>  Election Law </H5>   Mr. Hammad told the group of Journalists that his ministry  had prepared the "administrative and technical mechanism" for a  new election law but had not yet prepared a draft for the  division of voter districts or the number of parliamentary  seats, which, he said, "will be determined by the final  arrangements for civil districts."    "We do not know yet whether the Kingdom will be treated as  one voting district or whether it will follow the division of  civil districts," Mr. Hammad said.    He also said that anyone who enjoys a Jordanian nationality  "will be allowed to vote regardless of his origin and whether he  is residing in Jordan or outside."    In an answer to a specific question on whether Jordanian  nationals who also carry Palestinian reunification papers--which  amount to a residency in the occupied territories--will be  allowed to vote in the next elections, Mr. Hammad stressed that  those who "carry the Jordanian nationality will be able to vote  regardless of where they reside and those in the West Bank are  no exception if they carry the Jordanian nationality."    He pointed out that this excludes holders of the two-year  passports since that passport is a travel document and not proof  of nationality.    He said that the new "administrative and technical"  amendments include allowing citizens to register according to  their national numbers given to them by the Civil Service  Commission and not by their family books as had been the  practice in the 1989 elections.    An important amendment to the Elections Law, Mr. Hammad  said,  is that the voting and the vote count will be conducted at the  same centre and ballots will not be moved to the governor's  office to avoid "criticism or unfounded charges."    He said that the principle of finding a mechanism which will  allow Jordanian expatriate communities to vote in their areas of  residence is being studied, but that the final decision over  "whether registration has to be made in Jordan or whether it can  be done in Jordanian embassies outside has not been reached."    On his meeting he had with the heads of political parties in  the Kingdom last Thursday, Mr. Hammad said that the two and a  half hour encounter served to "strengthen the relationship  between the Ministry of Interior and the secretary generals of  political parties."    He said that some of the participants asked that the  government "help allocate funds for the operations of political  parties," while some others argued against the concept.    "I asked them to put their request in a memorandum signed by  all of them and that I would carry their request to the  government," Mr. Hammad said.    The minister also pledge to provide the political parties  with any information they need on agreements signed by Jordan or  protocols with other countries.    "Each party will appoint a representative who will stay in  touch with the ministry over information requests," he said.    On requests for air time on Jordan Television or the  inclusion of their papers' editorials on the "press briefs  programme" carried on JTV, Mr. Hammad said that he explained  that since the parties have their own newspapers they could work  to "provide something different" in those papers since  television time "would be completely taken up" if all 22  political parties were vying for equal time.    He said that the secretary-generals complained about the  small percentage of Jordanians who are willing to become members  of political parties. "But I told them that this problem cannot  be blamed on the government. Let them come up with something  new and practical, and they will see better results."    On complaints that the government "has been intervening in  the running of professional associations," Mr. Hammad said that  he told them "that they are the ones interfering in the work of  the professional associations by politicising bodies that should  be working on improving conditions for their members."    On specific complaints of intervention in the associations,  Mr. Hammad said, "I advised them that problems like this should  be taken to courts where the law can be the decisive word."</p>

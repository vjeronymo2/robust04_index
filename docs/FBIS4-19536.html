			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hannes Koch: "Dasa Has Alternatives to </F> Eurofighter"]    [Text] Berlin -- While Deutsche Aerospace AG (Dasa) is  still calling loudly for the construction of the disputed  European fighter "Eurofighter 2000" in public, the corporation  is working with great concentration on alternative civilian  projects. The Daimler-Benz subsidiary is taking precautions for  the event that a red-green government will cancel the plane  after the Bundestag elections in October. This is reported by  armament opponents about a talk with Juergen Schrempp, chairman  of the Dasa board of directors.    After the talk about potential conversion from military to  civilian production, Juergen Graesslin, spokesman of the  critical shareholders of Daimler-Benz, quoted Dasa chief  Schrempp as saying: "We have civilian projects in the drawer  just in case the political framework conditions change."  Wolfgang Piller, who is responsible for company planning,  pointed to the intensive Dasa activities "in the fields of  energy production, energy storage, and energy distribution, such  as photovoltaic systems and electrolysis." Graesslin's summary:  "Dasa can manage without the Eurofighter."    Officially, on the other hand, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary  Dasa continues to urge the construction of the fighter and is  trying to get additional money out of the project. Only  recently the Federal Government received an additional demand of  570 million German marks [DM] for the development of the  Eurofighter. The armament program, which is estimated at DM50  billion, would help Dasa overcome its economic difficulties.  For 1993 alone the corporation suffered a three-digit billion  figure in losses in its central sectors of armament and aviation.    Speaking to DIE TAGESZEITUNG, Dasa spokesman Detmar  Grosse-Leege pointed out that the "total loss" of a new fighter  plane "cannot be compensated." In this case, the corporation  threatens to dismiss employees to an extent that would exceed  the announced reduction of 10,000 of the total 80,000 jobs.    In the meantime, Dasa has been forced to reduce armament  production, because the Bundeswehr has less and less money to  spend on new weapons. While in the 1992 business year DM6.4  billion -- 37 percent of a turnover of DM17.3 billion -- was  made with grenades, missiles, and military planes, currently the  military share accounts for only 25 percent, according to the  corporation. Last year 4,500 jobs were shifted from military to  civilian production, the corporation reports. It cannot be  overlooked that the company is increasingly getting involved in  environmental protection. Thus, the Dasa subsidiary Dornier in  Friedrichshafen is producing facilities for water purification  and draws up expert reports for environmental-compatibility  tests. The radar and radio production sector in Ulm is  equipping towns with computer-controlled waste bins, which  weight the weight of the waste and calculate individual waste  disposal fees.    Dasa intends to restructure parts of the corporation into  so-called profit centers this year. "With this strategy it is  intended to strengthen civilian production," Dasa spokesman  Andreas Breitsprecher says. An employee of the company from  Ulm, who does not want to give his name, gives an example of the  effect of the restructuring: So far, the development costs for  radar equipment were very high because the Bundeswehr ordered  the equipment and also bought it and paid practically any price.  This "military cost structure" makes it extremely difficult to  compete with other suppliers of radar equipment for orders from  civilian airports. In the future, this should be remedied by  nine profit centers in Ulm: The parts of the company are taken  out of the corporation's hierarchy and are responsible for their  profits themselves. They cannot hide any losses in the overall  corporation and are thus put under pressure to reduce costs.  This creates the conditions for being competitive on civilian  markets.    Dieter Rueckgauer, head of environmental planning in  Friedrichshafen, hopes he will be able to hire additional  employees for the sales department within the framework of the  profit center. So far, the experts deal with sales themselves.  The reason for the neglect: Raising profits in marginal areas,  such as environmental planning, was of little interest, because  the lion's share of turnover was achieved in the central sectors  of armament and aviation anyway.    Dasa's dual strategy becomes obvious here, too: It is  intended to establish profit centers not only in the civilian  but also in the military sector. Because competition is  increasing also on the market for military technology -- the  weapons corporation must gain the upper hand over other  suppliers.</p>

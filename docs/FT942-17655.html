			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / India takes further steps to liberalise trade policy India has announced further liberalisation of its trade policy, including the easing of rules on the import of second-hand capital goods and the removal of import bans on certain electronic components to help the assembly of finished goods in India. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce minister, announced the changes on Wednesday and Thursday. He hoped exports in the 1994-95 year, starting this month, would grow by more than the 21 per cent increase recorded in the first 11 months of 1993-94, the latest period for which figures are available. The minister disclosed that exports in the 11 months to February soared to a record Dollars 19.8bn (Pounds 13.4bn), whereas imports grew much more slowly, by just 1.8 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, leaving a trade deficit of a mere Dollars 500m. Agricultural exports grew particularly fast, boosted by liberalisations of last March. The textiles and gems and jewellery industries also performed strongly, said Mr Mukherjee. This week's liberalisation measures were less radical than expected. Ministers had discussed a limited lifting of India's long-standing ban on the import of most kinds of consumer goods. But the government has backed away from this move, apparently out of concern that such a large gesture might fuel opposition campaigns against further liberalisation. The ruling Congress (I) party has been under attack for having accepted the outcome of the Uruguay Round talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In a parliamentary debate this week, opposition MPs accused the government of having caved in to pressure from developed countries which, they said, stood to gain more from the proposed agreement than does the developing world. The measures announced include the removal of a maximum age for imported second-hand capital goods. The rules on duty-free export-processing zones are being relaxed to permit activities including trade repair and reconditioning, as well as manufacturing. This could, for example, enable Indian companies to establish workshops for repairing goods from abroad. The list of banned import items is being pruned, though less heavily than last year. As well as certain electronic components, imports of samples for product development are to be allowed, as are imports of outboard motors for fishing vessels. Schemes by which exporters can import components and other goods to be put into exports are to be simplified. The government is establishing a new category of 'super star trading houses' - companies whose exports are so large that they will qualify for further exemptions from the rules. The new measures are incorporated into the government's five-year trade policy plan for 1992-97. Despite all the liberalisation of the last three years, this still runs to two volumes and 1,182 pages in all.</p>

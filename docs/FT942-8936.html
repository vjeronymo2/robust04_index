			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BOC BOC spent most of last year trying to dampen the market's expectations, finally by announcing that, for the first time since the early 1970s, it would not increase its dividend. Yet yesterday's interim statement struck an optimistic tone, pointing to early signs of volume growth in gases. Since demand for gases is a fair indicator of industrial activity, that suggests consumer-led recovery in the Anglo-Saxon world is finally taking root in the wider economy. Many of the special problems which afflicted BOC last year are also easing. The pharmaceuticals division seems to be recovering after losing the US patent on Forane, its staple anaesthetic. While there could be a relapse if more companies choose to manufacture cheap generic versions of the drug, BOC has moved to protect margins by cutting costs. Any further margin squeeze in industrial gases should also be offset by the benefits of restructuring. If prices start to rise, BOC will be well placed to benefit. The brighter outlook leaves the equity market in something of a quandary. After a decade yielding less than the market average, BOC's shares were pushed to a handsome yield premium last year. With the growth prospects seemingly restored the yield premium should logically be unwound. Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares is a step in that direction. Having been so sorely disappointed last year, though, investors will be wary of taking a giant leap.</p>

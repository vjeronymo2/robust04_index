			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The United Nations' top  official for refugees said Thursday that Bosnian Serbs must be  included in ongoing peace negotiations to entice them to halt  their shelling of Muslim towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina. UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said, "I think  the real peace (in Bosnia-Herzegovina) will come only after the  Serbs are brought into the peace process."    She was referring to UN-brokered negotations between  Bosnia's  Muslim government and Bosnian Croats. "The Serbs have been left  out of the peace process and this is why the difficulties still  exist," said Ogata, who is a former professor of international  politics at Sophia University in Tokyo.    Neither UN-authorized NATO air strikes nor warnings and  pleas  from the West have deterred the Serbs from further encroaching  on Muslim-dominated territory in the former Yugoslavia.    "The situation is very, very serious and the United Nations  is facing a very critical point," Ogata said.    In their latest offensive Bosnian Serbian forces attacked  and  almost overran the town of Gorazde, one of the six UN-designated  safety zones.    Ogata said the last UN convoy with food and other  humanitarian aid has reached the town, where some 60,000  refugees have been trapped on March 22.    She said Gorazde-based UN staff is "crying for help" for the  besieged town, which sustained one of the worst poundings by  Serbian artillery Wednesday that damaged a hospital and a red  cross refugee center. However, she said the UNHCR will not ask  for air drops of relief goods because the casualty toll would  increase as people leave their shelters to gather the goods.    Nearly 350 people have died and more than 1,000 have been  wounded in the three-week assault on Gorazde.    Ogata said there might be a slight chance for "a little  cease-fire" if the Serbian forces stick to their promise to let  through to Gorazde a UN convoy with 100 peacekeepers and 41  doctors delivering medical supplies Thursday. She said she was  not able to confirm whether the convoy was on its way.    Noting that cease-fire agreements have "come and gone,"  Ogata  said at the moment, "there is nothing that would make me feel  optimistic" about reaching a lasting armistice.    Ogata was in Tokyo to attend a three-day meeting, ended  Thursday, of the Commission on Global Governance, an independent  think tank preparing proposals for strengthening the UN.</p>

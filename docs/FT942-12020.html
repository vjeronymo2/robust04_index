			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / People: Bergougnoux to run a railway Having helped restore financial health to Electricite de France, the state energy utility, Jean Bergougnoux is to take up a similarly formidable challenge at SNCF, the French national railway system, writes John Ridding. Jacques Fournier, SNCF's current chairman, will step down after the opening of the Channel Tunnel, at the age of 65. The government has picked Bergougnoux, managing director of EDF since 1987, to step into his shoes. Bergougnoux, 54, is an engineering graduate of the prestigious Ecole Poly- technique. He has built his career in the public sector and in particular at EDF, which he joined in 1970, earning a reputation as a skilful manager in both labour relations and financial affairs. Number two to Gilles Menage, chairman of EDF, Bergougnoux has for the past seven years been responsible for the day-to-day running of the company. He played a significant role in returning the group to profit at the end of the 1980s and reducing debt which, at FFr213bn in 1984, was equivalent to 27 per cent of sales. His new task is equally daunting. The principal challenge facing Bergougnoux lies in the financial situation of the railway company; last year it suffered losses of FFr7.71bn and a rise in its debts to more than FFr150bn. The new SNCF head must also try to win back passengers disenchanted by a series of marketing and technical blunders. Socrates, the computerised reservation system, was afflicted by technical problems following its introduction at the beginning of last year and contributed, along with recession, to an 8 per cent fall in passenger traffic. Labour relations at SNCF are also delicate. Fournier's attempts to increase efficiency by establishing separate divisions and more decentralised management have yielded positive results but have also drawn strikes and stoppages by workers.</p>

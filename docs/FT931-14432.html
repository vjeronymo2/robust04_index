			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Cool campaign chief to take the trade reins - Nancy Dunne examines the challenges facing Mickey Kantor WHEN he comes before the Senate finance committee today for his confirmation hearing, Mr Mickey Kantor can claim one attribute possessed by none of the other would-be US trade representatives. As chairman of the Clinton campaign he took his seat on the roller coaster well before his rivals came aboard. In fact it was Mr Kantor's cool leadership that helped guide the president-elect through his worst crisis: the affair of Gennifer Flowers, the candidate's self-described former mistress. He is so trusted by Mr Clinton that it was surprising when the president-elect selected others to oversee the presidential transition. Instead Mr Kantor was given the chore of setting up last month's widely applauded Little Rock economic conference, and he became the only campaign official to be nominated for a cabinet post. In Washington, where he is little known, the appointment was greeted with some gloom as Mr Kantor has had little experience with trade. One of the kindest remarks made of him since his nomination came from Mrs Carla Hills, the current trade representative, who briefed him and called him 'a willing learner'. Another senior US trade official dismissed worries: 'Trade isn't exactly quantum physics, you know.' Mr Kantor has been portrayed in the press as just another lobbyist, whose long list of clients has included NEC, the Japanese electronics conglomerate, Atlantic Richfield, Philip Morris, Occidental Petroleum, and Martin Marietta. It has been suggested that Mr Clinton, who promised in his new order to 'put people first', will continue to let corporate interests hold sway in Washington. Mr Kantor and his friends are likely to find this view ironic. Born in Tennessee, he grew up during the worst school integration battles and became an ardent civil rights supporter. He began his career as a poverty lawyer, focusing on the rights of migrant farm workers, and founded the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, which is designed to teach discipline to urban teenagers. He was also a member of the Christopher Commission, under the soon-to-be secretary of state Warren Christopher, which was charged with recommending reforms for the Los Angeles Police Department. Mr Kantor began working for the election of liberal Democrats in California in the 1970s, and supported former Governor Jerry Brown, later one of Mr Clinton's opponents for the Democratic nomination. In 1974 he threw himself into the campaign for former Vice-President Walter Mondale. Among politicians he is seen as hardworking, tough and highly efficient. He is also sometimes sharp-tongued; he criticised Mr Brown for 'giving hypocrisy a bad name'. His prestige was not boosted by the way in which Mr Clinton chose him as trade representative. He was not included in the economic team, which was the first batch of appointments, and was the last cabinet member to be a named. This came in a last-minute flurry to finish all key appointments by Christmas. The post reportedly had been offered to Mr Ron Brown, who chose to be commerce secretary and who announced at his confirmation hearing that the Commerce Department would lead the way on trade policy. Mr Clinton then met Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and promised to appoint one person to take charge of completing side agreements on the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Clinton camp, perhaps realising that Mr Kantor had once again been slighted, suggested that the person in charge would be Mr Kantor. Congressman Kika de la Garza, chairman of the agriculture committee who met Mr Kantor, said the new position could be akin to ambassador on Mexican affairs in the State Department. Intelligent and able as Mr Kantor may be as a legal negotiator, he still has to learn the Uruguay Round portfolio. He is being urged by at least one influential private-sector lobbyist to call for an overall reassessment of the Round, during which he would consult with Congress, business groups and US trading partners. He would then be able to ask for an extension of the fast-track negotiating authority. Mr Kantor is also likely to face pressure for an early decision on whether or not to retaliate against Japan for its failure to abide by a market-opening agreement on semi-conductors. He will find much on his plate and many critics ready to pounce if he fails to take a firm grip on the trade reins.</p>

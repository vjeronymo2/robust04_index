			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article: "U.S.-Russian Duet or </F> International Choir?"]    [Text] Commenting on the efforts by the world's two  leading powers to settle the Bosnian crisis, the U.S. newspaper  THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER talked of a "duet" between the United  States and Russia. It is obvious, however, that our countries  can act, rather, as catalysts of the peacemaking process, whose  success is unlikely without cooperation with all the other  interested states. It is no coincidence that President Boris  Yeltsin has proposed holding a meeting of major heads of state  devoted to the prospects for resolving the conflict in Bosnia.  At the same time, as the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  has explained, the composition of the summit need not be limited  to the five countries named by the president.    Nor should it be forgotten that an extremely great deal  depends on the good will of those actually involved in the civil  war and on sincere moves by them to end the bloodshed. The  stand taken by the official leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina  [B-H] in recent days is reassuring in this sphere. B-H Prime  Minister Silajdzic declared in Washington, after signing the  agreement setting up a Croatian-Muslim federation, that he  intends to come to Russia in the very near future. In Moscow he  intends to discuss the prospects for implementing the new plans  for the B-H state structure and options for cooperation with the  republic's Serb population in this process. Without Russia, the  premier admitted, a Bosnian settlement is impossible.    But his viewpoint is certainly not shared by everyone. Some  leaders of that same Bosnia, and also outside the former  Yugoslavia (in Turkey, for example), are cautious about Russia's  participation in lifting the blockade of Tuzla Airport. They  perceive this almost as a buildup of our country's military  presence in the Balkans. Although such accusations and fears  are totally groundless. As Vitaliy Churkin, Russian Federation  deputy minister of foreign affairs and the Russian president's  special representative, explained, the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense has not even been entrusted with the  practical fulfillment of the provisions of the agreement on  opening Tuzla Airport. Representatives of the Ministry for  Emergencies and civilian specialists are being sent to Bosnia.  According to Vitaliy Churkin, Russia endeavors not to react to  sundry accusations, realizing that many statements are made in  an extreme situation and in a state of psychological shock  caused by war and combat operations.    As for the plans to create a Croatian-Muslim federation and  the prospects for subsequently forming a confederation with  Croatia, the Russian Foreign Ministry views them with cautious  optimism. This optimism is founded on the assessment that this  agreement, being included in the overall picture of a Yugoslav  settlement, can produce positive results. But it is cautious  because there have already been quite a few splendid plans which  have never reached the stage of implementation (take the  Vance-Owen plan). The point is that a federation, as reported  previously, provides for unified control over foreign policy,  joint leadership of the economy, and also the formation of joint  armed forces. Troops which are still fighting each other today  will have to unite. (Incidentally, the "unidentified" aircraft  which bombed the Muslims and were downed by U.S. aircraft had  actually taken off from Croatian territory, so Croatian Foreign  Minister Granic has admitted). In addition, territorial  demarcation is a stumbling block in the present plans, just as  in the previous ones. Carrying it out essentially means feeding  both the wolves and the sheep. But who or what will be the  "dinner"? For it is obvious that we cannot manage here without  casualties or, at any rate, compromises....    Not only Russia and the United States have their interests  in  the region but also Germany, France, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi  Arabia. Each country has its own historical and political  allies, whom they support and whose interests they are prepared  to champion persistently. So a successful outcome to the  Bosnian crisis can come about only in the event of harmony  throughout the international "choir" and not just as a solo part  for the U.S.-Russian "duet."</p>

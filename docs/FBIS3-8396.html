According to the prosecutorial complaint, read out by Judge  Mrs Csiky Julianna Szobacsi, the party's aims and deeds sharply  violate constitutional provisions related to human rights and  fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to human dignity,  minority rights, the equality of citizens, and the freedom of  learning.    The party proposes university applicants should state their  nationality, with Gypsies and Jews to be admitted according to  their numerical proportion, in addition to ability.    In its monthly, MAGYAR TUDAT (HUNGARIAN CONSCIOUSNESS),  published on November 16, 1993, the VNP (registered on October  11, 1993) published an article entitled "Justice to Ferenc  Szalasi", making the fascist takover in Hungary appear as a  heroic deed.    Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946), leader of the Hungarian fascist  (Arrow-Cross) party, seized power on October 15, 1944 with  Hitler's help and introduced a reign of terror to the country.  He was condemned to death by the Hungarian people's court and  executed as a war-criminal.    At a meeting in Budapest's 13rd district on January 18,  1994,  VNP activists incited hatred against Jews and Gypsies living in  Hungary. The police investigated the case as representing a  crime of incitement against a community and recently sent  related documents and an accusation proposal to the court.    Party Chairman Albert Szabo and his defender asked the court  to dismiss the prosecution's complaint as unfounded and denied  the charge of unconstitutional party operations.    Szabo pointed out that newspaper reports on the VNP's  January  18 meeting distorted the facts because they are not racists but  would like to replace predatory capitalism by socialism based on  national ideas. The trial will continue on April 13.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: How green is a green fund? SOME OF continental Europe's 'green' investment funds which make environmental or ethical claims could lose the confidence of investors because of poor definitions and a low level of supporting research, according to a survey* published this week. Many of the 'green' funds identified in the study did not have clear research methodologies and only a few could explain how stocks were selected. Furthermore, a number of funds depended upon the advice of brokers or financiers, rather than social or environmental scientists, as to whether a company was 'green' or 'ethical'. Of the 25 ethical or green funds in continental Europe which claimed either to avoid companies with interests in defence, tobacco or alcohol, or claimed only to invest in companies with a sound environmental record, just 12 stated that they employed additional research to investigate companies. The remainder of the funds were unable to provide systems for rigorously substantiating the green or ethical claims made in their criteria. The survey said unclear definitions and research input perhaps explained the inclusion of companies which do not feature in green funds in the UK and the US, such as GEC, the UK electronics company, Sandoz, the Swiss drug company, Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company, British Petroleum and RTZ, the UK mining group. The survey said that across Europe, including the UK, there are now more than 70 ethical or green products for investors to choose from, amounting to about Pounds 734m under management. The UK-based funds account for around Pounds 400m or 54.5 per cent of the total investment, followed by Luxembourg with Pounds 79.3m or 10.8 per cent, France with Pounds 75.3m or 10.3 per cent and Sweden with Pounds 59.4m or 8.1 per cent. The survey noted that the Luxembourg-based funds included so-called Sicav funds, which are managed from other European countries. The survey identified Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, as the most popular stock with UK green funds. Generale des Eaux, the construction, water and waste management group, was the most popular with French green funds, and in Germany, GEA, the air purification and process engineering company, came out on top. *Survey of Ethical and Environmental Funds in Continental Europe is published by the Merlin Research Unit, part of the Jupiter Tyndall Group, Knightsbridge House, 197, Knightsbridge, London SW7 1RB. Cost: Pounds 50 (plus Pounds 5 for postage and package overseas).</p>

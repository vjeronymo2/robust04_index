			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CASE OF THE CRIME-WRITING COUPLE  </P> <P> He drives too fast, can't fathom his ladyfriend's trust in institutions and  wonders why others don't have his credo: If you don't make the rules, you're  stuck with somebody else's.  </P> <P> A thug? No, he's just the other side of the line -- a fixer for the good  people.  </P> <P> This is the fictional creation named Fiddler whom one industry source has  compared to John D. MacDonald's famous knight errant, Travis McGee.  </P> <P> What? Another book about a loner getting into nasty scrapes?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keeping Him Honest  </P> <P> Yeah, but there's a twist: he has a woman to keep him honest. She is Fiora,  Fiddler's beautiful and brainy ex-wife who spends almost as much time with him  divorced as she did when they were married.  </P> <P> Fiora is largely the inspiration of Ann Maxwell of Laguna Niguel, who with her  husband, Evan, created the Fiddler character six years ago by typing out a  single paragraph on a home computer.  </P> <P> The paragraph went something like this:  </P> <P> Frustrated violinist, guy from Montana, has perfect pitch but hands like veal  shanks. Realizing he'll never be Itzhak Perlman, he wanders out to Southern  California, where an uncle has left him a trunkful of C-notes. Rich now, he  needs a reason to get up in the morning so he becomes a free-lance "problem  solver."  </P> <P> The Maxwells write under the name A. E. Maxwell. In the earlier books,  Doubleday insisted on fuzzing the identity to imply that one person -- probably  a man -- was writing the books.  </P> <P> But Ann Maxwell did her own marketing research and convinced the publisher that  thinking was out of date.  </P> <P> "Not only is it OK for a woman to write about a tough guy," she said, "but it  might even help sell him."  </P> <P> That a woman character in the series is now emerging to be the equal of a man  is not something you see very often in crime fiction, said Sheldon McArthur,  who runs the Mysterious Book Shop in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Of the Maxwells' latest book, "The Art of Survival," he observed: "It's the  best book of the five and you know this series is just going to keep growing."  </P> <P> In the mystery/crime genre a 10,000-book hardback run is considered good.  Doubleday says its Fiddler series has jumped from a 6,000-copy run for the  first book to 15,000 for the fifth.  </P> <P> The paperback versions have gone from 30,000 for the first book to 60,000 for  the fourth, published last year, according to Doubleday publicist Sue Laizik.  </P> <P> Last year's Fiddler, "Just Enough Light to Kill," was chosen by Time magazine  as one of the best crime novels of 1988.  </P> <P> And of the new one, Kirkus Reviews, a book industry forecaster, writes: "The  writing is lean and restrained, the series is growing from book to book and it  now gives Travis McGee a real run for his money."  </P> <P> Travis hung out in Ft. Lauderdale. And Robert Parker's Spenser is from Boston.  </P> <P> Fiddler uses his muscle in places like Santa Fe, Newport Beach and Napa.  </P> <P> "The Art of Survival," takes Fiddler from Santa Fe to Newport Beach in an art  scam involving a faked Georgia O'Keeffe.  </P> <P> In two of the books, Fiddler prevents California high technology from falling  into the hands of the Russians. In another, a fiend tries to buy up Napa Valley  property and then get around development restrictions by introducing a disease  to destroy the vineyards, making the land good for nothing but malls and office  parks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiora Comes Clean  </P> <P> But it is in book six, "Money Makes Everything Cheap," to be published next  year, that Fiora really emerges, say the authors.  </P> <P> "We are trying to extend the genre to have a man and a woman working together  as equals in crime fiction," said Evan Maxwell.  </P> <P> Ann interrupted: "From the start I have insisted that Fiora had to emerge. In  the first book she was a plot device -- she got kidnaped.  </P> <P> "Traditionally in crime fiction, women exist as a bedroom convenience or to  screw up in order that the plot may progress. I wanted no part of that."  </P> <P> Typically, Ann will work at her computer for a stretch, then pull out the disc  and hand it to Evan to pop into his machine. Or vice versa.  </P> <P> Evan, 46, a former reporter for the Los Angeles Times, brings a knowledge of  law enforcement agencies and, as he put it, "an understanding of just how a  crime or a big scam goes down."  </P> <P> Ann, 45, not only helped create the Fiddler characters, she makes the stories  hop, having mastered tight plotting with 30 previous books, most of them  science fiction and romances.  </P> <P> Much of their time is spent researching plot themes in the University of  California, Irvine, library. They also visit locales from Seattle to Chula  Vista.  </P> <P> The next book, for example, starts with a hike on Orange County's Modjeska  Peak, where Fiddler and Fiora have decided to take a break from tackling  people's problems to solve some for wild animals.  </P> <P> They spend a day cleaning out artificial watering devices called  quail-guzzlers, which dot the chaparral.  </P> <P> But Fiddler does not do it joyfully. In the code he lives by, making animals  dependent on such gadgets is an example of good intentions gone awry.  </P> <P> As for people's problems, Ann says: "Fiddler is keenly aware that justice and  law don't necessarily equate."  </P> <P> Neither Maxwell will own up to specific lines in the Fiddler novels.  </P> <P> "We are A. E. Maxwell," Ann said firmly.  </P> <P> And they are reveling in the good news that's coming in these days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Book of the Month  </P> <P> "The Art of Survival" will be a Book of the Month Club selection for August,  the same month the fourth book is released in paperback.  </P> <P> That news the other day called for a nostalgic trip down to Fiddler's refuge --  Orange County's Crystal Cove. In the books, he lives in a house here with a  pond full of koi in the back yard.  </P> <P> Standing on the highway and looking down into this shabby-chic enclave of 1930s  cottages, the Maxwells said there has been some fear the houses would be torn  down when complicated leasing arrangements end.  </P> <P> "But even if they bulldoze it," said Ann Maxwell, "Fiddler will live on. That's  the great thing about creating a character."  </P></p>

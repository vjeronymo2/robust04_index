Seven other people were injured and hospitalized in  critical condition, after the explosion shattered tens of  railway wagons.    The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The  train, in which one of the cars exploded when passengers were  getting into it, arrived earlier from Kislovodsk, southern  Russia. It was duly inspected in the local depot and put into  service again because of the rolling stock shortage.    Competent sources close to the investigation of the accident  do not rule out an act of subversion as the cause of the blast.</p>

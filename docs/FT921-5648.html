			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters in ADR flurry A LATE surge in shares of Reuters, the global data information group, followed news that US investment houses are currently running heavy short positions totalling 2.74m American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Such a situation in the ADR market implies an underlying short position of around 8.2m Reuters shares. Barrons, the US investment magazine, published a list of the 10 heaviest short market positions among US brokers which included Reuters. After being marginally easier for much of the London session, the stock began to push ahead as Wall Street opened yesterday. US brokers were among those chasing the stock higher in late trading in the UK, attempting to close what are seen as dangerously exposed share positions. The stock ended a busy session 26 higher at 1197p, its best level since mid-July 1990; turnover reached just short of 1m shares. Specialists said the shares were also being stimulated by high hopes for Reuters' Dealing 2000 foreign exchange trading system which is expected to go 'live' later this month. The group's Globex system is about to undergo trials. Wellcome setback Concern over the the proposed dilution of Wellcome shares saw the pharmaceutical group tumble in turnover of 4.1m. Wellcome Foundation, the charitable trust, yesterday confirmed weekend reports that it intends to seek permission to sell at least 24 per cent of the drugs group in an international placing - leaving the trust with a stake of under 50 per cent. It said its long-term aim was to maintain a share of 25 per cent of the equity. 'Wellcome has always benefited from the premium attached to the rarity of the shares available for trading,' said Mr Didier Cowling at Nomura. 'The proposed reduction of that premium has taken the top off the shares, but also hit the rest of the sector on concerns that there could be switching into Wellcome.' Worries over greater liquidity in Wellcome dragged the pharmaceutical sector down in early trading. However, strong US buying pulled selected stocks back in busy afternoon trading, with Glaxo Holdings rising 4 to 785p, and SmithKline Beecham 'A' shares adding 5 to 923p. Bowater rights The market was taken completely by surprise by a hefty Pounds 333m rights issue from Bowater to help fund a brace of acquisitions for more than Pounds 400m. The cash-call and purchases accompanied near-static profits and a near 9 per cent hike in the final dividend. Dealers, taken aback by the magnitude of the rights issue, chopped the Bowater share price to 744p as the news emerged. But it later rallied strongly, eventually closing only 3 easier at 765p, with specialists enthusiastic about the acquisitions, DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging. Bowater's manoeuvring gave a substantial boost to ADT, the security alarms group which held a minority stake in Quoteplan, which in turn owns Cope Allman Packaging. ADT will receive Pounds 117m. ADT shares, which fell to a five-year low of 281p as recently as December last year, jumped 37 to 500p on the news. Fisons firmer Shares in Fisons rose ahead of today's results, buoyed by renewed bid speculation and market sentiment that the stock is undervalued. Without a chief executive and with the shares looking fairly cheap, weekend press speculation was carried over into the market yesterday that either ICI or Hanson - both old favoured candidates - could be possible predators. The shares added 7 to 393p. A mixture of US and Japanese buying, via Goldman Sachs and Nomura, sustained the English power generators, but water stocks suffered from selling generated by the latest opinion polls and profit-taking after their recent good performances . Of the footsie stocks Anglian and Severn Trent weakened 8 to 363p and 338p, North West 7 to 372p and Thames 6 to 376p. Nomura was said to have been responsible for downward pressure on GEC, seeing an early improvement to 217p whittled away to settle slightly easier at 215 1/2 p. Downgrading the shares from a 'hold' to a 'sell', Nomura's Miles Saltiel said GEC shares had run ahead of themselves and outperformed the market by 23 per cent since last July, reducing the yield premium from 46 per cent to 21 per cent. He said the stock had benefited from a stream of new contracts which he did not expect to continue. Hopes of a big boost to sales of its telephone alarm systems for the elderly and disabled saw Tunstall shares run up 10 to 220p. Midland Bank outpaced the rest of the banks sector. The shares climbed 11 to 278p responding to talk of broker upgradings, recovery hopes and lingering takeover speculation. Turnover in the shares was a hefty 6.5m. Lloyds also made good progress, adding 7 at 420p. The battle between brokers in the UK and the US to get the upper hand in BP continued yesterday with 15m shares changing hands. Most UK investment houses have been aggressive sellers of BP since it revealed disappointing preliminary figures last month, as opposed to US investment banks which have been heavy buyers of the shares. The stock was 4 down when Wall Street opened but subsequently rallied to end the session unchanged on balance at 266p. British Aerospace continued to shine following last week's two-day analysts' visit to the company. The shares gained another 9 to 325p with 4.2m shares traded. Kwit-Fit gained 6 to 192p after Albert E. Sharp, the Midlands stockbroker, said that profits would rise to Pounds 32m and the dividend by 22 per cent; Ford's move into its business sector was 'unlikely to impact significantly' on Kwik-Fit said Sharp. ASW Holdings retreated 7 to 131 after reporting a 94 per cent profit setback to Pounds 2.3m. Mr Robert Sassoon at County NatWest believes the company will be forced to cut the interim dividend. Because of the 'slow improvement in the pricing environment'. Sentiment in ASW left British Steel half a penny off at 71 1/2 . News of accountancy practice worries at MTM cast a shadow over Siebe, the shares falling 15 to 579p. The company is said to follow similar policies. Press reports that P&amp;O had won a Pounds 1bn contract to build the second phase of the Disney theme park outside Paris lifted the shares 2 to 368p. Chemicals group MTM plunged 60 1/2 to 226p after it announced that its 1991 results would be delayed by three weeks over the auditors valuation of certain fixed assets. MTM warned that its profits - expected to be in the region of Pounds 23m - would be 'substantially below current City expectations'. Entertainment group European Leisure slipped 2 to 5p as it warned of continuing difficulties in its trading performance. Speculation rose that Thorn EMI had emerged as favourite to buy Virgin's music division. The shares slipped 2 to 807p. Preliminary talks have taken place with potential purchasers of all or a major part of Dalepak, according to the company. This lifted the shares 71 to 433p. Food retailer Ashley Group, jumped 8 to 50p as the resignation of Mr Anthony Butler as chief executive encouraged speculation about a consortium bid for the company. Suggestions of a possible price war, involving the big supermarkets, knocked 5 off J. Sainsbury and Tesco to 387p and 265p respectively. A research document from Goldman Sachs warned that the introduction of US style warehouse clubs into Britain, with heavy discounting on bulk purchases, poses a potential competitive threat to food retailers. Do-it-yourself store owners took a hammering on fears of a price war following a series of press adverts offering a sharp reduction in prices. Boots' fall of 7 to 472p was a reflection of the depressed pharmaceutical sector rather than its position as a major retailer. The first day of trading in Rosebys saw shares in the household textiles retailer finish at 124p, compared with the placing price of 115p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (61).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano, who described days ago the 1937 Nanjing massacre as a  "hoax," withdrew his remarks today in the face of mounting  criticism both at home and abroad.    "My remarks on the historical incident (of the Nanjing  massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I  would like to retract them," he told a press conference in the  Justice Ministry.    The newly appointed minister told the "MAINICHI SHIMBUN" in  an interview Tuesday that he believed the Nanjing massacre "is a  fabrication" and it was wrong to say "Japan's invasion of  neighboring nations before and during the (Second World) War was  an act of aggression."    The now-defunct Imperial Japanese Army troops killed more  than 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing City of Jiangsu  Province in east China in December 1937, historians say.    Nagano's comment denying the historical facts sparked sharp  criticism from other Asian countries, which suffered bitterly  under Japan's military heels.    "Yesterday, Prime Minister (Tsutomu) Hata said in Paris  regarding our country's history that our country's aggression  and colonial rule (of its Asian neighbors) inflicted unbearable  suffering and sorrow on many people," the minister said.    He acknowledged that the massacre is an "undeniable fact."    Nagano, who is a member of Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), also said he "feels fully responsible" for the war  remarks and was willing to accept Hata's decision over his  future.    Hata, now on a four-nation European tour, criticized  Nagano's  remarks Wednesday as "inappropriate" and admitted Japan's  wartime atrocities, saying the Japanese should not repeat such  mistakes.    Earlier today, Japan's second largest opposition party, the  Social Democratic Party, urged Hata to fire the justice minister  for what he has said.    Nagano, 71,graduated in 1941 from a former elite Japanese  military academy and took part in the 1937-1945 war of  aggression against China as an Army officer.    He joined the Ground Self-Defense Force after the end of the  war and moved up to the top rank of chief of staff before he  retired from the military in 1980.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By M.K. Shukla] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 7 -- Armed forces of Pakistan and  the U.S. have begun a five-week-long joint exercise in the  rugged mountains north of Peshawar. The objectives include  preparing both Pakistani and American troops for  highly-specialised high-altitude warfare, say military experts  here.    It is learnt that 150 U.S. commandos arrived in Islamabad on  Thursday [January 6] to commence the exercises. Besides  imparting training to their Pakistani counterparts, U.S. troops,  too, will gain considerable experience in high-altitude warfare  from these exercises, since the terrain chosen is ideal for this  purpose.    Military observers in Delhi have expressed concern that the  expertise gained by Pakistani troops from these exercises could  have a bearing on the future of the Siachen dispute. However,  it is learnt that last year also a similar joint exercise was  conducted. Its continuance for a second year in succession is  indicative of the U.S.'s growing military cooperation with  Pakistan, experts say.    Highly-placed sources here said that the Americans have  clarified that not many U.S. soldiers are participating in the  mutual training scheme and too much significance should not be  attached to the matter.    It has, however, been confirmed that troops belonging to  certain special units of the U.S. Central Command will be taking  part in the programme which is being conducted on the southern  slopes of the mighty Hindukush ranges.    Sources here also revealed that the Chief of Army Staff, Gen  B.C. Joshi, had advised his senior officers not to get unduly  alarmed over this development. The Indian Air Force is also  learnt to share this perception.    Yet, coming in the wake of a succession of anti-lndian  statements from the Clinton Administration and given its clear  "tilt" towards Pakistan in South Asian affairs, many officials  in Delhi are understandably worried by the latest development  which comes just after the failure of the Foreign Secretary  level talks between India and Pakistan.    A source in the Army, however, discounted the possibility of  Pakistan being able to overrun Indian positions in the Siachen  glacier with the help of U.S. training. "We are considered  Number One in high altitude warfare by one and all," he said.    He pointed out that past efforts by Pakistan to spring a  surprise on Indian positions in Siachen (where temperatures  range between 40 and 50 degrees below zero) had been effectively  beaten back. Both the Pakistani army and air force got a bloody  nose in their attempt to dislodge Indians from their militarily  superior position on the glacier.    Military experts here feel that the joint high altitude  exercise could, nevertheless, be mutually beneficial. The U.S.  Army may be aiming for combat readiness for such warfare in view  of changing geo-political realities in mountainous Central Asia.    Both Pakistan and the U.S. have a strong interest in the  region in today's post-USSR scenario. The entire region has  become volatile and politically unstable following the carving  out of independent, mainly Islamic, republics. Clearly, the  Americans see Central Asia as a potential trouble spot for the  future and want to be in readiness to face any eventuality.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Italians invest in white goods unit of Polly Peck THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International, have agreed a deal under which Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group best known for its Ariston brand, has bought 25 per cent of two Turkish white goods producers owned by Vestel, the Turkish consumer electronics subsidiary of the collapsed fruit and electronics conglomerate. Separately, Candy, another leading Italian manufacturer, has signed a L70bn (Pounds 31.8m) deal with the Libyan government to build and equip a plant to produce 50,000 refrigerators within the next two years. The Merloni deal, being conducted jointly with Philco Italia, in which Merloni has a 50 per cent stake, includes an option to buy a further minimum 26 per cent share in the two Turkish companies within the next two years. Merloni is paying Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.3m) with a further Dollars 9.5m if it exercises its option. It is also injecting Dollars 8m in capital into the two companies, which were set up recently. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, Polly Peck's administrator, said the sale was unlikely to provide any funds for the Pounds 1.3bn owed to the 23,000 creditors. The two Turkish groups are called Pekel Teknik and Pekel Pazarlama. They have 750 employees and make fridges and washing machines respectively. Combined output amounted to about 200,000 units last year, and is forecast to rise to 300,000 this year, two-thirds of it fridges.</p>

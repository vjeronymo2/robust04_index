			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY HOME SALES DOWN 20% IN AUGUST FROM A YEAR AGO  </P> <P> Home sales in Orange County dropped 20% in August from a year ago, according to  TRW Real Estate Market Information.  </P> <P> But last year was an unusually hot year for home sales, so this year's dip in  sales was anticipated and represents a more normal market, experts said.  </P> <P> TRW estimated that 4,431 homes were sold in the county in August, compared to  5,613 last year.  </P> <P> The average price of a home was $251,959, which includes both condominiums and  houses. That rose 12% from a year ago, when the price was $195,023.  </P> <P> TRW includes sales of both new and used homes in its calculations.  </P> <P> There was some good news for the real estate industry in August's figures: The  numbers represented a 28% increase in sales from July, probably because lower  mortgage rates lured more buyers into the market.  </P> <P> Only 3,461 homes were sold in Orange County in July, TRW said. The average  price was actually a little bit higher in July, at $252,987.  </P></p>

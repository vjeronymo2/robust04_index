			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul, traitor  Kim Yong-sam on 27 May toured a combat fighters corps, the  headquarters of an army division in the frontline area, and the  headquarters of a Navy fleet. He babbled that an impregnable  guard posture against North Korea should be assumed.    This warmonger, wearing a mask of civilian politics, also  raved that now is a very dangerous time, one should have  strength, and so forth. He had fighters stage an emergency  mobilization training, and inspected the guard posture of the  puppet army units against North Korea in the frontline area.  Thus, he frantically ran amok to instigate war fever.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam's tour of frontline areas this time was  a thoroughgoing war junket aimed at confirming the posture of  readiness of the puppet army for a northward aggression and at  provoking a war against us at any time.</p>

Mr Borujerdi referred to the visit paid by the Turkish  consul  in Orumiyeh to the victims of the incident and said: The  existence of these witnesses to the bombings must have removed  any doubts Turkish officials may have had about the bombs  falling around the Sar-e Dasht area. He added: The Islamic  Republic of Iran strongly requests that the Turkish Government  adopt measures ensuring that future military operations by that  country in northern Iraq will not inflict any harm or damage to  the Islamic Republic of Iran's borders, even if such operations  take place close to our country's frontiers.    Mr. Haktanir, the Turkish ambassador to Tehran, for his part  expressed deep regret over the tragic incident and said: The  Iranian authorities and nation must rest assured that the plans  of Turkey's military officials were to attack the positions of  PKK guerrillas inside Iraqi territory, and that was precisely  why we immediately sent a special fact-finding team to examine  the situation close up with Iranian officials. He added: The  Turkish Government will not forego any measure to make up for  the losses inflicted, and the proposals of the Government of the  Islamic Republic of Iran will be speedily conveyed to the  Turkish authorities.</p>

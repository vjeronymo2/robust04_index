			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Management: Bonus for quality Toshiba's UK copier salesmen will not necessarily get bonus payments for hitting their sales targets. Dealers must also conform to the company's quality programme to gain their sales incentives. Two years ago Toshiba launched a campaign to persuade its complete UK dealer network to register for BS5750, the widely used but increasingly controversial quality systems standard. It recently decided to provide an additional encouragement by linking incentive payments to adherence to its quality programme. Number three in the UK copier market after Xerox and Canon, Toshiba has focused on its quality programme to boost customer satisfaction, says Angus Drever, general manager. Thirteen of the company's 80 UK dealers have qualified for BS5750 and another 20 have applied for registration. Toshiba hopes to have its entire network registered within the next two years. BS5750 has attracted criticism because it is not a guarantee of product or service quality but a measure of the consistency of a company's internal procedures. In theory it could be obtained by providing a poor but consistent level of service. To flesh out the standard Toshiba insists that its dealers agree to implement its code of practice, provide an eight-hour response time and regularly monitor customer satisfaction. 'We could have set a 16-hour response time but nobody wants to wait two days for a repair,' comments Drever. Under the second stage of its quality programme, Toshiba has tied dealer-incentive payments into a 10-point quality programme. It is too early to say whether the incentive scheme will provide an additional boost to customer satisfaction. But it does indicate that quality systems require an attention to detail that goes well beyond buying a certificate off the shelf.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Kono is all tact after UN talk: Jurek Martin tries to pin down Japanese foreign minister's agenda There are two ways to read the speech that Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, delivered to the United Nations general assembly on the subject of his country's membership of an enlarged Security Council. The first is to conclude that Japan is putting the world on notice that it expects its contributions to the UN finally to be recognised with a Security Council seat by the end of next year at the latest. The second is that Japan's time-frame is nothing like as tight. Interviewed by a small group of correspondents from western newspapers in the offices of the Japanese mission to the UN, Mr Kono made no threats, but exuded a quiet insistence that the time had come. 'I think it is inevitable the time is needed for any agreement in an organisation with so large a membership,' he said. 'My speech reflected Japanese mentality,' he added about the address on Tuesday. 'It is more convenient, better, to think in round figures, like 50 or 100.' Next year is the 50th anniversary of the UN, thus it was 'a logical objective'. However, he declared, there was no setting of a firm deadline. He was not specific about how big an expanded Security Council might be, settling, vaguely, at 'around 20 countries', and declined to identify who they might be. He also ducked the obvious question as to whether the power of veto should be extended beyond that possessed by the current permanent five - the US, Russia, Britain, France and China. 'That will require a lot of discussion.' But he then made the argument that possession of nuclear weapons should not be the only criterion. 'It is important to have countries with a non-nuclear frame of mind' on the Council, for the simple reason that international security could no longer be defined exclusively in military terms. 'Today, the UN is expected to play all sorts of roles,' he argued, listing the environment, development, refugees, disaster relief and nuclear non-proliferation. Permanent members 'should have experience and other capabilities' on which the existing five members do not have a monopoly. Mr Kono agreed that the change in government in Tokyo had altered Japan's approach to membership, with the clear divisions that marked the coalition headed by Mr Morohiro Hosokawa now replaced by a consistent view. There might still be reservations in the Social Democratic and Buddhist parties, he said, 'but within the cabinet there is agreement behind this new push'. The foreign minister also diplomatically declined an invitation to say whether Japan would support a second term for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. It was 'too early' to assess his performance or contemplate the succession. But, clearly aware that the secretary-general will be an important player in UN reform, Mr Kono noted how hard Mr Boutros Ghali had worked to improve relations between the UN and Japan, and with Asia in general. Mr Kono was careful not to give the impression that Japan was consciously leading an Asian movement for greater influence in the UN. Asian growth had been 'breathtaking', with many nations now 'more confident' and ready to speak out on a wide variety of issues. But some were 'still mired in poverty'. But with Japan contributing 12 per cent of the UN budget, and with the world's largest development aid budget, Mr Kono thinks his country's case for membership now stands on its own merit.</p>

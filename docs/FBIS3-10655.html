			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A survey by two energy experts -- professors Adriano  Pires Rodrigues and Danilo de Souza Dias from Rio de Janeiro  Federal University -- concluded that if the oil monopoly is  maintained, our country will become increasingly dependent on  oil imports.    Petrobras is not in a position to make the required  investments -- $102 billion through the year 2010 -- to maintain  the current production rate, representing 55 percent of total  oil consumption.    The professors recommend the participation of other  enterprises in the exploration of new areas and a law to  regulate this activity.</p>

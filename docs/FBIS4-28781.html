			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] According to a source in the foreign job  placement field, Libya has instructed Libyan employers to send  Thai workers home in three months. Earlier this year Libya  announced that it would not hire any Thai workers. Libyan  employers have begun to hire many workers from China and Vietnam  to replace outgoing Thai workers.    Piti Chuchunmanakit, manager of the Siri and Son Job  Placement Company, which places Thai workers in Libyan jobs,  said Libya has implemented a new policy which bars completely  the hiring of Thai workers. Cooperation has been sought from  employers to gradually send all Thai workers home. In three  more months, the contracts of most Thai workers will have  expired and they will have to return home.    According to Piti, Libya's annoucement was first regarded as  merely a threat. Recently, the Libyan Government sent circulars  to employers telling them to stop hiring Thai workers. Piti  said he could not estimate how many Thai workers would be sent  home, noting that the number of Thai workers is quite large. He  said: "About 800 workers placed by my firm now remain in Libya.  All of them would have to return home in three months."    Piti said, among Middle East countries, Libya has a very big  demand for foreign workers. Huge projects, such as gas and oil  distilleries, are at the beginning stage. Thousands of Thai  workers could have found jobs there if it had not been for the  international political problem.    Piti added that Libya and Iran pay the highest wages in the  Middle East. Despite the number of Thai workers in Liyba, the  Thai Government and the Labor Ministry have not attempted to  solve the problem on their behalf. As a solution, job placement  firms will probably look to Iran, where wages are also high.  [passage omitted]</p>

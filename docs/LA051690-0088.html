			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT AMERICAN BANK NARROWS LOSS IN QUARTER  </P> <P> Great American Bank on Tuesday reported a $1.2-million first-quarter loss, an  encouraging sign after the troubled San Diego-based thrift nearly drowned in a  tide of red ink in 1989.  </P> <P> But Great American also reported a continued deterioration of the overall  quality of its loans and said it is enmeshed in a dispute with the federal  Office of Thrift Supervision over the value of certain loans.  </P> <P> If OTS auditors prevail in the dispute, to be settled during the current  quarter ending June 30, a revaluation of the loans could ensue, resulting in  writedowns of up to $65 million to be charged against Great American's  earnings.  </P> <P> Great American's loss for the quarter ended March 30 contrasted with an  $11-million profit for the same period last year. But Great American executives  took heart in the fact that the loss was an improvement from the $198.9 million  and $263.4 million losses for the 1989 fourth quarter and full year,  respectively.  </P> <P> Last year's loss, caused largely by loss provisions set aside to cover  non-performing commercial and apartment loans in Arizona, put Great American on  the brink of insolvency. As of Dec. 31, Great American was deficient in all  three standards applied by the OTS to test a thrift's capital, or its financial  cushion against loss. The S&amp;L was given a Dec. 31, 1990, deadline to sell  itself or raise $350 million in outside capital to avoid a possible regulatory  seizure.  </P> <P> However, there are signs that Great American still has not turned the corner on  its bad loans. Its non-performing assets as of March 31 rose to $556.7 million,  or 3.61% of assets, from $539.4 million, or 3.39% of assets, as of Dec. 31. The  percentage increase also reflects the shrinkage in Great American's assets, to  $15.4 billion as of March 31 from $15.9 billion at the end of last year.  </P> <P> Another bad sign for the S&amp;L was that its classified assets, a broader  category of problem loans, increased over the three-month period to $1.389  billion, up from $1.297 billion as of Dec. 31.  </P> <P> That OTS inspectors have not fully completed their field reviews of Great  American loans could be another ominous sign for the S&amp;L. The OTS has  reviewed all of the S&amp;L's Arizona loans and those of its real estate  development subsidiary, but not Great American's loans made by its California  and Washington branches.  </P> <P> The strict standards imposed by OTS audits of Great American's Arizona loans  were factors in the S&amp;L taking huge loan losses in 1989. Great American  expects to receive written results of the examination during the current  quarter ending June 30.  </P> <P> Thanks to an accounting technique, Great American reported that its capital  position improved somewhat over the first quarter. The technique involved a  reallocation of $34.6 million in retained earnings from Great American's real  estate development operation to the S&amp;L. Despite this, Great American's  so-called tangible capital is still $99.1 million short of minimum regulatory  requirements.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L also declined to comment on reports that it has offered its chief  executive post to James M. Cirona, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of  San Francisco.  </P></p>

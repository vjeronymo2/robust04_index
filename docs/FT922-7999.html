			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 22% downturn at Tomkinsons In another difficult interim period, Tomkinsons, the floor coverings group, limited its drop in sales to just over 4 per cent, but saw pre-tax profit fall by 22 per cent. For the six months to March 21, sales came to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 10.4m) and profit to Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 491,000) after interest charges were cut to Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 65,000). Mr Lowry Maclean, chairman, was confident that the performance would prove to be better than many competitors. He said an operating margin of 3.9 per cent, coupled with low gearing of 1.5 per cent, continued to demonstrate underlying strength. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.5p. Earnings per share dropped 1p to 4.2p.</p>

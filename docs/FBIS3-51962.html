The poll, which was conducted by the National Advisory  Center  [Centro Nacional de Consultoria -- CNC] in Medellin, the second  largest city in the country, invited opinions on the presence of  U.S. soldiers in Colombia.    It showed that 73 percent of those polled flatly rejected  the  foreign presence, 18 percent favored it, and 9 percent did not  reply.    The rejection emerged in late December when a contingent of  U.S. Marines arrived in the Pacific region to carry out charity  works, according to the government's official report. According  to the report, these foreigners are building a school, a health  center, and a stretch of a road. Their arrival, however,  sparked very angry comments, and several politicians even  dismissed their tasks, claiming that Colombian soldiers could  carry them out without foreign aid.    EL COLOMBIANO reported that those polled pointed out that  "they do not accept the presence of U.S. Marines along the  Colombian coast. Likewise, they mistrust the government's  explanations about the works that are being carried out there."    When asked whether the presence of U.S. soldiers violates  sovereignty, 69 percent replied yes, 20 percent replied no, and  11 percent replied they did not know. When asked whether they  believe the soldiers are building schools and roads, 66 percent  of those polled replied no, 10 percent replied yes, and 24  percent did not answer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 10 Apr (TANJUG) -- Units of the [Bosnian]  Serb army have not entered Gorazde, and they are not firing on  the town, the command of the Herzegovina Corps announced this  evening, denying the news broadcast by Muslim media and quoted  by some world news agencies.    Officials in the Herzegovina Corps command claim that the  reports that the Serb army is using poison gases are also  untrue. The same command says that the truth is that Muslims  have recently used poison gases -- made in the fertilizer  factory in Vitkovici -- in the battles south of Gorazde.</p>

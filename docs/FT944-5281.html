			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Leaders aim to upgrade CSCE role: Bruce Clark on debate beginning today over a new security order The leaders of more than 50 nations gather in Budapest today for an ambitious effort to work out a new security order for Europe and the former Soviet republics, aimed at reducing the danger of further conflicts such as Bosnia. The idea of upgrading the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has some powerful supporters, including US President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. While Germany and Russia are long-standing proponents of a stronger CSCE, the US has weighed in more recently with its own proposals to make the institution a more effective instrument for preventative diplomacy and arms control. The CSCE comprises the US, Canada, and almost every country in Europe and the former Soviet Union. It was born nearly 20 years as a playing field for cold war diplomacy, in which the Soviet Union promoted respect for existing borders, while western countries advanced the principle of human rights and free speech. A document circulated two weeks ago by the US calls for the CSCE to 'assume a central role in the promotion of a common European security space ...' But a shadow has been cast over the summit by the grave problems that arose last week in the other international institutions that are supposed to be dealing with security in Europe: the United Nations, Nato and the 'contact group' on Bosnia. With the US, Russia and the main west European powers barely able to conceal their differences over Bosnia and the future of Nato, diplomats say they will be hard pressed to bring any real credibility to the more ambitious project of an upgraded CSCE. An important product of the CSCE process was the treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), a giant exercise in non-nuclear disarmament whose terms Russia now wants to revise. But the CSCE's commitment to border security was unable to prevent the disintegration from within of three of its founder members: the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Czechoslovakia. The CSCE's human rights inspectorate has worked well in places such as the Baltic states and Albania which were keen to co-operate because they felt they were being unfairly accused of ill-treating minorities. Yet the break-up of the Soviet Union has left the CSCE with a number of member states - particularly on the southern flank of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a group of 12 former Soviet republics which Russia increasingly dominates - which make no pretence of observing western norms on human rights. Moscow would now like the CSCE to become the apex of a new security system whose twin arms would be Nato and the CIS. Western countries have balked at any suggestion of downgrading Nato, but the US has recently spelt out a compromise position: the CSCE should be boosted, without watering down the Atlantic alliance in any way. Both the US and Hungary, which is hosting today's meeting, have suggested going halfway to meet Russian aspirations for a stronger CSCE would help to blunt Moscow's objections to the enlargement of Nato. However, the tough position adopted by Russia at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels last week suggests that Moscow will not be bought off easily. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, refused at the last moment to approve a Russia-Nato co-operation programme, in protest at Nato's newly adopted plans for faster enlargement. This came after the US, in the hope of assuaging Moscow, had persuaded its 15 allies in Nato to support its proposals for a stronger CSCE. The US now supports the German idea that CSCE members should refer any conflicts to the CSCE as a 'halfway house' before resorting to the UN. Washington also wants the CSCE to develop stronger 'early warning' mechanisms which could give notice of potential conflicts and help to defuse them. A big test of the CSCE will be the fate of its long-standing effort to set up a peace-keeping force in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave of Azerbaijan where tens of thousands have died in fighting since 1988. Moscow wants any peacekeeping force to be mainly Russian, while Azerbaijan has been pressing, with western support, for a multinational effort. Russia's insistence on as free as possible a hand for its 'peace-keeping' activities has fuelled western fears that Moscow simply wants to use the CSCE to license its military presence in the southern republics of the CIS. Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has postponed his departure for Budapest because one of the most prominent campaigners for the republic's independence, Mr Georgy Chanturia, was assassinated over the weekend. His associates blamed 'imperialist forces'.</p>

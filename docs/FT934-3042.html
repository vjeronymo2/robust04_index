			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Pilkington It has taken a frustratingly long time to achieve, but Pilkington appears at last to be getting a real grip on its business. A further Pounds 30m of cost savings in the first half has helped reinforce an encouraging productivity trend. The sale of the Sola spectacle lens business, netting some Pounds 200m, has now cut gearing to a more manageable 67 per cent. And, following a squeeze on working capital, Pilkington even promises to become marginally cash positive this year - for the first time since 1989. The doubling of interim pre-tax profits represents the first tangible fruits of such developments. It would even be tempting to grow quite excited about Pilkington's prospects if the company could replicate its US performance in Europe. A combination of price rises, volume improvements and cost reductions resulted in US operating profits leaping from Pounds 2m to Pounds 15m, highlighting the wonders of operational gearing. Greater sales of higher added value glasses further gilded the profits rebound. The trouble is Europe shows few signs of following the same pattern in the immediate future. Severe over-capacity still undermines Pilkington's attempts to tickle prices higher in the UK. Despite recovering demand in the UK and the resilience of the German building industry, sales remain desperately weak. Moreover, Volkswagen's continuing assault on costs threatens a further downward spiral in automotive glass prices. Pilkington's shareholders must retain their extraordinary patience.</p>

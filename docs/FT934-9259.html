			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Lone-parent claimants up sharply, official data show CONSERVATIVE MPs urged the government yesterday to press ahead with its examination of ways to cut state benefit to single-parent families after new data showed a sharp rise in the number of lone parents claiming social security in recent years. Government figures showed that the number of lone parents claiming income support, one of the main benefits disbursed by the Department of Social Security, had risen by more than 38 per cent in the past five years. Nearly half those claimants were single women, and 45 per cent of all claimants had received the benefit for more than two years. The release of the figures coincided with a row in Westminster over whether ministers were planning to cut state benefit to lone parents in an attempt to reduce the social security budget. On Tuesday, a leaked cabinet document had claimed that the growth in the number of lone parents was 'a burden on public expenditure'. It also disclosed that ministers were considering cutting state benefits. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, played down the prospect that the government would cut benefits to that group. But yesterday, Mr Alan Duncan, a backbench Tory MP and member of the Commons select committee on social security, said the data were another indication that a 'culture' of lone mothers was growing. 'We must pursue our survey of how much this is costing and we are entitled to ask whether any cuts in the costs can be made,' he said. Yesterday's figures showed nearly 1m lone parents claiming benefit in summer 1992, compared with 694,000 in May 1988. The number of lone parents claiming income support as a proportion of all claimants had also risen over that period, from 16 per cent to 18.8 per cent. Lone parents also turned out to be the largest single category of claimants for housing benefit last year, ahead of the disabled and the unemployed. These figures go some way towards explaining the rising cost to the state of supporting lone parents - at Pounds 6.6bn DSS in the 1992-93 financial year, about 8 per cent of the total social security budget. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security secretary, said the figures underlined that the government had to increase childcare provision and educational opportunities. 'We have learnt this week that policy is conducted from prejudice and not from facts,' he said.</p>

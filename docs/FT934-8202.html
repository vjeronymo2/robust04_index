			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / NZ poll stalemate broken THE National party early today picked up the crucial Waitaki seat from Labour in the official recount of New Zealand's election, giving it a slender majority in the new parliament. The win gave the party, headed by prime minister Jim Bolger, 50 seats in the 99-seat single-chamber parliament and Labour 45, with two minor parties, the Alliance and New Zealand First, having two seats each. But opposition parties were expected to demand that Mr Bolger's government provide a Speaker, who may have to use his casting vote to support the government on crucial matters. There were two marginal seats left to be declared, but political analysts thought they were unlikely to cause an upset. Labour's narrow loss of Waitaki was the first change since the official recount began in the cliffhanger election, held on November 6. But a number of seats are held with tiny majorities and some defeated candidates say they will seek judicial reviews or electoral petitions, which could mean that the final outcome may not be known till January.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) Sir John Cuckney to seek Maxwell assets Correction (published 20th June 1992) appended to this article. SIR John Cuckney, a leading City figure with a reputation as a company doctor, is to head a new government trust to solicit contributions on behalf of the Maxwell company pensioners. The trust, announced last week by Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary, will also aid in the return of stolen pension fund assets. In announcing the trust, Mr Lilley said many financial institutions which had profited handsomely from legitimate transactions with Mr Robert Maxwell over the years 'may well feel some moral obligation to assist the pensioners who have so cruelly lost at Maxwell's hands'. The government is said to be reminding City institutions of the possibility of new regulations should voluntary appeals not be met. However, City financial institutions and advisers to Mr Maxwell have reacted with indignation to the suggestion that they have an obligation to aid pensioners, saying they are not responsible for the theft. Sir John will also be responsible for co-ordinating government efforts to trace and secure Maxwell pension fund assets outside the UK and for co-ordinating legal moves by trustees for the various pension fund schemes. Sir John is non-executive chairman of Royal Insurance and will soon be departing as chairman of 3i, the UK's largest source of venture finance. Until December 1990 he was a director of Lazard Brothers, the investment bank, which was at one time manager of a portion of the Maxwell company pension funds. Separately, it emerged yesterday that Robson Rhodes, liquidators to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pensions funds, is to sue Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell for the recovery of Pounds 850m of assets. A detailed civil writ for Pounds 450m was issued against Mr Kevin Maxwell on December 8 last year. Another writ for Pounds 400m against Mr Ian Maxwell was served several months ago. Mr Kevin Maxwell has until July 6 to file a defence and a High Court hearing will take place next month. The court has yet to set a date on the charges relating to Mr Ian Maxwell. The actions are civil cases and are entirely independent of any criminal action which may be taken against the brothers. Correction (published 20th June 1992) appended to this article. THE FT of Monday June 15 incorrectly reported that Lazard Brothers managed a portion of the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme. In fact, Lazard Freres and Co was the manager.

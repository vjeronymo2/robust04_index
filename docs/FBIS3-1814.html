However, Chien said, th ROC will not forge diplomatic  relations with a number of "mini" states simply to reach that  goal.    "We'll develop formal ties only with those countries whose  ecoomies are complementary with ours and whose political  situations are stable," Chien told a press conference at the  Foreign Ministry.    The ROC currently maintains diplomatic ties with 29  countries, mostly in Latin America and Africa.    "The government needs the support of the press and academic  communities as well as the Legislative Yuan in seeking to expand  diplomatic frontiers," Chien said.    He stressed that the government will continue to seek  membership in major international organizations and forge  diplomatic ties with more countries under the "one China" policy.    "China is divided and ruled by two separate governments,"  Chien said. "As a sovereign state, the ROC, which controls  Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, is entitled to have a role in  the world arena."    Chien said that although Beijing has spared no efforts to  block Taiwan's international presence, the ROC won't abandon its  bid to join the United Nations and other important world bodies.    Chien added that he is reserved toward a proposal made  recently by a Taiwan affairs official in Beijing that the two  sides stop their "cutthroat" competition on the diplomatic front.    "It is Beijing that has adopted a `zero-sum' strategy  against  Taiwan in diplomatic arenas," Chien said. "In forging ties with  other countries, we have never asked them to either totally cut  relations or reduce exchanges with Beijing."    "Under the current conditions, I doubt the Chinese Communist  Party leadership will accept the so-called `diplomatic truce'  overture," Chien said, adding that unless Mainland China's  political system changes, cross-strait relations are unlikely to  make great headway.</p>

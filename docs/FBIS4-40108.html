			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine intends to take part in the formation of a  UN peace-keeping rapid deployment force. This was reported on  Monday [13 June] to INTERFAX-Ukraine by a senior official at the  Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Vladimir Yelchenko.    He said Ukraine is most likely to form a battalion of  specially trained paratroopers who will be required to speak  foreign languages. Kiev is also ready to offer Ilyushin-76  transport planes for peace-keeping operations.    Yelchenko said that the final decision on the matter has not  been made, as organizational and financial questions should be  resolved first. He voiced hope that part of the spending on the  formation of the Ukrainian contingent would be assumed by the  United Nations.    Under the constitution the involvement of Ukrainian troops  in  operations overseas should be sanctioned by parliament.  However, Yelchenko thinks that if the Ukrainian contingent is  formed, the decision on its use will be made by the head of  state after an appropriate appeal from the United Nations.    The idea of forming a UN rapid deployment force belongs to  the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. In a letter to him last  February President Leonid Kravchuk confirmed Ukraine's readiness  to take part in the formation of the force.</p>

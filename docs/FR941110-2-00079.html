Texas Gas Transmission Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP95&hyph;36&hyph;000] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on October 26, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky, 42302, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;36&hyph;000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), requesting authority to abandon in place a purchase meter station and related pipeline located in Panola County, Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open for public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas asserts that the facilities proposed to be abandoned consist of a dual 12-inch purchase meter station known as the Union Pacific PMS (``old'' Union Pacific PMS) and approximately 1,298 feet of related 20-inch pipeline, as well as approximately 20 feet of 20-inch line installed in conjunction with the installation of a ``new'' Union Pacific PMS, with all appurtenances, located at the Union Pacific Resources Company's East Texas Plant (East Texas Plant) in Panola County, Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that Texas Gas proposes to transfer ownership to Union Pacific Resources Company (UPRC) the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS, approximately 1,248 feet of the ``old'' 20-inch pipeline, and approximately 20 feet of ``new'' 20-inch pipeline installed in conjunction with the construction of the ``new'' Union Pacific PMS. The remaining approximately 50 feet of ``old'' 20-inch pipeline located downstream of the ``new'' Union Pacific PMS will be abandoned in place, but not transferred to UPRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also stated that the facilities for which Texas Gas seeks abandonment approval are utilized to receive natural gas purchased by Texas Gas or transported by Texas Gas from various producers located in the Carthage Area in Texas. However, because the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS is located  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inside  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the East Texas Plant yard, Texas Gas states that operation of the facilities has become increasingly difficult. Therefore, UPRC and Texas Gas agreed to ``relocate'' the Union Pacific PMS to an area outside the plant property downstream of the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS. (The ``new'' Union Pacific PMS was constructed and installed pursuant to Section 157.208 of the Commission's regulations.) In the instant application, Texas Gas is requesting authority to: (1) Abandon by transfer to UPRC the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS and all the related 20-inch pipeline located upstream of the ``new'' Union Pacific PMS, as well as a small portion of ``new'' 20-inch pipeline installed in conjunction with the ``new'' meter station; and (2) abandon in place a portion of the ``old'' 20-inch pipeline located downstream of the ``New'' Union Pacific PMS. Texas gas states that the relocation of these facilities will eliminate the operational problems now existing at the location of the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS while continuing to allow Texas Gas to receive gas into its system from the East Texas Plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment date: November 23, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

Box 1273, Charleston, West Virginia 25325&hyph;1273, filed an application for: (1) A certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing construction and operation of certain natural gas facilities to provide firm transportation service under Rate Schedule FTS pursuant to Part 284 of the Commission's regulation for Panda-Brandywine, L.P. (Panda), a new firm service customer; and (2) an order granting permission and approval to abandon an existing segment of natural gas transmission facilities to be replaced to aid in providing the service to Panda; all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, Applicant states that Panda has requested up to 24,240 Dth/d of firm service under Rate Schedule FTS, which will be used to supply natural gas to its Brandywine, Maryland cogeneration plant. Applicant states that the proposed construction will consist of three segments: (a) The first segment's construction will be approximately 4.1 miles of 36-inch pipeline loop on Line WB in Hardy County, West Virginia; (b) the second segment's construction will be approximately 1.6 miles of 36-inch pipeline designated as Line WB&hyph;5, which will replace by abandonment approximately 1.5 miles of 26-inch pipeline in three sections designated as Line WB, Braxton County, West Virginia; and (c) the third segment's construction will be approximately 0.6 miles of 36-inch pipeline loop on Line WB&hyph;5 in Clay County, West Virginia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant estimates that the proposed facilities total cost will be $11,448,000. Applicant states that Panda has agreed to make a contribution-in-aid of construction of up to $8,772,590, toward the actual cost of construction of the proposed facilities, plus any gross-up for income taxes. Applicant claims that the remaining balance for construction will be financed through funds generated from internal sources. Applicant states that the net book value of the 1.5 mile segment of Line WB, to be abandoned by replacement, is $727,000. Applicant estimates that the revenues associated with its proposal are greater than the cost of service which results in a net benefit to Applicant and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its customers. Finally, Applicant states that the proposed construction will aid in the development of a natural gas-fired electric power generation in Washington, DC and a major portion of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : November 23, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

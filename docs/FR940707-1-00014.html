The person shall certify to the OHA that it has complied with the requirement of this paragraph. The OHA may notify other persons participating in the proceeding of such comments and provide an opportunity for such persons to respond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1003.54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Contents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The application shall contain a full and complete statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the circumstances, act or transaction that is the subject of the application and to the OHA action sought. Such facts shall include the names and addresses of all affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable); a complete statement of the business or other reasons that justify the act or transaction; a description of the acts or transactions that would be affected by the requested action; and a full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any relevant documents. Copies of all contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relevant to the application shall be submitted to the OHA upon its request. A copy of the order of which modification or rescission is sought shall be included with the application. When the application pertains to only one step of a larger integrated transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information pertaining to the entire transaction shall be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The applicant shall state whether he requests or intends to request that there be a conference regarding the application. Any request not made at the time the application is filed shall be made as soon thereafter as possible, to insure that the conference is held when it will be most beneficial. The request and the OHA's determination regarding it shall be made in accordance with subpart F of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The applicant shall fully describe the events, acts, or transactions that comprise the significantly changed circumstances, as defined in &sect;1003.55(b)(2), upon which the application is based. The applicant shall state why, if the significantly changed circumstance is new or newly discovered facts, such facts were not or could not have been presented during the prior proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The application shall include a discussion of all relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal and exceptions relied upon to support the action sought therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1003.55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  OHA evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any application for modification or rescission provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating an application for modification or rescission, the OHA may convene a conference, on its own initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by &sect;1003.53, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) An application for modification or rescission of an order shall be processed only if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The application demonstrates that it is based on significantly changed circumstances; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The period within which a person may file an appeal has lapsed or, if an appeal has been filed, a final order has been issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``significantly changed circumstances'' shall mean_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The discovery of material facts that were not known or could not have been known at the time of the proceeding and action upon which the application is based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The discovery of a law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision on appeal or exception that was in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the application is based and which, if such had been made known to the OHA, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order of the OHA affecting the applicant was issued, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of such order and the date of the application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1003.56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Decision and order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding, the OHA shall issue an order granting or denying the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The order shall include a written statement setting forth the relevant facts and the legal basis of the order. The order shall state that it is a final order of which the applicant may seek judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The OHA shall serve a copy of the order upon the applicant, any other person who participated in the proceeding and upon any other person readily identifiable by the OHA as one who is aggrieved by such order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart F_Conferences and Hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1003.60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Purpose and scope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and conducting an OHA conference or hearing. Such proceedings shall be convened in the discretion of the OHA, consistent with OHA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1003.61 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Conferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a conference be convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding.

The request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific showing as to why such conference will materially advance the proceeding.

Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceeding. A transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the OHA in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the OHA in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1003.62 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that such hearing will materially advance the proceeding.

The request shall be in writing and shall include a specific showing as to why such hearing will materially advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA at the address provided in &sect;1003.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The OHA will designate an agency official to conduct the hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

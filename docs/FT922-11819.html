			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Accountants' salaries show sharp increase ACCOUNTANTS' salaries have risen sharply in the past year in spite of the recession, a survey by Hays Management Consultants showed yesterday. Average base salaries rose by 10.3 per cent in the 12 months to February 1 this year, down slightly from an increase of 11.1 per cent in the previous year. The consultants listed pay by experience category and said that the average salary for a first-year accountancy trainee early this year was Pounds 14,567. For a newly-qualified accountant it was Pounds 21,226, for someone with four to five years' experience after qualifying Pounds 27,627 and for someone having worked nine to 12 years after qualification Pounds 43,836. The only salary increase which was larger this year than last was for accountants who had qualified four to five years earlier, for which the figure grew by 11 per cent compared with 10 per cent last year. Pay for tax professionals was up 8.1 per cent, compared with 9.6 per cent in the previous 12 months. Average base salaries under the experience categories were Pounds 15,950, Pounds 24,711, Pounds 32,915 and Pounds 45,207. For industrial and service-sector companies, the average base salary was Pounds 14,303 for first-year trainees, Pounds 20,924 for newly-qualified staff, Pounds 27,121 for those four to five years after qualifying, and Pounds 42,244 for those qualified for nine to 12 years. In the public sector, salaries in the same categories were Pounds 14,146, Pounds 19,965, Pounds 25,461 and Pounds 40,965. In finance, they were Pounds 16,346, Pounds 23,971, Pounds 31,792 and Pounds 53,335 respectively. The salaries paid to those in private practice were within these ranges. The seventh annual Hays survey covered accountants from 522 organisations and tax professionals from 127. The survey also covered a range of benefits offered to the employees. Only 7 per cent of organisations did not provide company cars. The average list price of cars provided for a newly qualified accountant was Pounds 12,000, rising to about Pounds 19,000 for someone with nine to 12 years' service after qualifying. Pensions and company cars were the most common benefits offered, although a growing number of organisations was reviewing changes in the provision of these benefits. The usual number of holidays was 25 days per year. The largest growth in accountants' salaries came in the oil industry, with that for newly-qualified staff rising 27.4 per cent on last year and 24.2 per cent for those four to five years after qualifying.

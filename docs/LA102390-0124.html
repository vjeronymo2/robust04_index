			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SIGNS OF SUCCESS: Stanton City Council candidate Rand Hogan thinks he "must be  doing something right." Otherwise why would anyone bother to steal virtually  all 1,000 of his campaign signs from local lawns overnight? . . . "Everybody  expects to lose a few signs -- kids will get their percentage of them -- but  this was clearly a systematic destruction," he said. The Sheriff's Department  reports no suspects so far.

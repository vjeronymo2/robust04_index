			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  SUMMA'S PROJECT TO GET 'FRESH LOOK'  </P> <P> A Santa Monica-based development company, known for its ability to win  government approval for its projects, will attempt to resolve the controversies  surrounding the $1-billion Playa Vista project south of Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> Playa Vista, a massive planned community proposed for a 957-acre parcel owned  by Summa Corp., has been mired in controversy over its density and threat to  nearby wetlands.  </P> <P> An official of Maguire Thomas Partners, which acquired an interest in Playa  Vista for an undisclosed amount and will step in as managing general partner,  said the firm will take a "fresh look" at the project to see how community  concerns can be addressed.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose 6th District includes Playa  Vista, won election in part because of her opposition to the project. Last  August, she called for a 40% reduction in the amount of office space in the  project, for expansion of the wetlands and for a new environmental impact  report.  </P> <P> The city and the state Coastal Commission in 1986 approved plans allowing Summa  to build up to 8,837 housing units, 5.9-million square feet of office and  research space, 970,000 square feet of retail space, 2,400 hotel rooms and a  40-acre marina with 700 to 900 boat slips.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / US manufacturing outlook weakens THE outlook for US manufacturing industry deteriorated significantly last month, according to figures published yesterday. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a closely watched barometer of the health of manufacturing - fell sharply from 51.1 per cent in May to 48.3 per cent last month, reflecting a sudden drop in new orders. This was the lowest reading since December 1991 and sharply down from the 58 per cent reached in January, shortly after President Bill Clinton's election victory. A reading below 50 per cent is generally interpreted as a sign that the manufacturing sector is contracting. Separately, the Conference Board, a New York Business analysis group, said its index of business confidence fell sharply from 66 in the first quarter to 57 in the second quarter, the lowest level since late 1991. 'The desired improvement in new orders failed to materialise in June, resulting in a decline in the manufacturing sector and a dismal end to the second quarter,' said Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers. A sub-index measuring new orders fell from 53.5 per cent to 49 per cent in June. Indices measuring export orders, manufacturing production and employment also weakened. Mr Jason Bram, a Conference Board economist, said the euphoric mood among many businessmen at the beginning of the year had evaporated. But confidence varied significantly among sectors. Chief executives in finance and business services were the most positive, while 'manufacturers of food, textiles and apparel have become very negative.' Yesterday's reports were the latest in a series of weak economic figures, including recent falls in consumer confidence, home sales, factory orders and leading indicators. Many economists believe the pessimism partly reflects apprehension about the impact of tax increases proposed in the Clinton economic plan. US businessmen are also concerned about economic weakness in Europe and Japan. Employment figures for June, published today, will be closely scrutinised for signs of weakness in labour markets.</p>

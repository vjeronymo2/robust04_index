			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The director-general of the Industrial Works  Department, Manat Suksaman, has given an assurance that  factories along the Chao Phraya, Bang Pakong, Pa Sak, Tha Chin  and Nam Pong rivers will not pollute river water during the dry  season.    The department has made a series of inspections as part of a  five-month campaign beginning in January to monitor factories to  ensure they do not dump treated or untreated waste water which  fails to meet standards into public waterways.    The factories have been urged to economise on consumption of  water or to reuse treated water in the factories to help cushion  the impact of the severe water shortage.    The campaign is part of the government's effort to tackle  the  drought this year, the worst in 25 years.    Mr. Manat said: ``I can assure you that river water will not  be polluted by factories along either bank of five major rivers  during the dry season. However, I cannot be sure that the river  water will not be polluted by communities and farms.''    He said there will be constant inspections during the dry  season to ensure that the factories do not pollute the river  water.    ``The department has got tough with factories discharging  waste water into the rivers because the drought this year is the  worst ever, and a very low volume of water from major dams is  flowing into the rivers,'' he said.    ``Even a little waste water dumped into the rivers can  easily  pollute the water.''    Any factory found polluting river water will face severe  penalties, ranging from warnings and fines to imprisonment, he  said.    Last week Mr. Manat led a group of officials and engineers  to  inspect factories near the Bang Pakong river in Chachoengsao, to  monitor whether the department's campaign was being carried out  successfully.    He said that treated waste water from 33 major factories  sited on either bank of the Bang Pakong River is being  discharged into the river in very small amounts.    This is because of the limited volume of raw water. Most  factories are storing the treated water for further reuse,  especially for factory cleaning and garden watering. In  addition, the raw water sold in this area is very expensive, as  high as 100 baht per cubic metre.    After they followed the department's advice, factories can  reduce water consumption by 30 percent compared with the same  period last year. One million cubic metres worth one million  baht can be saved, he said.    Mr. Manat said the samples of water from the Bang Pakong  river show average salinity gauged at 24,500 parts per million  (ppm). Dissolved oxygen is gauged at five milligrammes per litre.    This indicates that the river water is too salty and is not  fit for consumption. The salinity standard of drinking water is  250 ppm.    Mr. Manat said factories sited on the banks of other target  rivers are also being kept under close watch.    Factors contributing to river pollution vary, he said. For  example, water in the Chao Phraya and Pa Sal rivers is mainly  polluted by the community rather than by factories, while that  of the Tha Chin River is the result equally of communities,  farms and industrial plants    The problem of the the Nam Pong is very easy to see, as the  river is static, and the department will therefore not allow  factories to dump any waste water there, he said.    Phoenix Pulp and Paper Co's mill is a model in that it does  not discharge treated waste water into the Nam Pong, but instead  uses it to water its eucalyptus tree plantation, he said.    ``With the strict measures applied to factories, I can  assure  you that river water will definitely not be polluted by  factories,'' Mr. Manat said.</p>

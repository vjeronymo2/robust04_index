			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Cut greeted with less of a fanfare than anticipated AFTER all the waiting, Germany's interest rate cut yesterday was greeted with less of a fanfare in the country's government bond market than might have been expected from confirmation that the peak of the interest rate cycle has been passed. The Bundesbank's actions yesterday at least killed off fears that rates would be forced up this autumn. But any further cuts are widely expected to be long in coming. Yesterday's announcement of a 9.2 per rate at this week's repurchase agreement (or repo) tender left few observers seeing much room for money market rates to fall below 9 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Klaus Baader, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, summed up the mood. 'They've brought forward a rate cut. But the scenario hasn't fundamentally changed.' With the main monetary indicator, M3, still well outside the Bundesbank's target range, and with inflation still to be brought fully under control, the German monetary authorities are not expected to abandon their recent policy stance. The repo rate, which has been bumping up against the key Lombard rate in recent months as the Bundesbank has applied the monetary squeeze, will fall to 30 basis points below the Lombard rate at this week's repo tender, the authorities said. That was less than the market had hoped for. From now on the repo rate will become a more important indicator, as the rate moves in a range between the Lombard and discount rates, said Ms Alison Cottrell, of Midland Montagu in London. The signs that the Bundesbank intends to retain a stringent stance helped to offset some of the loss of face it suffered in the markets over the hasty rate cut. Typical of the comments was one from a bond trader in London, who said: 'We're not used to having a German interest rate cut announced by the Italian prime minister. It's very worrying.' However, yesterday's revelation that the German authorities had spent DM26bn last week alone in intervening in the currency markets - way ahead of market estimates - helped the rate cut to be passed off as a reaction to extreme upheaval in financial markets, rather than a response to political pressure. Yesterday's announcement furthered the flattening of the German yield curve, which had already begun to lose some of its sharp inversion in response to clear signs of economic easing. The yield between five and ten-year bonds fell to around 35 basis points, from 45 basis points at the end of last week, partly in response to a move by German investors into longer-dated bonds. International investors, meanwhile, were reported to have moved heavily into medium-maturity bonds yesterday. The rally, however, is expected to be restrained. With the Treuhand privatisation agency to launch bonds for the first time this week, and further hefty issuance due from the federal government, the longer end of the market faces faces considerable supply.</p>

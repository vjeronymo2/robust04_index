			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok on Friday said the government would make multi-pronged  efforts to elevate workers' interests, but warned that it would  not tolerate unlawful strikes under any circumstances.    In a statement issued on the railroad and subway workers'  strikes, Yi said his government would not compromise with  unlawfulness and sternly deal with the incident if only for the  civilian-led government to fulfill its duty to promote  democratization.    The statement was made soon after he presided over an  emergency ministers meeting at the Sejong-ro government building.    The prime minister said in the statement that the railroad  workers' strike was illegal since, he said, it was staged by  those who are public officials in status and who, therefore,  have no right to collective actions.    Saying that split and confrontation within the country serve  no national interests, Yi said the government would sincerely  try to improve working conditions if striking workers regain  reason and return to normal work.</p>

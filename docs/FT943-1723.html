			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds take lead in S Africa Gold shares took the lead for the second consecutive session encouraged by the bullion price. But some industrials retreated on some big sell orders and generally negative sentiment. Brokers noted that gold shares were reluctant to move with the bullin price at Dollars 393/94 and there was some selling into strength, but investors began to pick up interest after midday when it went through Dollars 396.50. By the close of trade, bullion was easier around Dollars 394/5. September near-term futures still called the market substantially lower and there was continued nervousness on lack of clear direction from international markets. The overall index shed 18 to 5,782.

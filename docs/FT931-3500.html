			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Whitegate Leisure in the black IMPROVED trading, lower interest rates and the disposal of its loss-making French businesses enabled Whitegate Leisure to return to the black in the six months to February 28. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 682,000 for the period compared with losses of Pounds 1.51m last time and a Pounds 3.03m deficit for the 8 months ended August 31 1992. Whitegate's core business - mass market leisure in the Midlands and the north of England - performed better, but turnover was still suffering as a result of low levels of general economic activity. UK leisure profits rose to Pounds 3.37m (Pounds 2.3m) on turnover of Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 8.7m). The USM-quoted company said it continued to offer its healthcare businesses for sale and considerable interest was being shown. These operations turned in profits of Pounds 103,000 (Pounds 3,000 losses). Last year's group losses were after an exceptional charge of Pounds 784,000 for restructuring costs and write down of assets. Interest took Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.98m) and earnings per share were 2.4p (5.6p losses).</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Mercedes contract for Lucas LUCAS Industries, the UK motor components and aerospace group, has won its first ever contract to supply diesel fuel injection systems to Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car maker. The contract, described only as of 'substantial' value by Lucas executives yesterday, marks a new stage in the UK group's relations with Mercedes. Lucas has supplied other components to the German concern, but this is the first time it has worked in a long-term partnership with Mercedes jointly to develop new technology. Engineers from Lucas' Diesel Systems subsidiary have been working with Mercedes counterparts for five years to develop the electronically-controlled system, called EPIC, which is being introduced on Mercedes' advanced, multi-valve OM 604 diesel engine fitted to its new C220 car range. Analysts estimate that the business initially should be worth about Pounds 15m a year to Lucas. This is based on diesel versions being expected to account for some 20 per cent of the new C class cars' hoped-for 250,000 annual sales, and a likely value of approximately Pounds 300 for the Lucas units. However, analysts also believe that the eventual value of the business should be much larger, as the system is adopted for other Mercedes diesel models and by other manufacturers. Lucas acknowledged yesterday that it is talking to 'several other' car makers about supplies of the new injection system. Lucas claims currently to have 32 per cent of the existing European market for diesel fuel systems. It said the new system is the first to be designed specifically for electronic control.</p>

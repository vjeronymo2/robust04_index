			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wei Ping [7614 5493] </F>   [Summary] Recently the Institute of Epidemiology of the  Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) conducted a study  entitled "Diseases Monitor Methodology and Chinese People's  Health Situation," which provides reference information for  mapping out China's near- and long-term health plan. Since  1989, in five years CAPM established a national diseases monitor  network including 145 monitoring stations in 30 provinces,  municipalities directly under the Central Government and  autonomous regions. The purpose of monitoring stations is to  study people's health situation in China. The stations' major  findings are: China's overall birthrate, mortality rate and  infant deathrate are basically unchanged or somewhat decreased.  However, rate of decrease is different from region to region.  For example, overall birthrate and infant mortality rate in the  rural areas are twice those of the cities. In poor rural areas,  epidemic disease incidences of digestive system account for 50  percent of the category A and category B infectious diseases.  Death rate of adult tuberculosis in poor rural areas ranks  highest in the world.    The four major causes of death in China are  cardiocerebrovescular diseases, malignant tumors, respiratory  diseases and accidents. Bronchial tumor, which increases at the  annual rate of 4.5 percent in the nation and 10 percent in rural  areas, is the major killing tumor of Chinese people. Accidents,  especially traffic accidents, are increasing at a rate of 10  percent each year in China.</p>

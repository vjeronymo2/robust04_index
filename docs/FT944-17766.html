			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Spain opens way for foreign stakes in Telefonica unit Mr Jose Borrell, Spain's transport and telecommunications minister, said yesterday there were no obstacles to foreign companies taking equity stakes in Telefonica's profitable international subsidiary. He also indicated the government might sell some of its equity to allow the entry of new partners. However, the subsidiary, Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), believes it would be preferable for the unit to issue equity in order to finance its continued expansion in Latin America, where it is the dominant foreign operator. Tisa said it was in discussions with GTE, a US operator which has obtained licences in Latin America, and that the two companies were conducting the due diligence of their respective businesses in the continent. An agreement with GTE to develop jointly the fast growing Latin America market could be 'weeks or months away', Tisa said, though it added that 'ideally there should be an agreement before the end of the year'. The negotiations have been slowed by the varying forms of equity holdings, management agreements and consortium arrangements that the two companies have in Latin America. 'We are looking for the complementary nature of the businesses and there are a lot of complexities to iron out,' the group said. Tisa is also conducting a review of its Latin American operations with a view to gaining economies of scale and access to information superhighway technology. It is trying to shape its different units, which include basic telephony, cellular, cable-TV, data-transmission and yellow page licences, into a more cohesive corporate mould. Tisa, which has stakes in 20 Latin American companies and has a market capitalisation of between Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn, raised its first-half profits this year by 80 per cent to Dollars 88.9m. It is investing about Dollars 600m a year in Latin America and it is preparing to bid for telecommunications privatisations in Bolivia and Nicaragua. Mr Borrell said 'there was no problem' over an alliance between Tisa and a foreign operator, and that a sale of government equity was a possibility. The Spanish government's portfolio holds a 23.8 per cent stake in Tisa. Telefonica, which is 32 per cent owned by the government portfolio, owns the rest of Tisa equity. Tisa is discussing partnership alliances with AT&amp;T, the US long-distance operator, but it said these were at a more preliminary stage.</p>

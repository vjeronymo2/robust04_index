			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM DUELS ERUPT IN BEIRUT  </P> <P> Christian and Muslim militias battled in fiery duels across Beirut on Saturday,  killing two civilians and forcing police to close the only gateway linking the  divided city. It was the first serious flare-up in three months.  </P> <P> The clashes coincided with the arrival of President Elias Hrawi in Muslim West  Beirut, where he set up his office and residence and received credentials of  the Vatican representative, Pablo Puente.  </P> <P> The action marked the Vatican's recognition of Hrawi's government and further  isolated the Christian army leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, in his rejection of  the government.  </P> <P> Aoun's supporters, at his request, staged a "human chain of demonstrations"  along the 25-mile route from Aoun's residence to Puente's home to protest the  Vatican's move.  </P> <P> Other protesters went to Puente's home to deliver a message of protest from  Aoun.  </P> <P> Thunderous shell blasts and bursts of gunfire echoed across the Muslim and  Christian sectors as soldiers of Aoun's army battled with Syrian-backed Muslim  militiamen. Both sides accused the other of shooting first.  </P> <P> A police spokesman said the clash was "the gravest violation" of a cease-fire  called by the Arab League on Sept. 22 to halt six months of fighting between  Aoun's troops and Syrian forces. Until Saturday, there had been only minor  clashes.  </P> <P> An artillery shell crashed into the Christian side of Beirut and killed two  civilian men, police said. Two other people were wounded in exchanges that  engulfed nearby districts.  </P> <P> The fighting broke out in the morning, eased at noon and picked up again in the  afternoon, forcing police and army units to close the mid-city Museum Crossing,  the only gateway linking Muslim West Beirut and Christian East Beirut.  </P> <P> The latest deaths brought to 931 the number of people killed in  Christian-Muslim duels since Aoun in March declared his intention of driving  Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon.  </P> <P> Aoun rejects Hrawi's presidency because it came about as a result of an Arab  League plan aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war but not setting a  deadline for the withdrawal of the Syrians.  </P> <P> All foreign countries with diplomatic missions in Lebanon have recognized  Hrawi's "national reconciliation" government, which was formed in November to  oversee implementation of the plan.  </P> <P> Puente said during the Vatican credentials ceremony that the Holy See favors  dialogue to resolve the crisis between Hrawi and Aoun.  </P> <P> But a stung Aoun later emerged from his residence outside Beirut and told  cheering demonstrators that "there is no room for dialogue."  </P> <P> He drew wild applause when he vowed to bring to justice Hrawi and all  Parliament members who approved the peace accord.  </P> <P> Hrawi, who like Aoun is a Maronite Catholic, fired Aoun as army commander and  interim prime minister in November.  </P> <P> Hrawi and his wife, Mona, arrived in West Beirut in a 10-car convoy escorted by  Lebanese army and police units.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, fighting raged in southern Lebanon between militiamen of the  pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal. No new casualties were  reported.  </P></p>

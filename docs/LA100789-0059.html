			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CSUN AGAIN TO GIVE GRADE CASE EVIDENCE  </P> <P> The state Personnel Board has granted Cal State Northridge officials a second  chance to present evidence against a Pan-African studies professor who was  fired last year and then reinstated after a judge found him innocent of charges  that he sold grades.  </P> <P> The state board in June ordered Cal State Northridge officials to give Eleazu  Obinna back his job based on recommendations by an administrative law judge.  The judge, after hearing seven days of testimony, ruled that there was not  enough evidence to support university allegations that, in the 1988 spring  semester, Obinna offered his students A grades for selling $100 worth of raffle  tickets to benefit a foundation he headed.  </P> <P> Obinna, a 17-year tenured professor at the university, was instead suspended  for 90 days for unprofessional conduct for "selling tickets in connection with  a class." Obinna had said in testimony that he never offered students grades in  exchange for selling raffle tickets, but that students volunteered for the  sales.  </P> <P> At a meeting this week, the board granted a request by Cal State Northridge  attorneys that the judge in the case reconsider some of the testimony presented  during hearings held in November and February, said Duane Morford, chief of  policy for the state Personnel Board.  </P> <P> No date has been scheduled to rehear the case, Morford said.  </P> <P> Obinna could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

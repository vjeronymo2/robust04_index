			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Italy to raise Y300bn in new year The Republic of Italy plans to raise Y300bn in the international bond market early in the new year. The mandate for the widely-expected offering has been awarded jointly to Daiwa and J. P. Morgan. Yesterday's announcement coincided with the Japanese finance ministry's decision to abolish the 'lock-up' period for Euroyen bonds issued by sovereign borrowers from January 1. The lifting of this selling restriction will facilitate the distribution of Eurobonds to investors in Japan. Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of the Italian treasury's international borrowing programme, said the timing of the Euroyen offering stemmed from the virtual completion of the 1994 budget process in the Italian parliament and the strength of the yen and the Japanese bond market. Italy has raised about Dollars 12.8bn this year, within the Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn range indicated 12 months ago as a target for 1993. Daiwa said Italy's deal was likely to be the largest-ever offering of yen securities outside the Japanese government bond market. No further details were available yesterday but there was a view in the market that Italy was looking for a maturity of more than five years. Elsewhere, Woody Gundy pulled two more Canadian dollar offerings out of the hat which allowed it to overtake ScotiaMcLeod in the Canadian dollar league table. Bayerische Landesbank raised Dollars 250m through an offering of Eurobonds with a maturity of just under six years. One aim of the deal was to re-finance a CDollars 75m five-year Eurobond offering which matured on Monday. Part of the proceeds of yesterday's deal was swapped into floating rate dollars. The bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points over Canadian treasuries and when they were freed to trade the spread remained intact. Wood Gundy said the borrower took a good portion of the bonds to meet demand from its retail clients. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has raised its implied rating of Chile's long-term foreign currency debt to triple B plus from triple B.</p>

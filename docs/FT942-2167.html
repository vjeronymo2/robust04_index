			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Retail planning test case to open A test-case public inquiry likely to affect out-of-town shopping centres begins today. The Church Commissioners, who own the MetroCentre, Europe's largest out-of-town retail and leisure development, have disagreed with Gateshead borough council over whether the complex, with 350 retail units, should be treated as one unit or 350 for planning purposes. The local authority argues that any change of use of individual units in the centre and any change of shop front require its permission. The Church Commissioners maintain that the MetroCentre is one building and that internal changes should not need consent. Local authorities are not consistent on planning policy. Some follow Gateshead's line while some require planning applications only for change of use, and some do not require any applications for internal changes. The MetroCentre disagreement has arisen since its Enterprise Zone status, which conferred a simplified planning regime, ended in 1991. Mr Chris Moore, for the Church Commissioners' managing agent, said: 'What we are trying to do is clarify the planning legislation.' The commissioners said the issue is one of principle: 'It is administratively inconvenient for us and for the tenants. We also want to reaffirm our ability to control the centre.' But Mr Jerry Barford, Gateshead's director of planning, said the council wished only to exercise its statutory responsibilities. The commissioners, he said, seemed puzzled that the council sought to exercise planning control. Mr Peter Gates, chairman of the centre's tenants' association, said retailers were concerned at any measures which might increase costs.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Woolworth shares fall as chiefs step down Shares in Woolworth, the US retailer, tumbled by more than 5 per cent yesterday in New York following an announcement at the weekend that the company's chairman and chief financial officer had stepped aside pending an investigation of accounting irregularities. Mr William Lavin, chairman and chief executive, and Charles Young, chief financial officer, have denied wrongdoing. According to Woolworth they have told the company they have relinquished their positions temporarily so that the company's business will not be disrupted during the investigation. The confidence of suppliers was shaken last week as the company announced it was looking into allegations surrounding its reported gross margins. The news threatened to disrupt the company's normal trading as suppliers reassessed their relationships with the retailer. The shares closed down Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 12 7/8 in New York yesterday.</p>

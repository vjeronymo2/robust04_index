			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Mowat Mowat, the USM-quoted property and leisure group, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.97m for the 15 months to end-September and also revealed that it was holding talks regarding the sale of its housebuilding division. The loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 651,000 for the 12 months to June 30 1990, was struck after taking account of a Pounds 5.7m rise in administration expenses to Pounds 8.71m and interest charges which more than doubled to Pounds 11.5m. Turnover expanded from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 48.8m and operating profits by Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 9.5m. Leisure activities contributed Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 4.16m) to turnover and Pounds 4m (Pounds 2m) to operating profits. Mr Brian Dunlop, chairman, said the 'relative performances of the group's main operating divisions have highlighted the strength of the holiday division'. As a result, it has decided to concentrate all group resources in the holiday division and initiate a phased withdrawal from property development and housebuilding.</p>

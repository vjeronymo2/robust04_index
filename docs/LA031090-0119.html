			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL OKS PANEL TO OVERSEE FIRM'S LIQUIDATION  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. won a battle Friday that allows a panel of  its outside directors to monitor the winding down of the company instead of  turning its books over to a court-appointed investigator.  </P> <P> Drexel and First City Bancorp, the head of its creditors committee, told the  bankruptcy court that they had reached an agreement in which a committee of  three of Drexel's outside directors would oversee the liquidation process.  </P> <P> However, the accord also provides for a subcommittee of four creditors who will  be told of transactions before they occur.  </P> <P> Although the creditors cannot demand that Drexel stop a sale, they can ask for  a delay. If no agreement can be reached, the creditors can appeal to the  bankruptcy judge.  </P> <P> In addition to overseeing the liquidation process, the oversight committee of  Drexel directors has the authority to investigate compensation of more than  $100,000 to anyone who had been an officer or director of Drexel or its  subsidiaries since Jan. 1, 1989.  </P> <P> Creditors and government regulators have been concerned about Drexel's payment  of some $270 million worth of bonuses several weeks before it filed for  bankruptcy. The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently investigating  the payments.  </P> <P> Drexel filed for bankruptcy Feb. 13 but its subsidiaries are not included in  the filing. Therefore, they are being liquidated without court supervision.  </P></p>

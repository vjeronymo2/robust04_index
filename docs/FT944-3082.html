			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Animal haulage laws reformed Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, introduced fresh legislation yesterday to improve the welfare of live animals in transit to the Continent following the failure of European Union ministers to agree controls on the trade. The national measures, which come into force on January 23, make it a criminal offence to breach journey plans that must accompany animals on trips longer than 15 hours. 'We cannot do nothing because Europe cannot agree. That's why we are now pressing ahead with our own measures to fill the gap,' Mr Waldegrave said, after ministers abandoned plans on Tuesday to agree rules which could be enforced throughout the EU. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said yesterday that the legislation did little to remove its opposition to the cross-Channel trade. 'It still leaves millions of animals with long journey times,' it said. The RSPCA wants the EU to introduce a maximum journey time of eight hours, but Mr Waldegrave's new legislation states only that animals should be fed and watered after 15 hours. The RSPCA's opposition to the transport of live animals has convinced Britain's ferry companies to ban the carriage of livestock for slaughter. The ferry companies said yesterday that they were still studying the legislation, but had so far found little in it to change their minds. 'The issue is about what happens to animals on the . . . Continent and whether this can be enforced over there,' said an official at P&amp;O. Mr Waldegrave said he had agreements from the French, Dutch and Spanish authorities to provide information towards the prosecution of offenders. But the RSPCA believes it would be impossible to enforce the measures on the Continent. The new rules mean animal hauliers could be jailed or fined up to Pounds 5,000 if they break journey plans for trips of more than 15 hours.</p>

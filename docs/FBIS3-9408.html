The Ministry also shed light on some cases in which  the investigation against Defense Ministry employees came to a  halt precisely because of the blockade by the Defense Ministry.  Gojko Bervar reports:    [Begin recording] [Bervar] Minister Bizjak, Mitja Klavora,  the head of the Criminal Police, and State Secretary Borut Likar  first armed themselves with a tape of the first contact between  the Defense Ministry and the operational communication center of  the interior minister in the Smolnikar case. From the tape, one  really cannot conclude that it implies rejection. On the  contrary, the Ministry of Internal Affairs constantly tried to  convince the representatives of the Defense Ministry to take  Smolnikar to a police station in Domzale. However, further  discussion proved that, at the time of the contact, the members  of VOMO [Defense Ministry Security Organ] already had Smolnikar  in Kardeljeva Street in Ljubljana [VOMO headquarters] and that  they were calling the police, I quote, to avoid a fuss. [no  reference to close of quotation as heard]    Mr. Gasper, as a representative of the Defense Ministry  identified himself, even said:    [Gasper] The thing is that we should have questioned him a  little more.    [Bervar] At the news conference Minister Bizjak said that  this was not the first case in connection with Defense Ministry  employees. In all these cases, ranging from the suspicion of  arms trafficking, some [word indistinct] thefts, suspected  embezzlement in Orbis enterprise [manufacturing submachine guns]  and even in the well-known cases of the public letter by the  Civilian Initiative and the explosives placed under the car of  Member of Parliament Jelincic -- in all these cases the  investigation came to a halt because of the lack of  cooperativeness and, in some cases, the prevention of further  investigation on the part of the Defense Ministry.    The Interior Ministry first warned the prime minister about  all this at the end of last year. They also drafted a special  report that, in its conclusion, points at (?ambiguities) in the  legislation; however, a meeting that would clarifying everything  did not materialize, also because the acting VOMO director  assured Mitja Klavora that he does not have any such  instructions from the defense minister.    Ivo Bizjak also dismissed the possibility that any sort of  subversive organization would be active within the Ministry and  said that there is not the slightest proof for this. Milan  Smolnikar is not an employee of the Interior Ministry and all  hitherto investigations by the police were within the boundaries  of legal procedures, they said at the news conference.    However, they have established the activity of a group of  people within the Defense Ministry, consisting of various  organizational units of this Ministry, which, besides illegally  prescribed tasks on the field, also engages in special tasks  that are not the responsibility of this Ministry, some of them  precisely in Ljubljana.

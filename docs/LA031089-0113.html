			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DAVISON'S CLUTCH HITS PUT REDONDO IN TOURNEY FINAL  </P> <P> Redondo High infielder Brian Davison was a two-time hero Thursday, delivering  key hits to propel the Sea Hawks to a 5-4 victory over Burbank Bell-Jeff in a  semifinal game of the Crossroads/Westside baseball tournament.  </P> <P> Davison delivered a one-out, bases-loaded triple in the top of the seventh to  bring the Sea Hawks back from a 4-1 deficit to tie the game.  </P> <P> He was not through. Two innings later, Davison again singled, scoring Ron  Brooks from second base with the winning run.  </P> <P> Redondo, 3-1, advances to the final of the 32-team tournament Saturday against  the winner of the Channel Islands-Venice game.  </P> <P> "When you put a winner in there like Davison, (and) when you have a chance to  win a game, this is what happens," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. Davison  was 4 for 5 at the plate with 4 RBIs.  </P> <P> The Sea Hawks got a stellar pitching performance from sophomore right-hander  Mike Houck, who now has a 2-0 record.  </P> <P> In his second outing this season, Houck was at his best in the three middle  innings, where he faced the minimum of nine batters and threw just 18 pitches.  </P> <P> Davison's late-inning heroics would have been unnecessary but for two  disastrous innings in which the Sea Hawk infield committed four errors. Houck  surrendered just one earned run, but trailed 4-0 after the third inning.  </P> <P> "We came out like we had been riding in a bus for an hour and a half,"  Ammentorp said of his team's early play.  </P> <P> "We weren't ready to play when we got here."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Davison woke up.  </P> <P> "I was in a slump at the start of the season, but I pulled myself out of it  today," he said. "I got all the pitches I wanted today."  </P></p>

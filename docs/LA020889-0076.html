			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Narcotics police have launched a major drug offensive in Colombia that has  become the most successful crackdown on the nation's drug lords in five years,  a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said in Bogota. The official,  who asked not to be identified, said police have destroyed 2,600 pounds of  cocaine in northwestern Antioquia province, compared with about 22,000 pounds  destroyed in a major 1984 operation in southeastern Caqueta province, police  said. Nevertheless, the official said, the new drive will have little impact on  the price or availability of cocaine on U.S. streets.  </P></p>

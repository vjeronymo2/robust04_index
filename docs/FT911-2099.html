			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Cerus sells Groupe Expansion stake CERUS, the troubled French holding group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, yesterday announced the sale of a 7.44 per cent stake in Groupe Expansion, theeconomic and financial newspaper group, to Mr Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere, a leading French businessman with publishing interests, writes William Dawkins in Paris.  Mr Ladreit de Lacharriere earlier this month retired from L'Oreal, the French cosmetics multinational, where he was deputy managing director and chief financial director, to devote more time to his family's publishing company, which includes Editions Masson. The purchase, at an undisclosed price, lifts Mr Ladreit de Lacharriere's stake in Groupe Expansion to 12.14 per cent. He will join the board. Cerus has now sold all but the core of its French portfolio over the past year.</p>

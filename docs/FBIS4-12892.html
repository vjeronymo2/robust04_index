			<p>BFN     [Text] On the eve of the 20 April visit to the United  States by His Royal Highness Prince Hasan, AL-BILAD has learned  from reliable sources in Washington that the U.S. Administration  is taking Jordanian threats to boycott the talks seriously.  AL-BILAD has learned that the United States will agree, during  their meeting with Prince Hasan, to the inspection of  al-'Aqabah-bound ships inside the port by Lloyds, not the U.S.  Navy. AL-BILAD has also learned that the resumption of the  [Arab-Israeli] talks and the expansion of participation in the  multilateral talks will be raised by the United States during  the talks.    Meanwhile, Jordanian officials say that holding the talks  the  way the Israelis want is rejected by the Jordanians, because  this is intended to bypass the agenda in order to postpone  priority issues. Furthermore, the Israeli request to sign a  peace treaty with Jordan before discussing substantial issues,  such as borders, refugees, and water, is considered impossible  by the Jordanian leadership. This, consequently, will not make  Prince Hasan's U.S. visit at all easy.</p>

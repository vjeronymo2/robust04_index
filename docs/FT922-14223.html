			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Daimler-Benz to be ordered to pay extra for Berlin site BRUSSELS will shortly call on Berlin to demand a substantial additional payment from Daimler-Benz for the prime-site property the company bought from the city two years ago, a senior official said yesterday, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. An investigation was launched by the EC to determine whether Daimler-Benz and Sony had received illegal subsidies from the city to buy real estate for offices on Potsdamer Platz. The square was the heart of pre-war Berlin and was bisected by the Wall. The Commission told the Bonn government that Daimler-Benz would be asked to pay nearly DM34m (Pounds 12m) in addition to the DM93m it originally paid. Berlin sharply criticised the decision as likely to deter investors but said it expected Daimler-Benz to pay.</p>

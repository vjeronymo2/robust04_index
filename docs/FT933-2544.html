			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Austrian oil group announces shake-up OMV, the troubled Austrian integrated oil and petrochemicals group, has embarked on a Sch3.7bn (Dollars 331m) restructuring programme to bring it back into profit next year. The partially-privatised group revealed last Friday that it would suffer a Sch1bn operating loss and pass its dividend this year, as slumping prices in European markets undermined its refining and petrochemical product margins. It had earlier forecast a modest profit for the year. Mr Richard Schenz, the chief executive, said yesterday that the group would cut 40 per cent of its ammonia fertiliser capacity and would withdraw its geotextiles subsidiary from the US market. These and other restructuring measures would entail the loss of at least 1,500 jobs, nearly 12 per cent of its workforce, over the next two and a half years. The group's latest reverses have shaken both its own supervisory board and the Vienna Borse, although public threats by Mr Oskar Grunwald, the supervisory board chairman, to sack the personnel director and strip Mr Schenz of some responsibilities have not been carried out. Mr Schenz said he was still hopeful that the first step in the group's full privatisation plans, the sale of a 20 per cent stake to a strategic partner, could be fixed before year-end. He admitted he was wrong to make a profit forecast in April, but said he could not be blamed for the sudden deterioration in trading conditions in the second quarter. The group suffered its largest loss - Sch417m - in the second quarter, more than treble the loss in the first quarter. It was then that the managing board decided it had to take radical steps rather than hope that an economic recovery would enable it to restructure more gradually. Mr Schenz said he was not going to resign, and that the question was not discussed at Wednesday's supervisory board meeting.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sweb lifts pay-out by 17.5% - Distributor backs calls for demerger of the National Grid South Western Electricity, the Bristol-based distributor, yesterday threw its support behind a demerger of the National Grid from the regional electricity companies that own it. The company also reported a 17.5 per cent increase in dividend payments, one of the highest in the current power reporting season which ends today. Mr John Seed, chief executive, said he thought most of the recs would support a National Grid demerger after a review of its future later this year. Options include selling a part of the company and keeping the cash. But Mr Seed said his company favoured a full demerger of the Grid, to be achieved by handing over shares in the new company to the recs' existing shareholders on a pro rata basis. Swalec has adopted a similar stance on the Grid. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 were 15.5 per cent ahead at Pounds 116.8m (Pounds 101.1m), achieved on turnover of Pounds 899.6m (Pounds 892m). A proposed final dividend of 16.5p gives a total for the year of 23.5p (20p) covered 3.2 times by earnings of 75.4p (63.1p) per share. Mr Seed said the dividend increase could not be interpreted as a signal for a favourable outcome of the distribution review. 'The dividend rise is based on our performance during 1993-94 and our desire to maintain the dividend cover at 3.2.' Mr John Sellers, finance director, said the company would also want to review its balance sheet following the distribution review. It would be comfortable with gearing levels of up to 40 per cent. Sweb had net cash of Pounds 43.5m at the year end, against borrowings of Pounds 105.7m last time. Excluding the effect of VAT receipts, gearing would have been 3 per cent. The performance was helped by a higher than average 2.2 per cent growth in units distributed, weather-corrected. COMMENT Here are yet another set of impressive results from a rec, which if anything, understate the underlying growth. After adding in the effects of Pounds 27m for provisions and subtracting money taken from customers relating to previous years and pension provisions, the total could have been about Pounds 10m higher. Assuming a 14 per cent dividend rise this year, the shares, up 14p to 615p yesterday, are trading on a prospective yield of about 5.5 per cent. That is fair for a company which has performed well but faces a tougher time than most because it must convince the regulator that its high cost base is fully justified by the expense of servicing a sprawling rural area. But at the end of a week in which rec share prices have risen strongly, investors in all 14 companies affected by the distribution review should stop and consider. While it is almost certain that the review will be less tough than the worst fears, there is as yet very little hard information to work on. The market is working on hunches, not knowledge.</p>

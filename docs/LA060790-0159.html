			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IT'S A FIRST: REDS ARE SWEPT BY THE GIANTS  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants appear to be swinging back into the form that made  them National League champions last season.  </P> <P> The Giants became the first team to sweep a series against the Cincinnati Reds  when Kevin Mitchell hit a home run off Rob Dibble with two out in the 11th  inning Wednesday at San Francisco to give them a 3-2 victory.  </P> <P> The Giants extended their winning streak to six games by sweeping the  three-game series from the Reds, whose 33-15 record is the best in the majors.  </P> <P> "I just took a step back and tried to see the ball better coming out of his  hand," said Mitchell, who has 15 homers. "He threw me two sliders away and I  knew he didn't want to get behind on me. I thought I'd see a fastball and I hit  it pretty good. I was lucky to get ahold of it."  </P> <P> Will Clark's 10th homer, a solo shot in the ninth off Randy Myers, tied the  score, 2-2. Mitchell's homer off Rob Dibble (3-1) marked the first time in 29  games that the Reds lost when leading after eight innings.  </P> <P> The Reds, who have an 11-game lead over the fourth-place Giants in the West,  took a 2-0 lead in the first on Paul O'Neill's seventh home run.  </P> <P> Don Robinson, making his third start since coming off the disabled list on May  24, held the Reds to eight hits in eight innings. Jeff Brantley (2-1) earned  the victory, retiring Ron Oester on a grounder with runners on first and second  to end the Reds' 11th.  </P> <P> Danny Jackson limited the Giants to one run and four hits in 7 1/3 innings, his  longest outing of the season.  </P> <P> San Diego 3, Houston 2 -- Garry Templeton capped a three-run ninth inning with  a two-out single at San Diego as the Padres handed the Astros' their sixth  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Joe Carter's ninth homer, a two-run shot off Mark Portugal (1-6), tied the  game, 2-2.  </P> <P> Benito Santiago then singled and Dan Schatzeder walked Mike Pagliarulo. The  runners executed a double steal as Larry Andersen struck out pinch-hitter Jack  Clark, setting the stage for Templeton's game-winning hit.  </P> <P> Glenn Davis supplied all of Astro runs with his 17th homer, his seventh in six  games.  </P> <P> Craig Lefferts (3-1) pitched the ninth inning to earn the victory.  </P> <P> Minnesota 15, Toronto 5 -- Kirby Puckett went 5 for 5 for the second time this  season and the Twins equalled a season-high with 19 hits at Toronto.  </P> <P> Puckett, who is batting .342, had a double, four singles and also scored three  runs.  </P> <P> "I'm just trying to go up the middle," said Puckett, whose other five-hit game  came May 14 against Oakland. "That's my game plan all season. If I get 600  at-bats, I'm trying to go up the middle in every one."  </P> <P> Fred Manrique had a double and three singles and drove in three runs for the  Twins. Greg Gagne had three hits, including a two-run homer.  </P> <P> The Twins, who lead the league in hitting, also had 19 hits on April 24 against  Detroit and on May 25 against Boston.  </P> <P> John Candelaria (7-1) pitched three innings in relief to earn the victory.  </P> <P> Kelly Gruber hit his 15th homer for the Blue Jays.  </P></p>

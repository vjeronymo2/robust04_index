			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- House of Representatives  Speaker Takako Doi on Friday [3 June] proposed upgrading the  lower house council on political ethics to a standing committee  as part of a personal Diet reform plan.    Doi urged the lower house's Steering Committee Chairman  Keiwa  Okuda to draw up a concrete plan based on a personal plan that  she has put together through study meetings she has held since  she assumed the Diet post in August 1993.    It is very unusual for lower house speakers to refer to the  steering committee their own ideas for reforming the Diet.    In her personal scheme, Doi advocates promoting the Ethics  Council to become a new standing committee on "political ethics"  by which the Diet can promptly deal with scandals involving  politicians and clarify structural cause of corruption.    To effectively deal with scandals, the new committee should  be entitled to summon people to a session to testify under oath,  according to her plan.    In Doi's plan the press would be allowed to take pictures of  witnesses testifying before the Diet.    At present, the Diet prohibits the press from taking any  pictures while testimony is under way to protect the rights of  witnesses.    Also, Doi recommends setting up a new Diet Information  Center  to provide easy public access to the minutes of both plenary and  committee sessions.    In the future, Doi said, the Information Center should  establish a data base that can provide people with past remarks  by government officials in the Diet on various subjects.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Imports are coming into the country at a slower  rate, but foreign buying is still at a high level.    Between January and August, imports totaled $6.435 billion,  an increase of 55.7 percent over the same period of the previous  year.    According to the director of the National Administrative  Department of Statistics (DANE), Rodolfo Uribe, this growth rate  means that external purchases are stabilizing, especially  considering that in the first half of the year, the increase was  77.9 percent.    In the first eight months of the year, Colombia's exports  totaled $4.662 billion, 2.5 percent higher than the figure for  the same period in 1992.    This means that imports were $1.773 billion higher than  exports, resulting in a deficit in the balance of trade.    Last year, the shortfall was just $414 million. In other  words, in a year, the trade deficit (spending on imports  exceeding earnings from exports) quadrupled.    The trade gap can be explained by the increase in domestic  demand for foreign goods, the recession in developed countries,  the decline in international prices for Colombia's main exports,  and the coffee crisis.    If the government's predictions hold true, by the end of  1993  the trade deficit should fall to $1.297 billion.    In other words, the country will have to curb the rate of  imports even further and add more dynamism to exports.    The government expects external sales to rise by 5.6 percent  by the end of the year, while imports are slated to grow by  "only" 48.5 percent.  <H5>  By Sector </H5>   When imports are broken down by sector, it can be seen that  the greatest increase is in capital goods and construction  materials.    Foreign purchases in this sector totaled $2.508 billion, a  jump of 91.20 percent over the figure for the first eight months  of 1992.    The greatest dynamism can be seen in construction materials,  with a growth of 110 percent. Capital goods for industry rose 53  percent, to a total of $1.452 billion.    Colombians bought foreign consumer goods amounting to $1.125  billion, an increase of 70.69 percent over the previous period.    Colombia's main supplier continues to be the United States,  whence 34 percent of its imports came during the period in  question.    Purchases made in the United States were less dynamic,  however, than those made in Japan and Venezuela, Colombia's two  other major partners.    Whereas U.S. imports rose by 47.7 percent, imports from  Japan  and Venezuela doubled.    Customs revenues (from tariffs and the value-added tax)  doubled as of August, climbing from 441.406 billion pesos to  937.956 billion pesos.    The greater increase, 95 percent, was seen in value-added  tax  (IVA) collections.    The DANE explained that the import figures are subject to  change as a result of corrections or revisions in payments made  by the Directorate of National Taxes and Customs (DIAN).</p>

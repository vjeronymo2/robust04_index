According to  President Mobutu's personal adviser, (Muamba Tshisindi), the  head of state said: I am prepared to appoint Etienne Tshisekedi  as prime minister only if the political climate eases. The  adviser says the High Council of the Republic would then be  asked to continue the search for a consensus on a text based on  political compromise. Mr. (Tshisindi) said other  representatives from his country and he had been sent to present  this plan to several foreign countries. Mohamed Youssoufou  Saliou interviewed him in Paris yesterday.    [Begin recording] [(Tshisindi)] [Words indistinct] we would  have settled our differences which are now making it impossible  to organize free and fair elections.    [Saliou] As President Mobutu's adviser, do you think that  the  head of state is now ready to make all these concessions so that  the situation on the ground can improve, and so that Etienne  Tshisekedi becomes prime minister once again as intended by the  sovereign national conference?    [(Tshisindi)] [Words indistinct] it all depends on  Tshisekedi's political will. President Mobutu has already said  that he will appoint whoever is chosen as transitional prime  minister, including Tshisekedi. If Tshisekedi decides to  present his candidacy and is able to obtain a parliamentary  majority or consensus the head of state will appoint him prime  minister. [Words indistinct] where we go through an interim  government, if the differences are settled in the end, if the  conditions set for Tshisekedi on the formation of a national  union government are met, we will get back to the current  position which is [words indistinct] in that case too, the head  of state will appoint him prime minister.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is the full text of the speech by Prime  Minister Mokdad Sifi at today's inauguration ceremony of the  National Economic and Social Council.    [Begin Sifi recording] In the name of God, the  Compassionate,  the Merciful. Thank you Mr. President. Mr. President, chairman  of the Consultative Council, ladies and gentlemen ministers,  ladies and gentlemen. May God's peace, compassion, and  blessings be upon you.    I am honored and pleased to join you today at the  inauguration of the National Economic and Social Council  [al-majlis al-watani al-iqtisadi wa al-ijtima'i]    On this occasion I present to you, on behalf of the head of  state and the government, my warm congratulations for everyone's  choice and the trust put in you. I also express to the  organizations and institutions which appointed you my  satisfaction with the constructive spirit and broad view they  expressed during the consultations which brought them together  with the government on setting up this Council, which has a  special importance.    The installation of the National Economic and Social  Council,  which will be followed by the National Transitional Council, is  a symbol of the break with past practice, which we hope to  instill, and is proof of our eagerness to engage in open  consultation with all the participants in national life.    Ladies and gentlemen, the state, while opting for opening up  to its economic and social partners in order to create this  council, affirms its desire to ensure the actual participation  of all sections of society in order to take charge over the  future of our country.    I am convinced that this opening up of our state to society,  the choice of competence, and giving the necessary opportunities  to our youth, will be a starting point toward the better  management of our country's affairs. Thanks to your ideas and  the suggestions which you submit to the government, we will  continually consolidate and deepen the citizens' contribution to  preparing the social and economic decisions which concern them  and define their future. I hereby affirm the government's  eagerness for the development of this consultation so as to take  charge of coordinating the economic reforms which will be  witnessed by the country, and for the revival of national  development, which will benefit large sections of our people.  This was the concept stressed by the head of state recerntly  before the Council of ministers, and which is related to the  need to give necessary attention to promoting national  solidarity and social justice.    At the same time, great attention will be given to those  sectors financing the economy, such as the hydrocarbons sector  or those which comply with economic growth, and society's needs  such as agriculture, housing, and small and medium industries.  Our national development will remain characterized by social  justice and the state's contribution in parallel with the  reforms, which aim at improving efficiency and freeing creative  initiatives. Better than that, this development will be further  consolidated through extended consultation with all  representatives of society, and in this lies the final split  with the spirit of monopoly, whatever its nature.    In this respect, the composition of your council provides a  better framework to identify the real points of strength and  weaknesses of our country, and to collectively identify the best  ways and means which enable Algeria to fully utilize its actual  resources.    Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our country embarks on  profound reforms and the international arena, when we experience  fast and profound changes -- from which the economic,  technological, and scientific domains cannot escape, your  council represents a considerable achievement to promote the  interests of our country and people. Indeed, in parallel with  the revival of the national economy, Algeria has to open up  economically toward the outside world in order to occupy its  real status within the international exchange.    On the other hand, it is imperative for our country,  especially when youth constitutes the majority of its  population, and especially now, to be concerned with the future  perception of its development in order to ensure a respected  future for the rising generations through the promotion of  efforts and the exploitation of creative energies that are the  sources for good and prosperity.    Such ideas, which have now acquired a wide and permanent  framework through your council, underline to our people,  regardless of the passing difficulties, that the hope of  restoring its perpetual prosperity in a stable country, one  respected by other nations, is a legitimate hope. It is because  Algeria of the eternal November revolution still has plenty of  the necessary energies to face up to all challenges.    All of this underscores the significance and vastness of the  hopes pinned on this council, which will be concerned with  fundamental national issues. The nation is awaiting rich ideas  from you, ideas that will emanate from the diversity of your  specializations and qualifications, and the state is awaiting  from you reformist proposals.    I would like to stress, on behalf of the head of state, in  my  own name, and on behalf of the government, that we highly  appreciate your brave commitment to serve the nation at this  very time; the time when Algeria has to depend on its loyal  children, who will never leave or abandon it. Before this heavy  burden and great responsibility is laid on your shoulders, I  cannot but wish you every success and righteousness, and stress  to you my absolute support.    I have the honor to officially announce the installation of  the Social and Economic National Council. May God help us all  to accomplish everything that brings good, pride, and prosperity  to Algeria. Peace be upon you and God's compassion and  blessings. [end recording]</p>

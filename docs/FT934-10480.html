			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Standards board retreats on reforms THE BOARD of the British Standards Institution suffered a surprising and humiliating setback yesterday when it was forced to withdraw proposals for sweeping changes to its constitution. Strong resistance from BSI members at the organisation's annual meeting forced Lord Keith, the president, to defer for at least three months proposals to increase directors' fees and strengthen the board's powers. The institution, which is responsible for writing standards used by industry, said it needed three months of communication with its 29,000 members - companies and individuals who subscribe for its services - before it could put the proposals to them again. This setback comes at an embarrassing time for the organisation, which is the subject of a government review. The Department of Trade and Industry is looking at whether it should continue to receive a government subsidy. The institution attempted to put on a brave face, saying the problems had arisen because of misunderstandings by its members. But Mr Michael Sanderson, former chief executive and a critic of the changes, said the move represented a defeat for the board unprecedented in the organisation's 93-year history. The annual meeting is normally a quiet affair which attracts a handful of members and lasts only a few minutes. Yesterday it was attended by 46 voting members and lasted nearly two hours. It was marked by long wrangles over procedures and tough questioning of the board. The first proposal to run into difficulties involved setting new limits to fees which could be paid to directors. Lord Keith proposed doubling directors' fees to Pounds 15,000 a year and the chairman's fee to Pounds 50,000. Members then objected to a series of far-reaching changes in the organisation's charter and by-laws. These would have strengthened the board's powers and given it the right to make additional payments to directors for work done beyond the normal scope of their duties. 'There was quite a full discussion but it was very clear there were misunderstandings over what was being proposed,' said Mr Derek Prior, communications manager. None of the proposals were put to the vote - all were deferred pending the consultation exercise. Speaking before yesterday's meeting Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI chairman, said changes to the constitution were necessary for effective decision making and to bring its fee structure more closely into line with general market rates. As well as organising the writing of British standards, the institution provides testing facilities for industry. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.7m in the year ended March 1993.</p>

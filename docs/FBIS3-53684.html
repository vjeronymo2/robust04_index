The Vatican spokesman considered what has been achieved  during the bilateral meetings between the organization and the  Vatican as an important starting point that constitutes an  initial step toward officially promoting the relations.    The organization's delegation, led by brother Muhammad Zuhdi  al-Nashashibi, member of the PLO Executive Committee, Nimr  Hammad, Ibrahim al-Daqqaq, and Zuhdi al-Tarazi, had held talks  over two days at the Vatican with a high-ranking Vatican  delegation led by the Vatican's foreign minister [title as  received], Jean-Louis Tauran, and with the participation of the  deputy [foreign] minister and the head of the Middle East  Department.    The Vatican's official delegation said during the talks that  the Vatican's policy was firm and has not changed regarding the  Palestinian people's inalienable rights, the issue of Jerusalem,  and the Palestinian people's right to regain it, and the  Vatican's commitment to legal legitimacy on the basis of UN  Resolution 181, stipulating the partition [of Palestine] and the  establishment of two states [Palestine and Israel].    In another development, WAFA's [Palestinian news agency]  correspondent in Rome has learnt that the Palestinian-Vatican  joint committee will continue its meeting at a later time to  draw up all the details in connection with bilateral relations.</p>

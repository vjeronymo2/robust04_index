			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Paying more than a pony - Jane Fuller interrogates the banks about their high charges, and advises small firms to shop around Lloyds Bank's attempt to woo small companies as part of its proposed bid for Midland focused on start-up businesses and on access to funds at favourable rates. But for the bulk of existing small firms, the promises must have sounded a little hollow. One of their main concerns was not addressed: what about the cost of everyday transactions? A quarterly bill from a bank can add up to a considerable amount, much of it charged for paying money in rather than taking it out. Take the case of a riding school on the outskirts of London, turning over more than Pounds 100,000 a year. Customers are charged Pounds 13.50 for an hour's riding and often pay by cheque. For the first three months of the year, the charges made by a local branch of Barclays Bank amounted to Pounds 401.79. As this would be for a comparatively quiet winter quarter, the annual banking fee would be well over Pounds 1,200 - more than 1 per cent of turnover. This is before charging any interest on an overdraft. The bill was itemised following a query from the customer and a list of imminent tariff increases was also sent to her. The main points that raised her eyebrows were the amounts charged for paying in cheques and cash, fees for letters and other pieces of administration, and several price rises at rather more than the inflation rate. A breakdown of the charges shows that by far the largest item was Pounds 210.34 for paying in 809 cheques, at 26p per cheque. From next month the charge goes up to 29p, an increase of 11.5 per cent compared with the latest UK inflation figure of 4.3 per cent. The second largest item on the bill was Pounds 89 for 'management and overdraft administration fees', which were not explained. Two other key points in the tariff information were an increase from 65p to 70p for every Pounds 100 cash paid in and from 57p to 61p for debits, increases of 7 to 8 per cent. The business is responding to the main problem of cheque charges in three ways: Passing on a 30p charge to the customer writing a cheque for less than Pounds 50. A copy of the bank charges will be pinned to the notice board to show the reason. Offering blocks of lessons at a discount to reduce the number of cheques. By-passing the bank altogether. The 30p cheque charge will encourage more customers to pay cash, which will then be used to pay suppliers directly. The last line of action sounds like regressive behaviour. It raises issues of security and loss of business for the bank. To try to find out whether the charges were typical, the FT asked the four other high street banks for comparative figures. The answers showed some variations in the amounts charged, but to a small business all might seem expensive. However, each bank also said that fees were negotiable. 'If the customer is not happy, they should go to see their bank manager,' was a common response, although they would need to ask whether, and how much, they might be charged for the appointment. Taking cheques paid in, cash paid in and debits, the cheapest was Midland Bank, echoing the findings of Rochester Research's recent survey of bank branches in Kent, which ranked Barclays as the next cheapest followed by NatWest, with LLoyds as the most expensive. Midland's charges per cheque were 23p and 60p for a single credit comprising a number of cheques. Had the riding school qualified for Barclays small business tariffs, for which the cut-off is Pounds 100,000 turnover, a bundle of cheques could have been banked for 66p. At NatWest, which has a similar Pounds 100,000 limit for its small business service, the charge is 64p for every payment into or out of the account. Over this threshold, it said 'all charges are individually negotiated', taking into account the level of activity. One option was to negotiate charges as a percentage of turnover. The TSB Bank was close to Midland at 25p per cheque and 67p per multi-cheque credit, and only 1p behind Midland's 52p for debits. Lloyds was the most expensive at 75p per credit or debit entry. However, its 'small business' tariffs applied to companies with up to Pounds 1m turnover, and the 75p was a flat rate for any amount of cash, rather than per Pounds 100. Both these factors would help in the riding school's case. Midland also fared best in terms of modest increases. It raised its charges in March last year and has decided not to put them up again until March 1993. All the other banks either have raised charges by more than the inflation rate or plan to do so. The explanation Barclays offered for this was that it was 'a known fact' that service inflation was higher than 'normal' inflation. Asked why, the response was: 'Without being an economist, I don't want to give a detailed explanation.' If the main reason is staff costs, then Lloyds' aim to save Pounds 700m over four years partly through cutting up to 20,000 jobs lends some credence to its claim that small businesses would benefit. However, with the exception of specific offers to new businesses and for certain types of borrowing, it talks of 'better products and services' rather than cuts in charges. Stuart White, enterprise director at Midland, explained why a bank might switch from charging a flat rate for a bundle of cheques to charging for each one. 'Where there is a high volume, you may look at how much it costs to process the paper.' He also expressed some dismay at the prospect of a business switching back to cash. 'Through the 1980s we moved towards the cashless society but now there is a danger we could end up as a cash-only society. I would like to see that avoided.' His advice for a business like the riding school was to reduce the level of banking activity - 'don't collect as many cheques'. And it was worth asking the bank 'to ensure that charges came out at a minimum', he said. Midland offered to provide its customers with costings to show that it was trying 'to get the costs back plus a bit of profit for ourselves'. The banks were also asked about the help they offered to the small business customer. Some of the answers focused either on free banking for new businesses in their first year (Lloyds is proposing two years if the merger comes off). Others concentrated on support for businesses that were running into difficulties - obviously a preoccupation when the high street banks have had to make heavy provisions for bad debts. This perhaps explains why that 'bit of profit' earned from businesses that are neither new nor ailing is so important, and why charges are tending to outstrip inflation.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Senators will fight move to end Alaska oil export ban US senators are promising strong opposition to any attempt to lift the 20-year ban on Alaska North Slope oil exports when it comes up for renewal at the end of this month. Senator Pat Murray of Washington state claimed yesterday 'a broad coalition' of interests backed the current export prohibition, and most of her colleagues would vote to keep it in place. Mr Howard Marlowe, director of the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil, a lobbying group representing business, consumer and labour interests that has successfully fought off three attempts to kill the ban, said more than 60 senators had indicated they would vote to keep the export prohibitions. The Department of Energy is working on a report, not yet released, but rumoured to offer economic evidence supporting abolition of the prohibition. Alaskan North Slope oil accounts for nearly 25 per cent of the US's 6.6m barrels of daily output. At present, most of this oil is refined in California, but if the ban is lifted, it could be exported to Asia. The ban was introduced in during the 1973 oil crisis to protect national oil supplies, but has since been embraced by environmentalists eager to protect Alaska from further oil development. British Petroleum, the largest producer in Alaska and the company with the most to gain from the ban's removal, has persistently pressed for the lifting of the prohibitions. There are indications that organised labour, formerly a big stumbling block to those fighting to lift the ban, is coming around to BP's side. The seafarers' union, which supported the ban because Alaskan oil must be carried on US-flag ships when it is transported to another US state, has apparently reached a deal with BP. They will no longer oppose lifting the prohibition, in exchange for new legislation requiring that all Alaskan North Slope oil exports be carried on US-flagged vessels.</p>

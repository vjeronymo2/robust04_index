			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Plea on libel action rejected Two environmental campaign-ers yesterday failed to persuade a court to let a jury decide the libel action brought against them by the McDonald's fast-food empire. Mr Dave Morris and Ms Helen Steel of London Greenpeace - which has no connection with Greenpeace International - are being sued over a leaflet they distributed between October 1989 and April 1990 entitled: 'What's wrong with McDonald's?' It contained a number of allegations against the multinational corporation including claims of a relationship between its food and illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and food poisoning. The leaflet also attacked the fast-food chain's employment practices and the alleged effect of some of their policies on the environment. Mr Morris, 39, and Ms Steel, 28, who will represent themselves when the case is heard within the next few months, were anxious that the issues should be decided by a jury. But Lord Justice Neill, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Lord Justice Steyn and Lord Justice Peter Gibson, upheld an earlier ruling that the case should be tried by a judge alone. He said that the issues relating to the safety of the company's food were of such importance as to require careful and prolonged examination and evaluation of the scientific evidence and available literature. In the interests of both parties and of a fair trial of the issues it was imperative that any decisions should be recorded in a detailed and reasoned judgment. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.</p>

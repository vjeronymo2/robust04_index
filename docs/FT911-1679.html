			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Government 'ready to talk' in move to calm NHS row - Prime Minister's Questions MINISTERS are to have a fresh round of consultations with doctors' leaders in a bid to defuse the mounting criticism of the changes in the national health service introduced last month. Mr John Major, the prime minister, announced his readiness to have discussions with representatives of the BMA in the Commons yesterday. He again came under fierce attack from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, who endorsed the BMA's verdict that the Government's reform of the NHS had resulted in a 'crisis' for doctors and patients. The prime minister clearly hopes that by the time he meets the doctors later in the year, the initial outcry over the cuts announced by hospitals which have opted out of control by local health authorities by becoming self-governing trusts will have faded. Mr Major recalled that the BMA had clashed with Conservative and Labour politicians from the time the NHS was established in 1948. Emphasising that the government was seeking to secure more value for money, he urged the doctors to accept that it was 'improbable' that the entire Pounds 30bn a year being spent on the NHS was being used to best effect. He said: 'The purpose of our reforms is to ensure that money is used to the best effect on patient care, and to ensure that the patient gets the best possible value for the contribution he makes to the health service'. The prime minister condemned the local government workers' union (Nalgo) for using 'phoney pictures and fake statistics' in newspaper advertisements attacking the health service reforms. He claimed that their content was similar to 'so much from what we are hearing from the Labour Party'. Mr Kinnock interpreted this charge as a sign of the prime minister's 'desperation' and proof of the BMA's case that 'you really do not know what is going on in the country'. tary of the BMA, had complained that the reforms introduced by the government had resulted in hospital clerks having to take 'life and death decisions' on the admission of patients to hospitals. The prime minister suggested that Dr Field should have looked to those parts of the country where hospital trusts were not seeking cuts but expanding staff.</p>

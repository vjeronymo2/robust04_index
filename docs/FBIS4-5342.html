			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Where Do They Drive the Situation?" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  rulers are driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to a  grave phase, making much ado as if a war were imminent due to  the North. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today states that  it is not the North but the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique of South  Korea who are scheming a war on the Korean peninsula.    The news analyst says:    The Kim Yong-sam group adopted a "policy of tough response"  to the North at a "high-level strategic meeting." It worked out  long ago a war scenario against the North codenamed New  Operation Plan 5027, and promoted a plan for introducing Patriot  missiles, crying for "a prompt entry into action" and "surprise  operation."    The Kim Yong-sam group is driving the situation to the brink  of war against fellow countrymen in collusion with outside  forces. In this it seeks to stifle the DPRK with "strength,"  realise its ambition for unification by invading the North and  prolong its power with the military support of its master.    The Kim Yong-sam group is a gang of treacherous political  charlatans most dependent on outside forces among the successive  rulers of South Korea.    In order to ease the tensions in Korea, save the nation from  disaster and promote peace and peaceful reunification of the  country, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK must be changed  and such traitors as Kim Yong-sam be removed from power in South  Korea.</p>

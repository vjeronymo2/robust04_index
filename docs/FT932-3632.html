			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Senior executive at EBRD threatens to resign THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was thrown into turmoil last night by the news that its first vice-president, Mr Ronald Freeman, is 'seriously considering' resigning. Mr Freeman has not 'finalised his decision', according to a bank executive, but directors fear he is likely to resign in protest at a reorganisation of the bank's management orchestrated by the governments of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. Mr Freeman was unavailable for comment. 'It would be a serious blow to the bank,' said one of the EBRD's directors, who represent the 54 countries and agencies which own the bank. The EBRD refused to make any official comment last night. Mr Freeman is in charge of merchant banking and was viewed inside and outside the bank as the number two to the president, Mr Jacques Attali. Bank directors believe Mr Freeman was unhappy that Mr Ernest Stern, number two at the World Bank, has been approached to fill the new post of senior vice-president of the EBRD in charge of both its merchant banking and development banking operations. Mr Stern has been offered the post by officials representing the G7 countries. They have been trying to bring stability to the bank, which has been widely criticised for excessive spending on private aircraft and on its London headquarters. However, bank directors said last night that the G7 governments had caused increased turmoil in the bank by prompting the possible departure of Mr Freeman, who is widely liked and admired within the organisation. As part of a reorganisation at the bank, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the EBRD's head of development banking, is also expected to be promoted to be another senior vice-president. In that case, Mr Freeman would effectively be demoted to number four.</p>

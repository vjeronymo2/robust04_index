			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / German coalition plans cuts in spending GERMANY'S coalition govern-ment yesterday presented plans for drastic cuts in public spending and tax increases, intended to provide a stable basis to finance the soaring costs of German unification. The package proposes cuts in social spending, unemployment benefits and industrial subsidies along with the reintroduction of a 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax and the abolition of a series of tax allowances, to reduce the soaring public sector budget deficit. The financial markets were concerned at one element, which would extend the 30 per cent withholding tax on investment income to include dividends from offshore investment funds. Analysts in Frankfurt played down the significance of the move, however, suggesting that it would not have a big effect on the flow of money out of the country. Because of the downturn in the German economy, with gross domestic product officially forecast yesterday to stagnate or decline by up to 1 per cent this year, the immediate result of the package will be a DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) increase in the central government deficit for the year. In the longer term, however, the proposal is intended as the basis for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's planned 'solidarity pact' between central government, opposition, the 16 state governments, trade unions and employers, aimed at launching a recovery of the east German economy. It is also intended to provide 'room for a reduction in interest rates' by the Bundesbank, by demonstrating the will to reduce the structural budget deficit in the public sector, the Ministry of Finance said. The 50-page document, entitled a 'federal consolidation programme', was finalised by leaders of the coalition yesterday, and presented to their supporters in the German parliament. The planned savings, however, ran into criticism from trade unions and the opposition Social Democrats for targeting social spending and unemployment benefits. They warned that the whole solidarity pact could be endangered. The immediate savings package would cut some DM9bn from central government spending this year, to finance extra investment subsidies in east Germany, support for local government, and extra payments to Russia for accelerated troop withdrawals from its former satellite. The additional DM10bn increase in the federal government budget deficit, set to rise from DM43bn to DM53bn this year, is blamed on a DM5bn shortfall in tax revenues and a DM5bn increase in unemployment payments, because of the economic downturn. In a bid for trade union support, the package proposes a one year extension in the life of the Treuhand privatisation agency, from end-1993 to end-1994.

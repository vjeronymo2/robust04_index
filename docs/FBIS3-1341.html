Speaking after a National Party [NP] meeting in Lowryville,  in the Northern Cape town of Colesberg, he said SAP Commissioner  Johan van der Merwe was negotiating with the generals over their  suspension from the force and was keeping the minister informed.    "I will evaluate the decision and if I don't agree with it I  will bring into play certain powers available to me," he said,  without giving any details.    Mr Kriel said he had not met President F.W. de Klerk on  Thursday, as had been reported on national radio. He said he  personally had no reason to resign as he was in no way involved  in the violence. "I am a man of peace."    He told the meeting of about 250 enthusiastic supporters  that  the NP wanted to help the poor and to assist people in acquiring  houses. His speech was characterised by attacks on the African  National Congress, which he said was a violent party that forced  children and teachers out of schools with boycotts and strikes.    He told people to stand up against intimidation and not to  participate in violence, and to vote against what he called the  ANC's "impractical plans for the future".    Mr Kriel was asked by an ANC supporter why his party was now  wooing the coloured vote when it had removed coloureds from the  voters role shortly after it came to power in 1948.    He responded quickly by admitting that the NP had made a  mistake which had now been rectified.</p>

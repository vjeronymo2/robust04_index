Then, assuming you are in the middle of the final episode of Turning The Screws, Roger Graef's documentary series about Wandsworth Prison (9.00 C4) you will be able to record Chef] on BBC1, second episode in the new foodie comedy starring Lenny Henry (9.30 BBC1); the second episode in A Labour Of Love (9.30 BBC2) about child care in the first half of the 20th century which looks as though it may be nearly as good as 'A Secret World Of Sex"; and the second part of Disguises in which Adam Holloway finds out what it is like to be a schizophrenic on the streets.

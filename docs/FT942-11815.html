			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Running on rubbish - Christopher Brown-Humes on a plan to exploit the high energy value of waste packaging Applying the term 'value-added' to waste may seem odd, but it goes to the heart of a European plastics industry initiative to use ordinary waste packaging for energy. The high energy value of plastics and paper usually discarded with the rest of the household rubbish can be exploited by using them as a fuel in a conventional power plant rather than a municipal solid waste incinerator (MSW). The project's backers claim the process saves fossil fuel resources and reduces landfill requirements at a price that is both environmentally and economically acceptable. Tests at plants in Sweden and Finland have shown that the process is technically viable. Now the challenge will be persuading local authorities and power plants throughout Europe to adopt it. If they do, as much as 30m tonnes of the 50m tonnes of combustible packaging which Europe consumes every year could be used for power generation. That is more than four times the current level, and would represent a saving of 14m tonnes of oil worth Pounds 1bn. The initiative is being promoted by the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe (APME), with support from a number of plastics and packaging manufacturers and the Finnish government. Combustible used packaging, when converted into a fuel, has a higher energy value than peat, wood or brown coal - plastic is, after all, made from oil. The basic product, refuse-derived fuel (RDF), is municipal solid waste from which food, glass and metals have been removed. It has a net calorific value of 15 megajoules per kilogram, compared with the 10 MJ/kg rating of ordinary municipal solid waste. Packaging-derived fuel (PDF) is a refined, drier, version of RDF, with a 20 MJ/kg calorific value. The idea is to use the packaging as a co-fuel, rather than on its own, because quantities of RDF and PDF are relatively limited and plants would probably need to spend more on changing the combustion chamber and modifying flue-gas cleaning equipment if the proportion of RDF/PDF feed were to rise above 30 per cent. 'In most areas there will never be enough PDF to feed a plant. But there will be a power plant that is able to take all the PDF waste in an area as some 5 per cent to 20 per cent of its feed,' says Martin Frankenhaeuser, a project manager in plastics and the environment at Borealis Polymers. He says the technique brings energy from waste within the scope of small local authorities which usually do not have access to an MSW incinerator. At the Kauttua combined heat and power plant in Finland, RDF/PDF has been used as a substitute for coal in trials over the past year. The tests have demonstrated that packaging can be used as a substitute fuel without higher overall emission levels and without damaging equipment. Reduced coal use has cut sulphur dioxide pollution; however, the higher plastics content has increased hydrogen chloride emissions. Chlorine is present in substances such as PVC, and its corrosive power is the main reason that the combustion equipment is being so closely inspected for signs of damage. Supporters of RDF and PDF combustion say it fits in well with the broader recycling trend. According to Fred Mader, deputy director general of APME, combustion and recycling are different solutions to the problem of plastics waste, rather than alternatives. 'Recycling can maximise the environmental benefit of recovering plastics bottles and containers. But there is no benefit from collecting, sorting and cleaning lightweight plastics films,' says Mader. One reason for believing the initiative has a future is the increasing political resistance to the burning of unsorted waste in municipal solid waste incinerators. Older MSW plants have been condemned on both economic and environmental grounds. This had led plastics industry experts to suggest that, in future, building plants capable of using RDF and PDF as a majority fuel may be more attractive than constructing additional MSW incineration capacity. But this applies only to densely populated areas where volume of supply could be assured. An important issue will be cost. Kauttua has not had to make significant outlays because it has a suitable 'fluidised bed' boiler technology and because it already has a suitable feeding system, handling waste paper from a nearby mill. Other power plants are likely to have to install a receiving area and feeding line for the material, at the very least. But they could also have to make much more substantial investments, particularly if they do not have 'fluidised bed' boilers. Assessing the scale of such investments is just one of the tasks for the APME to consider when it studies the potential for packaging combustion in power plants in five countries - the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden - in the coming months. It will also have to take into account the fact that many European countries do not have well-developed networks for separating types of waste. Establishing one would immediately create an extra cost burden. There is also the vexed issue of who pays. Will power plants accept the plastics industry's contention that packaging fuel has a positive value, because it is cheaper than coal, and because savings on raw materials would more than cover additional installation, operation and maintenance costs. In other words, would power plants be prepared to pay for waste packaging? It is a question that will almost certainly have to be taken up in the broader context of recycling and landfill costs. Mader stresses that there is a long way to go, not least because the public tends to link incineration with pollution. This will inevitably complicate the task of securing changes to current legislation, he says. But he still believes that up to 15 per cent of Europe's plastics waste could be used for energy recovery by 2000.</p>

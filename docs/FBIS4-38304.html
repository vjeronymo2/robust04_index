			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, has emphasized that the Republic of Yemen will deal  positively with any international proposal that is in interest  of the Yemeni people and that serves the higher national  interest.    He said: Our forces -- the forces of legitimacy -- have  restored more than 70 percent of the areas that had been  controlled by the secessionists. He said that the forces of  legitimacy are now at the entrances of Hadramaut, and are in  control of more than 55 percent of city of Aden.    The brother president emphasized our Yemeni people's  rejection of those secessionists and agents who betrayed their  people and sold the homeland's cause at a low price.    He called on some brotherly countries, which claim to be  really eager to save Yemeni blood, to stop interfering in our  internal affairs and not to support the rebels.    The brother president hailed the position of the fraternal  State of Qatar -- government and people -- which advocates  Yemeni unity, and the Qatari leadership's sympathy with, and  support for legitimacy and Yemeni people.    He said this in a (television interview?) with the Qatari  television team.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eurocopy rises 54% to Pounds 2.62m Despite a 19 per cent fall in turnover, pre-tax profits at Eurocopy, the office equipment distributor, improved by 54 per cent from Pounds 1.71m to Pounds 2.62m in the year to end-September. Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said the drop in turnover - from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 27.6m - resulted from lower machine sales and service revenue, coupled with the absence in the second half of furniture sales after the April disposal of the furniture division. However, losses in the sales divisions were reduced substantially through a combination of better margins and lower costs, he added. Earnings per share came out at 3.6p (2.32p) and an improved final dividend of 1.2p (0.5p) raises the total for the year to 1.7p (1.6p).</p>

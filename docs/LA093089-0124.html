			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INSURER SEEKS LOWER RATES FOR GOOD DRIVERS;  </P> <P> STATE FARM PROPOSAL RELIES ON DRIVING RECORD IN FIRST STEP TOWARD COMPLYING  WITH PROP. 103  </P> <P> State Farm, California's largest auto insurance seller, has asked Insurance  Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for permission to lower its rates for most good  drivers throughout the state from 2% to 20%, while compensating by sharply  increasing rates for problem drivers.  </P> <P> The rate changes represent a step toward complying with a key provision of  Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Giving a number of examples of how increases and decreases would apply, State  Farm said rates for most good drivers would decline from 5% to 15% in central  Los Angeles, by 2% to 19% in San Diego, by 2% to 12% in eastern San Francisco  and from 3% to 18% in rural Northern California counties, if the company gets  its way.  </P> <P> No Orange County examples were given, but a company spokeswoman said the  general pattern would apply to Orange County as well as to other areas.  </P> <P> Good drivers are defined as those with no more than one conviction for moving  traffic violations in the previous three years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hikes for Problem Drivers  </P> <P> State Farm is proposing to pay for the decreases by sharply increasing the  rates of problem drivers, no matter where they live, who have been convicted of  two or more traffic violations in the previous three years. Most of these  drivers, according to examples released by the company, would see their rates  increase anywhere from 29% to 36%.  </P> <P> A company spokeswoman said that only "a very small number" of drivers in the  areas mentioned would fall outside these ranges of increases or decreases, if  Gillespie approves the new rate schedule.  </P> <P> The new schedule is revenue neutral, in that State Farm would end up with the  same amount of total premium income statewide after the various increases and  decreases.  </P> <P> The filing with Gillespie marks the first time any major company has moved in a  detailed way toward compliance with the provision in Proposition 103 that  mandates that a driver's record, the number of miles driven, and the years of  driving experience must be more important in setting auto insurance prices than  the neighborhood in which he or she lives.  </P> <P> Virtually all the major insurance sellers have opposed downgrading of  neighborhood-based pricing, known in the business as the territorial rating  system. And State Farm Friday emphasized that its proposed rates would, on  balance, only "slightly diminish" the importance of neighborhood as a pricing  factor.  </P> <P> The spokeswoman said the rate adjustments are being made on a  territory-by-territory basis and that the average urban driver would continue  to pay more than the average rural or suburban driver.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, State Farm's filing with Gillespie said that the company intends  in the new rates to "place more emphasis on driving safety record, miles driven  and years of driving experience as required by Proposition 103." In doing this,  it necessarily diminishes the importance of where a driver lives as a pricing  factor.  </P> <P> Beyond that, the proposed rates by State Farm mark the first time a major  insurer has abandoned an attitude of total resistance to implementation of  Proposition 103 since it was approved by the electorate last November.  </P> <P> </P> <P> News Conference Monday  </P> <P> There has been no reaction yet by Gillespie to State Farm's requests. The  insurance commissioner, however, has called a news conference for Monday in San  Francisco to lay out emergency regulations of her own for applying the pricing  provisions of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> State Farm said that time constraints will not permit implementing the  commissioner's regulations immediately, and it asked for permission to apply  its own new rates from Nov. 8 onward "for a reasonable time."  </P> <P> Gillespie has in the past expressed great hesitancy in accepting the  Proposition 103 rating criteria literally and downgrading neighborhood-pricing.  But she has said there will be changes in ratings, and she may not wish to do  less than State Farm has now indicated it is willing to do.  </P> <P> Gillespie has repeatedly suggested it would be impossible to bring down rates  for good drivers in urban areas without raising them in rural areas. But the  State Farm proposal notably finds a way to reduce rates for such drivers  everywhere, mainly by putting the burden on problem drivers.  </P> <P> State Farm, with about three million California customers, has 17% of the total  auto insurance market in the state, and has long been an important influence  over the rest of the industry.  </P> <P> But a lobbyist for several other major companies expressed unhappiness Friday  about State Farm's rate requests. Asking not to be identified, he said that  State Farm does less business in inner city areas than other big companies,  such as Allstate, so it is easier for it to agree to cut its rates for good  drivers in urban areas.  </P> <P> Consumer spokesmen were also reserved about State Farm's rate proposal,  suggesting it does not go far enough toward reducing the differential in prices  between urban and rural areas.  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103 and chairman of Voter Revolt,  said, for instance, that State Farm should be required to lower rates for good  drivers far more.  </P> <P> Conway Collis -- the state Board of Equalization member who has been endorsed  by Rosenfield for insurance commissioner when the post becomes elective next  year -- said the State Farm proposal "begins to bring down rates for good  drivers in Los Angeles and elsewhere, but not nearly to the extent that they  will be after 103 is fully implemented."  </P> <P> State Farm, in its filings with Gillespie, also gave other examples of how  rates might fluctuate by driver according to how many miles were driven each  year, how many years of driving experience he or she had, and how many  accidents there had been.  </P> <P> When these factors were included in the calculation, the increases and  decreases varied.  </P> <P> The examples given all involved a 1988 Ford Taurus "GL" four-door sedan with a  fairly complete coverage package and multiple cars in the household. However,  the State Farm spokeswoman said the examples were meant to be representative of  patterns in other situations as well.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, in one example, household drivers with no traffic convictions,  driving more than 7,500 miles a year and with nine years of driving experience,  under age 50 and having a policy in force at least six years would get a  decrease of 6.5% in premium, from $1,018 for each six months to $952.  </P> <P> If one driver in the household had one minor traffic conviction in the previous  three years, the drivers covered would still get a 6.5% decrease, from $1,018  to $952. But if one driver had two convictions, the household drivers would get  a 29.1% increase, from $1,018 semiannually, to $1,315.  </P> <P> If the drivers had no convictions and no chargeable (at-fault) accidents and  the car was driven less than 7,500 miles a year, with the principal driver in  the household having five to nine years experience and being a single female,  the premium would drop by 15.1%, from $1,474 to $1,252. If, on the other hand,  the vehicle was driven more than 7,500 miles a year, the decrease would be only  4.9%, from $1,474 to $1,402. And if there had been one chargeable accident,  there would be a 7.6% increase, from $1,582 to $1,702.  </P> <P> If the drivers had no moving traffic convictions, no chargeable accidents, the  car was driven more than 7,500 miles a year, and the principal driver had less  than three years driving experience and was a single male, the increase would  be 18.6%, from $3,270 to $3,878.  </P> <P> If one driver in the household had one conviction of a minor traffic violation,  no chargeable accidents, the car was driven more than 7,500 miles per year, and  each driver had nine years or more of driving experience (14 years for a single  male) and is under age 50, and the car was driven to and from work more than 30  but not more than 100 miles a week, there would be a 15% decrease, from $1,415  to $1,202.  </P> <P> The examples demonstrate how changes in the facts about a drivers' situation  can lead to dramatically different rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE RATES WOULD BE LOWERED  </P> <P> The map shows neighborhoods in Los Angeles where State Farm, California's  largest auto insurer, is proposing to reduce rates for most "good drivers" in  November between 5% and 15%. At the same time, most drivers in these areas with  more than two traffic violations in the last three years would be given rate  increases close to 30%. The proposed rate adjustments are designed to bring the  company into compliance with a key provision of Proposition 103 calling for a  reduction of neighborhood price differentials.  </P> <P> 1.

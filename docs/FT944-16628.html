			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Procter predicts record Shares in Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 62 3/8 yesterday after Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, predicted it would report record sales and earnings for its first quarter to September. Unit volume for the quarter was 10 per cent higher than a year earlier, Mr Artzt told the company's annual meeting, with 3 percentage points of the increase coming from new businesses. Mr Artzt said Procter &amp; Gamble could increase its share of the Dollars 25bn worldwide laundry products market from 23 per cent to 33 per cent by the end of the decade. This is likely to raise eyebrows at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group which is P&amp;G's biggest rival. The companies are embroiled in an acrimonious soap war over the European laundry products market.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Charities attack Benetton: Poster campaign prompts Aids furore BENETTON, the Italian clothing company, came under fire from Aids welfare organisations in Europe yesterday for the images used in its latest advertising campaign, launched this week. The French Association for the Fight against Aids said the photographs - which depict a human bottom, a male arm and a lower abdomen each stamped 'HIV positive' in blue ink - evoked the Nazi practice of tattooing concentration camp inmates. It said it had filed a civil complaint against Benetton in the French courts, demanding that it take down the posters and that it pay unspecified damages. The British charity Acet (Aids Care Education and Training) also demanded the withdrawal of the adverts, which have appeared in double-page colour spreads in UK newspapers and on the French metro system. 'The image of branding when it comes to HIV/Aids is one we have all worked hard to get away from to reduce the stigma of Aids,' said Mr Maurice Adams, executive director of Acet. 'I hope these offensive images will be withdrawn. If they consider this working for charity, then this kind of help we can do without,' he added. The Italian company is known as much for its shocking advertising as its colourful knitwear. The Terrence Higgins Trust, the leading British Aids charity, would not comment on the photographs but welcomed the inclusion of the Aids national helpline number in the adverts. Benetton, which has used photos of a newly-born baby, a man in a Christ-like pose moments before he died from Aids and a priest kissing a nun, defended the campaign. The adverts 'were metaphors for the more extensive branding practised throughout society towards those who are different,' the company said in a statement from its Italian headquarters.</p>

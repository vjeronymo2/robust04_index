			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / EBRD chief Attali reimbursed twice for Tokyo flight MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was reimbursed twice for a first-class return flight to Tokyo - by the bank and by the organisers of a conference at which he was giving a speech. Last night Mr Attali said it had been the result of a clerical error. Mr Attali also accepted a Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) fee for making the speech in May 1992. He said last night he had since handed the funds to three unnamed Jewish charities. Separately, it has emerged that the EBRD's audit committee has received details of several new flights on private jets taken by Mr Attali in 1992. Mr Attali said last night that, earlier this year, he had reimbursed the EBRD for the flights. The EBRD's audit committee will in the next three weeks complete an investigation into allegations of overspending and lax financial controls at the bank. A director of the bank said the committee would take a close interest in fees paid to Mr Attali and the double payment of the flight expenses. Mr Attali, who has been criticised for the bank's overspending in the two years since it was set up, said last night that his personal assistant, Mr Francois Olive, had issued instructions earlier this month that the bank should be reimbursed for the expense of travelling to Tokyo over a year ago. An EBRD official said Mr Attali flew first-class to Tokyo from London on a British Airways flight on May 13 1992 and returned to Paris by Japan Air Lines on May 15. The cost of such a round trip would have been approximately Pounds 7,000, British Airways said yesterday. Mr Attali made the speech at the end of the trip, on May 15, at a conference organised by Asahi Shimbun, the leading Japanese daily newspaper. On the trip, Mr Attali also met senior Japanese officials. An EBRD official said that under the terms of his contract with the Asahi Shimbun, Mr Attali had also received Dollars 30,000 for a speech made for the newspaper in the spring of 1991, although the official was not sure whether on the earlier occasion Mr Attali had yet joined the EBRD. However, the official said that Mr Attali had signed the contract before joining the EBRD. Under the terms of the contract, Mr Attali also received Dollars 20,000 for being part of the international body set up by the newspaper to advise on the conferences. The EBRD's staff handbook says: 'Bank officials and staff members owe their duties entirely to the bank'. It adds that bank officials shall not 'accept any remuneration from any government, entity or person in connection with their appointment or service with the bank'. Mr Attali said last night: 'I would like to point out in no uncertain terms that with the salary I make from the bank and the revenue from my books, I do not need to make money from travel reimbursements.' He also pointed out that he had a surplus of Pounds 8,000 on his EBRD corporate credit card: 'That shows the bank owes me money.' Mr Attali said: 'I have given some 80 speeches in the last two years. In almost all cases, they have been free of any fees. In two cases, I have cashed the money to be sent to a humanitarian association (the International Association against Hunger) and a Romanian orphanage.' The bank's audit committee has also learned of several new occasions on which Mr Attali used private jets, in addition to the 26 uses disclosed to the committee in April. Mr Attali said last night that there had been an extra four or five flights, most of them to Paris, by private jet in 1992. The cost had originally been billed to the EBRD. Earlier this year, he had decided to reimburse the bank for them, in anticipation of a change in the bank's 'air travel policy'. The cheque for several thousand pounds was received by the bank's finance department at the end of April. The first public disclosure of Mr Attali's frequent use of private jets came in the Financial Times. Mr Attali said the cheque had been written in February and had been 'held up' in Mr Olive's office. The EBRD, set up to make investments in eastern Europe, is owned by 54 governments and agencies.</p>

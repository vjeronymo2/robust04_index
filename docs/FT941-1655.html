			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alternative view of pensions 'fantasy' Sir, Barry Riley's view ('Break-up threat to pension fund fantasy league', March 16) that UK pension funds are moving away from a 'fantasy league' is his interpretation of surveys like ours. Others may interpret differently. Balanced managers have done the UK pensions industry, the sponsoring companies and members a great service compared with those overseas. While a number may 'tweak consensus strategy', this is hardly surprising when this consensus is their target. Many others seeking higher targets are likely to employ managers who display distinct preferences and styles - they cannot slavishly follow the consensus when they are engaged in compiling it. Twenty years of consensus results have produced annualised returns of 15.3 per cent a year when earnings growth has been 10.1 per cent. Universes reflect the reality of pension funds, maturity et al. Indeed the WM All Funds Universe is currently split into, broadly, three equal parts; funds with positive net contribution flow ignoring investment income, positive cash flow only when including investment income, and negative cash flow despite investment income. The WM 50 Universe of very large funds represents an even more mature peer group. If the industry profile has changed over time, the aggregate of the new environment is just as meaningful as it was of the old.

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENTSEN BILL WOULD LIMIT TAX BREAKS AFTER BUYOUTS  </P> <P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) introduced a bill  Thursday to limit the tax refunds that corporations can receive from leveraged  buyouts.  </P> <P> The bill is designed to prevent companies from receiving tax refunds when they  generate large losses simply by taking on the huge debts that result from LBOs  and major debt restructurings.  </P> <P> According to a study by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York firm  specializing in leveraged buyouts, 17 companies that it acquired through LBOs  paid $430 million in taxes the year before the takeovers but received $130  million in tax refunds after the transactions.  </P> <P> "My proposal would put a stop to that," Bentsen said. "I don't think the  federal government should write checks to corporations that replace equity with  debt."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limit Deductibility  </P> <P> The Senate Finance Committee staff went to unusual lengths to explain the  proposal, partly because a much more far-reaching tax proposal by House Ways  and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) in 1987 aimed at  leveraged buyouts has been widely blamed for contributing to the October stock  market crash.  </P> <P> In addition, Bentsen waited until after the stock market closed Thursday to  announce the bill.  </P> <P> "There are proposals to limit the deductibility of corporate interest that are  more dramatic than mine," he said in a statement. "I have opposed them and will  continue to do so."  </P> <P> The measure would raise an estimated $200 million in the next fiscal year and  $1.8 billion over a five-year period.  </P></p>

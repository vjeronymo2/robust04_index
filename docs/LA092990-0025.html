			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICANS HAVE PATIENCE TO LET INTERNATIONAL ACTION SUCCEED;  </P> <P> GULF: A 'WAR PARTY' IN WASHINGTON THREATENS TO UNDO WHAT IT TOOK THE UNITED  NATIONS 45 YEARS TO ACHIEVE.  </P> <P> The men and women who have kept alive the world's hopes for the United Nations  through these last 45 years of tribulations and trials have done a singular  service. Now their hopes are gradually being realized, at least in part.  </P> <P> For 45 years the Cold War vastly restricted the power of the United Nations to  do what its founders hoped for -- chiefly, to establish a world order of peace  and responsibility, in which the rule of law and international cooperation  would replace the old order of brute force.  </P> <P> Now the Cold War is over. The United Nations has taken on new vigor. It has  been functioning more effectively than it had in years.  </P> <P> And now in the Persian Gulf it faces a most difficult challenge. The five  permanent members of the Security Council have acted repeatedly, with  unprecedented unanimity and the support of nearly all the council's other  members, to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and to impose tough sanctions  with the object of getting Iraq to relinquish Kuwait.  </P> <P> This is the principal object for which the United Nations was founded: to  establish an international order where once had been only the law of the  jungle.  </P> <P> It is an exhilarating spectacle to watch. It is also sobering, because it is  dangerous.  </P> <P> It is dangerous first because Saddam Hussein is dangerous. We all know the  stories: He came to power through assassination; he has maintained his power by  murder and ferocious repression; he not only attacked Iran and Kuwait, he also  slaughtered his own Kurdish people with poison gas -- and, some say, his own  soldiers, deserters in the war against Iran. He has amassed a great war machine  and he is racing to build nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them.  </P> <P> The situation in the gulf is dangerous also because the presence of so many  heavily armed opponents can lead to accidents, to sparks that could set off a  great fire no one could control.  </P> <P> And it is dangerous because there exists in the United States a war party that  is either assuming that war is inevitable or hoping that it is.  </P> <P> The war party's argument goes something like this: Sanctions will not persuade  Hussein to leave Kuwait, because Iraq will be able to withstand their effects  for months or even years -- at least longer than the American people will  tolerate the tension, and the expense, of keeping so many of their young men  and women stationed in the Arabian desert. The international cooperation shown  to date is actually fragile, and cannot stand a long, inconclusive period of  uncertainty. In any case, the war party's argument goes, Hussein, if unchecked,  will only become more dangerous. Therefore, the argument goes, the United  States should either seize upon the least provocation, or create one, to attack  Iraq, Hussein and his military, chemical and nuclear installations. Finally,  this can be accomplished swiftly, and almost entirely with air power.  </P> <P> That line of reasoning is dangerous.  </P> <P> First, it is foolish to count on air power, and air power alone. A war with  Iraq would involve troops on the ground -- very many of them -- and there would  be many, many casualties.  </P> <P> And it is impossible to predict what will happen once a war gets under way.  Wars have unintended, indeed unimagined consequences. A war with Iraq in which  the United States played the leading role of antagonist would threaten the  United Nations consensus. It would seriously threaten, if not destroy, the  anti-Iraq stance of most of the Arab states. It would present the containment  of Iraq, which is currently a United Nations endeavor, as an attack by the  infidel Christian West against a Muslim Arab state. It would throw the Arab  world into further turmoil, with all sorts of upheavals, in Saudi Arabia, for  instance, or Egypt. It would at least for a while disrupt the world's supplies  of oil much more seriously than they are disrupted now.  </P> <P> In short, a war with Iraq in which the United States played the leading role  would gravely set back the cause of international order.  </P> <P> The problem of Saddam Hussein, (and threats to peace from future Saddam  Husseins), is better contained by international than by unilateral American  action.  </P> <P> Of course, the outcome may not lie in the hands of the United States or its  allies. It may be that Hussein by his own unmistakably belligerent acts will  precipitate a war. In that case, the international response, and the  predominant Arab response, may well hold together in opposition to him.  </P> <P> But suppose Hussein does not precipitate a war, and suppose the war party in  Washington -- and in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt and perhaps in Israel -- is  restrained. Is the world then condemned to watch helplessly as Hussein grows in  power and arrogance, until he is able to unleash the horror of not only  chemical weapons but also nuclear weapons against Israel? To use nuclear  blackmail against Saudi Arabia and the oil states of the gulf, Egypt and the  Western allies?  </P> <P> The preponderance of evidence is against these assumptions. It is true that the  world in general and the United States -- and France -- in particular, not to  mention Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- have much blame to bear for letting Hussein  think that he could act pretty much as he wanted to, not only without  opposition, but indeed with support. Surely he is disabused of that notion now.  </P> <P> And it is by no means certain that the sanctions will not have a severe effect  on Iraq, especially on its more sophisticated war-making machine. The lack of  parts and the lack of imported skills and materials will, some people believe,  seriously crimp Iraq's ambitions to build an even more sophisticated engine of  destruction.  </P> <P> It has been argued, variously, that an international force under U.N. command  could be held in the desert indefinitely, in order to allow the United States  to withdraw the bulk of its ground troops while keeping its air and sea power  there in conjunction, as now, with other nations.  </P> <P> To be sure, such a course would not immediately solve the problem of Kuwait.  Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait should remain the United Nations' unequivocal  position, even though it may take some time to bring that about.  </P> <P> It is often said -- by American commentators -- that the American people will  not put up with a long struggle whose outcome is indistinct and whose purpose  is unclear. It is said that the American military force now in the desert must  be used soon, or the people will demand that it be brought home -- a cynical  "use it or lose it" point of view.  </P> <P> I don't believe that. I believe the American people will support a long  struggle -- if the purpose is clear, and clearly worthy. After all, the United  States has spent a vast fortune and kept several hundred thousands of men and  women at arms overseas over the last 45 years in defense of the freedom of our  own and other peoples. A long but much smaller watch in the Persian Gulf, in  the service of the international order, is a task the people would support if  the elected leaders have the courage to ask for it, the intelligence to explain  it and the moderation to make it fit the challenge.  </P> <P> It may be that this first post-Cold War attempt at international cooperation  will quite literally blow up through miscalculation, or, worse, by calculation.  If it does not, if it is sustainable by the international community, then the  human species will have taken another faltering but forward step toward  organizing itself on rational principles for the benefit of everyone.  </P> <P> None of us should feel smug in our belief that despite the horrors of this  ghastly century there is such a thing as progress in human affairs. But those  who have supported the concept of the United Nations through its darker and  more ineffectual days may take some small satisfaction in seeing that a more  orderly and united world is still struggling to be born.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Burundi interim president and chairman of the  National Assembly yesterday addressed the nation. Mr. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya centered his address on the major issues that are  facing our country following the crisis and have paralyzed the  country since October last year. Matthias Ndahirigije has gone  into this address, here is his report:    [Ndahirigije] Peace seems to prevail on the whole country,  but insecurity and suspicion are not mainly uprooted yet because  mutual hatred still haunts the population and lack of confidence  hasn't been swept away at all. In such state of affairs, the  population think that evils are intellectuals because it is the  latter who always create disorders in the country while fighting  for powers. For the Burundi ad-interim head of state, current  chairman of the National Assembly, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya,  the population has suffered too much and wants peace now. Time  has come to come together, work together, and overcome all  partisan tendencies which can't lead nowhere else than to  catastrophe.    It's true that some provinces have now a state of security  somehow calm but in some other areas of the country, such as the  capital Bujumbura, especially the mayorship of Bujumbura, the  situation is rather deteriorating. Ethnic cleansings have led  to the creation of ethnic settlements and barbarous acts can no  more allow free traffic and free circulation of people. For the  ad- interim president of the Republic, Mr. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya, the state can't allow such ethnic settlements  because the country should serve every citizen. For him, it is  too deplorable to see quarters like Kinama, Kamenge, and others  to become Hutulands, and quarters such as Nyakabiga, Ngagara,  and others become Tutsilands.    For Mr. Ntibantunganya, everyone should bear in mind that  all  Burundians are all citizens, and therefore should share all  opportunities offered by the state. It's true that since 21  October, the country lives a strong crisis but if everyone could  feel involved in the settlement of it, a lot could be settled  down. That's why he called upon administration forces, order  forces, lawmen, and churchmen to feel involved and do whatever  necessary to restore peace and mutual confidence.    Therefore, some activities seem to take priority over  others.  First of all, the state should organize the relocation of  displaced persons and start the reconstruction of all damaged  equipment or buildings, start quickly the disarming of the civil  population because this is a prerequisite for the restoration of  peace in the country. Another priority task would focus mainly  on the youth (?training) which is becoming more or less  impossible in the capital Bujumbura. The OAU and UN observers  are also appealed to backing this mission of restoring peace in  the country.    Earlier he had congratulated all order forces for having  done  whatever possible to keep security.</p>

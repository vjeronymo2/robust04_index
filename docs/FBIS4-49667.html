			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- The 13th United Nations  Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific opened  here today.    Over 200 delegates from the UN and international  cartographic  organizations and cartographic departments of various countries  are attending the conference.    At the opening ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  praised the UN's role in promoting international cartographic  cooperation and development.    The Chinese Government has always encouraged China's  cartographic departments to strengthen economic and  technological cooperation with their foreign counterparts, said  the vice-premier.    To date, China's cartographic management departments have  signed contracts with cartographic organizations in more than 10  countries and set up technological cooperative relations with  dozens of countries. Meanwhile, they have actively participated  in related activities of the United Nations and international  cartographic organizations, Li said.    With a stable political situation and rapid economic  development, China now is speeding up its reform and opening to  the outside world, said Li. He hoped the United Nations and  other countries in the world would support restoration of  China's status as a signatory state to GATT so as to further  promote China's economic development.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze has sent  an appeal to the Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. The appeal  says in particular:    We have chosen a peaceful way of settling the conflict in  Abkhazia. The hallmark of the Abkhazian separatists is easily  recognized in the tragedy which has unfolded recently. They are  continuing their practice of ethnic cleansing and terror against  civilians. All this shows that the Abkhazian side is not  interested in establishing, since the latest tragedy which  unfolded in Gali rayon coincided with the timing of the return  of displaced people to Abkhazia, as envisaged by the Geneva  talks.    The only solution is to speed up a UN-sanctioned deployment  of peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia and to establish strict  international supervision.    The start of the normalization of relations between Russia  and Georgia, which by itself is the foundation for the  establishment of peace in the Transcaucasus, has evoked a wide  response from beyond the borders of our countries.    I appeal to the leadership of Russia, on whose mediation and  peacemaking role largely depends the future of peace in Georgia,  in particular Abkhazia, to take all measures for a peaceful  settlement of the conflict and a (?dignified) return of the  refugees.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Body Shop The much-heralded US article on the Body Shop contained no shockers. The main categories of criticism had already been leaked. True, a lively debate over whether the detailed charges are accurate looks set to rage for some time. But the City has come to the conclusion that the criticism will have precious little impact on the business. A few so-called ethical shareholders may expect purity from the Body Shop. But most do not. If ethical investors sell out, others will pick up their shares at a bargain. The City will only worry if Body Shop's image is so tarnished that customers stop buying its products. So far, it has taken the view that they will not. Squabbles with franchisees and a few shampoo spillages are unlikely to turn people away from Body Shop. Most customers are attracted by its bright colours and powerful aromas. This is not to say that Body Shop cannot learn lessons from the saga. In a moment of pique, Mr Gordon Roddick, who with his wife Anita founded the Body Shop, said that maybe they should 'no longer even try to be remotely ethical'. Reflection will show that this is not the lesson. Companies, like individuals, should behave ethically, though the exact definition of such behaviour is open to debate. The lesson is rather one of presentation. Those who proclaim their virtue as energetically as the Body Shop has leave themselves wide open to criticism if they make the slightest slip.</p>

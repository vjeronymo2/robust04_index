			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "COST Meeting"] </F>   [Text] A meeting of the senior officials of the Committee  on Scientific and Technical Research (COST) took place in  Brussels on 20-21 January. The meeting was chaired by Mr. N.  Roulet.    There was agreement on COST's policy on possible  enlargement.  Almost as a precursor to this, the Committee decided on  participation from non-COST countries in its 78 ongoing actions  from:    -- the Cluj-Napoca Technical Research University of Rumania  and the Radio Research University of Rumania and the Radio  Research and Devlopment Institute from Moscow in Action 235  (Radio propogation effects on next-generation fixed-service  terrestrial communication systems);    -- the University of Melbourne in Action 240 (Techniques for  modelling and measuring advanced photonic telecommunication  components);    -- the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism of Izmiran  (Russia)  in Action 238 (Prediction and Retrospective Ionospheric  Modelling over Europe (PRIME).    The Committee also had an extensive exchange of views on the  different sectors in which COST is particularly active. These  included materials science, biotechnology, transport and  telecommunications. It was also decided to establish two  working parties on procedures and the ways of improving the  methods of this cooperation system. These will report to the  next meeting of the Committee. One working party will examine  the suggestions for improving the procedures, while the other  will review the actual role of the Senior Officials Committee.    Eight new actions were decided upon, including:    -- continuous speech recognition over the telephone (COST  Action 250);    -- management and information application development (COST  Action C4).    On the central issue of the meeting, enlargement, the Senior  Officials decided that:    -- COST should retain its identity as a dynamic mechanism  for  enhancing scientific and technical collaboration across Europe;    -- COST will continue its policy of openness along the lines  of the Ministerial Resolution of the Vienna Conference;    -- Each request for participation as a full member will be  examined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the  manageability of the COST system;    -- Such requests will be considered on the basis of mutual  benefit and institutes of research of the countries concerned  should be encouraged to participate in individual actions. The  participation in individual COST actions will be the appropriate  way to evaluate scientific interest and mutual benefit before a  decision on the entry of a new member;    -- A COST Ministerial conference in 1996 could be a  framework  to confirm possible decisions of the COST Senior Officials  Committee concerning the enlargement of COST. If that is the  case, the countries concerned should be invited to participate  as observers at COST after the decision of the COST Senior  Officials Committee;    -- Cost will continue to inform non-COST countries about its  activities.</p>

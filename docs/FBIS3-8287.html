			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy at 1400 departed from Ljubljana airport on  a regular flight by the Russian air carrier Aeroflot to Moscow.    Because the Slovene authorities did not allow him entry into  the country, he spent the night at the airport, together with  his three companions. He was visited by Yuri Girenko, charge  d'affaires of the Russian Federation Embassy in Ljubljana.    The Slovene Foreign Ministry has reported that it did not  allow entry to Zhirinovskiy because of violations of public law  and order during his visit in Slovenia at the end of January.  On that occasion the Foreign Ministry merely advised him to  leave the territory of the Republic of Slovenia as soon as  possible.</p>

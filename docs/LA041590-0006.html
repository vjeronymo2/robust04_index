			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE HEIGHT OF HUBRIS'  </P> <P> Could it be that Robert Ward's credentials, earned working as a television  producer, give some indication of why television is in such a sorry state? His  categorical assertion in his review of "Writers in Hollywood" (by Ian Hamilton,  Book Review, April 1) that "in movies, character is completely dictated by  plot" seems to me the height of hubris and ignorance.  </P> <P> That may well be the rule on "Miami Vice," but it is certainly not true in the  best of films.  </P> <P> Indeed, what distinguishes fine films from the mediocre is character  development, with stories that are driven by the interrelation of unique and  interesting people.  </P> <P> Ward claims that " 'What does the hero do?' is the main question, not 'How does  he feel?' or 'What does he think?' " In fact, one of the reasons that screen  writing is a demanding form beyond the reach of many novelists is that the  writer must rely on what his characters do to convey how they feel and what  they think about. (In the best drama, as in life, characters often lie with  words and tell the truth with their behavior -- and this certainly includes  film drama.)  </P> <P> I suggest Ward go see "Driving Miss Daisy," which won an Oscar for its writer,  Alfred Uhry. There's not much in the way of plot, but there's 25 years of  enlightening and moving character development.  </P> <P> JOHN CROWTHER  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NEW COUNCILMAN TO LEAVE SCHOOL BOARD  </P> <P> Robert L. Richardson's successful bid for a seat on the City Council has  resulted in a vacancy on the Santa Ana Unified School District Board of  Education.  </P> <P> Richardson, who has served on the seven-member school board since 1987, won a  council seat by defeating incumbent Councilman Ron May. Richardson will begin  his four-year term on the council on Nov. 26.  </P> <P> The board will decide on Tuesday whether to fill the vacancy by appointment or  special election, said Diane Thomas, district spokeswoman.  </P> <P> A special election would cost the district about $49,000, according to Doug  Mitchell of the county registrar of voters office.  </P> <P> If the board decides to appoint a successor for Richardson, it will begin  accepting applications immediately, Thomas said.  </P></p>

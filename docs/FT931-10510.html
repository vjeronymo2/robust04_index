			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Joblessness rising in EC UNEMPLOYMENT has risen in most regions of Europe, but the most striking increases have been in areas of Spain and southern England. Eurostat, the European Community's statistical office, said rising unemployment in Spain, Greece, Ireland and the UK were the main forces behind the overall rise in EC unemployment. The figures, which measure the increase in unemployment in the year to April 1992, take no account of the recent grave deterioration in employment levels across the Community. Unemployment in the EC rose from 8.5 per cent in April 1991 to 9.4 per cent in April 1992. The areas worst affected were Campania, Basilicata and Sicily in southern Italy and Andalucia, Extremadura, Ceuta y Melilla and the Canary Islands in Spain. In these regions the jobless total was more than 20 per cent. It was below 5 per cent in southern Germany, parts of northern Italy - Lombardia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto and Emilia Romagna - and Portugal. Luxembourg recorded the lowest rate of unemployment. For the community as a whole, female unemployment rose by 11.5 per cent, compared with 8 per cent for men. But female unemployment was lower than the male rate in Hamburg, and every part of the UK other than the North of Scotland. Regional differences were most marked for the under-25s. In some regions of Germany the rate was 2-3 per cent, while in many Spanish and Italian regions it was over 30 per cent. The figures came from the EC Labour Force Survey.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "The Measure of a Man," the Feb. 19 episode of "Star Trek: The Next  Generation," was wonderful. Fascinating . . . intriguing . . . superb . . .  beautiful -- it was all these and much, much more. Not since "City on the Edge  of Forever" has "Star Trek" produced such a heart-rending and heartwarming  show.  </P> <P> Rivka Gila Simon, Los Angeles  </P></p>

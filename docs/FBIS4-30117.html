			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Korean Bellicose Elements Perpetrate Military </F> Provocations" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  bellicose elements perpetrated military provocations again in  the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), military sources said.    They illegally introduced recoilless guns into the southern  portion of the DMZ in the central sector of the front from June  20 to 22.    They also brought by stealth large-caliber machine guns into  the MP [military police] posts in the central sector of the  front and in the eastern sector of the front.    On June 22, they brought 25 vehicles and 500 armed personnel  into the southern portion of the DMZ to build military setups.    If the South Korean bellicose elements continue aggravating  the tensions in the DMZ despite our repeated warnings, they will  have to bear full responsibility for all consequences arising  therefrom.</p>

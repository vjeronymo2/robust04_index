			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Gloomy forecast for Hualon plant Kurt Salmon Associates, the independent advisers to the UK government on the planned Hualon textile plant near Belfast, last month issued a statement forecasting sharp declines in European production of the fabrics that will be made at the Pounds 157m plant. Mr Tim Smith, the economy minister for Northern Ireland, said this week that KSA had been employed by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board to provide 'specialist marketing and production/technical advice' on the plant, which is to receive Pounds 61m in government grants. Mr Smith said KSA had concluded in its report for the IDB that the market for the Hualon plant's products was growing. The contents of KSA's report to the IDB are not publicly available and are bound by customer confidentiality. The report was not part of the project appraisal - it was commissioned after the UK government had approved the project, and after the European Commission had announced a formal inquiry into the proposed plant. KSA said yesterday that it had finished the report last December, a year after the UK submitted the Hualon proposal to the Commission for approval. Last month, however, KSA issued a statement in response to media inquiries about the plant, in which it forecast a 22 per cent fall in synthetic fabric production in the European Union between 1991 and 2001, and a fall of 26.4 per cent in cotton fabric production. These forecasts were initially produced by KSA last year, in a special report on the textiles industry, and were published by the consultancy before it undertook the report for the IDB on the Hualon plant.</p>

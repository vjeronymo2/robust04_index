According to the  surveys, the share of the CRo in the total number of radio  listeners is approximately 65 percent. "The situation at the  Praha, Radiozurnal, and Vltava radio stations is stable,"  Jaroslav Pochmon, director of programing, said when assessing  1993. The most popular programs are the Radiozurnal Segments of  Narrative and Music [bloky slova a hudby]. The Morning Stream  [ranni proud] is listened to by an audience of 1.7 million, and  the Praha station Good Morning [dobre jitro] has 1.2 million  listeners.    On Saturday [29 January], the management of the Radio  Metropolis radio station sent a proposal for a "nonstandard"  solution to the complex situation of the CRo in connection with  financing its newscast program on the long-waves band to CRo  Director General Vlastimil Jezek. The Radio Metropolis proposes  that a "nonbiased private entity with sufficient financial,  professional, and political guarantees, assume the long-wave  broadcast. A condition would be a close programing cooperation  with Czech Radio.</p>

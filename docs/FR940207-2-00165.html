No CDSC will be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a fixed number of years prior to their redemption, or on shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC Period. The amount of the CDSC to be imposed will depend on the number of years since the investor made the purchase payment from which an amount is being redeemed and the lesser of the shares' cost or the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants also request the ability to waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) Following the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b) in connection with certain distributions, described in the following paragraph, from an individual retirement account, a deferred compensation plan under the section 457 of the Code, a custodial account maintained pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, or a qualified pension or profit sharing plan (collectively, ``Retirement Plans''); (c) pursuant to a Fund's systematic withdrawal plan, but limited to 12% of the value of the account annually; (d) effective pursuant to the right of a Fund to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset values of shares held in the account is less than the designated minimum account size described in the Fund's prospectus; and (e) by the Adviser of its investment in a Fund. If a Fund waives or reduces the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in the class specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The CDSC may be waived for a total or partial redemption in connection with certain redemptions from Retirement Plans. The CDSC charge may be waived for any redemption in connection with (a) a distribution from a Retirement Plan after attainment of age 591/2 (or such other age as may be provided in section 72(t)(2)(A)(i) of the Code), (b) in the case of a tax sheltered custodial account maintained under section 403(b)(7) of the Code or a qualified pension or profit sharing plan after separation from service after attainment of age 55 (or such other age as may be provided in section 72(t)(2)(A)(v) of the Code, (c) in the case of an eligible deferred compensation plan established and maintained pursuant to section 457 of the Code, after separation from service, or (d) a loan, from a qualified employer plan to a participant, that is intended to meet the requirements of section 72(q)(2) of the Code. In addition, the CDSC may be waived upon the tax-free rollover or transfer of assets to another Retirement Plan invested in one or more of the Funds. In such instances, a Fund will tack the period for which the original shares were held on to the holding period of the shares acquired in the transfer or rollover for purposes of determining what, if any, CDSC is applicable in the event that such acquired shares are redeemed following the transfer or rollover. The CDSC also may be waived on any redemption that results from the tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d)(4) or (5) of the Code, the return of excess deferral amounts pursuant to section 401(k)(8) or 402(g)(2) of the Code, or from the death or disability of the employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Class B shares and Class C shares may automatically convert to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. For Class B shares, the conversion period will be between four and ten years; for Class C shares, the conversion period will be a maximum of twelve years. For purposes of conversion to Class A, all shares in a shareholder's account that were purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions paid in respect of Class B shares or Class C shares will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares or Class C shares in the shareholder's account convert to Class A, an equal proportion of the Class B shares or Class C shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Trust will have obtained an opinion of counsel that the conversion of Class B shares and Class C shares to Class A shares does not constitute a taxable event under current federal income tax law. The conversion of Class B shares and Class C shares to Class A shares may be suspended if such an opinion is no longer available at the time such conversion is to occur. In that event, no further conversions of Class B shares or Class C shares would occur, and shares might continue to be subject to the additional distribution fee for an indefinite period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. No CDSC will be imposed in connection with the exercise of an exchange privilege whereby an investor exchanges Class B shares or Class C shares for Class B or Class C shares of another Fund or for shares of the money market portfolio of the Trust. In the case of the exercise of an exchange privilege between the Funds, a Fund will tack the period for which the original shares of a class of the Fund were held on to the holding period of the shares acquired in the exchange for purposes of determining what, if any CDSC is applicable in the event that such acquired shares are redeemed following the exchange. In the event of redemptions of shares after exchanges, an investor will be subject to the CDSC schedule imposed by the original Fund. All such exchanges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

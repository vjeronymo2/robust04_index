			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: London Economic statistics are starting to behave like London buses. Nothing significant appears for several days; and then three or four important figures turn up at once. The main traffic jam will be on Wednesday, when the gilts market can choose from retail sales, unemployment, average earnings and the public sector borrowing requirement. But the key statistic for gilts investors will undoubtedly be January's Retail Prices Index, also out on that day. The market was rather confused by last week's quarter point base rate cut, which the Bank of England linked to its Quarterly Inflation Report. However, the report's forecast of 3 per cent underlying inflation in 1995 - in the upper part of the government's target range - did not appear to justify the cut. Both headline and underlying inflation are expected to rise, as a very good January 1993 figure drops out of the annual comparison. But any figure significantly above the 2.6 per cent consensus of headline RPI growth (3 per cent for underlying inflation) is likely to dent confidence further. The markets will also watch for further details of the next gilts auction. The Bank of England announced on Friday that it would be offering stock with a maturity range of between 2000 and 2004, rather longer than expected.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rescuers used bulldozers and bridge-building equipment in an attempt to reach a  wrecked Air Force cargo plane in a swamp on Eglin Air Force Base in Florida,  but came no closer to learning the fate of the eight people aboard. The  four-engine C-141B jet based at Norton Air Force Base near San Bernardino  crashed and burned four miles north of Hurlburt Field, part of the base, in  Florida's panhandle Monday while on its landing approach. Seven crew members  from Norton were on board, along with a military retiree who boarded during a  refueling stop in Colorado, officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Naval Main Staff First Deputy Chief, </F> Vice Admiral Yu. Kaysin, under the rubric: "Questions of  Theory": "Developing Naval Command and Control Theory"]    [Text] The Navy's combat readiness is formed in peacetime  and its improvement is a continuous process. In the process, the  underestimation of just one of the elements of combat readiness  can result in such consequences that are at times impossible to  correct during the course of a war. Proceeding from that, the  Navy's leadership is making heightened requirements to the  activities of commanding generals, commanders and staffs in this  sphere.    The capability of command and control organs to bring  themselves and subordinate units to readiness to accomplish  combat missions in a timely manner and also the skill of  commanding generals, commanders and staffs to firmly command and  control subordinate forces during the course of preparing for  and conducting military operations is one of the primary  elements of naval forces combat readiness. Military history  knows quite a few examples when units or formations, that had a  powerful combat potential, lost battles and engagements to an  enemy who was equal in forces and sometimes weaker precisely due  to the absence of operational, continuous and reliable command  and control.    Our Navy's operations on 22 June 1941 serve as a positive  example. Having manifested vigilance and based upon information  obtained on the change of the operational situation at sea and  in the air, the Navy's command authorities issued the order to  shift fleet forces to full combat readiness several hours prior  to the enemy attack which permitted them to successfully repel a  surprise attack. As a result, on the first day of the war, our  Navy did not lose a single ship or aircraft.    The experience of the latest local wars and armed conflicts  also objectively confirms the need to prepare the command and  control system for the complex conditions of entry into war. So,  according to foreign press information, during the course of  Israeli Armed Forces aggression into Lebanon (in 1982), the  Israelis managed to reveal the Syrian troop formations' command  and control and communications system which permitted them to  conduct accurate strikes against the revealed targets already at  the beginning of the conflict. As a result, they managed to  completely or partially disrupt command and control of Syrian  troops, their aviation and air defense systems.    In the Persian Gulf, during the first two weeks of combat  operations of the United States and its allies against the Iraqi  Armed Forces, approximately 25 percent of the command and  control organs were destroyed and 50 percent were rendered  inoperable which permitted them to practically paralyze the  Iraqi Armed Forces command and control system and to  dramatically reduce coalition forces losses. It is  characteristic that one of the reasons that caused the defeat of  the Argentine Armed Forces in the Falklands (Malvinas) Islands  (1981) were the shortcomings of their command and control system  that reduced the reliability and stability of the leadership of  combat operations.    All of this attests to the need to maintain the command and  control system at a high degree of combat readiness during  peacetime and to ensure its transition beforehand to combat  readiness when a threat emerges and also its role in the  attainment of victory in wartime.  <H8>  Definition of Command and Control Theory </H8>   The content of military practice has perceptibly expanded  under contemporary conditions. The significance of military  theory has also correspondingly increased. Therefore, the role  of military scientific research and also the significance of the  timeliness of the introduction of their results into the  practice of military structural development have substantially  increased. We know that theory sheds light on the path of  practice and practice is the driving force and the goal of the  development of theory.    Naval theory -- this is the system of scientific knowledge  that reveals the laws and patterns of armed combat at sea, the  principles of structural development of the Navy, its  preparation and employment in the system of the armed forces  both during the course of a war and also during peacetime. While  defining the prospects and directions of naval development on a  scientific basis, it is a part of military science and is in  subordinate dependence to it. In turn, naval command and control  theory permeates all of the elements of naval theory.    In the Soviet Military Encyclopedia, the concept of ground  (naval) forces command and control is interpreted as the  activity of commanding generals (commanders, superiors), staffs,  services and other command and control organs for the  maintenance of the combat readiness and combat capability of  ground (naval) forces, preparation of operations and combat  operations and their leadership while accomplishing the assigned  missions. At the same time, it indicates that in a broader sense  troop command and control encompasses all of the activity of  strategic leadership, commanding generals (commanders,  superiors), and staffs both for command and control in a combat  situation and also for the development and combat improvement of  ground (naval) forces, the organization of operational and  combat training and service of the troops, maintenance of  discipline and high moral spirit of personnel, and ensuring  continuous combat and mobilization readiness of the troops  (naval forces).    However, in our view, we must examine command and control  theory as one of the components of military science that has an  independent sphere of research that is based upon the common  laws and principles of command and control of the Armed Forces.  In the process, the provisions of naval command and control  theory certainly must take into account and reflect the specific  features of the Navy while resolving the missions of armed  combat at sea and in turn be part of all of the components of  naval theory. So, its own private theory, that takes into  account the specific nature of this activity, is being developed  based upon the general provisions of command and control theory.    From what has been stated above, we can arrive at the  conclusion that contemporary naval forces command and control  theory must be developed as naval command and control theory on  the whole. Let's dwell on this in more detail.    In our view, the activity of the command authorities and  command and control organs during preparation of the Navy for  the armed defense of the state and the employment of forces  during the course of military operations, that are being  conducted both independently and also jointly with other  services of the Armed Forces, is the object of study of this  theory. Its subject are the laws, patterns, principles and  categories of command and control, the organized forms and  methods of functioning of the naval command and control system  under various conditions and while accomplishing various  missions with the employment of contemporary technical command  and control systems.    The structure of naval command and control theory must  examine all of the specific features of the peculiarities of  command and control of forces while preparing for and conducting  operations and combat operations, the management of  construction, operational, combat, moral-psychological training  and education of personnel, and also scientific research and  other types of naval activity. In our view, it consists of the  following elements: the foundations of naval command and  control, command and control organs, systems and equipment, and  organization and methods of command and control. The laws and  principles of the science of command and control of the state  and the Armed Forces, that are being employed while taking into  account the specific nature of the missions, organization, and  forms of utilization of naval forces, are its methodological  basis, like all other sciences. Furthermore, it broadly utilizes  the information of the natural and technical sciences, based  upon which the continuous improvement of command and control  methods and systems is being carried out.  <H8>  Development of Naval Forces Command and Control Theory </H8>   The art of command and control of naval forces had already  emerged in ancient times. We know that in the 5th Century B.C.  ships in the Greek Navy had already been formed into detachments  for convenience of command and control in battle and the naval  commander had several assistants which we can consider to be the  beginning of the birth of the organization of command and  control of forces. It was improved over the course of many  centuries along with the development of naval forces and naval  battle tactics. The first naval charter of 1720, in which the  combat experience of ship operations in the Northern War was  summarized, played a large role in the establishment in our  country of the theory and practice of command and control of  naval forces. The appearance of a steam-powered navy required  the development of both new tactics and also the organization of  the command and control of its forces. Headquarters of  formations were created in the Russian Navy in the 1880's as a  result of the increase of the volume of command and control  functions.    The introduction of the radio became revolutionary in the  matter of the command and control of naval forces. So, the  experience of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 pointed out  that command and control had attained the significance of an  important factor that determines the attainment of victory in  armed combat at sea and its excessive centralization and Vice  Admiral Rozhestvenskiy's underestimation of the capabilities of  command and control using radio were noted among the causes of  the defeat of the 2nd Pacific Squadron in the Battle of  Tsushima. Furthermore, the absence of a full-fledged staff under  the commanding general had a negative impact on the quality of  command and control of forces during this battle.    After the Russo-Japanese War, the question on the  reorganization of the naval leadership staff was urgently  raised. In 1906, the Naval General Staff was created with the  functions of operational-strategic leadership of the Navy  because the Main Naval Staff that had existed prior to this was  involved only with administrative-management activities.    During the course of the First World War, objective  conditions for the emergence of a new form of combat activity of  the fleet -- the naval operation -- developed as a result of the  appearance of new branches of forces (submarines and aviation)  and the increased scale of combat operations at sea. Its  introduction into the practice of armed combat at sea began to  be implemented thanks to the increased capabilities of fleet and  staff commanding generals for command and control of forces at  great distances using radio communications and also for planning  large-scale operations with the involvement of operational staff  organs.    The expansion of the missions, the qualitative and  quantitative composition of the Navy, the forms of its combat  employment, and the introduction of new technical systems  rendered a substantial influence on the development of naval  forces command and control techniques. Having absorbed the  accumulated domestic and foreign experience of command and  control of forces in the First World War and the Civil War, the  theory and practice of command and control of forces found its  expression in an entire series of interim guidance and  instructions and, in 1925, in the first postwar general military  regulation.    Furthermore, the military reform of 1924-1925, having  affected all spheres of activity of the Armed Forces, resulted  in the reorganization of the central staff. One-man command was  introduced and special research was conducted to improve command  and control of forces at all levels. In 1937, the People's  Commissariat of the Navy was formed for the direct leadership of  fleet forces. On the eve of the Great Patriotic War, it  introduced a number of documents that regulated the combat  activities of the fleets and contained requirements and  recommendations for planning and organizing combat operations  and the leadership of their conduct. The war years were an  important stage in the improvement and development of the naval  forces command and control system and principles. The provisions  of command and control theory underwent combat verification.  Much attention was devoted to summarizing and disseminating  combat experience in those years. In the process, the new  dimensions of the nature of fleet operations during the course  of the Second World War had an impact on the development of the  theory and practice of command and control of forces, the most  important of which were:    the spatial scale that encompassed enormous spheres of the  seas and oceans with active combat;    the increase of the role of the most universal branches of  fleet forces --submarines and aviation (especially,  carrier-based aviation) in armed combat;    the increase of the significance in attaining the common  goal  of joint operations of the Army and Navy, their coordination in  defensive and offensive operations (which found its expression,  in particular, in the increase of the number of amphibious  assault landings), during which the fleets were operationally  subordinated to the troop coastal combined formations or the  creation of a single command authority was stipulated, joint  development of combat documents was conducted by staffs, command  and control was organized from a single or closely-located  command posts, the exchange of staffs by operational groups,  etc.; and,    the increase of the number of major naval operations and  engagements, especially with the participation of carrier-based  strike formations.    During the course of the Great Patriotic and Second World  wars, the staffs of various echelons and other command and  control organs, radio communications and situation coverage  systems received significant development. The experience of  these wars and the new trends of development of the theory and  practice of command and control of naval forces lay at the  foundation of the resolution of the problems of the leadership  of the activities of the fleets right up to the end of the  1950's. During subsequent years, the leading naval powers,  including our country, developed qualitatively new ocean navies  based upon the achievements of science and the  military-technical revolution and modern and fundamentally new  command and control systems were deployed to realize the combat  potential of these ocean navies.  <H8>  Naval Forces Command and Control Theory at the Current Stage </H8>   The history of navies, like military history on the whole,  does not provide and cannot provide prepared recipes for the  resolution of today's problems. Its main value is in the  capability to reveal the general patterns of development and to  provide a scientific analysis of the phenomena of past wars and  to extract object lessons from them.    Under contemporary conditions, various types of automated  command and control systems, using special software, are being  widely utilized for the collection, analysis and transmission of  information. This permits them to shift to the automation of the  most important process of command and control -- working out a  decision. If a decision is the meaty basis of command and  control, the command and control system, the main elements of  which are command and control organs and facilities,  communications and automated command and control systems, and  also the system for extracting and gathering information on the  situation, serves as its material basis at the present time.    Automation of the command and control of forces is normally  understood to be the process of developing and realizing the  required system of technical equipment that permit accomplishing  certain command and control functions automatically, without the  participation of man in command and control organs (staffs and  command posts). Actually, at the present time it does not appear  to be possible to effectively control many spheres of activity,  including naval forces, without utilizing automated command and  control systems. But nevertheless man still remains the main  figure in the command and control process. Really command and  control is first and foremost anticipation. Machines can only  ease and accelerate the process but are presently incapable of  replacing the creativity of the intellect.    The decision made by the commanding general (commander) is  the basis of command and control of forces. Command and control  is structured on its basis and must ensure effective utilization  of the combat capabilities of forces and successful  accomplishment of missions by them within the prescribed time  periods under any conditions of the situation. Therefore,  unswerving observance of the principle -- teach staffs and naval  forces what is required in war -- as before is the main  requirement made toward the activities of commanding generals,  commanders, staffs and command and control organs during the  planning, organization and conduct of operational and combat  training measures.    The existing structure of the naval forces command and  control system, which was developed in peacetime and includes  the command and control organs and facilities, communications  and situation coverage systems, and also automated command and  control systems, permits us to accomplish the important  functions of supporting the conduct of combat operations. It's  obvious that, on the one hand, under all conditions the system  must ensure stable, uninterrupted, operational and concealed  command and control of its own forces and, on the other hand,  provide the capability to carry out disruption of the enemy  forces and weapons command and control systems by employing men  and equipment to disable enemy command and control facilities,  communications hubs, navigation systems, etc, or to achieve  disruptions in their operation.    However, it is not simple to accomplish all of these  missions. At the present time, there is an objective need to  increase the quality of all training of command and control  facilities because its shortcomings reduce the quality of the  assessment of the situation which, in turn, does not promote the  correct prediction of its development. In the process, this can  result not because people are unskilled but because the existing  direction of their training and also the level of organization  of coordination of command and control facilities combat crews  does not always promote success in operations in a specific  situation.    While considering what has been stated above, steps have  already been taken in the fleets to increase the quality of  training for the command and control of forces but there still  remains a significant sphere for initiative. In the process, in  our view, first of all we need a scientific approach to the  problem of improving the combat training of command and control  facilities, the goal of which must become increasing the combat  readiness level of the entire command and control system and its  capability to withstand any unpleasant situations under the most  varied conditions. Here, in our opinion, along with the  resolution of a number of technical problems, we need to  increase the quality of individual training of officers of  command and control facilities, to precisely ascertain the list  of methodological and guiding documents that regulate training  for command and control of forces and the performance of  operational alert duty and also the selection of the most  optimal organizational forms of training utilizing computer  systems.    Developed at the end of the 1980's, the naval forces command  and control system corresponded to the composition, structure  and missions being accomplished and on the whole supported  command and control of naval forces and also combat and  operational training of forces and staffs. In the process, the  primary provisions of the new military doctrine on the whole did  not affect the principles of its formation. Analysis of the  operational training inspections and measures that were  conducted in the 1993 training year indicated that, despite a  number of deficiencies that were revealed, the Navy's command  and control organs are capable of accomplishing the assigned  missions. However, the change of the state borders partially  affected the effectiveness of the Navy's command and control  system. At the present time, the command and control organs  themselves have also been subjected to a substantial  reorganization and experience shows that a drastic reduction and  change of the structures of command and control organs has  always been reflected in the qualitative indicators of their  functioning. We must also take into account the fact that the  entire load of work not only for the command and control of  forces but also for the reorganization lies on the command and  control organs.    Moreover, at the present time we can precisely see the naval  powers' navies' increasing role in maintaining peace and  stability, accomplishing peacekeeping functions, conducting  foreign policy actions under the aegis of the United Nations,  rendering assistance to the population in emergency situations,  etc. This, in turn, entails the need for a comprehensive  analysis and rethinking of a number of directions in the  training of command and control organs. With the increased  probability of the outbreak of regional conflicts, in this  training we need officers to expand their study of the  political, economic, and social processes that are occurring in  these regions.    Here we have touched upon only the most general issues that  are associated with the development of naval forces command and  control theory. We would like for the chiefs of staff of all  levels to participate in the development of its individual  issues and to share the experience that has been accumulated in  the process on the pages of the press. This will certainly  promote the strengthening of the Navy's combat readiness.    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.</p>

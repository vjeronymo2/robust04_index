			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS EXPAND SCIENCE SKILLS IN COURSES, INCLUDING GARBAGE STUDY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: INSTRUCTORS FIND HANDS-ON METHOD OF SCIENCE NOT ONLY ENCOURAGES  STUDENTS BUT SHARPENS CREATIVE THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE SKILLS.  </P> <P> Fourteen elementary school teachers from the metropolitan area gather at the  Museum of Science in Boston to sort through garbage.  </P> <P> The goal of the project -- dubbed "garbology" -- is to make hypotheses about  whose garbage it is. "This will be great in the classroom," said Ann Harney, a  teacher from Beverly, Mass. "If garbage and mess are involved, the kids will  love it."  </P> <P> As teachers sift through discarded panty hose, used envelopes, newspapers,  batteries and a cereal box, they draw conclusions from the evidence and later  learn how close their hypotheses came to fact. They are working like scientists  and learning to be better teachers in the process.  </P> <P> The project was part of the Museum Institute for Teaching Science, a two-week  program in its fourth year of helping elementary school teachers become more  science literate. The program's philosophy is that if teachers have a positive  attitude toward science, their students will reflect that attitude whether or  not they are scientifically inclined.  </P> <P> Teachers are sent to one of eight participating area museums, including the New  England Aquarium, the Massachusetts Audubon Society, the Manomet Bird  Observatory and the Children's Museum. The museums are sponsored by the  National Science Foundation and a number of science-related companies  interested in the development of the future work force.  </P> <P> Teachers become students and spend their days "doing science," rather than  reading or teaching it from a textbook. They leave with notebooks full of ways  to introduce science into the classroom.  </P> <P> Mary McClellen, a sixth-grade teacher from East Somerville Community School in  Somerville, Mass., enjoyed her first summer in the program so much that she  returned for a second round this year. After being told last year that her  school would departmentalize, McClellen decided science was one of the courses  she wanted to continue teaching. "I said I wanted to stick with science," she  said. "Two years ago, if anyone told me I would be saying that, I would have  told them they were crazy."  </P> <P> According to Beverly Perna, Museum of Science outreach program coordinator, the  goal of the various museums is to get the teachers to realize the value of  interdisciplinary teaching. Instead of sitting before a classroom of young  children and saying, "Now it's time to read, now it's time to do math,"  teachers should let one course naturally flow from another, she said. Science  does not have to be simply science in the traditional sense of the word; it can  be integrated into the curriculum with any subject that an elementary school  teacher normally teaches, Perna said.  </P> <P> An exercise in making cartouches (ancient Egyptian nameplates, which royalty  wore as necklace ornaments) involves not only the scientific inquiry necessary  to decipher unknown symbols and codes, but also leads the class to discussions  and lessons in history, social studies and language, with more than a little  art thrown in.  </P> <P> Joan Wolman of Randolph, Mass., has always taught with a hands-on approach to  science, but the museum institute has helped her integrate science with other  subjects.  </P> <P> "In the past, I would have the kids do an experiment, or demonstrate an  experiment, and that would be that. Now, I have them write about their  experiences afterward and get them to use their language skills."  </P> <P> "The importance of science is a sense of discovery," said Harney, who has spent  parts of three summers with the museum institute. "Young kids are at the stage  where science is fun. They know if we see an unusual bird in the field, we are  going to go out and look at it."  </P> <P> Like most of the teachers in the program (90% of whom are women), Harney had  very little science training.  </P> <P> "We're striving for a more science-literate nation," said Amy Stevenson,  director of public relations at the National Science Teachers Assn. in  Washington.  </P> <P> The goal of the organization, Stevenson said, is to promote the science  profession. It sponsors several teacher workshops similar to the museum  institute and certifies teachers who have limited science backgrounds, but who  are competing in an environment that increasingly values a science education.  </P> <P> To become certified, a teacher must complete 12 semester hours of science  courses, including labs, field work and student teaching. "Teachers are finally  able to say with confidence, 'Yes, I have a science background,' " Stevenson  said.  </P> <P> "Elementary school kids are not afraid of science," said Ann Donofrio, a  teacher from Randolph, Mass. It is often the teacher who does not feel  experienced or smart enough to teach the subject, she says. One of the reasons  the museum institute and programs like it work is that they become research  centers for teachers to turn to throughout the year.  </P> <P> "Science has become a hot topic," said Frank Gardner, executive director of the  museum institute. The program has extended invitations to other museums to  visit the workshops and use them as a training program.  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / KIO's role in Spain under review KUWAIT yesterday sought to quiet growing concern in Spain and the state itself over the Spanish investments of the Kuwait Investment Office by revealing that Peat Marwick, the accountantcy firm, is conducting a full assessment of KIO's Spanish and worldwide holdings. The announcement was made after a high-level meeting in Kuwait. It included the ministers of finance, oil, trade, planning and communications, as well as top officials of the Kuwait Investment Authority and Mr Ali Rashid al-Bader, president of the London-based KIO. A statement after it assured that the KIO should seek whatever further legal or financial expertise was necessary to 'safeguard and develop Kuwaiti investments in Spain, and in order to maintain Kuwait's international reputation in this regard.' Mr al-Bader had been summoned to Kuwait to explain to the government KIO's role in the threatened collapse of Ercros, Spain's biggest chemicals company, which KIO controls. Convening such a meeting reflects Kuwait's concern about perceptions that the KIO may have lost some of its agility as an investor since the Gulf war. The secretive KIO has liquidated up to half of its pre-war investments of Dollars 65bn (Pounds 34bn) to help pay for reconstruction costs. KIO's sale of a large part of its 10 per cent stake in Midland Bank just before the group became subject to a bid battle also raised some eyebrows. Ercros owes some Dollars 2.15bn to creditors. KIO's refusal to make new funds available to the group in the absence of help from the Spanish government or creditor banks has prompted fierce criticism of the group in Spain. It has also prompted a concerted attack on the KIO's secrecy and investment strategy from Kuwaiti opposition groups preparing for October elections. Peat Marwick, KIO's regular auditor, last year assessed KIO's Spanish investments at between Dollars 2.9bn and Dollars 4.4bn, with the lower figure valuing Ercros even then at zero and, at most, Dollars 500m. Peat Marwick has now been asked to 'furnish a comprehensive assessment' of KIO's Spanish investments by November. Damage limitations exercise, Page 24</p>

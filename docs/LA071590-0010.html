			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> *** "LIVE ON BROADWAY" BARRY MANILOW 6 WEST VIDEOCASSETTE ($19.98): ITEMS IN  THIS SURVEY OF POP-RELATED VIDEOS, BOOKS AND LASER DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Manilow appeals mainly to the straight-laced, over-35 crowd that prefers  ballads brimming with melodrama -- the chief ingredient in Manilow staples like  "Mandy" and "I Write the Songs."  </P> <P> That audience should love this swiftly-paced, well-produced, 90-minute tape of  Manilow's Broadway show -- with the songs structured around key points in his  life and career. Though mainly a solo show, Manilow uses supporting performers  for several numbers. Never an exceptional singer, he makes maximum use of his  strengths -- earnestness, an amiable personality and a knack for making his  audience feel warm and comfortable. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

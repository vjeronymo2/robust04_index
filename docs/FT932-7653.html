			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / 420 jobs at Swan Hunter to go soon A TOTAL of 420 of the 2,200 jobs at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, will be lost next week, receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday. The cuts, described by union leaders as a devasting blow, are mainly among steelworkers and technical staff. The 420 planned redundancies comprise 212 blue-collar workers, 134 white-collar workers and 74 short-term contract workers. Mr Ed James, one of the receivers, said the redundancies were necessary to bring employment levels into balance with the company's workload, while retaining technical expertise as the search continued for a buyer for the business as a going concern. Labour MP Mr Steve Byers, in whose Wallsend constituency the company is headquartered, attacked the decision to shed jobs as premature. Union leaders, who were told further jobs would be at risk in the near future if Swans did not win an Oman order it has tendered for, expressed concern that cutting 89 technical jobs, one third of the total, could handicap attempts to clinch new contracts - a view rejected by Price Waterhouse. The job losses take effect next Friday, the last date the Ministry of Defence has agreed for outfitting work to continue at Swans on three Type 23 frigates, its main workload. Finishing the vessels, providing work until late 1994, offers Swans the best chance of finding a buyer as a going concern. Talks between Price Waterhouse and the ministry are continuing. Yesterday HMS Westminster left the Tyne for sea trials, postponed when Swans went into receivership last Thursday after its failure to win a helicopter carrier order. Price Waterhouse denied Mr Byers's claim that the Westminster might not return to the Tyne next week for completion. Mr Byers also said that the ministry on Thursday invited Vosper Thornycroft of Southampton to submit a price for completing work on the frigates. The ministry said it could not comment. Mr Martin Jay, Vosper's managing director, said the ministry had issued no such statement. The company refused to comment further. Mr Jay said his company, which has a Pounds 700m order book reaching to 1997, had 'plenty of spare capacity'. AV Seawork, a wholly owned Vosper subsidiary, advertised in Tyneside's Evening Chronicle on Thursday for experienced ship design engineers. Interviews will be held at a Wallsend hotel on Tuesday. Mr Jay said the engineers were needed for the company's existing workload. The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation announced yesterday it was providing, with the Tyneside Training and Enterprise Council, up to Pounds 100,000 to study the merchant shipbuilding market and help Price Waterhouse evaluate bids. Tomorrow in Carlisle shop stewards from all UK shipyards will be asked to back a motion urging workers at other yards to refuse to work on the frigates. Mr Mike Hubbold, outfitting trades secretary at VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness, said unions there had taken no stance yet on what would happen should the frigates be moved there.</p>

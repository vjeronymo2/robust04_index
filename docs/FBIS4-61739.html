			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishop of Istra Arseny, the patriarch's vicar,  sanctified Monday morning a cross outside the White House in  memory of those who died in the October 3 and 4, 1993 riots.  The ceremony was attended by former vice-president Aleksandr  Rutskoy, Constitutional Court Justice Valeriy Zorkin and  National Salvation Front leader Ilya Konstantinov.    Rutskoy told journalists that the 55th [as received]  anniversary of the victory would be celebrated in a quite  different environment; the present police regime would no longer  exist following a popular victory. He was certain that the  victory would be bloodless.    According to Rutskoy, all Russia's residents had to work for  making the country a great power and for unity if order was to  be instilled in the country. He expressed the hope that neither  in this nor in the next century the people would tolerate  adventurers in power. Rutskoy was confident that the Soviet  Union would be restored.    Following the sanctification Rutskoy laid a wreath to it.    No more than 50 people attended the ceremony.</p>

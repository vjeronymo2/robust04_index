			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Crescent Petroleum On March 8 and 11 of this year, the Financial Times reported that Mr Robin Cook, the shadow spokesman on trade and industry, had raised parliamentary questions calling for Crescent Petroleum Company International, the Gulf-based oil company, to be investigated on account of alleged improper links with the State of Iraq. In fact, Mr Cook raised no such questions, and the Financial Times was mistaken to state that he had. It was not the intention of the Financial Times to suggest in any way that the company had breached sanctions against Iraq, or that it had any improper links whatsoever with Iraq. The Financial Times now recognises that a contrary impression might have been conveyed, and apologises unreservedly to Crescent Petroleum for any damage or inconvenience caused by its report.</p>

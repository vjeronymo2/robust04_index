			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Morris warning on social chapter THE DEPUTY speaker chairing the detailed discussion of the Maastricht bill last night warned the government it could face a vote of no confidence if it ignores MPs' demands over the treaty's social chapter. Speaking on BBC 2's Westminster Live programme, Mr Michael Morris acknowledged the government could ignore a vote in favour of a proposed Labour new clause but said 'all sorts of things could flow - votes of confidence et cetera' if it did so. Mr Morris selected the new clause - which would prevent powers being transferred under the bill until MPs had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK - in a ruling last month. At the same time he announced there would be no vote on a separate and potentially crucial Labour amendment that would remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter. But with the bill due to return to the Commons today, Mr Morris was last night under intense cross-party pressure to reconsider this decision. During a 30-minute meeting in Mr Morris's chambers, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, pleaded the case for allowing a vote either during the current committee stage or the subsequent report stage. If the deputy speaker reversed his decision by allowing a vote while the bill is in committee, the division - which could deal a severe blow to the government - would probably come later tonight. Mr Morris made clear he would listen to MPs' views regarding his ruling: 'It may be that I have missed some aspect, in which case I will take it very very seriously.' There were rumours last night that Tory Euro-sceptics might attempt to call a vote of no confidence in Mr Morris if he confirmed no vote on the amendment would be allowed.</p>

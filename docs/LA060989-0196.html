			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KENTUCKY SUPREME COURT ORDERS NEW SCHOOL SYSTEM  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court declared Kentucky's system of public schooling  unconstitutional Thursday and ordered the Legislature to create a new system.  </P> <P> By permitting a wide gap between poor and wealthier school districts, the  Legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty, the court ruled.  </P> <P> "Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that Kentucky's entire  system of common schools is unconstitutional," Chief Justice Robert Stephens  wrote for the court's five-member majority.  </P> <P> Rich and poor alike "must be given the same opportunity and access to an  adequate education," the court ruled in a case brought four years ago by a  coalition of 66 "property poor" districts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Applies to All School Laws  </P> <P> The decision "applies to the entire sweep of the system -- all its parts and  parcels," including laws and regulations "creating, implementing and financing  the system," the opinion said.  </P> <P> This includes laws creating local school districts and school boards, the state  Education Department, school construction and maintenance, teacher  certification -- "the whole gamut of the common school system in Kentucky," the  opinion said.  </P> <P> Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, a critic of the state's school management scheme, said  the court had given Kentucky its greatest opportunity of the last century.  </P> <P> "We've been talking about changing the management culture within the system,"  Wilkinson said. "We never imagined that we'd have an opportunity to remake the  entire system."  </P> <P> State schools Supt. John Brock called it "the happiest day of my professional  life."  </P> <P> The General Assembly's ranking members -- Senate President Pro Tem John Rose  and House Speaker Don Blandford -- said that building the kind of educational  system the court required was sure to the expensive, but that they are willing.  </P> <P> Rose and Blandford also said the ruling was a relief, although they technically  were on the losing side. "As far as I'm concerned, there are no more sacred  cows" in education, Blandford said.  </P> <P> The court agreed with plaintiff districts that, despite existing programs to  funnel state money to local districts, "there are wide variations in financial  resources . . . which result in unequal educational opportunities throughout  Kentucky," Stephens' opinion said.  </P> <P> "Even a total elimination of all mismanagement and waste in local school  districts would not correct the situation as it now exists," the opinion said.  </P> <P> The Constitution "places an absolute duty on the General Assembly to re-create,  re-establish a new system of common schools," the ruling said, likening the  present system to "a crumbling school-house, which must be redesigned and  revitalized for efficient use."  </P> <P> The Legislature must provide for adequate funding of schools and can choose its  own method, the court said. But, if lawmakers decide to continue basing the  system on poverty taxes, they must ensure full valuation of property and  uniformity of tax rates, it said.  </P> <P> Kentucky law always has required full valuation of property. Local school  boards, which now number 177, have been allowed to set their own tax rates,  however, and they have varied widely.  </P> <P> Spending per pupil in 1987-88 ranged from a high of $4,094 in Anchorage, an  affluent suburb of Louisville, to a low of $1,986 in Williamsburg, a small  Appalachian town in southeastern Kentucky, state Education Department figures  indicate.  </P></p>

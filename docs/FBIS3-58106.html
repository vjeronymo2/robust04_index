The 16 member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation must be prepared "to help the UN implement its  resolutions by sending in additional troops and ensuring real  protection in the safe areas," he said.    Juppe said the Brussels summit on January 10 and 11 should  enforce a European Community peace plan agreed last year by  building up sufficient land forces.    Under the plan, Bosnia-Hercegovina was to be partitioned  into  three ethnically-defined mini-states, with the Bosnian  government controlling one third of the republic's present  territory.    Juppe urged NATO to examine a French proposal to reopen the  airport at Tuzla as a means of supplying humanitarian aid to the  stricken population of central Bosnia.    He said responsibility for the war was shared among the  three  communities.    "We must break out of the war cycle," he said. If the  fighting continued, countries with troops in Bosnia would sooner  or later decide to withdraw them, causing an "explosion of war"  throughout the Balkans, he told the Europe 1 station.    Late Thursday President Francois Mitterrand said the United  Nations should resist mounting pressure to pull its forces out  of Bosnia-Hercegovina.    "I would not wish to see a withdrawal of the UN troops  because that would amount to abandoning the civilian even more  than they are already," he said.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Slovakia prepares its sale of the century: Stalled privatisation programme is back on track Slovakia's governing coalition, which came to office in March vowing to revive the country's stalled privatisation programme, is about to make good on its promise. On September 6, three weeks before a general election, the government of prime minister Mr Jozef Moravcik is due to approve the sale of up to Kcs250bn (Pounds 5.2bn) worth of state assets to the private sector. It is one of the biggest mass sell-off programmes of any post-Communist country outside the Czech Republic. However, given the government's distinctly end-of-term air, nobody is taking anything for granted. Officials admit there is still a lot of work to be done. 'People are working 24 hours a day to get everything finished,' said one, exaggerating only slightly. 'We are trying to make up for the previous government (of Mr Vladimir Meciar), which didn't do much, to say the least.' Privatisation was the issue which brought down Mr Meciar. Mr Moravcik is hoping it will ensure him a second term when Slovaks vote on September 30 and October 1 in the first general election since independence 20 months ago. Getting his fragile coalition to approve such a sweeping sell-off programme will be difficult. The Democratic Left party (SDL), comprising mainly former Communists, with seven ministers in the mainly technocratic government, is divided on the issue. Luckily for Mr Moravcik, the SDL's pro-privatisation wing, headed by deputy prime minister Ms Brigita Schmognerova, is currently in the ascendant. 'Privatisation is the most difficult issue facing the government,' admits Mr Eduard Kukan, foreign minister. He maintains, however, that it is less whether the policy should be implemented, than how, that divides the left and right wings of the coalition, and that the government is committed to the programme: 'We intend to fulfil our promise.' But the plans have come under fire for allocating only a quarter of the sales to voucher privatisation. Slovaks are already familiar with the voucher method, a device used the last government of the former Czechoslovakia in which citizens buy vouchers and exchange them for shares in the companies of their choice. About 30 per cent of Slovak industry had already been privatised in this way before the federation split at the end of 1992. The new programme calls for disposing of Kcs80bn of assets via the voucher method, though this may yet be reduced to Kcs60bn. The remainder will be sold directly to investors or management, or floated on the stock market. This has been seized on by the government's free-market critics as evidence that it is a hostage to its hard-left wing. With opinion polls suggesting the SDL and Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia will emerge as the biggest parties after the election, it is fear of the return to power of the former prime minister, a hardline nationalist with no inclination towards privatisation, that is driving the government to push through its proposals. This has also led it to strengthen anti-corruption and money laundering laws alleged to have been ignored or abused during the last days of the Meciar administration. Three weeks ago parliament enacted a law which requires all Slovak citizens buying state property to provide documented evidence of the source of their funds. However, there is now the prospect of that law being seriously undermined. An opposition-inspired parliamentary order has forced President Michal Kovac to call a referendum to enshrine a similar clause in the constitution. However, the question voters are to be asked to decide is extremely vague, and there are fears that if the referendum goes ahead - it is scheduled for October 22 - it could vitiate the newly strengthened legislation, which has been praised for its comprehensiveness. The government, as a result, would like to avoid the referendum, but summoning a parliamentary majority to repeal the order is proving impossible. Too many politicians are getting campaign mileage out of being seen to support it. This is exactly what Mr Moravcik was hoping to avoid. Instead, he has inadvertently handed a stick to the nationalists, who have taken to beating the government with it. Whether it becomes an issue when the election campaign kicks off in earnest in the weeks after the privatisation vote could overshadow the government's own campaigning platform - that it keeps its promises.</p>

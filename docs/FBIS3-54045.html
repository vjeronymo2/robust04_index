			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An ambush group belonging to the Islamic resistance  forces last week carried out an operation targeted on 'Awdah  'Atwan, a criminal belonging to the regime's intelligence organ.  Our sources noted that the operation, which took place in the  village of (Abu Hudaydah) in the Governorate of al-'Amarah  resulted in the death of the above-mentioned person; his  personal weapons were seized. Criminal 'Awdah 'Atwan is known  by the residents of Abu Hudaydah and al-'Amarah marshlands as  someone who sold his conscience and humanity to tyrant Saddam's  regime. In doing so, he committed the ugliest crimes and  attacks against innocent citizens. He personally executed three  innocent citizens.    Last week, the Islamic resistance forces set up an ambush in  one of the sensitive points along the road between the district  of al-Majarr and the subdistrict of Nahr 'Udayl in the  Governorate of al-'Amarah. Our sources in the south said that  the ambushers succeeded in attacking a military vehicle [word  indistinct] transporting some regime forces along the  above-mentioned road. The attack destroyed the vehicle and  killed or injured all those inside it. Our sources noted that  the resistance men found identity cards and documents on the  bodies of the regime's men proving that the destroyed vehicle  belonged to the 1st Company of the 3d Regiment of the 704th  Brigade, which is deployed in the marshlands of al-'Amarah.    The Islamic resistance forces returned safely to their  bases.  It later became clear that the regime had placed its forces in  a state of alert and patrolled the road with armored vehicles.</p>

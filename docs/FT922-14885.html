			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The Property Market: Rotterdam - Europe's 'Manhattan on the Maas' Rotterdam has been widely praised for the broad scope of its strategic plans, best illustrated by its ambitious proposals to redevelop its docks. The Dutch city is starting in earnest on a plan to transform the 100-year-old docks on the south side of the River Maas into a commercial and residential area. When completed by the end of the decade the Hop van Zuid development will account for a quarter of the city's projected office space. Rotterdam is best known as the city with a huge port. As far as offices are concerned, Amsterdam is the favoured city. The Hop van Zuid project is designed to boost Rotterdam's attractions as a location for international business. The project will link the north side of the city, where most offices are situated, with the poorer southern end. The most potent symbol of the linkage will be a new Fl 365m (Pounds 113.70m) bridge, to be completed by late 1995. The authorities hope the elegant design will become an international symbol for a city which, for all its careful post-war planning, lacks the big city status of Amsterdam. The bridge, the new metro station, roads, and viaduct will be financed by the local and national government. As a prelude, the city authorities have studied London Docklands, and the New York waterfront developments. They believe that by installing the communications at the same time, or even before, the other big developments, such as offices and houses, they will avoid the problems which have dogged London Docklands. They hope also to avoid the tension between the people who live there now, and those who will move into the thousands of new homes planned over several phases. Up to half the new houses will be social housing. Local residents - some of whom have been unemployed for years - will be trained as construction workers under a joint public/private sector scheme. Discussions are also under way to interest local people in running retail businesses in the planned festival market. The showpiece of the project is planned for the Wilhelmina Pier area. Work has started on the conversion of the former headquarters of the Holland America Line into a hotel, with the financial backing of the city and European Community funds. A large part of the Wilhelmina Pier area, in total 125 hectares, will be given over to the construction of offices. The area has already has been dubbed 'Manhattan on the Maas' by the local press, although the City authorities are playing down the tone of extravagant development which this comparison suggests. A private sector consortium was recently appointed to conduct a study on setting up the master plan for the Wilhelmina Pier phase. Laing Management Holdings, a British group, is lead manager; French construction group SAE will contribute development expertise; and MBO, a Dutch group, will be advising on financial and development matters. Construction in the Wilhelmina Pier area is planned to start in 1995, by which time communications infrastructure is scheduled to be in place  - essential if the scheme is to attract private sector backing. The Hop van Zuid project will kick off with the construction of offices to house the tax, district court and judiciary; work will start next year. Hop van Zuid has its critics: many say there is too much office space in a city where the greater need is for replacement of existing stock; there is too much provision for private housing; and too much money is being spent on the bridge. Dutch financiers are taking a wait and see attitude. They will want to test the area's ability to attract tenants for the private sector built offices before making a commitment. The logic of the project in terms of overall city planning, however, is impressive.</p>

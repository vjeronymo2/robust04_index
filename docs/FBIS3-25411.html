In reality its purpose is to bribe  ANC leaders so that it can scale down the South African weapons  industry, with a view to eventually closing it down as soon as  the ANC comes into power. This will be done despite the threat  of large-scale unemployment and the security risk coupled to  such a move. The Pentagon has already sent similar missions to  South American countries, where accusations were immediately  leveled against the Pentagon, that it tries to bribe state  leaders in more or less subtle ways to give preference to  American interests.    The eight-man delegation to South Africa consists of the  U.S.  Assistant Defense Secretary Charles Freeman, his deputy Jim  Woods, representatives of the American chiefs of staff and from  the American "European commandment" which also covers South  Africa, as well as a representative of American military  intelligence. The Pentagon explains that the aim of this  mission is to assist the ANC leaders to apply the integration  policy in the army, to restructure the various army divisions,  and in general to encourage "intellectual discussion" between  ANC leaders and American officials. The background to this is  that the American Congress has made drastic cuts to the military  budget, which also affects military assistance.    President Clinton is apparently following a policy  supporting  democracy worldwide, not only verbally but also financially.  This policy is aimed at opening the way to promoting American  exports. South Africa and its military and political leaders can  expect certain "advantages" from Americans if they help the  American weapons industry to get contracts in South Africa. The  U.S. weapons industry apparently sees great possibilities in  post-apartheid South Africa, according to Freeman.    He especially referred to American area detection  technology,  a field in which South African industrial research has made  significant progress. The Pentagon wants this research to be  discontinued so that information agents in the American Embassy  in Pretoria can determine, over the same network, exactly where  South African naval vessels and air force aircraft are  operating. Observers warn that the objective of spying is never  far from the thoughts of any member of any American mission  visiting South Africa. What is new is Clinton's plan to make  South Africa pay for this by scaling down its weapons industry.</p>

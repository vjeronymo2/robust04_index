			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH SHOT IN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AT MOTEL  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy was shot early Saturday by an innkeeper during a failed  robbery attempt at an Anaheim motel. The teen-ager and an alleged accomplice  were arrested a short time later, police said.  </P> <P> The wounded youth was not identified.  </P> <P> Police arrested Alvaro Taboada Jurive, a 21-year-old unemployed laborer from  Anaheim, on suspicion of commercial robbery.  </P> <P> According to Sgt. Greg Mattis, police were summoned to the Admirals Cove Motel  in the 100 block of West Ball Road at 2:17 a.m. Someone reported shots being  fired into the motel, Mattis said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Officers who arrived at the motel were told -- apparently through interviews  with the innkeeper or witnesses -- that motel manager Jim Chung, 48, of Anaheim  had exchanged gunfire with two robbers, who fled west on Ball Road after  failing to steal any money.  </P> <P> Mattis was patrolling that area and stopped a car in which the youth and Jurive  were traveling on Cerritos Avenue. Chung subsequently identified the pair as  his assailants, according to police. A sawed-off rifle allegedly used by the  suspects was found in the car.  </P> <P> Chung could not be reached for comment. Officer John Oldroyd said he did not  know the youth's name or what type of weapon with which he was wounded.  </P> <P> Officials at UCI Medical Center in Orange, where the teen-ager apparently was  taken for treatment, declined to comment on his condition.  </P></p>

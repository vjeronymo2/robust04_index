			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Fine Tuning - Concert that is, music that employs some non-standard intervals between notes, smaller or larger than our 'equal-tuning' system accommodates - was what James Wood gave us in the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday, with his New London Chamber Choir and an ensemble from his Centre of Microtonal Music. (This concert is going on tour for the Arts Council's Contemporary Music Network; see below.) Microtones include, for example, 'blue notes' in jazz, and certain notes in various folk-music scales (or modes, or Indian raga) that are too sharp or flat to be represented on a modern pianoforte. In the 'Fine Tuning' programme, every piece either had pre-tuned instruments or used microtonal slides for colouristic effects. Kevin Volans' 1982 suite White Man Sleeps plays the ethnic card with its two harpsichords and its viola da gamba, a sort of cello with frets, pre-tuned to African modes. For some time, that seems to be the only piquant thing about its gentle dances; but a gamba solo with soft drums develops more inwardly, and later the composer begins to invent rhythmic patterns and counterpoint beyond anything in the original material. 'Unacceptably Germanic,' he now thinks (he wrote the suite while studying with Stockhausen in Cologne) - but without those twists the piece would be little more than a curio. Yliam for ten female voices, by the eccentric recluse Giacinto Scelsi (1905-88), explores the disconcerting effects of microtonal slides within sustained, almost motionless harmony. It freezes one's attention for its six minutes. For a dozen mixed voices, the 1968 Nuits of Iannis Xenakis is a dramatically varied cry of painful sympathy for political prisoners; as often with Xenakis, the raw punch that it packs overwhelms any doubt about whether it is music, exactly. Jonathan Harvey's recent Valley of Aosta (after an apocalyptic Turner canvas) conjures up wild aural vistas, using its microtones - pre-tuned on harps and synthesisers - to misdirect any ear hoping to find a clear harmonic path through the music. We surrender to the radiant, mercurial colours. Through them, the two synthesisers cast sharp-focus streams of bright, even notes - but they are tuned a quarter-note apart. Wood's own Phainomena, premiered a year and a half ago but much revised last summer, earns its right to serve as climax for the programme. Though he is a prolific composer as well as conductor and percussion virtuoso, Wood's earlier pieces have been distinguished chiefly by ingenuity and eclectic resource. The extreme, pungent contrasts in Phainomena are theatrical as could be - but dramatic music, not music-theatre. It sounds like a composer discovering his own cogent means to a strong, original purpose, rich and strange. Further performances: Oxford, Nov 19, Leicester, Nov 20 and Huddersfield, Nov 21</p>

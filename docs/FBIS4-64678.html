			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Andreas </F> Unterberger; place and date not given: "Alois Mock: `Net  Payers Benefit Most From the European Union'"]    [Excerpt] [Unterberger] One of the most frequent  accusations against European Union [EU] membership is that we  will be net payers and will therefore pay more in than we get  out.    [Mock] As far as I know, Germany is the only founding  country  that has been a net payer right from the beginning. However,  the Germans recognize that they benefit most. I am often asked:  "If we are net payers now, we will hopefully also be net  receivers at some time in the future." I always answer to that:  "Yes, when we are poor."    [Unterberger] Why do net payers benefit most?    [Mock] The net payers have a very dynamic economy and,  therefore, they can get the maximum out of the large market.    [Unterberger] The Greens say that it will be the end of  neutrality if we join the EU.    [Mock] Of course, this is wrong. Neutrality derives from  what is set down in our neutrality law. This law is fully  compatible with the rights and duties that we take over as a  result of membership. This is the opinion of the government, it  is the opinion of all experts, with the exception of one, who  has registered doubts regarding the issue of economic sanctions.  This is also the view of Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland.    [Unterberger] And how will the special problem of economic  sanctions be solved?    [Mock] I am of the view that the issue of sanctions was only  part of neutrality policy (which is not settled by the  Constitution -- the editor). Neutrality is reflected in certain  regulations, from the penal code to the Military Materiel Law.    [Unterberger] Thus, these application laws must be amended?    [Mock] Yes, either one amends these laws or one clarifies  matters from a constitutional perspective. However, in case of  doubt I prefer the former, which means that things would be done  similarly to what was done in the case of Iraq and Kuwait.    [Unterberger] When we permitted overflights on the basis of  UN decisions in January 1991?    [Mock] Yes.    [Unterberger] If all goes well, you will sit at a table with  12 or 15 other ministers on 2 January 1995 What is your  priority, what are our goals with regard to a common foreign and  security policy?    [Mock] My priority is to contribute to making a common  foreign and security policy a reality in the first place,  because the more quickly it is established, the more effective  it will be. In terms of content, it is certainly the issue of  the former Yugoslavia that is a priority, where it is important  to bring about at least a cease-fire. Then there is the issue  of a coherent policy toward Central and Eastern Europe and of  partnership with the United States and Canada. These are the  priorities.    Even though it is not a priority, it is also important to  show through relations with the developing countries that we are  not just an egotistical association. And then there is, of  course, the East Asia-Pacific area, which is already a focal  area in international economic relations.    [Unterberger] Will you be able to vote freely in a common  foreign and security policy and in the EU Council of Foreign  Ministers, which is the most important body of the EU, or are  you bound by a mandate from Vienna?    [Mock] In my view, if things are not settled differently, I  am politically responsible to the Austrian parliament, just as I  am obligated to turn to the Austrian Government, if the matter  at hand is something that has to be discussed by the government.

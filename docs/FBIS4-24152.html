			<p>BFN     [Text] African National Congress Secretary General Cyril  Ramaphosa has announced a wide range of measures to adapt the  ANC to its new role as the senior partner in the South African  Government. The measures include retrenchments of ANC head  office staff, the opening of a Cape Town headquarters, and  restructuring the organization to prepare it to play a role in  implementing the Reconstruction and Development Program. Mr.  Ramaphosa said the ANC's finances were also under scrutiny and  that levies were being imposed on its paid public  representatives to help finance the organization.</p>

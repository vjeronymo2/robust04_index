The delegate of the measure committee for compensations to  the "comfort women for the army" and victims of the Pacific war  said that all documents and materials concerning the "comfort  women for the army" were carried to Japan at the time of its  defeat. "The attempt of the present Japanese Government to keep  its past crimes in darkness, while concealing all the materials  in its possession, is a mockery of human conscience and an  insult to the victims," he said.    The delegate demanded that Japan open all the materials on  the crimes to the public, punish the criminals by law and make  sincere compensations to the human rights victims.    The delegate of the World Council of Churches said that  sexual enslavement by the Japanese Army, an encroachment upon  human conscience and morality, can never be overlooked.    He demanded that Japan sternly punish those responsible for  the issue of "comfort women for the army" and make proper  compensations to the victims. He called upon all the  non-governmental organisations to join in the cause of defending  human morality and conscience with a united action.    The delegate of the International Fellowship of  Reconciliation demanded that the Japanese Government bear  responsibility for the grave crimes against mankind and take  practical measures for a fair solution of the problem.    Kim Won-ung, democratic member of the South Korean "National  Assembly," charged that the South Korean authorities and the  Japanese Government were taking an insincere and deceptive stand  toward the settlement of the problem of "comfort women for the  army".    He said the "comfort women" issue denotes a heinous and  inhumane war crime and criticized the attempt of the Japanese  Government to hush it up.</p>

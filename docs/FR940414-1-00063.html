			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The median active ingredient concentrations are assumed to reasonably reflect what is likely to be found in the wastewater. To check this, comparison was made of the calculated load of the commingled waste streams based on the median concentration values and the actual loading observed in the wastewater samples at two sampled facilities. The two values were reasonably close.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The active ingredient treatability data used in the cost model were principally taken from the pesticide manufacturers data base or from treatability studies as described previously under the discussion of data transfers. The following methodology was applied: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Active ingredients with pesticide manufacturing BAT technologies of hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, or activated carbon adsorption (the technologies used in the ``Universal Treatment System'') were assumed to be treated by these technologies in the cost model, to the same effluent concentrations set under the manufacturing rulemaking (58 FR 50637). This assumption results in conservative cost estimates since the sampling data from the PFPR facilities that are treating to recycle their wastewater sometimes had higher concentrations of pollutants in their treated wastewater than the manufacturing limits would have allowed, yet they still reuse their treated wastewater in various non-interior process related uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For pesticide active ingredients (PAIs) that have pesticide manufacturing limitations which are based on one of the UTS technologies (i.e., activated carbon, hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, chemical precipitation), achievable effluent concentrations were based on LTA concentrations from data derived from the development of the pesticide manufacturing effluent limitations guidelines. When pesticide manufacturing limitations existed but were not based on one of the UTS technologies mentioned above, treatability data for one of the UTS technologies was used to back up the manufacturing LTA concentration. When pesticide manufacturing limitations did not exist, EPA transferred LTA concentration data within strutural groups (using the highest LTA in the strutural group). When there was no LTA for any PAI within a given strutural group, EPA transferred the 90th percentile highest LTA, which means that 90% of the PAIs with manufacturing limits have LTAs less than the transferred limit. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Active ingredient analytical methods and associated costs were used to calculate effluent monitoring costs for each facility. The analytical methods and costs were obtained by: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Using the actual methods and costs, obtained from laboratories' rates, for those active ingredients for which EPA has approved methods;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Using the same method(s) as for structurally similar active ingredients for the active ingredients without approved methods. In cases where more than one method is available for structurally-similar active ingredients, the most expensive method is used to calculate costs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Using an average monitoring cost of $200 for those active ingredients lacking analytical methods for structurally-similar active ingredients. This cost assumes that a method would become available, and is based on the cost analytical laboratories have charged EPA to analyze for pesticide active ingredients in EPA's sampling program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimated costs for monitoring active ingredient concentrations for Options 1,2,3 and 3/S. Option 3 and 3/S (and 3S.1) would not require monitoring of pollutant concentrations to demonstrate compliance. However, the Agency assumes facilities may monitor wastewater after treatment and before recycling or reusing it to ensure it has been adequately treated. To be conservative EPA has assumed all facilities will incur this monitoring cost. In actuality, many facilities do not perform analyses to determine active ingredient concentrations. However, they usually do perform some type of quality check. It can vary from visual inspection to measuring a parameter such as density, COD or TSS to actually measuring the concentration of the active ingredient as done by some large facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimated the number of days each facility discharged in 1988 as well as the number of days each facility would discharge under the proposed regulatory options. Because the number of discharge days was not provided by pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in the questionnaire, EPA estimated 1988 discharge days based on the number of days that facilities operated their individual pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging lines in 1988. Facilities reported the number of days each line was used to produce pesticide products in 1988 and which months each line was in operation, but did not report the total number of days that the entire pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facility was in operation. In order to account for overlap when a facility operated multiple lines producing pesticide products during the same days, EPA compared the total number of days reported for all pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging lines at each facility with 22 days per month for each month the facility was in operation (assumes most facilities operated five days per week). EPA then selected the smallest of these estimations to be the number of discharge days. For the two proposed discharge options, facilities are assumed to discharge wastewater, at a minimum, once per each calendar quarter that they are in operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See Section 8 of the Technical Development Document for a detailed discussion of the engineering and technical analysis that is the basis of the cost estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments Whose Principal Business Is Retail Sales (Subcategory E)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is today proposing to establish pretreatment standards for refilling establishments that repackage agricultural pesticide products based on achieving zero discharge of wastewater pollutants to POTWs. Using the same approach to evaluating the pass through of wastewater pollutants as is discussed for Subcategory C, EPA expects that the pesticide active ingredient pollutants present in process wastewaters from refilling operations will pass through POTW's. As with pass through analysis for Subcategory C, an optimistic estimate of 50 percent removal of active ingredients using well-operated secondary treatment at POTWs does not come close to matching 100 percent removal achieved by the proposed BAT level treatment. As with Subcategory C, EPA assumes that the active ingredient will always be present in the wastewater from refilling establishments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The best available technology identified for this proposal is secondary containment of bulk storage areas and loading pads, plus the collection and holding of rinsates, contaminated stormwater and leaks and spills. The Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs has proposed a regulation under FIFRA that would require refilling establishments for agricultural pesticides to build secondary containment structures and loading pads to certain specifications (59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994). Of the estimated 1134 facilities (based on the 1988 survey) that would be affected by today's proposal, EPA's questionnaire responses indicate that 98 percent or an estimated 1101 already achieve zero discharge, primarily by holding contaminated wastewater and reusing it as make-up water. Thus, this practice not only eliminates the discharge of wastewater but also allows the facility to recover the value of the product in the wastewater. The average volume of wastewater discharged by refilling establishments is estimated to be 78 gallons per year per facility. EPA assumes volumes of this magnitude can be held in a minibulk container until such a time as it can be reused. EPA estimates the cost of a minibulk container to be about $300 capital investment. EPA finds the costs are economically achievable (see Section XIV).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XIII.

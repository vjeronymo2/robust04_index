			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hsia Yu-ping (1115 7183 1627): "Deng Returns to Beijing </F> in February and Continues To Play Bridge With Wang Daming"]    [Text] The "Basic Contingent" at Deng's Home    Bridge is a game that calls for testing the intelligence of  four people. Hence, Deng Xiaoping must have partners for the  game. He has two generations of partners. The older generation  includes Zhang Zhixiang, Wan Li, and Wu Han, and the younger one  includes Ding Guangen, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Daming. The latter  group has played bridge with him since the early 1960's.  Although quite a few people have played bridge with Deng  Xiaoping, most have been "troops disappearing like running  water." Only the setup of Deng Xiaoping, Ding Guangen, Wang  Hanbin, and Wang Daming has lasted long and remained stable, so  they are called by Deng's family as the "basic contingent."    As overseas readers are familiar with Ding Guangen (member  of  the CPC Political Bureau, secretary of the Secretariat and head  of the Central Propaganda Department), and Wang Hanbin  (alternate member of the Political Bureau and vice chairman of  the National People's Congress Standing Committee), this article  is intended to give an account of Wang Daming.  <H5>  Wang Daming Made an Appearance in Hong Kong </H5>   Wang Daming showed up in Hong Kong in mid-December 1993.  Tall and thin, with gray hair, Wang carries a distinctive air  of the academic in his speech and deportment. He led a  delegation visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of chairman of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]  Beijing Municipal Committee. His purposes in visiting Hong Kong  were, among other things, to meet old friends, make new friends,  and discuss with relevant parties the issue of electing  additional members to the CPPCC committee in Beijing.    Originally, he wanted his visit to Hong Kong to be a low  profile one, and to try to avoid causing a sensation as much as  possible. Unexpectedly, however, he was followed with  increasingly keen interest during his eight-day visit to the  territory. Of course, it has something to do with his personal  style, as he is free from bureaucracy, straight forward,  sincere, resourceful, and easily wins people's confidence.  Perhaps it may also have had something to do with the  particular background of his intimacy with Deng's family,  because the latest information about Deng Xiaoping's health that  he brought with him was, no doubt, regarded as specially  important by various sectors in Hong Kong, who pay close  attention to the CPC's political situation.    Wang Daming was asked about Deng Xiaoping's health on many  occasions and denied all the false reports concerning Deng's  health by telling the questioners that "he had played bridge  with Deng Xiaoping only recently." Besides, he disclosed some  details known to few outsiders: Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, which contains 116 articles and was  published a short time ago, was personally examined and approved  by Deng Xiaoping article by article during the hot summer. Wang  Daming said emphatically: "It is entirely impossible for an old  man of nearly 90 to examine and approve in person every article  he wrote if he is in poor health."  <H5>  Playing Bridge Was a Must Required by Underground Work </H5>   Wang Daming is from Beijing and is three to four years  younger than Ding Guangen and Wang Hanbin. He came from a poor  worker's family and graduated from the machinery department of  the Beijing Advanced Industrial School in 1948. He joined the  underground Communist Party when he was a student and learned to  play bridge while doing underground work. The cards were used  to conceal their activities when something happened during their  gatherings. When the people's republic was founded in Beijing,  Wang worked on the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist  Youth League [CYL]. Later, he was transferred to work in the  Policy Research Center of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee in  1953, holding the position of deputy head of the industrial  group of the committee.    His career during this period was connected with that of  Wang  Hanbin. In this same period, Wang Hanbin held the position of  head of the university section of the Beijing Municipal CYL  Committee. Afterward, he transferred to the post of deputy  director of the Policy Research Center of the Beijing Municipal  CPC Committee. During leisure time after work, the common hobby  of playing bridge has made them well-coordinated partners for  the game.    In 1961, Wang Hanbin worked with Deng Xiaoping in Shunyi  County on the outskirts of Beijing to conduct investigations of  agriculture. One day he said to Wang Daming: "Let me take you  to play bridge." In this way, Wang Daming played bridge with  Deng Xiaoping for the first time in a senior cadres' club on  Yangfengjia Road, thus cementing his friendship with Deng  Xiaoping over the bridge table for the past 33 years.  <H5>  Arrangements for Deng Xiaoping's Life After His Retirement </H5>   At first, playing cards with Deng Xiaoping was kept strictly  confidential, and the card players used the password "on duty"  to make appointments for playing the game. Wan Li's secretary  would act as an organizer by advising Wang Daming on the phone:  "You are on duty this evening." During that time, Wang Daming  had to be on duty three times a week on average, and very often  he spent his holidays at the card table with Deng Xiaoping.    They played cards in the senior cadres' club on Yangfengjia  Road before the Great Cultural Revolution. After Deng Xiaoping  was rehabilitated in 1974, some people suggested setting up a  senior cadres' club again, but Deng Xiaoping did not agree.  Therefore, the card table was moved into Deng's home, and Wang  Daming and other friends have played cards there ever since.    According to an insider, the arrangements for Deng  Xiaoping's life after he retired to the second line are: Seeing  a film one night, and playing mahjong three nights and bridge  three nights. He plays mahjong with family members, but he  has to invite friends to play bridge. For this reason, Deng  Xiaoping's wife Zhuo Lin particularly called them and said:  "Comrade Xiaoping has some trouble -- he is always thinking  about things and will never stop thinking. It is only when he  is playing cards that his attention can be diverted a while.  That is why playing cards is the best way for him to take a  rest." She thanked them very much for the time they had  sacrificed.    According to Wang Daming's observation, the reason Deng  Xiaoping is able to keep fit lies in his persistence in swimming  and playing bridge, as these activities have done a lot of good  for him. Last year, the doctor advised him to give up swimming  because of old age, but he goes on playing bridge, usually twice  a week.  <H5>  Discipline Is Enforced at Deng Xiaoping's Card Table </H5>   At Deng Xiaoping's card table, this discipline is enforced  --  no discussion about politics. Wang Daming recalled that there  were exceptions on a few occasions. For example, it was some  time in the 1960's when Deng Xiaoping returned from the  controversy between the CPC and the CPSU. As everybody was  anxious to know the result of the negotiations, they asked him  about it while playing cards with him, and he just made some  brief remarks regarding the matter.    Wang Daming said: "For many decades he has so trusted me  that I can take liberty to go about his house at will. A very  important point is -- I can observe discipline." Despite the  ever-changing situation in Beijing and the personal ups and  downs of his official career these years, he always kept silence  before Deng Xiaoping and refrained from "saying this and that,  and talking about right and wrong." In fact, had he ever spoken  to Deng Xiaoping about his career future, he might have had a  better official life than he has now.    In the early 1980's, Wang Daming took up the position of  director of the Economic Commission in Beijing. His ideas on  reform are clear. In a survey on changing tracks and finalizing  the pattern in enterprises, which was conducted in 1983, Wang  Daming pointed out that "enhancement of economic results should  depend on people with clear minds." Hu Yaobang appreciated his  views very much and gave written instructions to this effect:  "I agree with the views of Wang Daming from Beijing. In the  previous reorganization of enterprises, we failed to grasp this  crucial part, but this time he has hit the vital point."  Shortly afterward, Deng Xiaoping also said that the opinion of  Wang Daming from Beijing was right because economic results in  enterprises could not be enhanced if they did not have people  with clear minds.  <H3>  He Took Up the Post as Chairman of CPPCC Beijing Municipal  Committee in 1993 </H3>   In 1986, Hu Yaobang named Wang Daming as the person to be  appointed as deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC  Central Committee. Deng Liqun was in charge of ideology at that  time. However, before Wang Daming was able to display his  ability, he returned to Beijing [as published] because of  illness in 1987. Since then, Wang Daming has been down on his  luck. Li Ximing, former secretary of Beijing Municipal CPC  Committee, assigned him the post of vice chairman of the CPPCC  committee. During the ensuing five years, he was engaged in  doing study and investigation work, making quite a few valuable  proposals on major economic issues, and blazing a trail for the  CPPCC to participate in the deliberation and administration of  state affairs. In 1993, he took up the position of chairman of  the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee and eventually reentered  the power center in Beijing. But, five years had passed, after  all, and he was already 62.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping Is Particularly Punctual </H5>   Wang Daming is deeply impressed by some minor incidents at  the card table. He said: "Deng Xiaoping shows great respects  for others." It happened in those days when they played cards  at the club on Yangfengjia Road. One day, it was approaching  the appointed time when Deng Xiaoping suddenly called to say  that he would be late as he had something to attend to. Wang  Daming and other comrades thought that Deng would come very  late, otherwise he, being a big shot, would not have to phone  them to revise the appointment. Hence, they felt relieved and  went to take a bath. To their great surprise, Deng Xiaoping  arrived in a quarter of an hour, so everyone was in a hurry to  put on clothes. "Later, we got to know that he was particularly  punctual," said Wang Deming, "whenever we made an appointment to  play cards, he would be waiting for us at the table a couple of  minutes ahead of schedule."    Deng Xiaoping is very easy-going at the card table, so we  never feel nervous playing cards with him. Someone always wins  and loses in the contest, and Deng Xiaoping certainly tries his  utmost to win. But, if he is in an inferior position, no one  will give ground to him. Sometimes he discards a wrong card,  and Ding Guangen and Wang Hanbin criticize him bluntly: "You  are wrong to discard this one. Do you not know which card you  should discard?" Deng Xiaoping listens with respectful  attention.    In playing bridge, it is impossible to avoid making  mistakes, but people making fewer mistakes will defeat those who  make more. Wang Daming believes that Deng Xiaoping likes  playing bridge because he thinks the game can train people's  thinking and judgment. Moreover, the principle of seeking truth  from facts is particularly stressed in playing bridge. If the  cards in one's hand are poor, one must not blindly raise the  stake.    "Comrade Xiaoping's skill in cards is quite good among the  retired veteran comrades," said Wang Daming in assessment. This  basic contingent of the four abovementioned people has won a  number of championships in many amateur competitions.  <H5>  There Are Two More Staff Officers in Deng's Family </H5>   Over the past few years, there have been two more staff  officers at the card table since the basic contingent started to  play cards at Deng's home. Deng Pufang and Deng Nan used to sit  behind their father to watch him play, and sometimes they made  suggestions by giving him some pointers. During a bridge game,  Deng Nan would yell to Ding Guangen, criticizing that he had  discarded a wrong card, and Deng Pufang would add color and  emphasis to fan the flames. With all the talking and laughing,  the room was suddenly permeated with a lively atmosphere.    Wang Daming said he liked the harmonious affection in Deng's  family. Sometimes Deng's grandson would run into the room to  lean over his grandfather, and Deng would lovingly give him a  kiss. If they played for a long time, Deng Xiaoping would  invite them to dinner. The dishes for dinner are very simple,  just like those of ordinary families, and the supper is simple  as well. A small plate is laid before each person, in which  there were a few slices of apple or orange.    When Deng Xiaoping is away from Beijing, Wang Daming  sometimes accompanies him for a short period. During his south  China tour in 1992, it happened that Wang Daming was leading a  group of Beijing CPPCC committee members to emulate the  experience in Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Upon arrival in  Shenzhen, Wang Daming went to call on Deng Xiaoping who arrived  a day earlier, and told Deng about his impression of the south.  He said that the reform situation was favorable and the  socialist factors had increased. At the end of last year,  before going to Shanghai to spend the winter, Deng Xiaoping  asked him whether he could go along. As Wang Daming was busy  with official duties in his important position as chairman of  the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee, he was unable to leave  Beijing, but promised to pay a New Year call to the respected  old man after the Spring Festival and have a happy gathering at  the card table.</p>

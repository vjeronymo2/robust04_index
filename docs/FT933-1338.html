			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Observer: Mandarin speak Now that Wendy Pritchard is working roughly one day a month to develop the Treasury's fusty management habits, expect a rash of orders from nervous mandarins for her book, Changing the Essence. Written last year with long-time collaborator Richard Beckhard, the volume is brimming with tips to big organisations on how to change their cultures, garnered from her experience advising the likes of Shell and Lloyds Bank. If the Treasury takes this advice, it can look forward to turning itself into a 'learning organisation, with policies and practices that support this stance'. Meanwhile, permanent and deputy secretaries have the prospect of becoming 'deeply committed to personal leadership of change programs consciously designed to create the organisation's best future'. The advice to create 'a superior ability to sense signals in the environment' presumably betrays a deep understanding of the importance of improving the Treasury's forecasting record.</p>

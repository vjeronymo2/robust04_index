			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jammu and Kashmir governor, General Krishna  Rao, met the prime minister and the home minister in New Delhi.  He is understood to have discussed with them measures to  improve the situation in the state.    In Kashmir valley, militants shot dead a former MLA [member  of legislative assembly], Mr. Ghulam Qadir Mir, last evening at  his residence at village (Uran) in Pulwama District. An  associate of late Sheikh Abdullah, Mir is the 11th former  legislator to be killed by militants in the last four years.  Meanwhile, two militants have been killed and 16 arrested  during the last 24 hours. A large quantity of arms and  ammunition was recovered from them.    The Indian ambassador to the United States, Mr. Sidhartha  Shanker Ray, has said the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to  India is legal, final, and irrevocable. He said there can be no  compromise on the matter. Addressing the members of the Jammu  Bar Association, Mr. Ray said the seizure of over 10,000 weapons  supplied by Pakistan and the capture of foreign mercenaries is  clear evidence of Islamabad's continuing support to the  militants. He said the U.S. Administration is fully aware of  Islamabad's direct involvement in terrorist activities.</p>

That proposal was prompted by reports that certain PSU printed circuit boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. This action revises the proposed rule by adding a required terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;46&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That NPRM would have required repetitive visual inspections of the PSU printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to detect corrosion and evidence of overheating. If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the circuit board is detected, the proposed AD would have required the repair or replacement of the circuit board. If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the connectors is detected, the proposed AD would have required replacement of the affected connector. The proposed AD would also have required that all findings of corrosion or overheating be reported to the manufacturer. That NPRM was prompted by reports that certain PSU printed circuit boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. That condition, if not corrected, could result in overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that NPRM, the manufacturer has developed a design modification that, if installed, would eliminate the need for the proposed repetitive inspections. De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin 8&hyph;33&hyph;34, dated August 10, 1993, that describes installation of Modification 8/1950. Among other things, this modification entails reworking the PSU to include a new circuit board cover, a modified circuit board mounting, and new wire harnesses. Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has approved the technical content of this service bulletin and has issued revised Canadian AD No. CF&hyph;93&hyph;01R1, dated December 3, 1993, to include the modification described in the service bulletin as terminating action for that AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the FAA has determined that the previously proposed AD must be revised to require the installation of Modification 8/1950 as terminating action for the proposed repetitive inspections of the PSU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This determination to mandate installation of the modification is based on the FAA's finding that long term continued operational safety will be better assured by design changes to remove the source of the problem, rather than by repetitive inspections. Long term inspections may not be providing the degree of safety assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual inspections, has led the FAA to consider placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on design improvements. The proposed modification requirement is in consonance with these considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this change expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

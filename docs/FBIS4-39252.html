			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Illarionov report: "Yet Another Plan"] </F>   [Text] Novosibirsk -- The Novosibirsk Oblast  Administration has drawn up a plan to stabilize the territory's  economic position.    An extensive list of measures has been conceived aimed at  seeking funding to resolve priority tasks in the oblast and to  elaborate mechanisms for state regulation of the economy.    The plan's priorities include the development of  agricultural  production and support for the fuel and energy complex. The  social section of the plan is aimed at preventing mass  unemployment and a decline in living standards.    Scientists and specialists in Novosibirsk and the oblast's  rayons will have to resolve such difficult tasks as organizing  transactions between enterprises and ensuring economic  regulation of food prices.    A science support fund is to be set up.</p>

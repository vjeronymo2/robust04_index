			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal by political parties to Republic of Azerbaijan </F> leadership: "Appeal"]    [Text] To Mr. Geydar Aliyev, president of the Republic of  Azerbaijan; Mr. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Republic of  Azerbaijan National Assembly; and Mr. Suret Guseynov, prime  minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan.    The Azerbaijani economy is in a crisis condition; those  citizens who live only on wages have dropped below the poverty  line. There is no need to comment in detail on the tricky social  and political problems such poverty has caused or may cause. If  the impoverishment of the masses continues at the present rate,  it will eliminate all opportunities for the democratic  development of society and our Motherland's defense capabilities.    The deepening economic crisis and further impoverishment of  the population are processes that run in parallel and are  interrelated. The exacerbation of the economic crisis in  Azerbaijan is caused by both objective and subjective factors.  At the same time, the currently adopted contradictory decisions  are a sign of vagueness of the strategic line in the economy.    Periodic wage increases for the purpose of neutralizing the  tricky problems of impoverishment in the end do not solve the  problem, since the pace of wage increases lags far behind the  pace of increases in the cost of living. Thus, the main burden  of economic decline falls on the shoulders of the low-income  strata of the population, while the persons and state bodies  whose responsibility it is to avert the crisis apparently are  relieved of the need to conduct a firm economic policy. This  situation cannot continue for long, however.    While expressing our concern in connection with the current  situation, we believe it necessary to implement the law on wage  indexation for the purpose of averting a further worsening of  the population's standard of living. This law by itself cannot  help to improve the material situation of those living on earned  wages. By setting up a mechanism for its implementation, it is  possible to freeze the current difficult material situation of  the workers and avert a further worsening of it. If we begin to  implement this law, the persons and structures currently  shirking their responsibility for governing at the expense of a  decline in the popular standard of living will be forced to  conduct decisive, well-thought-out, comprehensive political  reforms.    [Signed] The Azerbaijani Party of Democratic Independence    The "Ana Veten" Party    The Azerbaijani Party of Popular Revival    The Azerbaijani Social-Democratic Party    The Party of Independent Azerbaijan</p>

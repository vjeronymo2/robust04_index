			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Bonds: EIB follows sterling issue with L400bn deal Following its Pounds 200m issue on Tuesday, the European Investment Bank launched a L400bn bond, led by BNL, BCI and Cariplo and fungible with an outstanding L500bn. BNL said the deal met strong demand from institutional and retail investors in Italy and the Benelux countries. There were a number of issues at the short end of the dollar sector, again following recent trends. A Dollars 250m two-year bond, issued by SBC Finance Cayman Islands, a financing company owned by SBC, and priced at 8 basis points above the equivalent US Treasury, was well received according to SBC, which led the issue, with strong demand from Swiss institutional and retail investors. Merrill Lynch also saw good demand from European investors for its Dollars 100m floating-rate note issue, paying a coupon of 20 basis points over three-month Libor. The FRN was the second by Merrill this year. European, Asian and Latin American investors were attracted by a Dollars 65m three-year issue by Credibanco, a Brazilian bank, priced at 430 basis points over the equivalent Treasury and led by Paribas. The issue was planned before the Brazilian government's recent decision to increase the tax on eurobond issues from 3 per cent to 7 per cent. Dealers say the tax increase is unlikely to dissuade new issuers, and point to a number of banks lining up sizeable deals over the next two to three weeks. Hemispheric Funding Corporate Series 1994A, a special-purpose funding vehicle, launched Dollars 300m of floating-rate notes. The issue, led by Goldman Sachs, is guaranteed by Capital Markets Assurance Corporation, a US financial guarantee insurance company which enjoys a triple A rating. Electricite de France made a rare appearance in the euromarkets with a Y30bn deal with a 4 3/4 per cent coupon via Nomura, which said the deal met strong demand in Tokyo, with very few bonds placed in Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 16 May (MENA) -- 'Abbas Zaki, Fatah Central  Committee member, stated that the committee met with PLO Fatah  leader and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat last night. The committee  discussed completing the formation of the Palestinian National  Authority Council and building the authority's institutions in  Gaza and Jericho.    In a statement to MENA in Tunis, Zaki said the committee  also  discussed Fatah's future strategy, because Fatah's role has not  yet ended and because it is responsible for transforming the new  Palestinian entity in Gaza and Jericho into a Palestinian state.    In his statement, the Palestinian official said that the  committee assessed Fatah's future political and practical  policies and the transfer of 1,200 PLO cadres from Tunis to Gaza  and Jericho during the next stage.    Reacting to reports about his appointment as the Palestine  ambassador to Oman, Zaki said that as a member of the Fatah  Movement he is committed to the instructions of the Fatah  leadership, whether inside or outside the territories.</p>

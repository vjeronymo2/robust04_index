			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel and Syria are currently studying a draft  agreement over the Golan Heights. This agreement includes the  security arrangements for each side. This draft agreement is  expected to lead to the signing of a peace treaty between  Damascus and Tel Aviv.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who will be  coming to the region within a few days, will try to bring the  viewpoints of Israel and Syria closer by shuttling between the  two countries. Christopher will also attend the signing ceremony  of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Cairo.    AL-MANAR has learned from high-level diplomatic sources that  the draft agreement includes clauses about the issues of  relations, normalization, and security arrangements. These are:    -- Withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan Heights will  take place in three stages. The first stage includes a  redeployment of Israeli forces. This stage will last two years.    -- U.S. forces will be stationed in strategic positions in  the Golan Heights, and warning stations will be set up there.    -- International observers will be deployed [location not  specified].    -- Settlements in the Golan Heights will be dismantled in  stages. Their inhabitants will be compensated if joint projects  with the Syrians are not set up.    -- Syria will not have the right to dispatch military  forces to the Golan Heights but only a police force equipped  with personal light weapons.    -- An exchange of ambassadors between the two sides will  be announced.    -- There will be U.S. supervision to monitor Syria's  armament.    -- Economic agreements between Damascus and Tel Aviv as  well as joint economic projects in the Golan Heights will be  concluded.    -- Washington will undertake to support the agreement and  its implementation by providing financial aid to Syria and  recognizing Syria's special status in Lebanon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Weekly Remarks" column by Kung Yao-wen (7895 5069 2429): </F> "Strengthen Cooperation, Reduce Trouble"]    [Text] The Washington-based World Bank issued a research  report last Friday [1 April], saying that the U.S. revocation of  China's MFN status would definitely deal a "disastrous" blow to  the economies of both countries. The report, providing a list  of specific figures, pointed out that the U.S. revocation of  China's MFN status would reduce China's exports to the United  States by 42- 96 percent. For example, China's garment exports  to the United States would drop by 50-100 percent. Given the  fact that the Chinese commodities are relatively cheap, U.S.  consumers would have to spend $14 billion more on buying more  expensive substitute commodities each year. The report noted  that the Chinese economy has become increasingly open due to its  growing volume of export trade. It can be said that "China is  much more open than India, Brazil, and even the United States."  Since the World Bank is the world's most authoritative  financial institution, its views are believed to be objective  and pragmatic.  <H5>  China's Stronger International Position </H5>   Recently, personalities in all parts of the world, including  those in the United States, have urged the United States to  renew China's MFN status, expressing the hope that the United  States and China will strengthen cooperation and will jointly  make efforts to safeguard the security of the Asia-Pacific  Region. Thanks to its growing economic strength and stronger  international position, China is playing a more and more  important role in the world. Take, for example, the recent  nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, which has now become the  focus of international attention. Many countries are hoping  that China will play a positive role in defusing this crisis.  As a matter of fact, the statement issued by the UN Security  Council chairman on 31 March, urging the DPRK to cooperate on  the nuclear inspections issue, has embodied China's policy on  the issue, this being the result of China's positive efforts in  this connection.  <H5>  Wide-Ranging Sino-U.S. Cooperation </H5>   China and the United States can no doubt broadly cooperate  with one another economically and through trade. Reports over  the last few days have fully attested to this point. Last  Thursday, official U.S. trade representatives declared: U.S.  exports to China in 1993 increased by $1.3 billion over the  previous year, reaching $8.8 billion. In a national trade  appraisal report submitted to the government, they acknowledged  that China has already taken "significant steps" in fulfilling  "most of its obligations" stipulated in the Sino-U.S. trade  agreement. The report noted that China has also increased the  transparency of its import examination and approval procedures  by a large margin. The day before yesterday, the U.S.  Government announced its decision to lift the ban on the U.S.  companies exporting computer and telecommunications equipment to  China in an effort to obstruct Europe, Japan, and other  countries from acquiring a larger share of the China market.  The decision will probably help to secure contracts worth tens  of billions of U.S. dollars for the United States. Yesterday,  it was reported that the Chinese and U.S. scientists have made a  new breakthrough in medical research cooperation: They have  jointly discovered and developed a liver cancer vaccine, thereby  finding a new cure for this "incurable disease." China and the  United States can indeed cooperate with each other in many  fields.  <H5>  Opposition to Attaching Strings to MFN Status </H5>   The above facts have demonstrated that those who have tried  to engineer the revocation of China's MFN status on the pretext  of human rights and thus undermine the normal relations between  China and the United States are indeed absurd and ridiculous!  It is a pity that such people still exist. In the past, they  tried in every way to obstruct China from obtaining MFN status  or tried to attach strings to China's MFN status. Seeing their  position losing popular support with every passing day, they are  now trying to employ new tactics. They have recently proposed  so-called sanctions against China's "state-run enterprises,"  which constitute nothing but a refurbished version of their  original position. China has already made it clear that MFN  status should be a mutual and unconditional status in bilateral  trade and that China will not accept any strings attached to its  MFN status. We can rest assured that those who advocate  revoking China's MFN status are will find it difficult to  fulfill their goal. U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Garten [jia  teng 0502 3326] once stated: "As far as I know, no official in  the Clinton administration wants to see China's MFN status  revoked." There is no denying the fact that contradictions and  differences exist between China and the United States.  Nevertheless, shared interests make it imperative for the two  countries to cooperate and develop relations with one another.  The governments of the two countries are duty-bound to make  every possible effort to expand cooperation and reduce trouble  between the two countries. I hope that events capable of  dealing a "disastrous" blow to the economies of the two  countries will never take place.</p>

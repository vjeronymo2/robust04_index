			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / The Review's aims The future role of nuclear power in electricity supply will depend on it proving competitive while maintaining rigorous standards of safety and environmental protection. The review will not consider whether Sizewell B should be brought on stream. It will, however, take into account the decisions made on Sizewell B, whether the consents are granted or refused. The review will focus on the future prospects for nuclear power. It will examine the economic and commercial viability of new nuclear stations against the background of the government's energy policy. The government has asked the nuclear generating industry to make the commercial case for new nuclear generating capacity publicly available. Whether any new nuclear station could be built with private-sector finance will be a key test of that case. The government invites submissions from interested parties on whether new nuclear power stations offer particular diversity, security of supply and environmental benefits or disadvantages. The review will examine options for introducing private-sector finance into the nuclear industry. The government is prepared to consider representations on whether privatisation would in principle be feasible, and what a practical timescale might be. The review will address the question of how best to manage the substantial nuclear waste and decommissioning liabilities which are currently the responsibility of the public sector, so as to secure value for money for the taxpayer while ensuring necessary safety and environmental standards are met. The review will also assess the existing arrangements to enable the full costs of nuclear power in the UK to be met. Submissions on these issues should be made in writing to the DTI and the Scottish Office by September 30. All substantive submissions will be made publicly available, apart from commercially confidential information, internal papers, advice and internal reports, and advice from external advisers.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Maxwell settlement may be speeded up CITY REGULATORY bodies may use the charges announced on Thursday against Invesco, the fund management group, to help speed up an out-of-court settlement to reimburse pension fund money stolen by Robert Maxwell. The Securities and Investments Board is holding out the prospect of using its powers under Section 61 of the Financial Services Act, which allows it to seek restitution for investors against organisations which have breached investment business rules. It would be empowered under the act to take court action to recover money as a result of the 55 charges announced on Thursday against Invesco by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro). The charges detail breaches of investment regulations. Invesco agreed to pay a Pounds 750,000 fine and Pounds 1.6m in associated investigation and legal costs. By admitting the charges - which included three relating to the Mirror Group pension scheme - it may have strengthened the case of those seeking recoveries through civil action. The charges said that Invesco MIM Management, one of the group's companies, failed to keep Imro properly informed of its concerns about the way in which the pension fund assets under its management were being used. Imro has also passed supporting evidence to back up the charges against Invesco, which could be subject to legal discovery if court action proceeds. But SIB is believed to favour informal efforts co-ordinated by the Maxwell pensions unit, headed by Sir John Cuckney, to reach an out-of-court settlement with Invesco and other City institutions. Mr Charles Brady, executive chairman of Invesco, said his company has not contributed to the unit, which now controls funds to compensate Maxwell pensioners receiving less than their full entitlements. He said: 'We are not in a position to comment on the legal action. We will pursue a solution. We are anxious to put this thing behind us.'</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Shipowner cannot claim for repairs THE BIJELA Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: February 7 1992 GENERAL AVERAGE is not admitted under the York-Antwerp Rules 1974 in respect of temporary repairs for accidental damage carried out in a port of refuge in substitution for permanent repairs which can only be carried out elsewhere, if the cost of permanent repairs would have constituted particular average expenses for which the shipowners alone would be liable, in that they were unnecessary for safe prosecution of the voyage. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when giving judgment for the defendant cargo-owners and their guaranteeing banks, Oswal Steel and others, on a claim by shipowners, Marida Ltd and others, for general average in respect of temporary repairs to the Bijela. HIS LORDSHIP said that by a Gencon charterparty, and bills of lading dated November 14 1985, general average was to be settled in London 'according to York-Antwerp Rules 1974'. The vessel was the Bijela. Her cargo was 25,197 tonnes of shredded scrap loaded at Providence in Rhode Island for carriage to Kandla in India. Shortly after leaving Providence, the vessel grounded and damaged her bottom plating. She put into Jamestown. Temporary repairs were completed by January 26 1986 and she set sail on February 3 1986. She arrived at Kandla on March 8 and, having completed discharge, proceeded to Singapore where permanent repairs were carried out. General average was declared. The initial adjustment allowed various expenses incurred at Jamestown, but not in respect of the temporary repairs themselves. The shipowners were dissatisfied and instructed other adjusters. They published a further adjustment which did make such an allowance. There was no dispute about the facts. The casualty was an accident which occurred without the shipowners' actionable fault. Jamestown was a port of refuge, and the repairs carried out there were temporary repairs of accidental damage effected to enable the adventure to be completed. The damage had not been caused by general average sacrifice, not were the repairs having to be effected for the common safety. There was no problem of damage to cargo nor risk of damage from any discharging or reloading that might prove necessary. In her damaged condition the vessel could not safely leave Jamestown without discharging part of her cargo. Unless repairs were done by using divers, as in fact occurred, the vessel would need to be put into dry-dock. If she were dry-docked all the cargo would have to be removed first. The nearest dry-docks which could carry out the repairs were New York or Boston, New York being the more suitable. The actual cost of the repairs was Dollars 282,606. If permanent repairs had been done at New York, costs would have amounted to Dollars 535,000. The shipowners contended that they were entitled to recover the appropriate proportion of the sum incurred in carrying out the temporary repairs at Jamestown as a substituted expense under the York-Antwerp Rules 1974. Rule F of those Rules provided that any extra expense incurred in place of another expense 'which would have been allowable as general average' was deemed to be general average. Rule X (a) provided that, where a ship entered a place of refuge in consequence of an accident 'which rendered that necessary for the common safety', the expenses of entering the place should be admitted as general average. The second paragraph provided that when a ship was at a place of refuge and was 'necessarily removed' to another place because repairs could not be carried out in the first place, the costs of removal 'including temporary repairs' should be admitted as general average. The second paragraph of rule XIV provided that, where temporary repairs of accidental damage were effected 'to enable the adventure to be completed', the cost of such repairs shall be admitted as general average 'but only up to the saving in expense which would have been incurred and allowed in general average if such repairs had not been effected there'. The shipowners relied on the second paragraph of rule XIV. The issue was whether the expenses in carrying out permanent repairs would have been 'allowable as general average'. The shipowners said they would have been allowable, under rule X. The cargo-owners disputed that. They said that, had the vessel discharged and proceeded to New York for permanent repairs, none of the expenses incurred would have been allowable in general average because the alternative of carrying out temporary repairs to enable the adventure to be completed, or for safe prosecution of the voyage, could be carried out at Jamestown. Where the need to carry out temporary repairs arose, not from general average sacrifice or considerations of common safety, but from a particular average accident, the expense did not as such qualify as general average expenditure (Rule A). The cost of performing the voyage and carrying the cargo to destination was an expense borne by shipowners alone, even if increased by the occurrence of some accident. That was one of the risks a carrier accepted when he entered into the contract of carriage. In the present case, the vessel and its cargo having arrived at port of refuge and being no longer in peril, it was the shipowners' duty to carry out, without unreasonable delay, such repairs as were necessary to carry the cargo to its contractual destination, and to bear the expense of those repairs. The prima facie position was that the expenses of repair were particular average expenses incurred by the shipowners in the course of fulfilling their contractual obligations under the contracts of carriage. The existence of that obligation was not decisive. Many types of general average expenditure were incurred in fulfilment of the master's duties to the interests involved in the common adventure, including cargo-owners. The function of general average was to provide a superimposed scheme for sharing the burden of that expenditure in an equitable fashion. But here one was not involved with a general average act and one had to consider application of the principle in rule F as formulated for the particular situation in the second paragraph of rule XIV. The numbered rule had to be construed taking into account the general principles of the York-Antwerp Rules as stated in the lettered rules. If there was any inconsistency, the wording of the numbered rule prevailed. In the present case there was no inconsistency. The flaw in the shipowners' case was that it disregarded the principle on which substituted expenditure was allowed. Substituted expenditure was not of itself allowable in general average. It only became allowable because it was incurred in substitution for some other expenditure which would have been allowable. Therefore the claim must depend on demonstration that there was some other expenditure which, if incurred, would have been allowable as general average expenditure. That the shipowners could not do. The rule they would have to rely on was rule X and they immediately encountered two insuperable difficulties. First, they could not show that repairs in dry-dock were necessary for safe prosecution of the voyage. All that was necessary for that purpose were the temporary repairs at Jamestown. Second, to bring themselves within rule X the shipowners needed to meet the criterion that the ship was 'necessarily removed' from one place of refuge to another, because repairs could not be carried out in the first place. There was no necessity for Bijela to be removed. All necessary repairs could be carried out at Jamestown. The shipowners could not demonstrate that the alternative course of carrying out permanent repairs in dry-dock in New York would have given rise to any expenditure recoverable under rule X. If they had taken that course, all the resultant expenditure would have been treated as particular average expenditure and would have been borne by them alone. A substitution for a particular average expense would be a particular average expense. The shipowners' claim failed. The initial adjustment was confirmed. For the shipowners: Anthony Clarke QC and Simon Gault (Lloyd &amp; Co). For the cargo-owners: Anthony Hallgarten QC and Steven Berry (Ince &amp; Co).</p>

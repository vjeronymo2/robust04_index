			<p>BFN     [Text] Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer has acquitted [Carabineros  Director] General Rodolfo Stange and other high-ranking retired  Carabineros officers of the charge of nonfulfillment of military  duties in the case involving the three slain Communist leaders  [Manuel Parada, Santiago Nattino, and Manuel Guerrero, who died  with cut throats]. The resolution was taken this afternoon, and  the case is therefore dismissed.    Judge Pfeiffer had instituted proceedings following charges  made by Judge Milton Juica in passing judgment on the murder of  the Communist leaders. Gen. Stange and other members of the top  echelon of Carabineros were among those accused of  nonfulfillment of military duties. The Military Court appointed  Judge Pfeiffer to conduct the inquest. Gen. Stange took a leave  of absence and was given other tasks during the proceedings.  Following the ruling by the Military Court, which confirmed the  decision not to prosecute Gen. Stange, Judge Pfeiffer dismissed  the case and acquitted all the high-ranking Carabineros officers  against whom Judge Juica had brought charges.</p>

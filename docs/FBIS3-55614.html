He  had earlier agreed with Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the  visit would take place on January 11.    Valeriy Tsepkalo, an adviser of the head of parliament, told  INTERFAX that Shushkevich needed more time to analyze the  results of the Moscow visit by a Belarusian government team  headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich.    Shushkevich will go to Moscow by train, which will leave  Minsk late on January 11 and arrive in Moscow early next morning.    Vasily Vorobyov, Shushkevich's press secretary, told  INTERFAX  that Shushkevich would meet with Yeltsin alone behind closed  doors in the Kremlin on January 12.    Shushkevich will leave for Minsk on the same day and give a  news conference there on January 13 about the results of his  meeting with the Russian president.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Sheafbank Property back in the black Sheafbank Property Trust, the property investment and financial services group, turned round from pre-tax losses of Pounds 831,090 to profits of Pounds 19,261 in the half year to September 30. The result was achieved despite a fall in net income from Pounds 344,616 to Pounds 284,003. Losses per share were cut to 0.04p (5.34p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.1p. Although yesterday's results were delayed, they follow just 4 1/2 months after the figures for the year to March 1991. Both delays were caused by board changes and the inclusion of audited information on substantial investments. Mr Frank Ridehalgh, company secretary, said Sheafbank was now 'catching up with itself'. It has changed its accounting period and he hoped results for the 15 months to June 30 would be published by October. The Stock Exchange had been kept informed, he said.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Channel 4 chiefs may challenge 'safety net' levy Channel 4 yesterday served notice that it may try to renegotiate its financial 'safety net'. This system will result in the channel paying Pounds 38.2m to the ITV companies for 1993. The safety net, which was spelt out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, means that Channel 4 has to give to ITV 50 per cent of any advertising and sponsorship revenues earnt above 14 per cent of all UK non-satellite revenues. A further 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund and Channel 4 can keep the rest. In return, if Channel 4 revenues fall below 14 per cent, the channel is compensated first out of the reserve fund and then directly by ITV up to 2 per cent of total revenues. The mechanism, supported by Channel 4 at the time, was designed to help protect the channel's minority programme remit as it sold advertising in competition with ITV for the first time. Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, said his board accepted the principle of the funding formula but it was now providing 'a safety net and subsidy of considerable significance to the more enthusiastic bidders (those that bid high for their franchises) for new Channel 3 (ITV) licences'. Last year Channel 4 audience share rose to just under 11 per cent and advertising and sponsorship revenue reached Pounds 330.1m, 18.2 per cent of total relevant revenue. The windfall will mean a payment of Pounds 5.6m for Carlton Television, Pounds 4.17m for London Weekend, Pounds 5.65m for Central, now controlled by Carlton, and Pounds 4.08m for Granada. The tiny Channel Islands TV company gets Pounds 15,000. 'The continuing support of the board of Channel 4 for the principles of the funding formula will depend on the impact of any further revisions to the act or regulatory rules which may further disadvantage the competitive positioning of Channel 4,' Sir Michael said. He added that money was being taken out of Channel 4 programming budgets at the same time as reports that ITV was reducing its network programme budget. Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission which will receive the money before handing it over to the ITV companies, conceded it appeared strange to have to 'pay your major competitor for your success'. But he added: 'The scheme also provides vital protection to the channel, with its special remit, in tougher years which may lie ahead.' Unless the broadcasting act is changed the present financial rules will stay in place until at least 1997.</p>

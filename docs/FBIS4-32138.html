			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiril Tsochev, deputy prime minister and </F> minister of trade, by Boyka Bashlieva, in Sofia on 15 June: "I  Do Not Expect To Work Miracles, But Welcome the Challenge"]    [Text] [Bashlieva] Mr. Tsochev, minutes after the result  of the vote was announced, Stefan Savov [leader of parliamentary  group of the Union of Democratic Forces] declared that you were  a Communist. Would you characterize yourself as one?    [Tsochev] When on 16 May Professor Berov invited me and I  was asked to stand for the post of trade minister, the first  question that I asked was who was proposing me. The prime  minister answered that I was his candidate and that he had  agreed my candidature mainly with professionals in the field of  foreign trade.    [Bashlieva] Do you know the identities of these  professionals?    [Tsochev] They were not named, but Prof. Berov said that  many of the people whom he had consulted had given, though it is  embarrassing for me to say so, a positive assessment of my work.  The condition that I set was that I do not want any political  force to stand behind me, making me its hostage in the  government of experts that I believe this government represents.    [Bashlieva] Did the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms]  set any conditions for supporting you?    [Tsochev] Certainly not. Our conversation was correct, in  terms of finding out who I was -- where I had worked, what sort  of job I had done, and they were pleased to receive a negative  reply to the question whether I had been in the state security  system. Was I a member of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party]?  Yes, until 1990, since when I have been nonparty.    [Bashlieva] How do you explain that the BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party] parliamentary group did not invite you to meet  them?    [Tsochev] Many of the BSP's economists do not know me.    [Bashlieva] Why did you accept Prof. Berov's invitation to  join his team?    [Tsochev] I find this an interesting challenge. The  know-how that I have acquired in 20 years work in state  government and two years in the private sector gives me grounds  to want to try to do something for Bulgaria. I would not like  to sound immodest, but I come from private business and am  materially secure, although unfortunately I will have to put my  company into deep freeze while I serve as a minister.    [Bashlieva] Is life easier in private business?    [Tsochev] Yes, but my zodiac sign is Aries, so I am the kind  of man who seeks a challenge.    [Bashlieva] You mentioned that you do not expect to work  miracles. Nevertheless, what ambitions do you have as you  accept your ministerial post?    [Tsochev] I have a few ideas, but first of all want to see  what has been done so far in the trade sector. I will meet Mr.  Karabashev [former trade minister] today.    [Bashlieva] Are you prepared to make any assessment of what  he has achieved?    [Tsochev] I do not think I am entitled to do so.    [Bashlieva] Do you have any impressions about the team with  which Mr. Karabashev worked, and are you considering making any  changes to it?    [Tsochev] So far I have not met the team, but I will be  meeting everyone. At this stage I do not intend to dismiss or  appoint anyone. However, this does not mean that anyone who  commits a professional gaffe will not go.    [Bashlieva] What are your initial ideas?    [Tsochev] They relate mainly to the foreign trade sector --  stimulating exports, protecting domestic production, and making  it possible for us to recover our positions in foreign markets.  In a week's time my team and I will announce a two-stage  program -- for the next three months and until the end of the  year.    [Bashlieva] Can you say anything more specific?    [Tsochev] One man does not make a team. Please let me first  hear what the people with whom I am to work have to say.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC), designed to prevent the greenhouse effect which  causes global warming, formally went into effect yesterday.    Since virtually all types of industrial and other commercial  fuel give off carbon gases, South Korea stands to be hit hard by  the convention, especially with the massive number of cars and  conventional heating systems.    The convention, which currently has 51 signatory countries,  is aimed at curbing the emission of carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse gases on a gradual basis throughout the world.    South Korea became a signatory to the convention last  December as the 46th country to do so and the convention, should  it in the near future be regarded as an advanced country, could  pose as a serious problem.    According to officials of the Foreign Ministry's Science  Environment Section, the main cause of global warming has been  identified as carbon dioxide and the convention reflects  advanced countries' eagerness to halt further change in the  climate, especially in terms of temperature.    However, there has already been sharp criticism from  developing countries on pressure for them to join up since they  believe that most of the greenhouse effects have been caused by  advanced countries themselves.    "Although it is difficult to determine who is actually  responsible for the changes in climate resulting from pollution,  chances are that they began long before industrialization  actually began to take place in countries which are currently  classified as developing, including Korea," one official noted.    Developing countries realize that the emission of carbon  dioxide and other greenhouse gases is inevitable in the process  of further industrialization and they have been demanding  differential treatment.    For Korea, however, the problem is not so simple. It is  scheduled to apply for admission to the OECD (Organization for  Economic Cooperation and development) in 1996 and it would have  to express greater willingness to conform to the standards in  advanced countries.    Statistically, the per capita emission of carbon dioxide was  measured at about 1.6 tons in 1990, considerably less than the  2.4 tons in Japan and 5.8 tons in the United States.    Since the convention stipulates that countries in group one,  in which Korea is not yet included, must reduce the level of  emission to that in 1990 by the year 2000, which would be an  enormous task for the government and industry.    The non-law-binding convention seeks to establish the basic  guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gases and deal with  problems relating to the provision of financial and  technological assistance to developing countries.    Advanced signatory countries are obliged to obtain an exact  estimate the existing emission volume of the pertinent gases and  report it to the convention's negotiating committee along with  specific timetable for their reduction.    Developing countries, on the other hand, have a period of  three years to do the same although they have been insisting  that their timetable would depend on the extent of financial and  technological assistance from advanced countries.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Australian trade meets forecasts Exports from Australia fell 3 per cent last month, but an even sharper 4 per cent decline in imports left the current account deficit roughly in line with market expectations. The country registered a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of ADollars 1.257bn (Pounds 540m) in October, up from ADollars 1.077bn the previous month, according to latest official figures. Analysts expressed no surprise at the exports fall: the September figure had been boosted by a high level of gold sales, and the merchandise exports - at ADollars 5.475bn - remains the second highest on record. The fall in imports, down ADollars 217m to ADollars 5.317bn, was also partly explained by the timing of transport equipment deliveries. The seasonally adjusted balance of trade stood at ADollars 158m, up ADollars 48m on the September surplus. Although the data was generally viewed as encouraging, the Australian dollar came under pressure, with Japanese selling blamed. BIS Shrapnel, the economic forecasting firm, also warned that long-term problems may be building up, given the low levels of business investment. 'By the end of 1995, strong growth and supply constraints will produce a surge in imports and a deterioration in the current account deficit to some ADollars 23bn by the end of that year,' it predicted. Opposition parties tried to capitalise on tension between the Australian government and Malaysia over remarks made by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, at the recent Apec conference in Seattle. Mr Alexander Downer, opposition treasury spokesman, said that the prime minister should apologise over his comments about Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. He said that Mr Keating's description of Dr Mahathir as a recalcitrant for not attending the Asia-Pacific summit was putting export trade with Malaysia in doubt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Semiconductor exports are  expected to reach 10.1 billion U.S. dollars this year, or nearly  11.1 percent of total exports, the Korea Semiconductor Industry  Association (KSIA) said on Friday.    Among exports, semiconductors ranked second after textiles  in  1992, but last year semiconductors moved into first at 8.1  billion dollars with textiles following at 7.32 billion dollars.  This year semiconductors will hit 10.1 billion dollars and  textiles 8.2 billion dollars, widening the gap further.    Semiconductors' share of total exports has continued to  expand with the ratio reaching 8.8 percent in 1992, 9.8 percent  in 1993 and 11.1 percent this year. Semiconductors have also  gained in the category of electronics exports as the ratio rose  to 31.6 percent in 1992, 33.1 percent in 1993 and a predicted  36.1 percent this year.    "The world semiconductor market demands more large memory  chips, so exports of semiconductors will rise more than 20  percent a year over the coming several years and semiconductors'  ratio among total exports will jump to 15 percent," a KSIA  official said.    Meanwhile, automobiles ranked ninth among exports in 1992  with 3.6 percent, but rose to eighth in 1993 with 5.4 percent  and will soar to seventh this year with 6.0 percent. But  finished textile goods, which ranked first in 1992 with 9.8  percent, fell to second in 1993 with 8.7 percent and will drop  to third this year with 7.6 percent.    Among exports this year, finished textile goods will hit  third at 6.94 billion dollars after semiconductors and textiles,  followed by home electronic appliances at 6.8 billion dollars,  steel products at 6.2 billion dollars, electronic products for  industrial use at 5.6 billion dollars, automobiles at 5.4  billion dollars, chemical products at 5 billion dollars, ships  at 4.9 billion dollars and general machinery at 3.8 billion  dollars.</p>

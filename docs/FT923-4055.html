			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: IMI IMI might feel a touch piqued about yesterday's 8 per cent fall in its share price. After all, it managed to contain the drop in first half profits to 9 per cent. Capital spending is up 16 per cent to Pounds 24m and, despite a further Pounds 14m in acquisitions, gearing is still only 31 per cent. The share performance, however, has to be taken in the context of a steep run-up over the past month. Assuming full year earnings little changed on last year's 15p, IMI is still trading on a prospective multiple slightly above the market average. The question is whether it boasts sufficient growth prospects to justify such a rating. Parts of its business are highly geared to recovery. But IMI's strength through the recession has been the breadth of its diversification both geographically and in terms of product. That could work against it in a recovery. The company expects to eradicate titanium losses by the end of the year, but revival hopes there must be limited by the weak dollar, the parlous state of the civil aircraft market and falling defence orders. The only real fizz is to be found in drinks dispensers, which is hardly enough to sustain the whole group. Yet, if it persists in rating IMI so highly, the market may be pointing towards a different sort of growth opportunity. IMI could use its own paper to mount a sizeable acquisition - providing a sufficiently attractive target can be found to tempt its innately cautious management.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yefim Logunov: "Russian Diplomacy's View of the </F> CIS; Ambassadors' Conference: Imaginary Threats and Real  Problems"]    [Text] A conference of Russian ambassadors was held in the  press office of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the  discussion of foreign policy toward the CIS and Baltic  countries. The conference was attended by Andrey Kozyrev and a  large group of Russian diplomats, as well as RF Minister of  Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin, Deputy Minister of Defense  Col-Gen Boris Gromov, and other high-level representatives of  Russian ministries and departments, most of them deputy  ministers. They discussed a broad range of military-political,  economic, cultural, humanitarian, and other issues, analyzed the  situation in the CIS and Baltic countries, examined current  developments in the interaction of CIS states in different  spheres, and presented legal assessments of the status of their  fellow-countrymen in neighboring countries.    The speech by the head of the Russian foreign policy  establishment aroused considerable interest. The minister  stressed that the CIS and Baltic states constitute the region of  Russia's primary vital interests and offer colossal  opportunities for the development of friendly and comprehensive  relations. The defense of the rights of Russians in these nearby  foreign countries was called the main strategic objective of  Russian foreign policy. We have recently been able to achieve  considerable mutual understanding with our immediate partners,  including an understanding on the question of dual citizenship.  Andrey Kozyrev called for the heightened effectiveness of  existing and projected mechanisms of economic cooperation within  the CIS framework and a strictly individualized approach in the  creation of common currencies. (The minister did, however,  praise the Russian-Belarusian agreement--Ed.)    The need to maintain the Russian military presence in the  sphere of Russian interests was underscored, but this does not  apply to the Baltic states, although the minister has already  been accused of planning this. This statement has evoked  conflicting responses abroad. Moscow is already being asked for  precise explanations. Washington is angry, and the Baltic states  launched another of their traditional anti-Russian campaigns.  (For the details, see yesterday's edition of SEGODNYA--Ed.)  These worries seem excessive, however. People in Moscow are not  planning to take any kind of unilateral steps in this direction,  without considering the opinions of neighboring states. The  fundamental principle of this kind of military presence is the  mutual interest of the parties. In addition to bilateral  agreements, the law of the Russian Federation "On Defense,"  which allows for the deployment of ground and naval forces  outside Russia with the consent of parliament, can serve as the  legal basis for stationing Russian troops abroad.    Ideas about the problems of the CIS were then expressed by  the Russian ambassadors, military leaders, and officials from RF  law enforcement and financial agencies. All of them agreed that  the Commonwealth is turning into a global factor now that it has  gone through the complex initial phase of its establishment.  They mentioned the diversified system of legal treaties within  the CIS framework. The implementation of the Treaty on  Collective Security has begun. There is a clear desire to  restore the common economic zone on a market basis, but this  will be a slow and gradual process: moving from the simple to  the complex, from a free trade zone to a free market.  Military-technical cooperation is being strengthened. The close  coordination of the operations of foreign trade and customs  agencies has begun. Joint measures have been taken to protect  external borders. The idea of forming a group of collective  forces to keep the peace in "hot spots" in the CIS is arousing  increasing interest. Concern about the Russians in nearby  foreign countries must remain a priority of Russian foreign  policy. The establishment of a special federal agency for the  protection of the interests of these Russians and the  negotiation of a CIS convention on dual citizenship were  suggested. The importance of drafting joint foreign policy  initiatives for international and regional forums was  acknowledged.    Speakers did not ignore the urgent problems of the  Commonwealth. Above all, these are the problems that are common  to all of the new states: the recession, the mounting social  tension, differences in the speed of economic reform, in budget,  credit, and monetary policy, and in economic interests, and the  absence of a single set of economic laws. They mentioned the  attempts to build an economic union at Russia's expense,  although this should be done on an equitable basis. Apparently,  this will not be a simple task. Just in the past year, the CIS  countries have received credits exceeding 500 billion rubles  from the Russian republic budget, and the projected figure was  over 800 billion. The republics still want to buy Russian raw  materials at heavily discounted prices. A single payment union  is essential, but the necessary legal and economic prerequisites  for this are still lacking.    Speakers expressed concern about the vulnerability of  borders, with all of the ensuing negative consequences for  Russia, particularly when citizens of third countries cross the  border. Whereas 12 million people crossed the Russian border in  1913 and 2 million crossed in 1988, the figure last year was 35  million. Under these conditions, how can border security and  border control be instituted? This would call for 500  checkpoints on the border between the Russian Federation and  Kazakhstan, and all of the moral and political implications of  this move also have to be taken into account.    The activities of Russian diplomats in the CIS states were  discussed in depth. Speakers mentioned the inadequate  coordination of the actions of different Russian agencies, and  the arrival of delegations from some CIS countries in Moscow  without the advance notification and consent of the Russian  side. Representatives from the ministries of defense and  internal affairs, however, expressed satisfaction with their  interaction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Speakers mentioned some of the difficulties involved in  finding suitable work and living premises for Russian diplomatic  representatives. In this sense, all of our partners are in a  privileged position in Moscow. The principle of reciprocity  should apply. The atmosphere of the Russian embassies also  leaves much to be desired. There are considerable differences in  wages, because the CIS has its own prestigious and  nonprestigious "spots." All of these difficulties naturally stem  from the insufficiency of funds. After the RF Ministry of  Foreign Affairs submitted its financial requests for embassies  in the CIS in 1994, the RF Ministry of Finance cut the requested  foreign currency allocations by 20 percent and ruble allocations  by 17 percent. The diplomats' subsequent "discussions" with  representatives of that ministry were futile. The financiers in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then promised to find the  necessary funds to extricate our embassies in the nearby foreign  countries from their present pathetic state.</p>

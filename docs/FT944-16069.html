			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Russian central bank chief offers to quit over rouble The chairman of Russia's central bank offered his resignation in a letter to President Boris Yeltsin, at the end of a turbulent week in Russian currency markets. Mr Yeltsin signed a decree formally relieving Mr Boris Gerashchenko of his post. The state Duma (lower house of parliament) had been due to vote on an earlier presidential request to remove Mr Gerashchenko next Wednesday, and there was confusion following Mr Yeltsin's decree on whether it would still be debated. The news was greeted by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former reformist finance minister, who wants Mr Gerashchenko's job, with the comment: 'There's evidently still a God in heaven.' The rouble, which fell heavily early in the week, strengthened further yesterday after a recovery on Thursday, rising 6 points to end the day at 2,988 to the dollar. However, the market remained jumpy: Mr Igor Doronin, the marketing adviser to the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, said the central bank had deliberately run the currency down this week and warned that a further crash could destroy the exchange. Mr Fyodorov's delight at the offered resignation of his long-time opponent contrasted with statements from Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice group, who said Mr Gerashchenko was 'right to take responsibility on himself', and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko group, who said that he had acted 'like a real man'. The candidates for Mr Gerashchenko's chair would include Mr Fyodorov, Mr Dmitri Tulin, a bank deputy chairman with a good reputation with western banks, and Ms Tatyana Paramanova, also a deputy chairman, noted for refusing credits. The move comes as the government prepares for talks with the International Monetary Fund, whose team arrives today. The talks centre on a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) fund to stabilise the currency, and the IMF will press for detailed and closely monitored monetary and fiscal dealings. It does not intend to support a budget for 1995 unless the government's aims include reducing inflation to about 3 per cent or lower a month, and achieving a budget deficit of about 5 per cent of gross national product next year - compared with a present level of about 11 per cent. Mr Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and former Russian government adviser, said yesterday that 'whatever happened this week, the basic reason is that the government has not put in place clear rules of the game - and so the power of a few insiders to stop reform is still too great'.

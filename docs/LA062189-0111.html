			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Court Orders Manischewitz Vote Delay: An Ohio state court ordered B.  Manischewitz Co. to postpone until June 30 a shareholder vote on a Beverly  Hills investment firm's $40.1-million takeover offer. The vote was scheduled  for Thursday. The delay -- the result of a lawsuit filed by a dissident  shareholder of Manischewitz -- will give National Foods Inc. more time to nail  down financing for its own $43.3-million bid for the Jersey City, N.J.,  company. However, if the plaintiff fails to post a $100,000 bond by this  afternoon, the meeting will proceed as planned, according to Levine, Tessler,  Leichtman &amp; Co., the Beverly Hills firm whose bid has already been approved  by Manischewitz's board.  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Watmoughs ahead to Pounds 7.91m - New contracts in UK and progress at Hungarian arm fuel the advance Contracts to print the Daily Telegraph's TV &amp; Radio Guide and The News of the World's colour supplement helped Watmoughs (Holdings), the Bradford based printer, to lift interim pre-tax profits by 24 per cent. They increased from Pounds 6.37m to Pounds 7.91m in the six months to end-June on sales 26 per cent ahead at Pounds 82.7m (Pounds 65.5m). Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the UK had performed better than expected, with overall demand improving in addition to the new contract work. The Hungarian subsidiary had progressed in line with expectations, while the Spanish arm, which came on stream last year, had performed slightly worse than expected. Profits in the UK were 23 per cent ahead at Pounds 7.19m (Pounds 5.83m) on turnover of Pounds 67.8m (Pounds 59.2m). Mr Walker said turnover in gravure printing had risen from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 44.6m, and in web offset printing from Pounds 21m to Pounds 27.2m. The company started printing the Telegraph TV guide in January and the News of the World supplement in April. It had also won more business printing retail and travel brochures and inserts. Last month the group delivered the first Sky TV Guide, which had a print run of 2.7m copies. The guide is expected to increase circulation by 50,000 copies an issue, giving it the biggest circulation of any UK magazine. In Spain recession held back the level of business outside the printing of ]Hola] and Hello magazine. Profits were Pounds 415,000, compared with Pounds 326,000 from the start of the operation in the second quarter last year. Profits in Hungary grew from Pounds 215,000 to Pounds 305,000 on turnover up from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 4.69m. The Budapest-based subsidiary now prints 36 periodicals and exports to Russia, Romania and Poland. Net interest payable was Pounds 1.61m, against Pounds 76,000 in the first half last year, when about Pounds 1.75m of interest was capitalised. For the whole of 1993, interest payable was Pounds 1.97m. The tax charge of 27 per cent (23 per cent last time) reflected a fall in capital expenditure, which is expected to be Pounds 28m this year, falling to Pounds 10m in 1995 before rising again. Earnings per share rose to 7.82p (6.69p). The interim dividend has been increased to 1.7p (1.5p). COMMENT Watmoughs looks well placed - demand is rising and customers are seeking the group out because of its market position. Results are already weighted towards the second half, and will benefit from a full contribution from the two new contracts. It is confident of passing on price increases; in any case most of its paper consumption is paid for by its customers in the first place. There is plenty of room for growth in Hungary and Spain. Earnings of 22p are expected for the full year despite the increasing tax charge. This puts the company on a prospective multiple of 18.5 - fully valued, but a strong hold. See People</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Metallgesellschaft deepens suspicions over derivatives - Risk and reward That German industrial giant Metallgesellschaft has been brought to its knees by a one-off derivatives hedging strategy gone awry has deepened the suspicions of financial regulators and other sceptics that these relatively new and complex instruments are systemically dangerous. The company says derivatives losses from its US oil and gas subsidiary, MG Corp, could mount to DM2.3bn. While its creditors arrange how best to mop up the mess, the derivatives industry is trying to put the best face on the situation, saying the MG example is not the norm. First off, they say, MG's hedging strategy was not a complicated structured instrument that ran wild because it failed to be understood by top-level managers. Instead it appears the company ignored its risk models and carried such huge positions that they became unmanageable. It also, and more understandably, seems to have mismatched the terms of its hedges with its contractual obligations. MG Corp sold oil and petrol under long-term contracts (known as 'forwards') to end-users and third-party traders. Then, in the simplest of hedges, they offset the forward contracts with corresponding purchases in both the Nymex oil futures markets and in over-the-counter oil swaps. Though MG's forward obligations were five to 10 years out, it offset them with short-term (three-month) derivatives. There was a good reason for this. Liquidity, or the ability to enter and exit trades at a reasonable price, exists only in the shortest-term deliveries in Nymex futures contracts. OTC oil swaps are less liquid than the futures markets and become thinner at longer maturities. Thus, it made business sense for MG to keep the hedge positions liquid, or short. The other attraction of short-term hedges was that, at least initially, they generated profit: so long as short-term oil futures prices were above those for longer-term delivery (backwardation), MG's practice of buying contracts for three-month delivery and 'rolling' them into the next three-month maturity yielded streams of cash. Seasoned energy traders say MG's risk model should have warned that if the oil market inverted, and short-term prices fell below those for distant deliveries (a contango market), the results would be disastrous, and management should have made contingency plans to restructure the hedges. Instead, MG's massive short hedge rolling programme remained in place as the oil markets went contango last autumn, generating rollover losses estimated at Dollars 30m a month. Energy traders believe the sheer size of MG's positions prevented it from restructuring its hedges. 'The biggest problem of all here is the size,' one trader said. Some estimates put MG's oil near 200m barrels, with exchange trades close to 10 per cent of Nymex open positions. Typically, hedgers who are in loss-making positions in the futures markets switch to less painful positions in the OTC markets, moving discreetly to shake off traders waiting to capitalise on their dilemma. MG's huge positions made this impossible. Despite widespread publicity, MG is still expected to perform another unprofitable 'roll' at the Nymex this month. Mr Gary Gastineau, director of customer risk management at Swiss Bank, says MG would have done better with a single large long-term hedge in the oil swaps market. However, that structured transaction would have been expensive, illiquid, and would not have had the profitable lure of the short-term futures roll.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Credit card use points to squeeze Tax and National Insurance increases may already have significantly depressed spending, according to figures from Barclaycard, which has the largest share of the UK credit card market. While any impact since the increase in deductions has yet to show through in discretionary spending, the amounts spent since the Budget on November 30 have fallen. Figures for Barclaycard's weekly sales turnover last summer show that spending using the credit card was running at about 12 per cent higher than during the same months in 1992. From December, however, the percentage increase in turnover for each month against the comparable period the previous year dropped to 6 per cent to 8 per cent. The amounts processed by Barclaycard on any given day - which reflect spending in the day or so immediately before - suggest a slight drop when last week is compared with its equivalent last year. At the start of the week, spending was about 120 per cent of the 1993 value, while by Thursday's figures it had slipped to 110 per cent of last year's figure.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / World Trade News: UK group enters Japan steel sector The Japanese arm of Trafalgar House, the UK construction and engineering group, has received approval to enter the Japanese fabricated steel business, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company, which opened its Japanese branch last month, will become the first UK group to acquire a licence to provide fabricated steel for the construction industry. The move however, comes at a time when the sharp fall in the economy and the plunge in the property market has hurt the Japanese construction industry. Trafalgar says it intends to gain market access by supplying low-cost steel products from its Dubai operations to Japanese fabricated steel sub-contractors, facing a profit squeeze.</p>

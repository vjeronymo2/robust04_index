			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Mitsubishi breaks ranks to buy steel from S Korea A significant crack has appeared in Japan's traditional corporate relationships with the unprecedented decision by Mitsubishi Motors to import steel from South Korea, long seen by Japanese manufacturers as their chief rival. Mitsubishi Motors, the carmaker within the Mitsubishi group of companies, broke an industry taboo by signing a contract with Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel to buy steel sheet on a long-term basis. The agreement reflects growing pressures on Japanese manufacturers to lower costs following the yen's appreciation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its annual survey of Japan's economy, warned yesterday that the yen's strength was the biggest threat to the country's emerging recovery. Mitsubishi would not disclose the price of Korean steel sheet, but it is believed to be 15 to 20 per cent cheaper than the Japanese product. Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, and Honda also said they were testing Korean steel sheet. Reports of the Korean imports, decided on Wednesday, depressed the share prices of Japanese steel companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, was the most actively traded issue, down Y6 to Y368 (Dollars 3.7). NKK and Kobe Steel were also among the 10 most actively traded issues, with NKK down Y9 to Y269 and Kobe down Y5 to Y311. Strong yen biggest risk for Japan, Page 4 Tokyo stocks, Page 37</p>

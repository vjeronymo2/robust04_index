			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: French vote provides nexttest for bond markets - Uneasy calm may be challenged A MONTH after Danish voters gave the thumbs down to the Maastricht treaty, European Community bond markets have settled into an uneasy calm. Whether that calm is justified, or whether a new wave of pessimism is about to break over the European markets, could be tested in the coming weeks. Two events this week suggest that it will not all be plain sailing - though most bond investors doubt that the equilibrium that has settled on the markets will be broken. The first event was the hike in the Italian discount rate at the weekend, prompted by a wave of speculation over a devaluation of the lira. The second was sterling's abrupt exit yesterday from the notional narrow band in which it had been trading in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The knee-jerk reaction to the Danish vote was a sharp widening in bond yields between Germany and higher-yielding bond markets. It left Euro-sceptics feeling vindicated. 'A while back, we put a discount on Europe,' said Mr Terence Prideaux, a fund manager at Kemper Investment Management. 'It seemed to us to have become 'politically correct' to be European, and fashions in political correctness can easily change.' The correction was sharp and quick. Spain and Italy were the biggest losers, while UK government bonds - poised delicately in investors' minds between the high-yielding and core ERM markets - largely escaped the rout. That was phase one of the reaction to the Danish vote. The markets have since recovered their equilibrium, and entered stage two: the long wait until September 20, when French voters deliver their own verdict on the Maastricht plans for European economic and monetary union (Emu). 'If the French say 'no' there will be a major sell-off in the higher-yielders,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income at Legal &amp; General, the UK insurer. 'We got half of it with Denmark - we would get the other half with France.' But although bond investors' thoughts are fixed firmly on the French referendum, there is plenty that could yet disturb their summer reverie. Bond yields in both Italy and Spain have continued to rise, relative to Germany, as further doubts about the ability of those countries to meet the convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht take hold. The foreign exchange markets have begun to ask some demanding questions of sterling, ending the three-month honeymoon that followed the re-election of Mr John Major's Conservative government in early April. The convergence among European bond markets achieved in the past two years may largely remain intact, but there could be stiff tests ahead. Italy faces the toughest challenge. Its political and economic problems are largely internal, and the rosy haze has lifted from international investors' eyes in the aftermath of the Danish vote, encouraging them to look more closely at bond yields that had once looked to be treading an inexorable path towards convergence. 'Maastricht was the first time we've had guidelines laid down against which economies can be measured,' said Mr Prideaux. Investors have begun to use the measuring rod mercilessly in Italy's case to question whether the country's new government has the will and the ability to tame its budget deficit. Sentiment in the gilt market, meanwhile, changed quickly this week as sterling came under pressure. Only last Friday, the Bank of England's operations in the money market suggested that it was tinkering with the idea of a rate cut. 'It was very badly timed,' says Mr Andrew Burtenshaw, head of fixed income at Norwich Union, the UK composite insurer. The rise in Italy's interest rates and a sharp fall in the US dollar against the DM this week gave foreign exchange dealers the opportunity to test sterling for the first time since the general election. Most doubt that sterling will come under serious pressure - a view apparently supported by the Bank of England's equanimity yesterday in the face of the pound's slide. Although the UK economy has shown little sign of improvement, the UK government, with an election behind it, is under no immediate pressure to generate a recovery through a devaluation. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange markets are likely to cast a shadow over gilts in the near future. This week's developments suggest that the European bond markets will continue to reverberate from the Danish vote on Maastricht in the coming months. But they offer little guide to the two big questions that will determine the markets' direction over the longer term: will French voters back Maastricht, and when will the Bundesbank allow German interest rates to fall?</p>

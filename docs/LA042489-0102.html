			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUSSEIN ACCEPTS RESIGNATION OF PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> King Hussein accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai today after  rioting over price increases, an informed source reported.  </P> <P> The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave no details, and there was  no official announcement. Earlier in the day, officials reported that the  Harvard-educated Rifai, prime minister since 1985, had offered his resignation.  </P> <P> Crown Prince Hassan was quoted Sunday as telling a Saudi Arabian newspaper that  last week's riots would not force a change.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riots Began Tuesday  </P> <P> "Government changes are first and foremost a decision of King Hussein and  dictated by constitutional legitimacy, and cannot take place because of  demagoguery or pressures exerted on us," the newspaper Al Sharq al Awsat quoted  the prince as saying.  </P> <P> The four days of riots, in which at least eight people died, began Tuesday in  the southern city of Maan and spread to dozens of cities and villages  throughout the kingdom.  </P> <P> Rifai has been widely blamed for falling living standards in Jordan. The annual  per capita income has slumped from about $2,000 in the mid-1980s to about  $1,200.  </P> <P> The government last year imposed import controls and austerity measures to help  deal with mounting payments on a $6-billion debt.  </P> <P> Rifai, 52, was a boyhood friend of King Hussein who became one of his most  trusted advisers. No Jordanian prime minister served longer than Rifai. Besides  the term that began in April, 1985, he also was prime minister from 1973 to  1976.  </P> <P> Educated at Columbia and Harvard universities, Rifai earlier served as  ambassador to Britain and as chief of the royal court.  </P></p>

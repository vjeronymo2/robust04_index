Paying homage to the martyrs for freedom in all the times  and  especially the latest martyrs, those of '90, President Berisha  recalls the last winter of the dictatorship, the destructions  and the numerous victims of that time. "March 22 makes us  recall all these not for revenge but not to allow them to be  repeated," the message says. President Berisha compared the  extreme poverty and the suspended economy, the serious  consequences of the isolation with the situation of Albania  after two years under democracy, when Albanians could manage to  have the most rapid economic growth and a stable and practically  convertible currency through the profound reforms they are  carrying out. The country in which for so many years the cults  of Hoxha and Stalin prevailed has now one of the most  progressive charter of the human rights and freedoms of the  time. Albania has become an important factor for the peace and  stability in the region. It defined its western character  clearer than any other former communist country.    Pointing to the overcome of the consequences of the 50 year  long isolation in the foreign policy of Albania, Mr. Berisha  says that engagement of Albania has given quite another  dimension to the Albanian question in general and to that of the  human and national rights and freedoms of the Albanians in their  territories in the former Yugoslavia. At present, the Kosova  question is first of all international and not simply Serbian as  the Belgrade dictator claims, President Berisha says.    Stressing the contribution of the aid and solidarity of the  European Union and its member countries, of the U.S.A. and other  friendly European and Islamic countries, to the achievements of  Albania, Mr. Berisha expresses his conviction that the free  Albanian individual has been the decisive factor in this  direction.    Concerning the difficulties that the Albanian people are  experiencing, Mr. Berisha said: "There are numerous Albanian  families or individuals who are not employed, who are on  assistance or on pension that are experiencing very great  difficulties in the daily life. I would like to assure them  that the government will make uninterrupted efforts to improve  their lives, to increase chances for their employment and to  give them a social and economic support."    Speaking about the Meksi government, Mr. Berisha pointed out  that facing a destroyed country, the new Albanian institutions  had to apply the economic reform, the law, to fight against  corruption, thus scoring one of the greatest victories within a  short period of time: the overthrow of the state-individual  ratio in favour of the latter.    "But our successes although great and undeniable cannot be  considered an economic miracle," Mr. Berisha said, adding that  Albania is the poorest country of Europe. "Our road towards  prosperity and development is not filled with flowers but with  serious difficulties." President Berisha said that "still there  is a miracle existing in Albania, this is the vigour of freedom.  This vigour will carry Albania nearer to the developed world,  will ever more unite the Albanians wherever they are and will  link them with other freedom-loving peoples and allied  countries. Therefore, today all together let us say thanks God,  and let us honour even more each other's freedom," the message  says in conclusion.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PALL AT THE 'PREDATORS' BALL';  </P> <P> CORPORATE RAIDERS PACKED THE HOTEL FOR DREXEL'S FIRST "JUNK BOND" CONFERENCE IN  THE POST-MILKEN ERA. BUT THE OLD ELECTRICITY WAS GONE.  </P> <P> At lunchtime at the annual Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" extravaganza, the  rich, the mighty and the famous found little white books next to their plates  titled, "Tom Smith and his Incredible Bread Machine."  </P> <P> The book is a parable in verse about a man who invents an amazing machine that  produces bread for under a penny a loaf. He feeds the world and becomes  tremendously rich. But he then is vilified by the press, indicted on false  charges and cast down. The book jacket says it's about "the age-old conflict  between the productive individual and the compulsory state."  </P> <P> The point of passing out the book was lost on no one.  </P> <P> As Drexel's 11th high-yield bond conference got under way Wednesday at the  Beverly Hilton, there were few signs of contrition for the legal problems that  have beset the firm and led to the racketeering indictment of Michael Milken,  the man who had built Drexel's own incredible bread machine.  </P> <P> For the first time, Milken, the former chief of Drexel's junk bond department,  wasn't there to preside over what is known unofficially as "the Predators'  Ball." His traditional role as keynote speaker and ringmaster for the rounds of  financial presentations was being filled by others. But there was a record  turnout of more than 3,000 top corporate executives and institutional  investors. And the message was still the same: Junk bonds are great. Junk bonds  create jobs. Corporate buyout artists and raiders help keep the American  economy strong by eliminating waste and keeping alive the entrepreneurial  spirit.  </P> <P> The Drexel speakers made clear that even though Milken has taken a leave of  absence since his indictment and is expected to permanently sever his ties to  the firm, they aren't about to disown the man who almost single-handedly built  the $183-billion junk bond market. John H. Kissick, the newly designated head  of the junk bond department, referred almost immediately to Milken in his  remarks opening the conference.  </P> <P> Speaking of Milken's "vision and genius" and enormous contribution to Drexel's  growth, Kissick said that "over the coming months our thoughts will be with  Mike" and the two other former Drexel employees indicted with him.  </P> <P> Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's chief executive, drew sustained applause at  lunch when he mentioned Milken's absence and said: "From a personal point of  view, we certainly miss his immense brainpower."  </P> <P> The remarks were all the more remarkable because Drexel itself has agreed to  plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650 million in penalties on charges  of securities fraud and defrauding customers. The firm is under intense  pressure from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan to publicly admit guilt  and not minimize the importance of its guilty plea. But the decision to plead  guilty was hardly mentioned by Drexel officials in their speeches.  </P> <P> Under original plans, according to well-placed sources at the conference,  Milken was scheduled to make a surprise appearance Wednesday night at one of  the Drexel-sponsored dinners. But Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder confirmed  that the firm's lawyers passed word to Milken at the last minute that his  presence at the dinner probably wouldn't be appreciated by the U.S. Attorney's  Office.  </P> <P> But if Milken couldn't be physically present, many at the conference whose  fortunes were made by his creative use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds went  to him. Sources said Milken spent the day in an office just blocks from the  Beverly Hilton, receiving a parade of well-wishers. More than 100 others were  said to have telephoned.  </P> <P> Milken, who denies any wrongdoing and plans to vigorously fight the charges  against him, was ensconced in an office in the same building that houses the  Drexel junk bond department in Beverly Hills. Since he is on a leave of  absence, he isn't officially allowed in Drexel's offices. But Milken, his  brother Lowell and several other individuals own the building. And he was said  to be in an office there that was separate from Drexel's rented premises.  </P> <P> If Drexel's legal misfortunes were about to have an impact on the firm, there  was little evidence of it in the crowded meeting rooms and corridors of the  hotel. As dawn broke over the hotel Wednesday, droves of limousines had already  deposited most of the attendees. Men in thousand-dollar suits eagerly clutched  canvas maroon-and-white Drexel tote bags handed out with free goodies and  schedules of events.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pickens, Turner, Kravis  </P> <P> There was no shortage of big names in the corporate world who were there or  would be shortly -- including corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr., television  mogul Ted Turner and Henry Kravis of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis  Roberts &amp; Co. With major help from Drexel, Kravis' company recently  completed the largest buyout in history, that of RJR Nabisco.  </P> <P> And dozens of executives interviewed said they stand by the firm, that they  think it was victimized by the government and that Drexel will remain a  powerhouse even though Milken is gone.  </P> <P> "It's not one person, it's an entire company," said Geoffrey H. Ramsden, an  executive at Kansas City-based Ferrell Cos. Referring to the $25-billion RJR  Nabisco deal, he said: "They've just completed the largest debt offering in the  history of corporate finance. The organization has transcended Michael Milken."  </P> <P> Although the annual conference is noted for extravagance and lavish  entertainment that in past years included Frank Sinatra, Diana Ross and Dolly  Parton, the real purpose is to conduct business. Corporations that raise  capital by issuing junk bonds put on presentations to institutional investors  who buy them. Big companies in a single meeting get to make a presentation to  what is undeniably the biggest assemblage of junk bond buyers. And there are  similar chances for the Cinderellas at the junk bonds ball -- the small,  upstart companies -- to make a pitch for the money that could mean big  expansion and success. In the side rooms and hallways, Drexel employees stand  by to sign up deals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Junk Will 'Clearly Survive'  </P> <P> Comparing this year's conference to previous years' Fredric M. Roberts, the  head of the investment banking firm F. M. Roberts &amp; Co., said: "While there  is a perceptible reduction in the electricity in the atmosphere, the crowds are  clearly larger, and the amount of fundamental business being done is as great  or greater."  </P> <P> He said this is an indication that "the business is now institutionalized, and  that it will clearly survive any individual."  </P> <P> And while some at the conference admitted that they had been shocked by the  amount of Milken's annual compensation, recently disclosed by prosecutors,  which in 1987 reached $550 million, nearly everyone interviewed voiced  solidarity and support for him. "He's being pilloried," said Philip N. Cohen,  chief financial officer of Integrated Resources, which has long done business  with Drexel. "I just don't believe that somebody who was making that kind of  money was going to bother to chisel on a couple of minor things."  </P> <P> Jaime Escalante, the school teacher portrayed in the film "Stand and Deliver"  was the second speaker at the conference, extolling the importance of  education, a favorite Milken theme.  </P> <P> And although the atmosphere was more subdued than in previous years, hype was  still in evidence. In the center of the Hilton lobby was a six-foot revolving  space station, modeled on something in "Star Wars," labeled "Drexel Burnham  presents High Yield City 2089 A.D." The space station included rotating TV  monitors promoting Drexel's clients and emitting Top 40 rock 'n' roll songs  with special Drexel lyrics dubbed in. Above the din of investment bankers and  corporate CEOs doing business, one could catch strains of: "Drexel makes it  real/We've got that higher yield," and another favorite, "They built this city  on high-yield bonds."  </P></p>

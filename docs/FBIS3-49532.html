			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by studio </F> announcer Pospisilova in Bratislava--live]    [Excerpts] [Pospisilova] [passage omitted] A short while  ago, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik told the  government that we want to use the Prague session not simply to  yet again reiterate the Slovak Republic's interest in NATO  membership, but also to present a major initiative toward  intensifying economic contacts between the United States and the  Slovak Republic. Minister Moravcik is now at the microphone.    Minister, let us first go back to yesterday's Brussels  summit. British Prime Minister John Major, speaking at the  summit, characterized the Partnership for Peace as an  evolutionary program that could lead to NATO membership--but for  some countries only. What will the Slovak Republic have to do in  order to, in John Major's words, find its place among those  selected countries? What is it that Slovakia can and is willing  to offer?    [Moravcik] The summit passed a very important document, the  summit statement. It should be signed by all of the countries  wanting to join the project, and the government of the Slovak  Republic is ready to sign it. Following a government decision, a  special group, consisting of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  Ministry of Defense officials, will be set up in the next few  days in order to prepare and realize the signing of the relevant  documents.    [Pospisilova] Minister, don't you think that in the past few  days some well-known foreign politicians and mass media  eliminated Slovakia from the process of joining NATO, even  before the process could start? For example, CNN television used  the argument that Slovakia's interest in joining NATO was not  quite as obvious as the interest demonstrated by Poland, the  Czech Republic, and Hungary. What do you think Slovakia has done  to deserve such treatment, subtle as it is?    [Moravcik] I am not aware that we have been pursuing NATO  membership less keenly than other Visegrad Four countries. We  have used every occasion to present our position quite clearly.  [passage omitted]. I would not read too much into such  statements because, in all my personal dealings with foreign  representatives--and some of them have failed now and then to  mention Slovakia as a country keen to join NATO--I received  assurances that Slovakia was counted in the same way as the rest  of the Visegrad group countries. In assessing the situation  objectively, we find there is no reason whatsoever to think that  Slovakia is less well prepared as a partner than anyone else. We  are definitely in the first group.    [Pospisilova] Apart from meeting Bill Clinton, you will have  bilateral talks with the members of other delegations. Are you  going to discuss the demands of the Hungarian minority in  Slovakia with your Hungarian counterpart?    [Moravcik] The position of the Hungarian minority can be  dealt with only in the context of our effort to prepare an  all-European document. In all other respects, the position of  the Hungarian minority in our country is our internal affair.</p>

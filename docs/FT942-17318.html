			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Museum staff threaten action French unions threatened to close leading museums in a 24-hour strike planned for today to back demands for higher wages and better conditions. The CFDT trade union said the stoppage could close the Louvre and Orsay museums in Paris and the Versailles palace near the capital, and cause severe disruption at other museums. The four unions involved say the 2,500 museum staff are getting insufficient reward for increasingly complex duties.</p>

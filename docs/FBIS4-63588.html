			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- "A successful solution to the  matter of dividing the Black Sea Fleet will stabilize the  situation in the Crimea in general." That is how Ukraine's  Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvegilskiy described the subject  matter of the talks between the heads of governments of Russia  and Ukraine, now in their second day. The second stage of the  talks began earlier this morning.    Yesterday Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his  Ukrainian counterpart discussed the division of the Black Sea  Fleet and its infrastructure, and the issue of separate bases  for the national fleets. The talks began in a one-to-one format  with the two delegations joining later.    The talks are proceeding in a confidential atmosphere, but  Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov told  correspondents that the exchange of views is constructive and is  being conducted "in a good working tone."    The sides make no secret of the fact that the grounds for  the  current stage of the talks on the division of the Black Sea  Fleet is the exacerbation of the political situation in Crimea.  This follows the Crimean Parliament's decision to restore the  Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992 which, in the Kiev  authorities' view, may pose a threat to political stability in  the Ukraine and provoke tension in relations between Russian and  Ukraine.    In Valeriy Shmarov's words, no settlement of the political  situation in Crimea was discussed at the talks yesterday.    Crimea's Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov today joined the  Ukrainian delegation at the talks.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Incense, Peppermints: Concert posters from the blissed-out era of acid rock,  some featuring Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, are up for auction at a store in  the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The 100-poster assortment, also including those from concerts by the Jefferson  Airplane, Santana and Chicago, was put up for bid by an anonymous owner,  according to Robert Beerbohm, proprietor of the Best Comics store. The total  asking price: $15,000. "There were only a thousand or fewer posters made for  the concerts and most are gone," Beerbohm said. Included is what Beerbohm  labels "the first psychedelic poster" promoting a 1965 concert by the  Charlatans, a San Francisco band, which he expects to sell for $2,000. CLAUDIA  PUIG  </P></p>

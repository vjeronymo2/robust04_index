How does this incidence rate compare with those of families traveling by air? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) What is the non-infant automobile passenger fatality, serious injury, and minor injury incidence rate for families with infants traveling by automobile? How does this incidence rate compare with those of families traveling by air? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) How does the automobile accident rate for parents and guardians of infants compare with the automobile accident rate for the general population? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) When is the passenger seat and safety belt that is available to an adult passenger (without the child safety seat) safe enough for a child? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) When should seats not manufactured to federal motor vehicle safety standards be used (if at all)? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the issue of the efficacy of infant restraints, the FAA has completed a study entitled ``The Performance of Child Restraint Devices in Transport Airplane Passenger Seats.'' A notice of availability was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 27, 1994 (59 FR 49276). The FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and to work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop revised standards for child safety seat testing and labeling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA will be seeking data from some individually selected air carriers, air taxis, and commercial operators or their representatives concerning anticipated pricing policies if child safety seats are mandated for infants. This data is needed to respond to the Congressional request for a report and would constitute competitive commercial information. To avoid any improper exchange of competitive price or marketing information the FAA will maintain the confidentiality of such information. Raw data of this nature will not be disclosed; rather, any presentation of such data will be aggregated to avoid any competitive concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parties interested in the congressionally mandated study of child safety seats are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide a factual basis which support the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in analyzing the child safety seat issues. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, competitive, and small business aspects of child safety seat use and of potential alternatives. Written submissions should identify the docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. Comments should not be sent or directed to any of the contractors that have been engaged by the FAA to provide information for the study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received on or before the closing date for comments will be fully considered. To the extent possible, all comments received after the closing date will be considered also. All comments submitted, will be available for examination in the Rules Docket both before and after the closing date for comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on October 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Dale E.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the beginning of this year, in line with the  principles set forth by the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council on `seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding  opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability,'  the provincial party committee and the provincial government  have positively and steadily promoted the reform in various  fields, thus effecting a relatively rapid increase in  production, construction, circulation, and consumption, and  keeping on the fine economic trend emerged since last winter.  In the first quarter of this year, the province's gross  domestic product was 66 billion yuan, an increase of 18.3  percent over the corresponding period last year. Of this, the  added value of the primary industry was 6.7 billion yuan, an  increase of 6.7 percent; that of the secondary industry was 41.6  billion yuan, an increase of 20.6 percent; and that of the  tertiary industry was 17.7 billion yuan, an increase of 18.7  percent. Economic development showed the following  characteristics:    The increase trend of industrial production was strong, and  production and marketing grew simultaneously. In the first  quarter of this year, the province's industry at or above the  township level realized 89.2 billion yuan in sales value, an  increase of 30.9 percent over the same period last year, and the  marketing rate of products was 91.6 percent, an increase of 1.57  percentage points. Such major light industrial products as  bicycles, electric fans, clothes, television sets, and washing  machines registered increases ranging from 40 to 80 percent.  And, such heavy industrial products as rolled steel, coal, soda  ash continued to increase steadily.    Crops were doing well, and livestock production developed  steadily. Since the beginning of spring, party committees and  governments at all levels in the province have conscientiously  implemented the guidelines of the national rural work conference  and the demands set by the telephone conference on spring  production held by the provincial government, thus giving rise  to a relatively good situation in agricultural production.  Wheat was doing well. Assignment of cotton fields was carried  out rapidly. Acreage sown to oil-bearing seeds and vegetables  increased greatly. Animal husbandry developed in an all-round  way, and the large-scale breeding of pigs, cattle, and sheep  developed rapidly.    Increase trend in investment remained vigorous, and  investment structure tended to be reasonable. State-owned units  throughout the province invested 3.94 billion yuan in fixed  assets, up by 38.2 percent over the corresponding period last  year, or an increase of 15 percent if price rise factor is  deducted. Major characteristics of investment were: the  investment in the projects undertaken by the central authorities  increased rapidly, the investment in local projects increased  slowly, the newly initiated projects decreased, and investment  structure improved. Investment in the energy industry increased  rapidly. Of this, investment in coal and power industries  increased by 170 and 130 percent respectively.    Sales on market tended to be brisk steadily, and urban and  rural markets were thriving. In the first quarter of this year,  the volume of retail sales of consumer goods totaled 24.86  billion yuan, an increase of 28 percent over the corresponding  period last year, with is growth speed faster than the average  national level. There was an ample supply of commodities on  markets, and the people's shopping mentality was stable. The  increase in rural markets was accelerated, and the gaps between  the increase margins of urban and rural markets were narrowed.  The transaction volume of country fair trade in urban and rural  areas increased at a high speed. In the first quarter of this  year, the transaction volume of the province's urban and rural  country fair trade amounted to 19.45 billion yuan, up by 92.4  percent over the same period last year.    Foreign trade maintained its steady increase. In the first  quarter of this year, the total volume of foreign export trade  reached $1.36 billion, an increase of 12.8 percent over the same  period last year. Utilization of foreign funds entered the  stage of substantial development. In three months, a total of  1,040 projects using foreign funds were newly signed, with the  contracted volume of foreign funds reaching $458 million.  Because the foreign investments for the projects signed last  year was put in place one after another, the foreign funds  actually utilized in the first quarter of this year reached $306  million, an increase of 42 percent over the same period last  year.    Revenues increased steadily, and the difference in social  credit was narrowed. The provincial budgetary financial  revenues amounted to 2.02 billion yuan, an increase of 27.5  percent, and expenditures amounted to 2.91 billion yuan, an  increase of 23.5 percent. By the end of March, credit savings  deposits of the province amounted to 194.3 billion yuan, 13.26  billion yuan more than the figure at the beginning of this year;  and loans amounted to 209 billion yuan, 3.12 billion yuan more  than that at the beginning of this year.    Living standards of the people continued to improve. In the  first quarter of this year, the total payroll of workers and  staff throughout the province was 7.46 billion yuan, an increase  of 31.5 percent over the same period last year, and the average  wage was 872 yuan, an increase of 27.7 percent. Living  standards of urban and rural residents also improved obviously.    At present, some problems remain to the province's economic  life. For instance, commodity prices have continued to pick up  in high place, the efficiency of industrial production has  declined, the range of deficits has been expanded, and the  prices of means of agricultural production increased. The  provincial departments concerned are adopting effective measures  to gradually resolve these problems with a view to pressing  forward the provincial economy in an even more healthy and  orderly manner.</p>

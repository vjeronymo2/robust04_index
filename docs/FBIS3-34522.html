After  two weeks of continued talks, Israel asked that these talks be  suspended until 25 February. This shows the Israeli position is  still the same in terms of intransigence, procrastination, and  prevarication. It still adheres to all the obstacles  threatening the peace process and continues to adopt proposals  and ideas that will not achieve real, durable, and comprehensive  peace.    This is revealed by Israeli assertions that issues have not  reached fruition on the Israeli side and that circumstances are  not yet conducive to achieving peace. No doubt, these flimsy  pretexts conceal an Israeli attempt to sabotage the peace  process, striking at its roots via a well-known policy of  extending the period of talks and considering talks an end in  themselves.    These Israeli efforts cannot be separated from practices  designed to obstruct the peace process and to lay traps in its  path. This is revealed by the Israeli Government's decision to  expand two settlements in the Golan and to allow settlers to  carry out this expansion with government support and  sponsorship. No other evidence is needed that Israel does not  want peace. These practices and positions all show, either  directly or through impressions and maneuvering, that Israel  still refuses to respond to the requirements of a just and  comprehensive peace. Israel is hostile to the resolutions of  international legitimacy that demand its withdrawal from  occupied Arab territories. Israel is being hostile to peace and  is contradicting it. Even in its separate deal known as the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, Israel is still procrastinating,  prevaricating, and avoiding implementation.    Furthermore, the secret Oslo deal is still blocked, facing  Israeli obstacles. Events and developments prove the Israeli  plans cannot lead to the desired peace--a peace that secures the  region's security and stability.    Hence, we believe that the Israeli positions and practices  threaten not just the peace process, but also place the region  in a state of continued disturbance and tension and spread an  atmosphere of pessimism and darkness. Israel alone is  responsible for this disturbed and worrying situation. It is  responsible for the possible consequences of such a situation in  terms of complications and reactions. This is because Israel's  waste of the available peace opportunities has not been a  coincidence. Each time, this has happened after careful  considerations and planning. This is reaffirmed by Israel's  refusal, inside and outside the talks, to speak about a full  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and by its refusal  to stop settlement activities which are a manifestation of the  occupation. This is also reaffirmed by Israel's refusal to  comply with the basics and formula of the Madrid conference and  by its disavowal of the principle of restoring the land in  return for peace.    The continued Israeli rejection of all this is a rejection  of  peace and its requirements and of the resolutions of  international legitimacy. This is because whoever is concerned  about peace does not prevaricate, procrastinate, or deceive.</p>

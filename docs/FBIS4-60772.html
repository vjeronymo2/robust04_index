			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Guntis Ulmanis in Riga on eve of </F> departure for talks in Moscow -- live]    [Text] Esteemed viewers, I hope that many of you will have  successfully ended another working week, while at the weekend  there is spring cleaning to be done. For the government,  parliament, and the president, however, one of the most crucial  visits to Moscow, and one of the most difficult working days,  will take place tomorrow.    This was not an easy decision, and at the basis of it were  those processes which have troubled the minds of many of you. I  think that this is a visit which in many ways is a first in  history. It is the first visit by the state president to  democratic Russia. It is the first summit meeting between  Latvia and Russia in unprecedented circumstances and conditions.  Democratic Russia want to achieve its goals by talking to a  free and sovereign Latvia. This path is taken not only by  Russia and Latvia; it has been created with the participation of  many European countries as well, especially in the past two  weeks. And perhaps it is the views of the European countries,  the views of the European Union, the letters and messages from  leaders of many countries, and the promises, as well as the  practical work of giving material support to these processes,  that have inclined us to the decision to go to Moscow and  commence political dialogue.    What are the basic aims and tasks in setting off on this  short but crucial road? In the first place our task is to bring  about, without reservations and by the appointed date of 31  August, the departure from Latvia of the last soldier of the  Russian army. There is proof that this process is by no means  easy in the facts of the past few days, that the withdrawal of  the Russian army is proceeding with great difficulty and  complexity, and quite often the tasks that are are already set  today are not being fulfilled. I think that in accepting such  an agreement, our government, our Ministry of Defense, will have  to make great efforts for these soldiers to be really withdrawn.  We must ensure that Skrunda acquires the status of a military  institution under civilian control, so it would not be possible  at all, even in theory, and as a the result of a mistake, as  happened recently, to acquire the status of a military base. We  must ensure that soon after the signing of this agreement the  new monster of Skrunda is demolished, so that it can never  return, and there can never even be any more talk of the  reinstating of this military base.    I think that in the past week two very essential  improvements or supplements have been achieved: they are, on the  creation of the repatriation fund, on the functioning and  significance of this repatriation fund. I am convinced that  through this repatriation fund many former soldiers and military  personnel will have a chance to leave Latvia in a civilized way.    And another achievement, if it can be called anything in  this difficult struggle, is that we have received from Russia  the number of those retired military personnel -- 22,320 -- who  will be subject to the application of these agreements and laws.  So, if we talk of the fourth agreement, and whether it will be  signed at all, it could be a matter of the futures of 22,320  people, and Latvia will one way or another bear its civilized  responsibilities only for the fate of those people in the social  (?sphere).    I think that this kind of checking will allow us to remove  the range of responsibilities rumored recently - that there are  100,000 150,000, or 200,000 in Latvia -- no, this agreement  covers only that number that will be checked and monitored every  year. I think that the last two questions we are to talk about,  namely the commencement of political dialogue and the future  settlement of economic relations, are less important.    We are taking with us more than 10 agreements, about which  there will definitely be talks, and I think they will allow many  economic industrialists, farmers, producers, to breathe freely,  because the way to the eastern market, in my opinion, is today  after all somewhat easier than the way to the western market.    And I cannot speak about the last question that we are  definitely to discuss at our meeting with Yeltsin - that is the  question of our moral, of our spiritual responsibility in the  face of those forces from which we have still not freed  ourselves today. They are the consequences of the occupation,  they are the consequences that our people is still living  through since the deportations of 1940 and 1949. I am convinced  that the Russian leadership will acknowledge the criminality of  these consequences, acknowledge the destructive effect of these  consequences, not only on the Latvian people, but also on many  other peoples.    And in conclusion I want to confess that this journey is  undoubtedly very complex and very hard, and I can say with  certainty that I am travelling with a (?heavy) heart and doubts  -- but not doubts about the road that Latvia is taking. Here  neither the president nor the government has any doubts. But we  have doubts about whether the new democratic Russia will be able  to receive and accept us - not as the near abroad, not as a  possible sphere of influence, but as a sovereign independent  state.    I know, and I am acquainted with, the great hospitality of  the Russian people. I hope that the Russian government, too,  will be able to comprehend these efforts being made by the  Latvian people. I would like our delegation to have as its  travelling provisions not only those harsh words and critical  remarks you have made; it has also done much good in assessing  our work for us; but also to have wishes for us for a bit of  endurance, a bit of strength, patience and persistence in this  lengthy, but for Latvia very important, process.</p>

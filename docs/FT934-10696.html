			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Research shows majority of defendants treated as 'economic units' THE majority of defendants are treated as 'economic units' by their solicitors and do not receive adequate advice or representation, research for the Economic and Social Research Council shows, Robert Rice writes. The study found that most defendants were encouraged by lawyers to plead guilty to save time and costs. If they did not agree they were frequently branded as 'nuts'. Professor Michael McConville, the author of the research, said the main problem was the weight of work faced by solicitors, allied to declining levels of legal aid and a loss of values associated with adversarial justice.</p>

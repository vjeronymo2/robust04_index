			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television There is a decidely medicinal smell to tonight's TV schedule. Horizon (BBC 2 at 8pm) looks at the growing global asthma epidemic; Panorama (BBC 1 at 9.30) examines how the tobacco industry has suppressed research linking smoking to disease; The Doctor (BBC 1 at 7.30) is a repeat of the documentary series which follows a practice of GPs on its daily round in the Yorkshire Dales. On the fictional front there is a chance to discover whether there is life after Morse. Not apparently for John Thaw, who came a cropper trying to be charming to the French in the ill-fated A Year in Provence. Now his old side-kick Kevin Whately gets his chance as an ambitious rural doctor in Peak Practice. Whether he can lift what looks like another series of emotional dramas set in a pretty landscape into anything memorable only time and the ratings can tell. (ITV at 8.30). Finally Channel 4 at 8.30 has a re-run of the medical comedy Surgical Spirit. Hypochondriacs might be best directed towards the repeat run for The Men's Room (BBC 1 at 10.15) which shows off healthy bodies.</p>

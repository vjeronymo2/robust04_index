			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--Cairo dailies in their 26  February editions highlight the horrendous crime a Jewish  settler committed in the city of Hebron in the occupied West  Bank. The dailies dedicate their front page headlines to reports  on the tragedy.    Draped in black, AKHBAR AL-YAWM's headline says "Massacre in  the Ibrahimi Mosque."    In its commentary, the paper says that the goal of the  Israeli extremists was to deal a fatal blow to peace. It adds  that this massacre should not pass unnoticed; we should pause  long over it to ask Israel and the world many questions that  need answering: What is meant by preserving security in the  Middle East region? Is it Israel's security alone? Where is  the Palestinians' security? And is it reasonable to leave the  destiny of the honorable Jerusalem in the hands of Israeli  extremists who determine who enters it and who gets out, who  lives and who dies?    AKHBAR AL-YAWM says that every Muslim and Christian in the  world must strongly condemn this barbaric crime. The world  should not content itself with condemnations; it should seek  ways to return holy places to their owners instead of leaving  them in the hands of those who cannot protect them and who let  armed extremists and crazy persons kill innocent people at dawn,  AKHBAR AL-YAWM says.    In its editorial, AL-AHRAM says this dreadful massacre is,  first and foremost, the responsibility of the Israeli  Government. It is not possible to claim that a crazy settler  committed it of his own accord.    The paper notes that there are precedents that fall into the  same category. Israel claimed that the person who set fire to  the al- Aqsa Mosque before was mentally unstable, AL-AHRAM says,  adding that a number of Palestinian laborers working in Israel  were killed a few years back and the Israeli authorities claimed  that the murderer was mentally unstable.    The paper asks if Palestinian blood has become so cheap that  dozens of fasting Palestinians should be killed as they  performed dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. Is it reasonable  that the Israeli Government's only reaction should be just a  statement appealing to Palestinians not to take revenge, the  paper asks.    AL-AHRAM affirms that Egypt will take a clear-cut stand when  the UN Security Council considers this barbaric aggression.    AL-JUMHURIYAH's main headline says "The Martyrdom of 61  Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque."    The paper highlights Egypt's condemnation of this heinous  massacre and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's call for an  emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to take the proper  measures to protect the Palestinian people.    In its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH writes that this massacre  will burden the international community with the big  responsibility of insuring security for the Palestinian people,  who suffer daily as a result of the Israeli occupation practices.    The paper adds that this massacre once again emphasizes the  need to use fair logic, observe human rights, and implement the  international resolutions that call for Israel's withdrawal from  the occupied Arab territories and for protecting the  Palestinians' right to confront the unheeding, continuous  Israeli oppression that goes on with the support and  encouragement of the United States, which is keen to supply the  Israeli Army with the most sophisticated weapons.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Washington keen for Mexican oil reform THE US is likely to push for a substantial liberalisation of Mexico's oil sector as part of the free-trade negotiations between the two countries, but will fall short of demanding changes to the Mexican constitution, according to a document from the US industry sector advisory committee on energy trade policy matters. Under the Mexican constitution, hydrocarbon ownership is limited to the Mexican nation. However, current practice allows Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, to hire private sector oil companies in exploration and drilling on condition that the contract signed is a service one - that is, that payment received does not depend on oil found. Nevertheless, in a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, the advisory committee says: 'Mexico has an unofficial, yet effective, ban on American land drilling rigs.' Offshore drilling contracts, says the report, are hampered by the need to use middlemen, and it is 'extremely difficult to obtain work even with an agent'. The advisory committee calls for a substantial liberalisation of existing laws and regulations in Mexico, saying this would 'increase the value of its (Mexico's) hydrocarbon resources'. This reform could be carried out within the current constitution. 'The US industry has demonstrated great flexibility in developing contractual arrangements for oil and gas exploration and production to accommodate a variety of legal, political and economic situations,' the letter goes on. 'If Mexican authorities are interested in obtaining outside participation in upstream activities, contractual arrangements could be developed which would meet their constitutional requirements, assure Mexico favourable investment returns, and provide US companies with incentives necessary for participation.' While Mexico's constitution limits ownership of oil to the nation, it is only the regulation which governs the constitutional article that rules out risk-sharing exploration contracts. The report highlights other areas that block foreign investment. Service stations and refineries in Mexico, it says, are solely owned by Pemex. The report concludes: 'The downstream sector should be open to foreign investment, as it is in the US and Canada. Such investments will bring necessary technology to address environmental problems.'</p>

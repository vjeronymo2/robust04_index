According to the latest Ifo economic climate test, the prospects  for the next six months are better than they have been in a long  time. The situation in the east is different; industry there  considers the situation and prospects to be much worse.    The only point on which companies in both parts of Germany  agree is that they see increasing hopes of higher exports.  <H5>  Industry in Western Germany </H5>   On the basis of the reports for its monthly test, the  Munich-based Ifo Economic Research Institute has concluded that  in the old laender, more orders were received than a month ago.  While output remained the same, it was possible to somewhat  reduce stocks. Hardly any companies are considering cutting back  on production. Prices remained stable.    The situation regarding producer goods worsened again, but  the outlook for the future of exports improved. In engineering  above all, production plans indicate that the recession is  subsiding. The signs are that there will also be an improvement  in the precision mechanics and optical instruments sectors.  Manufacturers of producer goods in the electrical engineering  sector remained skeptical, and manufacturers of delivery  vehicles and trucks complained about declining demand.    The situation is not quite as bad as it was for  manufacturers  of preproducts, and prospects were better for the chemical  industry above all. In the case of hard goods, business remains  bad, although there is more confidence about the future.  Manufacturers of hard goods state that the current trend is a  downward one.  <H5>  Industry in Eastern Germany </H5>   Orders for manufacturing industry in the new laender just  reached last month's level and no more. Companies continue to  complain about poor sales, difficulties with finance, and poor  technical equipment.    In the case of producer goods, the situation has grown worse  and expectations are more pessimistic. Only the shipbuilding  industry is satisfied. The food, drinks, and tobacco industries  are still experiencing a recession, and for the first time since  1993, those who take a negative view are in the majority.    In the primary commodities and capital goods sectors, every  fifth plant reports good prospects, but states that the overall  situation is as bad as the end of the year. The consumer good  sector described the situation as "almost satisfactory."  Confidence regarding the future has somewhat declined.  <H5>  The Construction Industry </H5>   There is confidence in the construction industry in both the  old and the new laender. In the west, orders have somewhat  increased compared to the previous year, from 2.9 months to 3.1  months. The upward trend primarily stems from surface  engineering, from housing construction to be more precise.  Nothing has changed in the construction of industrial  facilities, and the state is placing fewer orders.    In eastern Germany, the construction situation has worsened  because of seasonal factors. Nevertheless, almost two-thirds of  respondents were satisfied. The next six months appear to be  more positive, and 20 percent are counting on good business.  Capacity utilization stands at 67 percent, which is once again  above the previous year's level. Companies in the surface  construction field are pleased and optimism is spreading. In  the civil engineering sector, negative views prevailed once  again. In the prefabricated construction sector, the situation  has become much worse once again, although a much more positive  view is being taken of the future.  <H5>  The Wholesale Trade </H5>   The situation is once again bad for wholesalers in the west,  in January, just as in December, they failed to obtain the same  level of sales as a year ago. The sector also expects demand to  decline over the next six months. Only sales of hard goods were  described as less disheartening, with only 20 percent of  companies registering fewer sales than a year ago, compared to  40 percent in December.    The business climate for the wholesale trade in the east  grew much worse. Almost one-fifth of companies still want to  reduce personnel over the next few months. However, there is a  noticeable increase in confidence regarding future expectations,  and the optimism is primarily based on the prospects for sales  of raw materials, semi, capital goods, and food, drink and  tobacco products. In the case of wholesalers of consumer goods,  those that have been the worst affected are in clothing and  footwear: 70 percent recorded lower sales than a year ago.  <H5>  The Retail Trade </H5>   Consumer sales were bad throughout Germany in January. In  the west, they were still somewhat more negative than in  December and were "poor once again" in eastern Germany. Sales  were markedly below the previous year's levels. To keep the  decline in perspective, it should be borne in mind that this  year many end of season sales will not take place until February.    In the west, retail sales of consumer goods were somewhat  less worse than a month ago and sales were not quite so far  below the levels of a year ago. Sales were disappointing for  hardware, glass, porcelain, ceramics, lighting, electrical  goods, including audiovisual equipment. Sales were also  unsatisfactory for watches, jewelry, and office equipment,  although in the case of the latter, there are signs of an  improvement. In addition to the furniture trade, the automobile  sector also reported an improvement, although negative views  were still in the majority. Following a drop in demand in  January, retail traders in the food, drinks, and tobacco sectors  now expect demand to pick up.    In the east German retail trade sector, the situation for  employees will continue to worsen: As in the previous month,  one-third of companies want to reduce staffing levels.</p>

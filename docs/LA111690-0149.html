			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH EXPECTATIONS ARE HIS FOE;  </P> <P> RAMS: A YEAR AGO, TOP DRAFT PICK BILL HAWKINS TORE A KNEE LIGAMENT. NOW, THE  COACHING STAFF IS TURNING UP THE HEAT ON THE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.  </P> <P> Doug Reed watches Bill Hawkins in practice every day, and what he sees makes  him shake his head with empathy.  </P> <P> What he sees is a young defensive lineman whom Reed says probably won't be  physically ready to meet his coaches' high expectations until next season.  </P> <P> And what Reed, an eight-year veteran defensive lineman, also sees is a proud  player who won't admit it to himself, who wants to play so badly that he is  hurting his career.  </P> <P> "It seems like he's really being pushed, and I really don't believe that he's  ready," Reed said. "I think if he was in his fifth, sixth, seventh year, he'd  say, 'I just can't go. I just can't go.'  </P> <P> "Because when we go out there and you're not able to do your best, you're being  judged for what you're doing out there and people who really don't know what  he's going through are saying, 'The kid's a No. 1 draft pick, he can't even  rush the passer. . . . '  </P> <P> "If the guy is healthy, I know he can be the type of guy they thought he  would."  </P> <P> It has been almost year since Hawkins tore a ligament in his left knee, and the  Rams' coaching staff this week has clearly stepped up the pressure on Hawkins  to start playing with fire.  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said this week that the Rams have concluded it is time for  Hawkins to find a role. Just last week, Hawkins was one of two players the Rams  deactivated. In the exhibition season, Hawkins had been counted on to be a  starter, only to disappoint with his play.  </P> <P> "I think we've made the decision that he's healthy," said Robinson, who also  added that Hawkins has "obviously floundered" so far this season.  </P> <P> Hawkins, for his part, declined an interview request Thursday, saying he had to  go to a meeting.  </P> <P> "You talk to the guy," Reed said, "you say, 'Hey, Billy, if you're hurt you  shouldn't really be out here, really.'  </P> <P> "It's like taking a test before you study -- it just doesn't work. You don't  give yourself the benefit of the doubt. The man can only give what he has. He  can't give his potential, he can only give what he has."  </P> <P> Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said he understands that Hawkins is still  feeling the effects of the injury, and that the team expects him to make a full  comeback eventually.  </P> <P> "It's probably a lack of confidence as much as anything, either consciously or  subconsciously, and what we're trying to do is work through that," Shurmur  said. "And he'll work through it, it's just a matter of he and us recognizing  we've got to put some extra effort into it. There's no reason he can't be the  same guy he was before he was injured.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we're going to get him in a position where we can get him in a  ballgame and he'll be productive. He needs that and we need that. We're just  accelerating the program a little bit."  </P> <P> Dexter Manley as a Ram? It might be possible.  </P> <P> Manley, the longtime Redskin defensive end, is scheduled to have a hearing with  NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue today about lifting his lifetime ban for  substance abuse. Tagliabue is expected to make a ruling by Monday, and reports  in Washington indicate that the commissioner is expected to grant Manley's  request -- one year after the ban was ordered.  </P> <P> If Manley is reinstated, team sources have told the Washington Post, it is  almost certain Manley will be promptly released by the Redskins, who are said  to be weary of the entire affair.  </P> <P> And if this scenario unfolds, Robinson said the Rams would have to be  interested -- cautious, but interested -- in Manley, who is a proven pass  rusher.  </P> <P> Robinson also said that before the Rams, who would be in prime waiver-wire  position to claim him, moved to acquire Manley, they would have to make sure he  is clean and enthusiastic about playing for them.  </P> <P> "Those things demand investigation once you decide to do something," Robinson  said. "There wouldn't be any reason we wouldn't (be interested). (But) we'd  need some information."  </P> <P> Last summer, Manley said if the Redskins didn't want him, he'd prefer playing  for the Raiders or the Dolphins.  </P></p>

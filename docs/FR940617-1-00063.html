			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a second set of experiments (Ref. 10), the same authors assessed the effectiveness of three antiseptic formulations, including povidone-iodine, and an unmedicated soap in the removal of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. aureus, S. saprophyticus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from contaminated fingertips. Under conditions similar to those in the previous study, povidone-iodine demonstrated a 3-log reduction in the baseline number of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. aureus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which was significantly superior to the log reduction demonstrated by the unmedicated soap. Povidone-iodine produced an average 2.1 log reduction in the number of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. saprophyticus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and a 2.8 reduction in the number of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . However, neither of these reductions was significantly different from the reductions produced by the unmedicated soap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rotter (Ref. 11) evaluated the influence of differences in two testing methodologies on the demonstration of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine. One test method used is the standard test method (Vienna) for the evaluation of drug products for hygienic disinfection adopted by the Austrian and German Societies for Hygiene and Microbiology. In this test model, the release of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from the finger tips of artificially contaminated hands was determined before and after a 1-minute wash with povidone-iodine. The second model, based on agency recommendations for the testing of health-care personnel handwashes, evaluated the release of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from all surfaces of artificially contaminated hands by the glove juice sampling method before and after a 1 minute wash with the ingredient. These comparisons showed no significant difference in the reduction factor produced by povidone-iodine when tested with the two methods. Povidone-iodine when tested by the Vienna test method produced a 3.3 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction from the baseline count. When tested by the second method, the ingredient produced a 3.2 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rotter (Ref. 11) also used the Vienna test method to assess the effectiveness of rubbing antiseptics onto the hands versus washing with an antiseptic. Two povidone-iodine containing formulations were included in the assessment. A watery solution of povidone-iodine with 1 percent available free iodine rubbed onto the skin produced a 4 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction. Washing with a detergent formulation of the ingredient produced a 3.2 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction. However, this reduction was not statistically different from the reduction produced by washing with a nonantiseptic soap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rotter, Koller, and Wewalka (Ref. 12) used the Vienna test model to assess the effectiveness of a povidone-iodine liquid soap preparation (containing 0.75 percent available free iodine) for hygienic hand disinfection. The subjects' hands were contaminated by immersing them up to the mid-metacarpals in a broth culture of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The hands were allowed to air dry for 3 minutes prior to a pretreatment sampling. Sampling was accomplished by rubbing the finger tips of each hand for 1 minute on the bottom of a Petri dish containing a phosphate buffer sampling solution with neutralizers. After a 2-minute wash with the povidone-iodine or liquid soap followed by a 20-second rinse, the hands were again sampled. Average log values of the counts from the right and left hands of each subject were calculated, and the difference (log reduction factor) was determined. The povidone-iodine liquid soap formulation produced a 3.2 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction in the transient organisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wade and Casewell (Ref. 13) evaluated the residual effectiveness of povidone-iodine against two clinical isolates associated with hospital outbreaks of infection. An initial determination of the survival of the test organisms on untreated hands of three subjects was made by contaminating the subjects' finger tips with either of the test organisms and sampling the individual fingers immediately after contamination and at 1, 3, 10, and 30 minutes. The subjects' hands were then pretreated by performing three 30-second washes at 5 minute intervals with various alcoholic and aqueous antiseptic test formulations, including a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation and an unmedicated bar soap. The contamination and sampling procedure was repeated as before. All formulations were tested against both organisms. The median value of the log counts for the three subjects as each sampling was plotted against time. The survival curves for both organisms on hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and on hands with no pretreatment were similar. Pretreatment with povidone-iodine resulted in counts that were consistently less than for the untreated hands and for the hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and water for both organisms. After 30 minutes, hands pretreated with the povidone-iodine formulation demonstrated a 2.5 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction in the number of viable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Enterococcus faecium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and a 3.9 reduction in the number of viable <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Enterobacter cloacae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency concludes that these data demonstrate the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent for use as a health-care personnel handwash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> published <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  studies referenced in the submitted data and in the published literature (Refs. 1 and 14 through 19) have evaluated the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although the procedures followed are different from those in the previous FDA testing procedures (43 FR 1210 at 1244) and from those proposed in &sect;333.470 of this amended tentative final monograph, the essential criteria have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

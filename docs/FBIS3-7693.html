In response  to the question, the prime minister said, "Each ministry and  agency is now studying the concrete ways possible within its  administrative jurisdiction to deal with the economic  sanctions." The prime minister also stressed that "Japan will  have to carry out complete preparations." In this way, the  prime minister made it clear that the government is now studying  a wide range of measures to deal with the economic sanctions and  to maintain public peace and order in Japan.    During the session, Sadao Yamahana, the minister in charge  of  political reform from the Social Democratic Party, was asked how  he will deal with the issue of North Korea's nuclear development  program. In response, Mr. Yamahana echoed the prime minister's  statement, saying, "As a cabinet member, I will deal with the  issue in a responsible manner within the limits of the  Constitution."    Testifying before the session, Shigetake Ogata, Public  Security Investigation Agency director general, stated, "Of the  ethnic Koreans residing in Japan, approximately 247,000 have  some relationship with the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan, and approximately 56,000 of them are  formally affiliated with the pro-North Korean organization in  Japan." As for the amount of their remittances to North Korea,  Mr. Ogata said, "We possess no accurate measure of the  remittances," but he added, "rumors have it that the amount  ranges from 60 billion yen to 80 billion yen a year."

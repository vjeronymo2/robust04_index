			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE CITED BY AQMD FOR IMPROPER ASBESTOS HANDLING  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District cited the city of Lawndale this  week for improperly handling asbestos materials during the demolition of three  city-owned buildings last month.  </P> <P> The city could be fined up to $25,000 a day as a result of its mishandling of  the hazardous material during the three-day demolition, which occurred June  26-28 at 167th Street and Osage Avenue, according to AQMD officials.  </P> <P> Laboratory tests showed that samples of tile from the demolition site had a 37%  asbestos content, according to district spokesman Tom Eichhorn.  </P> <P> The amount of asbestos that may have been released into the air could not be  determined because it was not until June 30 that the AQMD received complaints  about the problem, Eichhorn said. By that time, he said, "the dust had  settled."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delayed Effect  </P> <P> Asbestos has been known to cause cancer and is regarded as particularly  insidious because it often does not produce symptoms until many years after the  initial exposure. Its handling is regulated by federal guidelines contained in  the "National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants," officials said.  </P> <P> Researchers do not know how hazardous a brief exposure to asbestos can be,  according to AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly.  </P> <P> "Science has found no one threshold of exposure below which you are safe from  getting asbestos-related diseases," Kelly said.  </P> <P> Lawndale City Manager Jim Arnold said Tuesday he did not wish to comment on the  citation until he had an opportunity to review it. AQMD officials said the  citation was sent to the city by certified mail on Monday.  </P> <P> In earlier interviews, city officials said they decided to undertake the  demolition after a contractor who had been hired to do the job failed to show  up. Arnold said that he and Public Works Director Jim Sanders, a civil  engineer, had inspected the site before demolition and found no evidence that  asbestos was present.  </P> <P> Specially licensed contractors are normally called in to handle asbestos  removal. Among the special procedures they employ is wetting down materials so  that asbestos fibers are not released into the air, according to the AQMD.  </P> <P> The one-page notice of violation, made available to The Times, cites the city  of Lawndale for four failures to:  </P> <P> *Comply with federal requirements for the containment and removal of asbestos  materials;  </P> <P> *Provide AQMD officials with a notice, 10 days in advance, of plans to demolish  the three storage structures;  </P> <P> *Properly control asbestos emissions during demolition;  </P> <P> *Deposit asbestos-containing waste materials at a designated waste disposal  site.  </P> <P> Eichhorn said that the AQMD's chief prosecutor's office will be reviewing the  case in the next few weeks and could handle the violations in one of three  ways.  </P> <P> The case could be resolved by negotiating a settlement, by filing a civil  lawsuit, or by prosecuting it in the criminal courts, Eichhorn said. Many cases  are resolved by a settlement, he said. The maximum penalty that could be  imposed is $25,000 a day, he said.  </P> <P> It is up to the chief prosecutor whether Lawndale's case would be viewed as one  violation or whether the fine would be tripled for the three days during which  the demolition took place, Eichhorn said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lawndale residents who live near the demolition site are worried  about the impact the improper asbestos removal could have on their health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surfaces Covered With Dust  </P> <P> June Mouzas, a supermarket checker who lives next door to the demolition site  with her 86-year-old mother, said she has spent her vacation cleaning the house  to remove any possible trace of asbestos. Because neighbors received no advance  notice of the demolition, they left their windows open and inside surfaces  became covered with dust, she said.  </P> <P> "I've taken down all the curtains and bedspreads and washed everything," she  said. "I've stripped everything down I could, washing the walls and even  painting them. I just hope everything will be OK."  </P> <P> Another neighbor, air cargo worker George Norman, said he is not sure what the  AQMD ruling will ultimately mean to him, his wife and their 2 1/2-year-old son,  Joshua.  </P> <P> "What I want to know is, is my family OK or not?" he said in a telephone  interview Tuesday. "The hard part about this is that it is a long-term  situation. We may not be sick today, or tomorrow, but who knows what will  happen down the line?"  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Mexico's economic growth slows Mexico's economy grew by 2.6 per cent last year, slightly below the government's latest forecast, with growth slowing sharply in the last quarter to 1.9 per cent on an annual basis, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. According to government figures, growth slowed from 1991's 3.6 per cent despite a strong increase in total investment of 13.9 per cent and in private investment of 20.4 per cent. Such investment failed to stimulate growth further because of rapid depreciation of existing capital stock.</p>

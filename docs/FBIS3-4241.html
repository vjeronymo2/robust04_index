The programme, drafted by the State Planning Commission,  involves importing advanced technology and equipment valued at  some $30 billion.    A large part of the new technology will be used to develop  24  key agricultural projects during the 1994-2000 period.    However, the $30 billion buying list also covers other  sectors, including energy, machinery and electronics, chemicals,  transportation, metallurgy and post and telecommunications.    The money to support the immense purchase will come mainly  from State foreign exchange reserves and the financial coffers  of relevant departments and local governments -- in addition to  overseas commercial credits and soft loans from foreign  governments and international financial institutions, government  officials said.    The agricultural technology and equipment will be used for  projects across China, including Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian,  Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Liaoning and Gansu Provinces and  the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    The key agricultural projects will focus on integrating  farming, animal husbandry, fisheries and forestry with  processing and environmental protection in the grain-rich Henan,  Sichuan, Fujian, Hainan, Jilin Provinces and the Liaohe River  region of Liaoning Province.    Also high on the agenda are vital irrigation projects such  as  the delta projects for the Yellow River, Huaihe and Haihe  Rivers; the irrigation programme of the southen Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region; the Tongyu River irrigation engineering  project in Jiangsu Province; and the farmland irrigation project  in Hubei and Hunan provinces.    The imported technology will also be introduced to help  State  farms in Guangdong Province develop tropical crops. The Bohai  Bay aquaculture project and the national agricultural-technology  popularization programme are also targeted for imports.    Other recipients will include the compound-fodder project;  the grain storage, transportation and market development  project; and the second-stage afforestation project.    Additionally, the programme covers the ongoing Taihu Lake  flood-protection project in Jiangsu Province; the second-stage  red-soil development project in South China; and the Loess  Plateau soil-erosion protection and agricultural development  project of Northwest China.    Finally, part of the imported techniques and equipment will  be used for the nationwide seed-breeding development project;  agricultural development along the Hexi Corridor in Gansu  Province; and poverty alleviation programmes in Guizhou and  Yunnan Provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.</p>

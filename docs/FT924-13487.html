			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (6): Partners put safety first - The Siemens-Framatome venture THE big vendors of nuclear power equipment will tell anyone prepared to listen that they remain confident about the long-term future of nuclear energy as an important source of electricity generation. Despite the present difficult market conditions virtually worldwide, suppliers are still spending heavily to stay in the race, and thus prove - eventually - that their beliefs are not merely empty rhetoric. But designing a new generation of nuclear power plant has always been a long-term affair, and with so few business opportunities, it is becoming increasingly necessary for suppliers to plan ahead in co-operation with each other. That was the background to Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France collaborating in 1989 in the field of pressurised water reactors (PWRs) through the creation of their joint subsidiary Nuclear Power International (NPI). Three years later, the project is nearing the end of an important first phase that has already illustrated the immense challenges of designing a new generation of PWRs, but has also shown the benefits of European co-operation in a market where a handful of players are determined to last out the present rough patch. By linking two leading reactor suppliers in Europe, the venture would have been important for the industry even if it had remained limited to its original terms - the marketing of PWR units based on the existing technology of the two parent companies and the joint development of the next generation of PWR units for export. But, says Dr Bruno Baumgartl, NPI's managing director, both Siemens and Framatome realised that the new PWR could not be designed without feedback from the German and French utilities which operated PWRs, or without co-operation from both licensing authorities. Yet Electricite de France had already started a long-term programme, REP 2000/N4+, for a new generation of PWRs, while several German utilities had signed an agreement with Siemens in 1989 jointly to define a concept for future PWR units. This was known as the Planungsauftrag. It was clear, therefore, that having three development programmes was a potentially huge waste of resources, and after a series of discussions in 1991 it was agreed to merge the available results from the two national programmes with the NPI development programme. What has emerged, therefore, looks much more logical: a joint development programme called EPR - European Pressurized Water Reactor - which in France will be the successor of the N4 series, in Germany will replace the Konvoi design, and elsewhere will be NPI's reference for export. The design concept is an essentially evolutionary development from the reactors built by Framatome and Siemens in the past, and, says Dr Baumgartl, there is not much that can be done to improve on the performance of these plants in terms of output. A nuclear power plant has to be competitive in comparison to possible fossil-fuelled plants, which is only possible with a capacity greater than 1,000MW. And with 1,400MW nuclear units now being operated with success in the European grid, there was no reason to return to a smaller size. So NPI is basing its concepts on a power output of 1,450MW, corresponding to the N4 units under construction in France. The main focus of efforts is on safety, to help facilitate public acceptance of nuclear power and thus the commercial prospects for the EPR. NPI is working on a two-fold strategy, of which the first is to improve the preventive level of the traditional 'defence in depth' approach as compared to existing products. The target is to reduce the chance of a core melt - the worst thing that can happen to a nuclear power station - to less than one in 1m per year for internal events, while no 'family of events' should be more than 10 per cent of this figure. 'This is the conventional way to make improvements,' says Dr Baumgartl. 'But it would not be sufficient to improve the acceptability of nuclear power in the public mind.' The second part of the strategy, therefore, is to assume the worst case scenario and mitigate its effects so that radioactive releases can be limited to the plant or nearby. This emphasis, naturally, focuses attention on the reactor building design and safety systems, as with any nuclear power plant. But it also points to the importance for NPI of co-operating with German and French licensing authorities to achieve common standards. NPI is now presenting proposals to authorities in both countries to achieve a harmonisation of safety rules. Although it cannot be said that one country's rules are generally tougher than the other's, there are different means to achieve the same goals, says Dr Baumgartl. The harmonisation challenge is one reason for the project's extended timescale. The first phase of the project, determining a 'joint technological concept', should be completed by the end of this year or the first quarter of next year. A second phase of work to establish a basic design phase will begin in April, and will be paid for by the utilities. Construction licence applications could then be made to authorities in both countries in 1995, with construction beginning in 1998. Dr Baumgartl's hope is that, by then, sentiment towards nuclear power will have changed in NPI's favour. Although forecasting is difficult, he says some nuclear plants will have to be replaced in France, while the debate in Germany about the greenhouse effect could work in the nuclear industry's favour. The two home markets will be important for NPI. 'For a new product, or one developed from previous products, it is necessary to have domestic orders so that it can be sold abroad,' says Dr Baumgartl - making the decision to merge the three PWR projects all the more sensible commercially.</p>

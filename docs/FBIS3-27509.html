			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wen Jie (5113 1240): "Zhou Nan Calls For </F> Common Efforts To Ensure China's Resumption of Sovereignty Over  Hong Kong in 1997 and the Implementation of the `One Country,  Two Systems' Policy"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This  afternoon, the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY hosted  a Spring Festival cocktail party in the Maxim Palace Restaurant  in Causeway Bay's World Trade Center. Several Hong Kong  celebrities were invited and the atmosphere was warm.    In his speech, Director Zhou Nan said: Over the past year,  under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the instructions of  the 14th CPC National Congress, China has made world-renowned  achievements in its reform, opening up, and modernization. Its  GNP has grown by 13 percent, ranking it first in the world. In  the past year, China has witnessed sensible policies, harmonious  human relations, political tranquility, and stability in popular  sentiment; the country's comprehensive strength has increased,  and its international position has improved. In the New Year,  we will continue to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, widen  opening up, promote development, maintain stability, make an  important step forward in establishing the socialist market  economic structure, implement a number of major reform measures,  and bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy [as received]  national economic development. We will usher in the 45th  founding anniversary of the PRC with more brilliant achievements  in our modernization drive.    Over the past year, Hong Kong's economy has further merged  with the motherland's economy. The mainland's vigorous  development has enabled Hong Kong to overcome all kinds of  negative factors and to maintain a comparatively high economic  growth rate, which stands at appropriately 5.5 percent. This  fully suggests that the motherland's stability and development  serve as the most solid foundation for Hong Kong's prosperity  and stability. We are completely convinced that, in the New  Year, exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, and  other fields between Hong Kong and the mainland will further  develop and move a step higher.    Over the past year, we have sincerely hoped that China and  Britain would reach agreement on Hong Kong's 1994-1995 electoral  arrangements on the basis of "three conformities," and we have  done our utmost toward this end. The British side, however, has  obstinately persisted in the erroneous stance of the "three  violations" and brazenly submitted parts of its constitutional  reform package to the Legislative Council at a time when no  agreement had been reached between the two sides. As a result,  the Sino-British talks have ruptured, and the good wishes of the  Chinese side and the Hong Kong compatriots have completely  fallen through. Now people can understand more explicitly that  the British side is completely responsible for the breakdown of  the talks. However, Hong Kong's destiny is, after all,  controlled by the great Chinese people, including the Hong Kong  compatriots. In no way can the British side's uncooperative  attitude stop the wheel of history from moving forward. In the  future, alongside the Hong Kong compatriots, we will actively  make all kinds of preparations for the establishment of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region firmly in accordance with the  "one country, two systems" policy and the provisions of the  Basic Law. We enjoy the backing of the powerful motherland and  the effective support of the Chinese people. We possess all the  necessary conditions to overcome all sorts of obstacles to our  progress, to bring about a steady transition in 1997, and to  ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.    There is only a little more than three years until the  historic moment of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Let us  unite as one, work with one heart and one mind, remove all  obstacles, ensure China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong  Kong in 1997 and the comprehensive implementation of the "one  country, two systems" policy, and work hard for the fulfillment  of this great and glorious mission entrusted to us by history.  The future of our great motherland and Hong Kong is infinitely  bright.</p>

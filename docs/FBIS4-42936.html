			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Alexis Papakhelas] </F>   [Text] Greek foreign policy remains attached to the Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. At  the same time, Turkey manages--despite all its problems--to be  strengthened both strategically and politically by Washington.  The Clinton Administration is showing already, with very clear  moves, that it is determined to continue arming Turkey  excessively and even ignore its own concerns over the imbalance  being created in the Aegean and the danger of a Greek-Turkish  conflict. It is interesting that at such a time, when many U.S.  analysts are concerned about the possibility of a "hot summer"  in Greek-Turkish relations, that Washington is making new  efforts to strengthen the Turkish war machine.    U.S. officials revealed to I KATHIMERINI that the White  House  has decided to approve granting five or six KC-135  aircraft-tankers to Turkey. These are aircraft that can refuel  fighter planes of the Turkish Air Force and will extend their  range of action considerably. The decision was made by the  White House interagency committee before Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's visit to the U.S. capital, but was not announced to  prevent it from spoiling the climate of Greek-U.S. relations.    This decision has already been conveyed to Congress. While  it is not certain how many of these aircraft are involved, a  Pentagon official said that the number may be 10. The Turkish  Government will also have to pay a considerable amount of money  to modernize the aircraft, as some of them were built in the  1960's.    Another important development is President Clinton's  decision  to approve the transfer to Turkey of part of the money that was  collected by former President George Bush to strengthen the  Turkish armed forces. Mr. Bush had promised Turgut Ozal that he  would collect $3.5 billion from the Arab countries (Kuwait,  Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates) and the United States to  finance the program to build 100 additional F-16 planes for the  Turkish Air Force as well as for manufacturing F-16's for the  Egyptian Air Force.    This sum was what Ozal collected for Turkey's stance during  the Persian Gulf war. The United States contributed $500  million, but it is not yet clear what budget it came from or  whether it has been approved by Congress. It is certain that  President Clinton approved the transfer of $1.2 billion for the  strengthening of the Turkish war industry, apparently acting  under the commitment of his predecessor.    Undoubtedly, we have to face a de facto disassociation of  Washington's policy toward Ankara from the Athens-Washington  relations. The U.S. Government is exploiting the Greek-American  lobby's activity and the Greek foreign policy on the Skopje  issue to promote the long-term plans for the strengthening of  Ankara. As Senator Paul Sarbanes recently pointed out very  correctly, the Greek foreign policy's expanding fronts have  "tired" Congress and Washington in general.    However, Washington also shows "fatigue" on the Cyprus  issue,  which unfortunately has disappeared from the White House's list  of priorities. The Americans exerted pressure on UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali to delay the release of his report because  they wanted to give Rauf Denktas every opportunity to accept the  confidence-building measures [CBM]. State Department officials  insist--in briefings to Congress and during discussions with  Turkish counterparts--that the Greek Cypriot leaders also do not  really want the CBM's.    Consequently, the State Department leadership believes that  pressure on the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot side alone is  unfavorable and even... [ellipsis as published] unjust. Some  analysts go one step further and for the first time begin to  discuss a "final" scenario, which is based on the idea of  recognizing the "pseudostate" and giving an official status to  partition as quid pro quos for the return of all the Famagusta  area to the Greek Cypriot community. This scenario is even  being discussed at closed seminars and is the subject of  confidential reports, while the U.S. agencies are again  promoting the formula of a quadripartite conference to hold  negotiations on all aspects of the Cyprus issue.    It is a fact that Washington rules out the adoption of  measures against Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot community,  particularly at a time when it believes that Turkish Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller is facing serious domestic problems.    It is always noteworthy that the mechanism of Turkey's  supporters converts every development or problem into a reason  for the support of Turkey. The inability to solve the Kurdish  problem and the upsurge of Islamism make it necessary--according  to this logic--for even more political, economic, and strategic  strengthening of Turkey. The theory, which is being heard more  often in closed seminars, that "Turkey will be the next Iran"  concerns the Americans and urges them--in a rather strange  manner--to adopt even more pro-Turkish directions.    There should be no doubt that Washington takes its  relationship with Turkey very seriously. There is also no doubt  that the most important U.S. promises for the strategic  strengthening of Turkey were given during the Mitsotakis-Bush  idyll and that these promises "were cashed in" during the  Papandreou-Clinton idyll.</p>

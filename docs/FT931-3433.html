			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The Telegraph recommends purchase of Southam stake THE TELEGRAPH, the newspaper group 68 per cent-owned by Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group, has written to shareholders giving details of the proposed Pounds 72.3m purchase of a stake in Southam, the heavily-indebted and loss-making Canadian newspaper group, from Hollinger. The deal is subject to approval of shareholders other than Hollinger, a Canadian holding company, at a special meeting on March 30. The shares fell 3p to 330p. The Telegraph's independent directors, advised by NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which handled The Telegraph's flotation last summer, are recommending the deal. Shareholders with 8.3 per cent of the group's equity, more than a quarter of the non-Hollinger shares, have agreed to vote in favour. In the circular shareholders were told that the deal would dilute earnings in the short term, although not significantly, and that The Telegraph would not receive dividends from its investment 'until towards the end of 1994'. It expects to equity account the stake, which will be held through a joint company owned 50:50 with Hollinger. The independent directors said that the investment in Southam represented 'a unique opportunity'. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph, said it would be able to influence Southam through three directors nominated by Hollinger and The Telegraph. He said Southam would benefit from recovery in the Canadian economy, from improving its marketing and cutting overmanning - with advice from The Telegraph - and could sell its non-newspaper divisions. Hollinger agreed to buy the 22.5 per cent stake in Southam on November 8 last year at a cost of CDollars 258.6m (Pounds 145.2m), or CDollars 18.10 per share, a 15 per cent premium to the then market price. The deal was completed on January 8. The Telegraph will buy half that stake paying the same price as Hollinger did, although the Southam share price has since fallen to CDollars 13.50.</p>

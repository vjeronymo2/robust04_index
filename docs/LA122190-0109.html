			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY SHORT-CHANGED ON FUNDS, JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> Bolstering San Diego County's claim that the state has shortchanged it by tens  of millions of dollars in mental health funding, a local judge tentatively  ruled Thursday that the county has been deprived of its fair share of some of  those dollars.  </P> <P> In what county officials hailed as a significant decision that strengthens  their hand in their nearly 3-year-old lawsuit against the state, Superior Court  Judge Barbara Gamer tentatively decided that the state's method of distributing  mental health dollars violates a law governing such allocations.  </P> <P> "This is a step in the right direction, but it's only the first step," said  Deputy County Counsel Michael Poynor. "This ruling does not solve San Diego's  complete mental health needs. Only a complete restructuring of the financing  formula, so that every county gets its fair share -- nothing more and nothing  less -- will do that."  </P> <P> But an attorney for the state, emphasizing that Gamer's ruling is only  tentative and does not directly address the overall equity of the state's  mental health funding system, characterized Thursday's ruling as a relatively  small battle in a war that could have statewide implications.  </P> <P> "It sounds like the county is getting a little ahead of itself, because this is  not a final decision, and it does not even deal with the fair share and overall  fairness question," said state attorney Lesley Sive.  </P> <P> Similar to two 1986 lawsuits that San Diego filed against the state concerning  alleged inequities in the distribution of property taxes and other revenues,  the mental health suit stems from the county's complaint that its allocation of  state revenue for that purpose is also vastly inadequate.  </P> <P> Though county officials concede that the San Diego delegation's lack of  legislative clout in Sacramento contributed to the predicament, they argue that  unfair funding formulas -- and the state's failure to adhere to its own  guidelines -- have dramatically worsened the financial shortfall.  </P> <P> During earlier hearings, Poynor emphasized that San Diego receives $19 per  capita annually for mental health services, less than the statewide average of  $28 and far below the $62 per person awarded to San Francisco County. Since the  mid-1980s, the gap between San Diego's allocation and the statewide average has  cost the county about $20 million annually, Poynor said.  </P> <P> "Because of the state's funding discrimination, we have been prevented from  providing needed care to the mentally ill of this region," county Supervisor  George Bailey said. "The impact of this unfair situation can be seen on our  streets every day. This is legally and morally wrong."  </P> <P> Thursday's tentative decision came in the first phase of a two-part trial. In  the more critical second phase, scheduled to begin late next month, the county  will ask the court to rule on the legality of the state's overall mental health  funding formula, which county attorneys contend violates the equal protection  clauses of the state and federal constitutions.  </P> <P> The origin of Thursday's ruling is a 1986 state law specifying that any  additional mental health dollars beyond those then being received by counties  should go to under-funded counties such as San Diego. However, rather than  strictly comply with that measure -- an attempt to at least partly remedy  funding inequities -- the state actually has sent millions of additional  dollars to counties such as San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo, Napa and Alameda  that already receive allocations in excess of the statewide average, county  officials said.  </P> <P> In tentatively siding with the county on that question, Gamer ruled that the  state has, in fact, violated the provisions of that law.  </P></p>

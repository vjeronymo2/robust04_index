			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] The Zionist terrorists carried out a massacre  that claimed the lives of dozens of Arab Palestinians, as a part  of the policy of annihilation pursued by the Israelis against  the sons of the Arab Palestinian people. [passage omitted]    This massacre, which was committed by the Zionists inside  the  Tomb of the Patriarch in Hebron and in the middle of the blessed  month of Ramadan, coincides with what is being publicized as  peace with the Israelis, which led to direct negotiations  between Israelis and Arab sides in Washington. It also  coincides with direct talks between Israelis and officials from  the Fatah organization to implement what has been labelled as  the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Today's incident brought to light  the falsity of this alleged peace, and exposed the plot that is  being hatched, which is that what is taking places these days is  not peace, but a method to force the Arabs to submit  unconditionally, to destroy their nation, and annihilate their  people.    This massacre also confirms other facts, the most important  of which are: This massacre represents one aspect of the outcome  of the so-called Gaza-Jericho Agreement. What has been  committed by the Zionist occupiers represents the real terrorism  that has been condemned and denounced by all international norms  and treaties. This type of terrorism epitomizes the highest  level of human rights abuses, that the West boasts to safeguard  and protect. This begs the following question: What will the  West do about this abhorrent act of terrorism? What will the UN  Security Council do? This Security Council which is controlled  by Western countries that claim to hold the torch to combat  terrorism. These countries also level accusations of terrorism  against anyone who does not follow their policies and does not  succumb to their blackmail and orders.    The Israelis would not have continued to carry out their  barbaric massacres and their annihilation of the sons of the  Arab Palestinian people without the unlimited support lavished  on them by the West through a supply of arms and funds, and  through a policy of cover-up of their crimes and turning a blind  eye on their accumulated arsenals of weapons of mass  destruction. This policy falls within an alliance between the  Jews and the Christians against the Arabs and Islam. This  massacre would not have happened if we did not have some Arabs  who rushed to recognize their enemy and submit to it.</p>

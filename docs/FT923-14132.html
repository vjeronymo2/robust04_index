			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Russian ministries turn on Kozyrev A BITTER struggle erupted yesterday within the Russian government, as the ministries of defence and security turned on Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister - accusing him of doing the job of US intelligence in seeking security and defence reform. Their spokesmen rejected claims by Mr Kozyrev last week that a 'party of war' was operating in military circles and that security and defence officials were nurturing a coup. They said that local disturbances based on economic grievances were possible, however. They said Mr Kozyrev's call for 'radical reform' of the KGB and defence departments would destroy the professional competence of these agencies  - the aim of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Last week Mr Kozyrev also accused the Russian military of supplying the bulk of the arms being used in the conflict in Moldova and its breakaway region of Trans Dnestr, and asked - 'Why are the military deciding major political questions? When tanks turn into an independent political force, this spells catastrophe.' A ceasefire called in the Trans Dnestr region for Tuesday night was reported to have been violated several times yesterday, and the government of Belarus, one of the states which was to have sent a peace-keeping contingent, said it will not do so.</p>

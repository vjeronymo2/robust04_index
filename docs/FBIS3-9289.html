			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG)--The President of the  Assembly of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) Momcilo Krajisnik  said Tuesday that no one should take the responsibility of  unilaterally opening the Tuzla airfield, but that he feared that  anything was possible today.    Krajisnik said this in an interview to Radio Jagodina,  commenting the announcement of Moslem Radio Sarajevo that  Tuesday the airfield near Tuzla would be opened. Tuzla is a  Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    On Tuesday a U.N. plane landed on Tuzla airfield with the  U.N. Special Envoy for the Former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on  board. This was interpreted as the reopening of the airfield for  humanitarian flights.    The spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) Silvana Foa denied this stating that the Tuzla airfield  would not be opened before Bosnian Serbs and Moslems agreed on  the way the incoming cargo is to be controlled.    The Serb side has not reached a final agreement with the  Moslems on the opening of the Tuzla airfield, there is only an  agreement with the Russians on its opening under certain  conditions, negotiations on the subject are not over yet,  Krajisnik said.    Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and the Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reached an agreement early this  month in Moscow on the opening of the Tuzla airfield for  humanitarian needs. Fearing that the Moslems could use the  airfield to bring in arms the Serbs asked for the incoming cargo  to be checked by Russian peacekeepers and Serb observers.    The Tuzla military airfield was closed in May 1992, a month  after the war between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out.    Krajisnik said that on Wednesday the RS parliament would  examine how Bosnia-Herzegovina would be constituted, the future  relations with the Moslem-Croat federation and the platform of  the Serb side in the next round of talks.    Bosnian Croats and Moslems have signed an agreement in the  White House, under strong U.S. pressure, on the establishment of  a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on general  principles of its later confederation with the former Yugoslav  Republic of Croatia. The question of whether the Bosnian Serbs  will join the federation, insisted upon by Washington, has been  left open.    Stressing that the deputies cannot overlook the question of  the division of the territories between the Serb side and the  Moslem-Croat federation Krajisnik said that the "Serbs own 64  per cent of the territory and we shall insist on this actual  ownership in all subsequent talks".    He added however, that they were ready to agree to certain  concessions in the percentage of the territory if it meant that  compact areas would be created. "This is nevertheless far below  the 50 per cent of the territory spoken about by the U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher", the RS assembly  president said.</p>

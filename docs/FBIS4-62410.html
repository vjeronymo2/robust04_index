			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by GIA correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 15 May -- A mass rally was held outside the  building of the Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theater, where  there was an explosion during a performance today. Speakers at  the rally said an attempt had been made to wreck the  centuries-long brotherly relations between the Georgian and the  Armenian people. They urged not to yield to the provocations of  the enemies of both peoples and to oppose them with unity and  joint actions for the sake of peace in the Caucasus.    Sandro Kavsadze, chairman of the committee on inter-ethnic  relations and the protection of human rights of the Republic of  Georgia, made a statement describing the crime as "directed  against all of us and against Georgian statehood."</p>

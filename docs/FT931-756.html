			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Scots TUC urges peaceful demonstration at Timex UNIONS WERE last night making urgent efforts to avoid a repetition of last Monday's violent picketing outside the Timex factory in Dundee, where the US-owned company last month sacked and re-placed its workforce after a strike. This came as the Court of Session in Edinburgh granted a new interdict (injunction) to Timex limiting the number of pickets outside the plant to six and requiring picketing to be peaceful. The AEEU had appealed against a similar interdict granted to the company earlier in the month. Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trade Union Congress, urged people planning to take part in next Monday's demonstration to stay within the law and keep to the rules set by the AEEU engineering and electrical union, which is involved in the dispute. He said: 'We will not welcome anyone coming to Timex who does not accept the discipline of the AEEU. Anyone not prepared to do so should stay away.' The appeal, made after talks with Tayside police, was aimed at leftwing groups such as Scottish Militant Labour, which took part in last Monday's picketing in which 16 people were arrested when 600 demonstrators battled with police. But Scottish Militant Labour said it again planned to bus in supporters from other parts of Scotland to join the picket line on Monday and appealed to other groups to follow suit. Mr Tommy Sheridan, leader of Scottish Militant Labour, who was arrested in last Monday's clashes, said he would be in Dundee but not at the picket line. Last Tuesday he appeared in court accused of breach of the peace and was ordered not to go within a mile of the plant. At a news conference in Glasgow he quoted an appeal from Mr John Kydd, the sacked Timex union convener, for trade unionists, political parties 'and any individuals the length of breadth of Britain' to support the Monday picket. The violent picketing last Monday is embarrassing to the unions which, while backing the sacked workforce, see little chance of winning the dispute and do not wish to be associated with either Militant or violence. Last night Timex welcomed the STUC statement and said that if there was compliance with it and with the new interdict 'there ought to be no repetition of the violent and disorderly behaviour' to which its employees had been subjected.</p>

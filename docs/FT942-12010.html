			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Auditor liability must have limit Sir, The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants in its submission to the Department of Trade and Industry on auditors' liability has missed the point ('Accounting body warns over cap on audit liability', April 25). To argue that allowing auditors the right to negotiate a limit on liability would be anti-competitive, and therefore against the public interest, simply misunderstands the seriousness of the position. It is quite clear that, following some spectacular corporate collapses and the ensuing epidemic of legislation, the major firms are now facing claims of such size that one or more of them could be bankrupted. Insurance cover is no longer available and, unless the Companies Act is amended to allow auditors to negotiate an upper limit for lawsuits, some firms will go under. Incorporation has been mentioned as one solution but, while it would offer some protection to individuals, the company as an entity would still be at risk in the event of an excessive lawsuit. The consequences scarcely bear thinking about. Setting aside the mayhem it would cause in the accountancy profession, business would be badly damaged as companies would be unable to substantiate their accounts and so attract investment. This dislocation would continue for some time and by no stretch of the imagination could that be described as in the public interest. Let us be very clear, the major firms are not trying to shirk responsibility. We are very willing to accept our share of the blame, but not everyone else's share. It cannot be right that auditors are exposed to 100 per cent of a loss, whatever their proportion of the blame. What is most desirable - and equitable - is that the law on joint and several liability should be changed so that auditors only bear the costs of what is directly attributable to them. However, the Law Commission has made it clear that its workload makes this change most unlikely in the short term. In this event, all we are seeking is a modest change in the law to bring us into line with other professionals who already have the right to negotiate a limit on what they have to pay out. Pursuing the goal of free competition is laudable and one to which we subscribe. We do not believe limiting auditors' liability goes against this. What we do believe is that failure to change the law will damage industry as much, if not more than, the profession.

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Pru backs OFT over greater life costs disclosure PRUDENTIAL, the UK's largest life insurance company, yesterday broke ranks with the Association of British Insurers and supported the Office of Fair Trading's proposal to require much more disclosure about the cost of life products. Mr Mick Newmarch, the Pru's chief executive and a board member of the ABI, said: 'The need for the industry to become much more transparent is something I agree with.' The Pru was considering telling prospective customers more about costs than current rules require, he said. Such a move could force the Pru's competitors to follow - something many in the industry are reluctant to do now. Mr Newmarch's remarks, made at a press conference to announce the Pru's annual results, referred to the OFT's report last week which concluded that life companies do not tell consumers enough about their products to enable them to choose among products, companies or sales agents. The Treasury must consider the report and, if it agrees with its conclusions, will ask regulators to draft rules for a new disclosure regime. The ABI said last week it intended to urge the Treasury to reject the report. The ABI, however, yesterday appeared to be softening its stance. Mr Tony Baker, director of public affairs, said: 'There are reservations and we will be commenting to the Treasury and to the regulatory bodies. We've got to wait for our members to consider the report, but we will not take lightly going against anything the OFT has said.' The OFT proposals were also strongly endorsed yesterday by Mr Joel Joffe, founding director and former deputy chairman of Allied Dunbar, the UK's biggest unit-linked life insurer. Mr Joffe told the social security select committee at the House of Commons: 'It's ironic that the ABI has suddenly begun to express a concern over the costs of regulation to the consumer. There will be intense lobbying by the industry, allegedly in the interests of the consumer.' This is the second time in recent months that Mr Newmarch has attacked his industry's approach to regulation, arguing that it was undermining public confidence in insurance products generally and would harm sales in the long run. In November, he called for statutory regulation if self-regulation could not be made to work. Observer, Page 21 Lex, Page 22 Pru advances to Pounds 406m, Page 24</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / EU fetes democracy incarnate European leaders yesterday feted President Boris Yeltsin as the incarnation of a new Russia moving toward democracy and market reform. At a ceremony at the European Commissionm, Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, joined Mr Yeltsin in signing a political declaration promising greater economic and political co-operation which both sides described as historic. Mr Yeltsin said the declaration marked a further milestone ending the Cold War. 'Another Berlin Wall has fallen,' he said. But the declaration fell short of Mr Yeltsin's hopes of signing a comprehensive trade pact because of outstanding EU objections to Russian legislation restricting the operation of western banks, and internal disputes over the treatment of Russian nuclear-processed fuels. Commission officials predicted that final agreement would likely be reached in the next few days. The visiting Russian delegation had promised to scrap the restrictions on private banks within 12 months, one senior official said. Mr Yeltsin's visit, on the eve of Russia's parliamentary elections on Sunday, is believed to be the first by a Russian leader to Belgium since Peter the Great.</p>

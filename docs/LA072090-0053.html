			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW TAXES ARE PRECISELY WHAT DOCTOR DIDN'T ORDER;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THEY SAID AMERICA WASN'T SAVING ENOUGH. FACT IS, TOO MANY AMERICANS  CAN'T AFFORD TO SPEND ANYMORE; AND THOSE WHO CAN, DON'T.  </P> <P> Only yesterday, it seems, President Bush was pointing with pride to the  performance of the economy. Then overnight, his apologies for its slowdown  unsealed his lips on the sensitive subject of taxes.  </P> <P> Bush aired his alibi at his June 29 press conference. "We've had a much slower  economy than anybody predicted." Therefore, as he explained, revenues have  shrunk along with earnings.  </P> <P> The President's embarrassment parallels that suffered by Gov. Michael Dukakis  in 1988 when his "Massachusetts Miracle" collapsed into just another voodoo  show. The Massachusetts economy went bad when retail sales went bad. Sales-tax  collections dropped, and Dukakis' claims to fiscal responsibility were  discredited.  </P> <P> But Bush's advisers did not realize then that the failure that benefited them  in Massachusetts would catch up with them within two years throughout the  country. Accordingly, he has operated with no contingency plan to use once the  national economy confirmed the evidence that it is following Massachusetts into  a slump.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, eminent economists in academe were bombarding media and  policy-makers with warnings that America's consumers were over-borrowing and  overspending the country into a recession -- or worse. The cure they  recommended called for more savings, forced by taxes if necessary. The most  articulate of them have been Democratic, specifically those taken seriously by  Dukakis.  </P> <P> Oddly enough, the reason given by the President for his retreat on taxes proves  that this accusation is a bum rap. Indeed, he put the country on notice that it  would be better off today if consumers had all along borrowed and spent even  more.  </P> <P> Recessions have been given a number of definitions, such as "two successive  quarters of negative GNP." But the functional definition -- when consumers run  out of cash, credit and nerve -- is the best and simplest. They ran out of all  three before the 1989 Christmas shopping season. The President's complaint that  no one around him "predicted" the slowdown that has spread since then is an  understatement.  </P> <P> Of course, the President's advisers also have an alibi. They have been going by  the statistics. But to paraphrase what the President told that same press  conference about his own job, his advisers are paid to anticipate statistics.  Hard evidence of the slowdown has been surfacing for the better part of a year.  Since last September, businesses and property owners have been putting up hard  money to counter the claims of economists against supposed consumer profligacy.  Advertising has featured bargains calculated to lure consumer dollars out of  hiding. Quality stores routinely guarantee to meet price competition from  anywhere. Big-ticket items are to be had for "no down payment." Banks waive  credit scrutiny to move foreclosed homes.  </P> <P> Business overconfidence about consumer spending is the direct cause of every  economic downturn. Business managements can also offer their creditors and  stockholders an alibi for 1990's disappointing results. They can blame them on  the dogmatic obsession with the myth of consumer overconfidence held by their  economic advisers.  </P> <P> The economy is caught in the stalemate between those who would spend if they  could, and those who could spend but won't. Slowly but surely, financial  pressures from cost inflation and servicing debt have stalled or scuttled  discretionary spending by the gainfully employed. Now, suddenly, political  pressures have sharpened against Bush to increase Treasury collections. But  he's missed the boat on raising taxes. Now the economy is clearly seen to be  weakening.  </P> <P> Before the end of 1989, the moneyed minority had salted away personal holdings  of income-bearing cash reserves amounting to $2.65 trillion. The  pre-inflationary rule of prudent budgeting called for saving 25% of annual  income. Such a prodigious pool of idled liquidity approximates half of gross  national product. It's a lot of made money even by Japanese or German  standards. This accumulation challenges both the claims of economists and the  assumptions of budget summiteers.  </P> <P> Any taxes intended to cut consumption will cut revenues instead. Businesses  already wounded by price wars cannot hope to pass on tax increases aimed at  consumers or, to the contrary, absorb them. Tax increases speed up business  slowdowns.  </P></p>

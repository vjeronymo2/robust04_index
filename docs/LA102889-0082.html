			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN EXEMPLIFIES HOW S&amp;LS COLLAPSE, OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> The collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine may be the most costly  thrift failure on record, but the pattern of high-risk investments, rosy  accountant reports and efforts to wield political influence were painfully  familiar to federal regulators.  </P> <P> While the example set by Lincoln was "the worst of the worst," its downfall was  a replay of other catastrophic S&amp;L failures during the last five years,  according to testimony by William K. Black, regional counsel for the Office of  Thrift Supervision in San Francisco.  </P> <P> It was as simple as "ADC," Black told Congress on Thursday, referring to  Lincoln's heavy investments in risky "acquisition, development and  construction" loans to developers and virtual abandonment of the far safer,  traditional loans to single-family homeowners.  </P> <P> "A thrift was the perfect cash cow for a real estate developer," said Black,  who testified before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee,  which is investigating the Lincoln failure.  </P> <P> In his congressional testimony, Black noted that American Continental Corp. of  Phoenix, controlled by the family of Charles H. Keating Jr., was basically a  home builder when it acquired Lincoln in 1984.  </P> <P> Lincoln was seized by federal regulators on April 14, a day after its parent  company filed for bankruptcy court protection. Estimates of the cost of  cleaning up the mess have ranged as high as $2 billion, which would make it the  most expensive thrift failure in history.  </P> <P> Black, who along with other regional regulators in San Francisco tried to call  attention to Lincoln's problems two years before the government finally acted,  told Congress that Lincoln was a textbook case of thrift excess.  </P> <P> A typical Lincoln ADC loan, Black said, required no down payment by the  borrower and included funds for architect fees, developer fees and other costs  on top of the price of the property and construction expenses. In addition, the  borrower was not required to make principal payments for the first two to five  years of the loan.  </P> <P> "In other words, the borrower puts zero money in and walks away with money in  his pocket," the regulator said.  </P> <P> At the same time, the thrift would charge the borrower millions of dollars in  "points" and other fees that were added to the amount of the loan, along with  enough money to cover two years' worth of interest payments. Those charges were  then recorded on the thrift's books as income, even though no money had changed  hands, Black said.  </P> <P> Because commercial real estate projects are frequently speculative, with no  legally committed or financially capable buyer on hand, they are far riskier  than home loans.  </P> <P> "The typical ADC project that sank thrifts was scores of millions of dollars in  size," Black testified. "Yet hundreds of such loans were made with no loan  application, no credit checks, with no appraisal or feasibility study, with no  down payment and no personal guarantee" of repayment.  </P> <P> Even under the best of circumstances, Black noted, an ADC nothing-down loan is  an extraordinarily risky investment.  </P> <P> "When combined with poor underwriting, a serious loss is highly likely," he  said. "When fraud is involved, these ADC loans become almost total losses."  </P> <P> While conservatively run institutions would not make this kind of loan,  S&amp;Ls that did were able to charge higher-than-normal interest rates and  fees.  </P> <P> "Lenders willing to take on these garbage loans were generally troubled thrifts  or thrifts acquired by unscrupulous individuals," Black said.  </P> <P> The problem was compounded by friendly accountants who were willing to disguise  the true financial condition of thrifts by counting as income the fees and  interest payments charged on ADC loans rather than categorizing them properly  as direct investments.  </P> <P> In Lincoln's case, he said, a chief accountant for the Dallas office of Arthur  Young &amp; Co. who had worked on the S&amp;L's books was hired at a salary of  $1 million a year by American Continental.  </P> <P> "It is a sad fact that most of the worst losses (experienced by the  government's deposit insurance fund) were from thrifts that received 'clean'  audit opinions from Big 8 accounting firms prior to their failures," Black  said.  </P> <P> "Indeed, Lincoln is proof positive that any thrift in America could obtain a  clean audit opinion despite being grossly insolvent."  </P> <P> As a result, he said, such accounting methods ensured that an ADC loan would  appear profitable for the first two years -- until the time came for the  borrower to begin repaying with real money.  </P> <P> "If a thrift grew rapidly and put the great bulk of its assets into ADC loans,"  Black said, "it was guaranteed to report record profits, at least until the  first payments to be made by the borrowers were due."  </P> <P> Sham sales of dubious loans also helped these S&amp;Ls appear to be in good  shape, the regulator noted, along with swaps of bad projects.  </P> <P> "I'll trade you my dead cow for your dead horse," became a catch phrase with  some of the worst thrifts, Black noted. "By paying each other more than the  book value of the projects, they could each convert a loss into a gain and  declare new income."  </P> <P> To fend off government regulators who tried to halt these practices, Black told  Congress, owners of high-flier thrifts made campaign contributions in an effort  to obtain political influence that could squelch an investigation.  </P> <P> In the end, the failures of Lincoln Savings and other troubled thrifts left the  taxpayers, rather than the owners, holding the bag since losses were covered by  federal deposit insurance.  </P> <P> "Federal deposit insurance is like giving the owner of a thrift access to the  federal mint," Black concluded. "Lincoln may have appropriated over $2 billion  in taxpayer funds. This is truly taxation without representation."  </P></p>

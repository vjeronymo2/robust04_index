			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Palestine rivals agree to halt internecine war The two main Palestinian militant factions in the Gaza Strip yesterday agreed to end violent attacks on each other and to set up a committee to resolve differences. The unexpected co-operation deal between the Fatah Hawks, loyal to PLO chairman Yassir Arafat, and the military wing of the Hamas Islamic extremist movement, which has repeatedly condemned Israeli-PLO peace efforts, improves Mr Arafat's chances of imposing his authority in the Gaza Strip when the Israeli army pulls out - possibly next month. If completed and adhered to, the agreement, and a similar one that may be taking shape in the West Bank could simplify the task of the 9,000 Palestinian policemen who are supposed to take over responsibility for internal security in the Gaza and Jericho areas when the Israelis leave. The deal was negotiated in secret over the past few weeks, with a key role being played by some of Mr Arafat's aides who were recently allowed by the Israelis to return to Gaza after several years in exile. It provides for an end to internecine violence, a commitment to co-operation, and a one-month amnesty for Palestinians who collaborate with the Israeli authorities to renounce such co-operation without fear of revenge. Palestinian militants have killed hundreds of alleged collaborators in more than six years of the Intifada (uprising). PLO officials in Gaza said yesterday that the agreement had been reached with the approval of top officials on both sides, presumably including Mr Arafat. Earlier this week, the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, acting on early reports of the agreement, had issued a warning to Mr Arafat not to sanction a deal whereby the PLO would turn a blind eye to continued Hamas attacks on Israeli targets. In the past three weeks, Hamas militants have killed 13 Israelis. One victim of the last of these, Shahar Simani, a soldier, was buried yesterday. In response, the Israeli army has rounded up more than 300 suspected Hamas activists and supporters in the occupied territories, in an effort to destroy the Hamas infrastructure.</p>

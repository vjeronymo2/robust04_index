			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LIVELY CAJUN-ZYDECO SOUNDS DRAW ECLECTIC CROWD TO ANNUAL FESTIVAL  </P> <P> There was no trouble spotting folks wearing T-shirts from such bastions of  Louisiana music as Tipitina's in New Orleans or Mulate's in Breaux Bridge over  the weekend at the fourth annual Cajun &amp; Zydeco Festival at Rainbow Lagoon  Park.  </P> <P> But then, anyone who's from -- or who's even visited -- southern Louisiana  doesn't need a bit of convincing about the unique charms of its home-grown  music. So while the presence of aficionados lent something of a stamp of  authenticity to the proceedings, even more impressive was the sight of  long-haired teen-agers in Iron Maiden T-shirts milling about the grounds next  to bearded Urban Cowboys in pointy-toed boots -- next to scrub-faced  adolescents in Depeche Mode shirts next to middle-aged black couples, all  sharing the same cheek-to-cheek smiles.  </P> <P> Maybe it doesn't sell the most records or garner the most radio airplay, but  Cajun and zydeco music undeniably rank among the happiest sounds ever wafted up  from this quirky little planet.  </P> <P> This year's festival -- promoted, like its predecessors, by Franklin Zawacki, a  San Franciscan who operates out of his brother's house in Orange County -- was  dominated by acts rooted to traditional Cajun and zydeco styles, more so than  in the past when such crossover acts as Beausoleil and Wayne Toups brought  their rock chops to the music.  </P> <P> Traditionalism was most evident in the midday sets by Cajun singer and  songwriter D.L. Menard, who endeared himself to the crowds of 2,000 on Saturday  and 2,500 on Sunday with the contagious joy of his music-making. (The program  was the same both days except for the openings T-Lou &amp; the Los Angeles  Zydeco Band on Saturday, Wilfred Latour &amp; His Zydeco Goodtime Aces on  Sunday.)  </P> <P> Because Menard, like many Cajun and zydeco performers, sings the bulk of his  material in Cajun French, some of the specifics of his old-timey tales of  unrequited love may get lost without the translation. But the emotions always  came through loud and clear from the yearning in Menard's voice, the soulful  moanings of Ken Smith's fiddle and the dazzling fingerwork of accordionist  Eddie LeJeune. (Los Lobos' accordion whiz David Hidalgo was spotted paying rapt  attention to LeJeune's solos on Saturday.)  </P> <P> And, on one of those occasions when he did sing in English, Menard showed why  he's been dubbed the "Cajun Hank Williams," with a throat-catching rendition of  Williams' signature "Your Cheatin' Heart."  </P> <P> Bruce Daigrepont's Cajun Band, which got penultimate billing, hewed close to  the traditional core but not as strictly as Menard. Like Beausoleil,  Daigrepont's band favors the rhythmic thrust that a tight bass-and-drum section  can add to the basic Cajun instrumental triumvirate of fiddle, accordion and  guitar.  </P> <P> Accordionist Daigrepont also sweetened the stew with scintillating  country-music harmonies and a witty rendition of Merle Haggard's "Okie from  Muskogee" -- in French, naturellemente.  </P> <P> Headliner John Delafose &amp; His Eunice Playboys closed each day's shows with  performances that, in their own way, demonstrated what was missing from earlier  sets by up-and-comer Nathan &amp; Zydeco Cha-Chas. Nathan's sets had a livelier  look than Delafose's, thanks largely to the antics of his jellyfish-limbed  rubboard player Mark Williams. The music also benefited from lots of  fat-and-juicy licks from sax player Fred Charles.  </P> <P> But leader Nathan Williams himself projected little sense of individuality,  either in his vocals or in his piano-accordion work. Without that sense of  personality, zydeco music easily can deteriorate into monotonous riffing.  (Williams, however, is relatively young in the field, and he did display minor  improvement over previous performances -- he actually smiled a few times. Maybe  once he starts appearing to enjoy himself on stage, the audience might have  more fun, too.)  </P> <P> Delafose, on the other hand, had presence to spare. Alternating between three  types of accordion -- the Cajun button type, a German button and piano  accordions -- Delafose quipped: "It takes a special kind of fool to use three  accordions."  </P> <P> Though a generous bandleader -- he frequently gave the spotlight to other  members of the band, including two of his sons -- Delafose clearly was in  control.  </P> <P> The festival's new location is far superior to its old one at Cal State  Dominguez Hills in Carson -- more picturesque (it's next to a small man-made  lake) and more comfortable because of constant breezes off the nearby ocean.  </P> <P> Things ran like clockwork, yet there was no sense that things were being  regimented by the stopwatch police. The only problem was the long lines at food  booths set up by several local Cajun restaurants.  </P></p>

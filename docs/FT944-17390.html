			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: A Cohen recovers to Pounds 764,000 A Cohen, maker of non-ferrous metal ingots, reported a substantial recovery in pre-tax profits from Pounds 36,000 to Pounds 764,000 for the first half of 1994. Turnover, however, fell by Pounds 8m to Pounds 35.5m because of a policy of concentrating on lower volume, higher margin business in some sectors. Earnings per share were 27p (8.96p losses), but owing to a decision to rebuild cash resources there is again no interim dividend - the last payment was a 3.4p final for 1992. Cohen said its principal markets were now all recovering and that demand, particularly aluminium, was strong. The directors were 'cautiously optimistic' for the full year.</p>

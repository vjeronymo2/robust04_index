			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" Dailies, Past), 06/07/94 --  Special Envoy of the Russian President Vladimir Kazimirov has  visited Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert, negotiating with the  sides regarding the new Russian peace project. He reported to a  "TURAN" correspondent, they are trying to find formulations and  topics based on mutual concessions.    According to Kazimirov, maximalist aspirations of both sides  are not supportive to the progress, since the other side would  clearly not accept them. "Unfortunately, the sides are not used  to trade yet, but are fixed on their demands", said Russian  President's Envoy.    Kazimirov noted the haste of the Azeri side, which is not  supportive for successful solutions. "In order to start  withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories, we should  not waste days and weeks but we should reach a Great political  agreement", noted Kazimirov. He also referred to stationing  peace-making forces and said they would be something inbetween  peace-making troops and observers. "This forces wouldn't have  disengagement functions", he noted, "these are observers with  corresponding control and security bodies." According to  Kazimirov, their structure is not defined yet, but financing  will be shared equally by the three sides.    Kazimirov said that the Azeri side made a proposal on  liberating Shushi and Lachin, but this problems should be  discussed only in two weeks after the current agreement is  signed.    Russian President's Special Envoy criticized Karabakh's  demand of "status against territories", saying this is an  attempt of resolving the problem by force.    Having finished the negotiations in Baku, Kazimirov arrived  to Yerevan late in the evening on June 4, and met his Armenian  counterpart Davit Shakhnazaryan. The sides have been  negotiating on several topics of the Russian project on peaceful  resolution of the Karabakh problem.    RA [Republic of Armenia] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan met  Kazimirov on June 5. On the same day Russian President's Envoy  left for Stepanakert.    Kazimirov met Chairman of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous  Karabakh] State Department of Defense Robert Kocharyan and the  RMK Foreign Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan. The sides discussed  problems relating to peaceful resolution of the Karabakh  conflict and the recent Russian project. The RMK leaders  expressed their worries about the non-constructive stance of  Azerbaijan, which rejects the peace projects one after another.  Kazimirov left Stepanakert on June 6.</p>

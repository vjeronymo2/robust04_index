			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ST. BARNARD HIGH STAR STOKES PLAYER OF YEAR;  </P> <P> VIKINGS' CENTER TOPS IN DIVISION I  </P> <P> St. Bernard High basketball star Ed Stokes, a 6-11 senior headed for the  University of Arizona, has been named the Southern Section Division I Player of  the Year by the First Interstate Bank/Amateur Athletic Foundation board of  sportswriters.  </P> <P> Stokes was the only South Bay prep selected to the Division I team, which  consists of players from the Southern Section 5-AA and 5-A divisions. He was a  near-unanimous pick as player of the year, outpolling Lakewood forward Brian  Camper.  </P> <P> In leading St. Bernard to a 23-6 record and the Camino Real League title,  Stokes averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and four blocked shots a game. His  rebound and block totals were the best in the South Bay.  </P> <P> The agile center bounced back from an injury-plagued junior season to blossom  into one of the Southland's most dominant big men. He improved his inside play,  shooting 76% from the floor, and continued to display a nice shooting touch. He  was the Vikings' second-best three-point shooter and made 73% of his free  throws.  </P> <P> "He probably has as much big-time potential as anybody we've had," said St.  Bernard Coach Jim McClune.  </P> <P> Although he was double- and triple-teamed in most games, Stokes carried the  Vikings throughout the season. And he did it without the help of the team's  second-best player, senior forward Juno Armstrong, a three-year varsity starter  who was sidelined early in the season with a viral infection.  </P> <P> Stokes led St. Bernard to the second round of the 5-AA playoffs, where the  Vikings lost to Redlands. He was a unanimous choice as the Camino Real Most  Valuable Player.  </P> <P> Stokes enjoyed some of his best performances against tough competition.  </P> <P> He had 34 points, 23 rebounds and 10 blocked shots Dec. 17 in a 65-61 win over  Bay League titlist Rolling Hills in the championship game of the Beverly Hills  Tournament. A week later, he scored a game-high 29 points in a match-up against  Artesia's highly regarded center, 6-8 junior Ed O'Bannon, to lead the Vikings  to an 87-67 victory in the Las Vegas Valley Tournament.  </P> <P> Stokes, who signed with Arizona last November, becomes the 22nd St. Bernard  player to earn a spot with a four-year college team since 1979. He chose the  Wildcats over Louisville, Syracuse and UCLA.  </P> <P> "I felt (Arizona's) Lute Olson would be a great coach for me," he said. "He'll  help bring out the best in my game."  </P> <P> Arizona, ranked No. 1 in the nation at the end of the regular season, lost in  the NCAA West Regional semifinals to Nevada-Las Vegas.

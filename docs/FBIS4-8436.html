			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- No official report was  released by 8 PM local time today on Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov's health, after the government said this morning that he  was taken back to hospital on suspicion of having contracted  hepatitis. On March 8 the prime minister had a heart attack and  on March 11 he underwent a quadruple bypass operation.    Berov's doctors have not confirmed the hepatitis diagnosis,  national radio quoted Gen. Vladimirov, boss of the National  Security Service, as saying upon his return from the hospital.  According to him, a medical statement will made by 1 PM  tomorrow following more tests.    The premier's return to hospital set politicians discussing  the fate of his cabinet. At a scheduled press conference today,  the leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic Aleksandur  Tomov said the Prime Minister's probable infection spoke volumes  not only for the level of Bulgarian health care but for overall  attitudes toward that man. According to Tomov, all people  involved in the prime minister's treatment, including the health  minister, should offer to resign.    According to Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Prof.  Berov will be under quarantine for about a week. Berov's health  did not prevent him from having two lengthy meetings with  Matinchev, Bulgarian National Television said in its evening  news broadcast. Berov's return proved more than what he was  equal to, Matinchev told national television. He said he today  advised the Prime Minister to reduce his contacts as much as  possible, relinquishing his duties to his two deputies.    "I am sure Prof. Berov has a will to live and, most  importantly, to rule this country", the ethnic Turks' leader  Ahmed Dogan told the press following a meeting with President  Zhelev. According to the Presidential Press Office, the  president and Dogan discussed the country's finances and  economy. At this stage, a cabinet overhaul may be appropriate  but it should be proposed by the prime minister and coordinated  with all parliamentary factions, said Dogan. Parliament and  politicians may be unprepared for any other option, said Dogan.  According to him, the current developments may grow into a  political crisis.    The health of the state depends on the health of a single  state leader; Bulgaria cannot do without a prime minister under  the present Constitution, Stefan Savov, floor leader of the  Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), today told national  television. The coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP) today discussed possible action in case the cabinet cannot  stay in control in Berov's absence, BSP floor leader Nora  Ananieva told the same broadcast. Berov's sickness necessitates  immediate consultations, said Gospodin Atanasov MP of the New  Union for Democracy (NSD). A resignation tendered by the  premier would be in keeping with the Constitution; otherwise,  the way out is a vote of no confidence, said another NSD MP,  Ruslan Semerdzhiev, adding he would vote no confidence in such  circumstances.</p>

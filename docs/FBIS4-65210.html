			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Paris-London air dispute continues. The  British Government said today that it gives its full backing to  the British airlines which have decided to fly into Orly.  [passage omitted] French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said  today that he finds it absolutely extraordinary that British  Airways should try to force the hand of the French authorities.  He was speaking to Alain Pagon:    [Begin Bosson recording] We are in favor of competition, but  we want it to be disciplined, loyal and healthy: We are not in  favor of an economic jungle. The government took some simple  decisions last October: It decided to open the Orly-London  route this April; it decided the opening of the Orly-Marseille  route to one company only in April 1995, and the opening of  Orly-Toulouse to one company only in April 1996. The  government's decisions will be respected. We have a certain  delay on the opening of the Orly-London route. It is a matter  of weeks now. We are moving toward that opening which we  ourselves decided, but we will not accept any forcible action by  whatever company on Monday [16 May] or on any other day.    As concerns the Orly-Marseille and Orly-Toulouse routes, the  European Commission has ordered us to open up these two routes  within six months. We do not agree with the Commission's aims,  because we feel that our measures are in conformity with  commitments made in Brussels by previous French governments, and  we have therefore appealed to the courts. It is all extremely  simple. [end recording]</p>

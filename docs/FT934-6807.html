			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Electronics side behind 53% rise to Pounds 20.4m at Diploma Shares in Diploma dipped 3p to 563p as the electronics, building components and special steels group announced a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 20.4m in the year to September 30. This time last year the shares stood at 344p. Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, ascribed the group's general health to the concept of service. 'People talk of service, but don't understand it. However, if you do, you get better margins. From better margins, you get good cash flow, which feeds the cash position.' Cash at the end of the year had risen Pounds 2m to Pounds 28m, and adjusted profit as a percentage return on sales was 13.5 (12.6) per cent. Group turnover grew to Pounds 158m (Pounds 132.3m). As previously, the main engine of growth was the electronics division, where profits rose to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 8.4m) on turnover up at Pounds 104.1m (Pounds 77.8m). Macro, the active components distributor, and - more modestly - Nortronic, in passive components, shone. Both increased market share and Macro, with the administration of Anzac now absorbed, lifted turnover by 35 per cent and profits by 50 per cent. Anachem, bought 18 months ago for Pounds 7.7m, lifted turnover and profits. Mr Thomas said he was interested in building the pharmaceutical side into the group's fourth arm. Customers' capital expenditure had fallen on both sides of the Atlantic, but new products and exchange rates helped recovery over the 12 months. The best performer in the building products side was again IG Lintels, though this also started slowly. Mr Thomas said Diploma did not want to 'wait for better times. We can make things better by investment'. The division's profits were Pounds 7m (Pounds 6m) on turnover of Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 43.4m). Special steels lifted profits to Pounds 1m (Pounds 700,000) on turnover static at Pounds 11.1m, again adversely affected by the oil services sector. Cost reductions helped here. Lower rates shrank interest receivable to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 2.1m) and earnings per share advanced to 24.9p (19.4p). The final dividend is lifted to 8.5p (7p) for a total up 23 per cent at 12p (9.75p).</p>

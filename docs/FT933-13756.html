			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Full inquiry on Thorp possible THE GOVERNMENT has not ruled out a full public inquiry into the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, has said. The second round of public consultation due to begin soon does not mean a subsequent inquiry will not take place, he told Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group. The consultation is likely to delay a decision on the future of the Pounds 2.8bn plant until November, but any inquiry could take more than a year. British Nuclear Fuels has protested against delays for further consultation, which it says cost it Pounds 2m a week.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Private metal trader to go into liquidation PHILIPP &amp; LION, one of the last privately-owned international metal-trading groups left in London, ceased trading yesterday and said it intends to seek voluntary liquidation. Mr Michael Lion, chairman and chief executive, said that the company recently ran into financial difficulties and this week entered into discussions with its bankers. But, in spite of being offered additional facilities, it was not possible to arrange satisfactory terms. Mr Lion said the company's immediate problem was an extreme liquidity shortage which, with the best will in the world, it was not able to solve with its several banks. No one loss caused the difficulties, 'it was a cumulative thing'. All 40 employees in London have been made redundant but some will stay on to help with the liquidation. Philipp &amp; Lion has called in accountants Touche Ross to advise on the liquidation and there will be a creditors' meeting on May 15. Mr Lion is one of the two largest shareholders in the company, along with Mr Melvin Sheinbein. The company's operations in the US - Philipp &amp; Lion International and Philipp &amp; Lion Trading, which between them employ about 20 people - remain active and operational, Mr Lion stressed. The company's trading activities were mainly in non-ferrous metals, both primary and scrap. Metal traders suggested yesterday that there were some signs that many banks were now unwilling to keep a high financial exposure in volatile commodity markets. The physical merchanting business had contracted in recent years and this trend was likely to continue, traders added. Other merchants were believed to be in difficulties.</p>

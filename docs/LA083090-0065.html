			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBERS SAY SUB COULD HAVE AVOIDED FATAL TUG ACCIDENT  </P> <P> A Navy submarine that accidentally sank a tugboat just outside Los Angeles  Harbor last spring probably would have avoided the disaster -- in which the  tug's pilot was killed -- had the crew used its "active" sonar before  surfacing, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The board, which recently completed its investigation of the incident, found  that the submarine's crew had activated only its "passive" sonar, which offers  a murkier picture of objects at the surface of the water.  </P> <P> Navy submarines often use only the passive sonar because enemy craft can trace  them more easily when they use the "active" system.  </P> <P> But NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said the board found that the crew of the  submarine Houston had little reason to be concerned that the sonar signal might  be traced.  </P> <P> "They were in costal waters," he noted. "In this particular accident, we felt,  there was no need for the submarine to be in some sort of secret mode."  </P> <P> In the June 14, 1989, incident, the submarine surfaced and snagged one of two  steel towlines that connected the tugboat Barcona to two barges it was pulling.  The Santa Catalina Island-bound tug was dragged underwater and pilot Bryan  Ballanger killed.  </P> <P> The submarine crew later said in a Navy report that it had picked up the  tugboat on its passive sonar, but mistook the barges for sailboats because they  made little noise.  </P> <P> Although the board is still preparing its official report, Pollock said it  would recommend the use of sonar devices in coastal waters.  </P> <P> The NTSB report will also recommend mandatory emergency-release mechanisms for  tugboat towlines and suggest that tugs keep certain doors closed when at sea,  he said.  </P> <P> "If they had had an emergency towline release, they may have been able to free  themselves," Pollock said.  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Should you join the stampede into gilts . . . - . . . or will you find yourself buying at the top of the market? IS THIS the moment to buy gilts? For anyone looking to a modest capital to provide them with a secure return on which to live, the options are shrinking. Base rates are down to 7 per cent, and most savings accounts will offer less than that. Ten-year gilts, on the other hand, still offer a yield of around 8 per cent, while 15-year government bonds yield 8.5 per cent. The higher returns available on longer-dated gilts have prompted a stampede by private investors in recent weeks. They have been busy selling short-dated gilts, which return little more than 6 per cent, and reinvesting the money in higher-yielding bonds - 'moving along the yield curve', in City jargon. The risk, of course, is that the value of these gilts will fall, leaving holders with a capital loss. The gilt market has already experienced a strong rise in prices in recent months: just ahead of the general election, the 9.75 per cent gilt due in 2002 was trading at a price of around 99 1/2 . By yesterday, the price had jumped to 111 1/4 - a significant capital gain. Could it be 1987 all over again for the private investor? After the institutions have reaped the rewards of rising gilt prices (many began diverting a larger share of their cash into gilts a year ago), private investors could find themselves buying near the top of the market. The amount of new borrowing the government has to do next year is one factor threatening prices. The official prediction this week was for borrowing to reach Pounds 44bn next year. Who is going to buy all those gilts? Foreign investors backed out of the market after sterling left the Exchange Rate Mechanism and have yet to return in force. UK insurance companies and fund managers have been expressing mixed feelings about gilts, wondering where to turn their attention. Pension funds, on the other hand, could continue buying: a massive 85 per cent of their investment is in equities, a lop-sided approach which could be amended by a shift into gilts. The attractions of gilts would also shrink if British inflation starts to pick up, or if German interest rates do not fall as fast as most investors expect. For the moment, these are risks that most pundits discount - a view shared by many private investors, given the recent stampede. The rush into longer-dated gilts has caused trading volume to jump threefold in recent weeks, putting a strain on the market. Only three market-makers handle trades for stockbrokers who have private clients, and all three faced some difficulties last week in settling the deluge of deals thrown at them. Occasionally it was not easy to trade - brokers found in some cases they had to wait overnight to buy or sell gilts for customers. Market-makers claimed that disruption had been minimal and, anyway, had largely been resolved by the week's end. For investors who are not concerned about dealing immediately, and who do not rely on a broker's advice, there is an alternative way to deal in gilts: through the National Savings Stock Register. A department of National Savings, the register accepts instructions by post and charges only a minimal commission (Pounds 1 for deals worth less than Pounds 250, with another 50p for every extra Pounds 125). Details are available from Post Offices.</p>

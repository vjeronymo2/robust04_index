			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Liaison body will pool information on frauds ONE OF the most important developments arising from the Bingham report is the creation of a new liaison body between supervisors and other bodies engaged in the detection of fraud. 'The Treasury regard this as one of the most important things to come out of the Bingham inquiry and we rather share that view,' the Bank of England said. Before the chancellor's announcement, no formal group had existed among regulators for the exchange of information on potential frauds, although a number of ad hoc meetings have been held in the past to discuss specific investigations. The new group has a core of statutory regulators - the Bank of England, the Securities and Investments Board and the Department of Trade and Industry. It will also include criminal investigators and will occasionally draw in prosecuting authorities. The Inland Revenue is excluded from the group because of the strict confidentiality laws on tax matters. The group's main aim is to oversee the exchange of information and to co-ordinate action between different bodies. One of the Bingham report's main criticisms was about the lack of communication between organisations that allowed the fraud at BCCI to escape detection for years. Mr Ian Watt, the KPMG Peat Marwick partner who is to head a new special investigations unit at the Bank of England, said he expected the group to involve regular liaison meetings, although its exact format or name has yet to be decided. He said: 'One of the things the investigation unit will be wanting to do is to create and maintain a close liaison with the other agencies that have the task of regulating and eliminating fraud.' The Bank of England said it would provide the secretariat for the group, which will develop its own terms of reference and methods of operation. Mr Watt is likely to be the group's first chairman. Mr Watt said he also expected to be involved in improving the collation of intelligence at the Bank. Previously the Bank has used a system called confidential inquiries, which provides for the Bank's officers to liaise with police, the Customs and Excise department and the Serious Fraud Office. That system will be covered by the new unit.</p>

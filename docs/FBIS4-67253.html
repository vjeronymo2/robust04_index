			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mauricio Menezes] </F>   [Excerpt] Rio de Janeiro -- On the evening of 12 May,  Federal Police [PF] Drug Enforcement Division agents seized a  truck that was carrying with 300 kg of marijuana and at least 60  boxes of .45 and .357 Magnum ammunition. The incident took  place on the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo road, near Nova Iguazu,  (Baixada Fluminense District).    The cargo was found in the double bottom of a dump truck  with  Sao Paulo license plates BWD-1230, which was being carried on a  car transporter to Rio de Janeiro. The car transporter driver,  Miguel Dias Ribeiro, said he was hired to transport the dump  truck. He denied all knowledge of the drugs.    Police officer Ramon Alonso headed the operation. He said  the drugs were found following the arrest in Sao Paulo of  trafficker Claudeci Martineli da Silva who was carrying 86 kg of  pure cocaine which he was about to send to Rio de Janeiro.  Martineli allegedly informed the PF of the drug shipment.  Alonso did not want to give details about where it was supposed  to be delivered. The driver, who was arrested, said that he had  to meet someone in Rio de Janeiro who would take the dump truck.  [passage omitted]</p>

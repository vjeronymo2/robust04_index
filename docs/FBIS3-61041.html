Grachev, Russian Federation </F> Minister of Defense; reprinted with permission from the editor  of the journal VOYENNAYA MYSL: "Urgent Problems in the  Development and Training of Russian Armed Forces Today"]    [Text] The end of the Cold War and positive changes in  Eastern Europe and in the Far and Near East are creating  fundamentally new conditions promoting a decrease in the level  of military confrontation between the East and West, a  transition from confrontation to cooperation, and consequently a  soon-to-occur reduction in the probability of major wars.    At the same time the sources of military danger remain.  Principal among them are the presence of sociopolitical,  economic, territorial, religious, national, ethnic and other  contradictions, and the persisting desire of a number of  countries to resolve them by military force. All of this, as  well as the breakdown of the unified defense system and the  military infrastructure, is having an effect on Russia's  military development.    The long economic crisis is the most important factor  determining the course of military development. The transition  to a market economy is gathering momentum today, and the  production slump has been surmounted. This necessitated major  review of a number of points in the state's military-technical  policy, and required the Ministry of Defense to reexamine  traditional approaches to outfitting and supplying the armed  forces.    Thus, the current international situation and the internal  political situation in Russia are developing under the influence  of extremely contradictory factors, which is why the  geopolitical and geostrategic realities on the planet must be  accounted for in Russian military development.    Military policy is the foundation of military development,  determining its orientation and content. The military-political  situation that has evolved in the world arena, as well as in  adjacent countries and in Russia itself, requires deep analysis  of all of its aspects. We are striving to make military policy  scientifically substantiated and realistic. Russia's rejection  of ideological confrontation is a favorable basis for  comprehensive cooperation, including military, with all states,  but chiefly with the USA, European countries, Japan and  neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. Pursuing its military  policy, as with any other state Russia must attach priority to  its own interests, based on observance of the UN Charter and  other international agreements. In this case the priority of  political over military resources in preventing and resolving  conflicts is being observed, the desire to maintain  military-political and strategic stability under the conditions  of the new ratio of forces in the world arena is being  maintained, and the armed forces and defense matters are under  civilian control at all levels of government.    The essence of the state's policy regarding military  security  will be reflected in military doctrine, official adoption of  which will promote a proper understanding of Russia's defensive  goals and intentions by all states and the world community.  Together with other documents it will become the basis for  developing and training the armed forces and carrying out  military reform, and defining the main directions for the  development of military art and military science in general.    From my point of view the content of military doctrine must  be based on new approaches to the issues of war and peace, and  to supporting the country's defensive capability, with regard  for the mutual security interests of all states. We have been  able to surmount the direct threat of world war. However, we  recognize that there are no guarantees yet that the positive  changes are irreversible, and that maintaining the country's  defense capabilities and strengthening its security are among  the most important objectives of the state and the entire nation.    The political foundations of military doctrine will rest  upon  the Russian state's peace-loving policy. We do not intend to  attack anyone or use military force to resolve interstate  conflicts. The Russian Armed Forces are intended to repel  aggression and to provide for the security of their people, and  defend Russia's territorial integrity, sovereignty and other  vitally important interests. The ways and means of preventing  war and possible allies in reaching such an important objective  must be examined in military doctrine in accordance with the  main goal of the state's policy--ensuring peaceful conditions  for the country's comprehensive development. Russia does not  view any state of the world community as its enemy. At the same  time it would be premature not to consider the realities that  may generate tension in interstate relations.    Given the nature of my duties--the role of the Minister of  Defense is reducing more and more to fulfilling  military-political functions--I go abroad rather often,  including to NATO countries. I should note that as is true of  the leadership of the Russian Federation, the leadership of the  North Atlantic alliance is troubled by the problems of  developing a system of collective European and global security.  We welcome NATO's departure from a strategy oriented on  neutralizing the so-called threat from the former USSR and its  allies.    At the same time a desire by some states (coalitions) to  achieve domination over certain regions and the world as a  whole, and to incite internal conflicts, which cannot but evoke  natural anxiety in Russia, can be observed. We are forced to  consider the probability of change in the political course of  certain countries, possible attempts at rethinking postwar  borders, and the maintenance of armed forces by some states that  exceed the needs of defense. Five hundred thirty divisions,  42,000 tanks and 12,000 warplanes are concentrated near Russia's  borders. This impressive instrument of war and how politicians  will use it in the future is a problem with many unknowns.    It is often said today that the situation in the world has  changed fundamentally, and that the threat of aggression no  longer exists because differences are disappearing from the  ideologies of Russia and foreign countries. However, historical  experience indicates that the ideas of peace and justice are  often found as working concepts in the doctrines of states that  are far from peace-loving. Military force is still one of the  main instruments of the policy of a large number of countries.    We are especially alarmed on one hand by the possibility of  proliferation of nuclear and other types of mass destruction  weapons, their means of delivery and the latest technologies of  military production, and attempts by some countries to use them  to realize their own military-political goals; and on the other  hand by the increasing threat of international terrorism,  including with the use of such weapons. Growth of nationalistic  and separatist tendencies and massive violations of universally  recognized human rights and freedoms are seriously destabilizing  the situation in the world.    Under these conditions Russia's military doctrine cannot but  consider at least two contradictory tendencies: The first--the  desire of nations to create a nonviolent world, to achieve  civilized mutual relations, to reinforce measures of trust, and  to exclude wars from the arsenal of the means of resolving  disputes; the second--the desire of some states to solve  international problems from a position of strength, to live by  laws under which military force plays an important role in  policy, if not the principal one. The latter tendency requires  elevated attention, and were circumstances to come together in a  particular way, it could bring on armed conflicts and wars.    When it comes to the military principles of doctrine per se,  it would be suitable to reveal the nature of wars and armed  conflicts; to determine the kind of aggression, which the state  and its armed forces must be prepared to repel; to direct the  development, training and means of combat use of the armed  forces.    In evaluating military conflicts we need to base ourselves  on  the fact that the probability of world nuclear or world  conventional war is significantly reduced under today's  conditions. At the same time the possibility of armed conflicts,  of local and regional wars, is not only the same, but it is also  increasing. In my opinion the most probable thing would be not  direct armed intervention against Russia but its gradually  increasing involvement in conflicts started in neighboring  countries and regions. Given the complex interrelationships and  interdependencies in the interests of different states and  peoples, any armed conflict can grow into a major war.    Considering the above, the following are the country's main  objectives in the area of defense.    In peacetime: Preventing military conflicts through a  combination of political, diplomatic and other measures and  maintenance of the military potential and fighting power of the  armed forces at a level ensuring reliable defense of the  country's vitally important interests; guarding state borders;  cutting off possible provocations and transgressions upon the  security of citizens and the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of the Russian Federation.    In a period of danger and at the beginning of a war:  Promptly  adopting the decision to switch the country and the armed forces  to a war footing, and practically implementing this decision;  mobilizing the country's necessary forces and resources to repel  the aggressor; using the possibilities of the United Nations and  other international organizations to condemn and isolate the  aggressor, and to force him to stop the war and restore peace.    Despite reduction of strategic defensive arms on the basis  of  START-2, it is obvious that nuclear weapons will continue to be  the principal element of European and global stability today and  in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we view strategic nuclear  forces as the most important guarantee of the military security  of Russia and its allies.    As far as the military doctrines of the USA and other  developed states are concerned, they are experiencing certain  changes as well. New focuses in evaluating the probability of  different wars are a positive aspect of changes in doctrine.  However, the general classification of wars adopted in the USA  and NATO in the 1980's remains the same. Armed forces have the  mission of preparing to fight any kind of war--universal  (global) and limited, using nuclear or just conventional  weapons, two-sided and coalitional, and of preparing for  participation in any possible conflicts.    According to the principles of the USA's revamped military  strategy, until the end of the 1990's and in the beginning of  the next century the outcome of wars employing conventional  weapons, should they be started, will be resolved in air, land  and sea operations. Nuclear weapons must remain in the  background, performing the role of strategic "deterrence." At  the same time should the situation grow worse in the course of  conventional wars, the possibility of using nuclear weapons is  not excluded.    Thus in determining the new approaches to ensuring Russia's  defense and military security, we need to base ourselves  primarily on a comprehensive assessment of the current  military-political situation, and of the changes that have  already occurred and will occur in the world and in our country.  The nature and tendencies in the development of the  international situation and the internal situation in Russia and  in CIS countries are creating exceptionally complex conditions  for the development of Russian Armed Forces.    The main goal of the present stage of development of the  Russian Federation Armed Forces is to create qualitatively new  armies and fleets meeting the requirements of the present  military, political and strategic situation in the world and the  Commonwealth of Independent States, and reflecting the trends of  its development and the real degree of military danger. In this  case the numerical strength and structure of the RF Armed Forces  must correspond to the missions assigned to them, to the  economic, demographic and other possibilities of Russia, and to  agreements on reducing armed forces.    As we know, Russia was among the last of the union republics  of the disintegrated USSR to begin creating its own armed  forces, but there were reasons for this. There was simply no  other alternative in the situation that established itself by  May 1992. The president, the Russian Supreme Soviet and the  Ministry of Defense had a question to answer: What should the  Army and Navy be?    I feel that considering the geostrategic situation and the  geopolitical interests of Russia, its armed forces must be  highly mobile, and outfitted with modern equipment and armament.  We need to do away with the large, slow-moving, hard-to-control  armed forces of the former USSR which are now part of the  Russian Army and Navy, but we also need to make maximum use of  their potential. Our proposals have been supported by the  country's leadership. In this case a real possibility has  appeared for reducing the armed forces and easing the excessive  burden of military expenditures.    Two highly important principles of ensuring military  security  are at the basis of the concept approved by the Russian  president for the development of the Russian Federation's Armed  Forces:    The first--deterring any aggressor from world nuclear and  conventional war by maintaining the Strategic Nuclear Forces in  a state allowing them to retaliate with the needed effectiveness  under any conditions.    The second--deterring an aggressor from starting regional  and  local wars and armed conflicts by creating general-purpose force  groupings (covering forces, mobile forces, Supreme High Command  reserves) guaranteeing repulsion of aggression and ensuring the  possibility for promptly augmenting the armed forces as the  scale of military activities increases.    As we know, the Russian Armed Forces are being reorganized  in  stages.    With regard for current conditions, formation of new armed  forces groupings on Russian territory has been started, planned  reduction of their numerical strength and force composition is  proceeding, reorganization of the central administration of the  Ministry of Defense and of force structures and transition to a  combined manning principle (through the draft and through  voluntary enlistment on a contract basis) have been started, the  principal measures associated with development of the armed  forces in the immediate future (up to 1995) have been determined  more specifically, and the directions of their future  reorganization (to the year 2000) are being developed. As a  result of the work done thus far, the overall numerical strength  of the Russian Army and Navy has been decreased by over 260,000  servicemen. There are plans for maximally decreasing the number  of large combined units and units of reduced strength. An active  effort is being made to conclude formation of a new  military-technical policy having the main goal of  comprehensively solving the problems of equipping the Army and  Navy with contemporary models of armament and military equipment  under the conditions of a significant reduction in  appropriations, conversion of military industry and new economic  relations. On the whole, the results of the first stage confirm  the correctness of the selected course for development and  reorganization of the Russian Armed Forces. However, the complex  economic conditions in the country are making this work  difficult.    Formation of the armed forces and the creation of the basis  for their extensive transformation are foreseen in 1993-1995.  During this period, creation of force groupings will be  continued, withdrawal of forces from other countries into Russia  will be basically completed, and the numerical strength of the  armed forces will be reduced to 1.5 million persons by 1995, as  determined by the law "On Defense." We concurrently plan to  create a military infrastructure capable of supporting stable  function of force groupings and their command and control in  peace and in war. And finally, we need to carry out  comprehensive research with which to substantiate the numerical  strength, force composition and structure of the armed forces  that will be required after 1995.    Later on (after 1995) we plan to finish establishment of  qualitatively new armed forces, which means radically  transforming their structure, switching to a combined manning  system, forming force groupings, and creating the military  infrastructure on Russian territory.    The planned volume and deadlines for development and  reorganization of the Russian Armed Forces are naturally not  written in stone. They will change under the influence of  external and internal conditions.    In addition to the problems of developing the armed forces,  developing the theory of the art of war is acquiring no less  important significance. Under today's conditions the role of  strategy is increasing significantly. It must first of all  determine the nature and content of possible military conflicts,  and the conditions under which they arise. It will predetermine  the nature of tasks directed on one hand at finding effective  military-political ways of averting war, and on the other hand  at revealing the laws, principles, forms and means of preparing  for and conducting armed conflict; at developing specific  measures by which to prepare the country directly to repel  aggression promptly and the means of modern strategic  development of the armed forces and their commitment to war; and  at providing leadership to them.    Developing scientifically substantiated recommendations and  the military-technical means of averting war should be  considered to be the central task of the theory of strategy.    It stands to reason that world war must be averted chiefly  by  political means, and this should be reflected in defensive  activity. As I see it, a prompt and adequate response to actions  by an aggressor preparing for an attack may be considered to be  the essence of deterrence. In peacetime this will force him to  reject armed attack because of the inevitability of retaliation,  while in wartime it will restrain him from using nuclear weapons  and other mass destruction weapons, limit the scale and  intensity of military actions, and force their termination under  terms acceptable to us. The solution to this problem depends on  the readiness to strike a possible adversary at any time with  losses that would be unacceptable to him.    Taking this into account, important significance is attached  in military art to developing a system of measures to prepare  the country for the repulsion of possible aggression. The main  ones are: Developing doctrinal principles and concepts defining  the actions to be taken by the Russian Armed Forces to repel  aggression; theoretically studying and practically mastering new  forms of armed conflict and the most effective means of  defeating enemy groupings; developing and practically  implementing a new system of mobilizational deployment, and of  preparing and committing reserves; improving the system for  training staffs and forces; preparing effective fortifications  in the Russian Federation.    Changes in the nature of military threats and defense  objectives require more precise definition of the possible forms  of strategic actions and combat use of armed forces. From my  point of view, under today's conditions they may include:  Strategic deployment of the armed forces (partial for armed  conflicts and for local and regional wars, and full for  repulsion of major aggression); use of armed forces in armed  conflicts and in local and regional wars; use of armed forces in  major war.    Strategic deployment of the armed forces has highly  important  significance to organized repulsion of aggression. The main  requirement on it is that it be based on real military-political  and operational-strategic conditions of carrying out missions in  a particular evolving situation. This was rarely done in the  past. There was often a gap between political and strategic  considerations and the system of combat and mobilizational  readiness. Consequently, the means and the organization of  strategic deployment must develop with regard for the  possibilities of potential adversaries for carrying out  aggression in any form.    Under the new conditions, special attention should be turned  to the theory of preparing and conducting strategic operations  in regions (strategic sectors), which will play the decisive  role in conventional warfare. Unfortunately, in the postwar  years the forces were ready either for offensive or for  defensive forms of combat activities. This was hardly right. We  cannot ignore the objective principles and laws of armed  conflict. If an enemy begins aggression, we have the right to  select and use those types, forms and means of military action  which would be the most effective under the given situation.  This could mean both offense and defense. In solving the  problems of repelling aggression in different regions and  sectors, we need to take a differentiated approach that accounts  for the real political, economic and strategic situation. We  must not give contiguous states the grounds for interpreting our  actions as provocative, but at the same time we do not have the  right to fall behind in the development of military affairs.    In preparing the armed forces we need to keep in mind that  in  the initial period of war, defense must ensure the possibility  of successful repulsion of enemy aggression in the absence of  previously fortified lines. They will have to be prepared in the  course of the developing invasion--that is, simultaneously with  conducting defensive engagements with forces that are not fully  deployed. This is precisely the time when commanders of all  ranks must display initiative in reasonably combining different  means of conducting defensive operations. We are in favor of  stubborn defense, but we must also know how to maneuver. This is  especially important today. The field manuals of 1942 and 1943  contain special chapters devoted to defensive maneuver, but we  have forgotten about it. In developing our guidelines we need to  expand our treatment of this problem. It is now the turn for our  military scientists working on the problems of operational art  and tactics to make their contribution.    Offensive operations should obviously assume their place in  the theory of military art as well. At the same time we cannot  forget the counteroffensive, which was so widely employed during  the Great Patriotic War.    A number of problems are arising in connection with air and  air defense operations in a strategic area, and with the enemy's  defeat in ocean and sea regions.    Given the present nature of armed conflict, the  effectiveness  of all forms of operations and of strategic and operational  actions will depend to an increasingly greater degree on the  reliability of troop command and control. The problems of  raising the combat readiness of command and control units, the  efficiency of their work, the viability of control posts and  communication systems, and wide use of automated control  resources have acquired special acuity. A number of immediate  steps will have to be taken to raise the effectiveness of the  principal forms of operational, psychological, technical and  rear support.    All of this must be reflected in the manuals being currently  written to regulate the use of the armed forces, and it needs to  be meticulously honed in the course of operational and combat  training. I feel that under today's conditions we need to lay  our emphasis mainly on preparing command and control units and  maintaining them at a level ensuring dependable leadership of  forces in both peace and war. Russia's complex economic position  forces us to count every kopeck. This is why there are plans, in  the immediate future, for training command and control units at  command-and-staff exercises, which are to be carried out under  the leadership of senior chiefs, with the wide use of automation  resources. Of course, the best form of training of staffs and  forces is major troop exercises. However, circumstances are  evolving in such a way that we need to devote our main attention  today to training tactical subunits, to teaching them to work  together, and to developing firm skills in the personnel in the  use of military equipment and weapons.    Fundamental changes in the military-political situation and  in the development of the resources of armed conflict are  raising the role of science, including military science, to an  unprecedented level. This is explained by the fact that  fundamentally new directions are opening up in the development  of military affairs, by the continuing existence of  posssibilities for the armies of the most highly developed  states to achieve military-technical superiority as a result of  the creation of new models of high-precision weapons, as well as  of weapons based on new physical principles with destructive  force close to that of nuclear weapons, and by other factors.  Military science is faced by extremely serious tasks associated  with theoretical development of the problems of developing and  using the armed forces, equipping them, and substantiating the  structure and optimum composition of every armed service, branch  of troops and special troops.    However, it should be noted that the economic difficulties  the country is experiencing are having a negative effect on the  solution of many problems. For example, while the models of  attack resources we have are quite modern, in terms of many  parameters we are behind in the resources of their information  support, and in command, control and communication systems. We  are behind in electronics, and without a highly developed  microelectronic base, it is difficult to count on generally  raising the country's industrial, scientific and technical  potential, and on maintaining Russia's defense capabilities at a  modern level. In the immediate future we need to consolidate the  positions we have gained, and then devote special attention to  technologies which predetermine the industrial might of the  country and the fighting potential of the armed forces.    Nor can we ignore the technology of so-called artificial  intelligence. In a number of countries (chiefly the United  States of America) "artificial intelligence" resources, which  represent the apex of technical progress, have already undergone  their period of development and have earned the right of  citizenship. They can be used in developing the armed forces,  controlling combat activities and weapon systems, training the  personnel, and so on. We are significantly behind in this area.    We also need to consider that shortcomings in modern combat  systems and resources cannot be compensated by either military  art or quantity, as was confirmed by the war in the Persian Gulf  zone. In order to catch up, we need to conduct scientific  research and experimental design work at a forced pace. In this  case, the real influence scientific research has upon solving  the practical problems of developing the armed forces and  raising their combat readiness must be the main criterion of the  effectiveness and results of this research.    Timely introduction of scientific accomplishments into  practical activities is acquiring special significance. Solution  of this problem involves improving the forms and methods of  operational, mobilizational and combat training of troop command  and control units. Scientific work in the forces and fleets must  consist primarily of generalizing the experience of exercises  and introducing research results into the practice of  operational and combat training.    Research in military history requires revamping. Study of  the  experience of local wars is acquiring special significance  today. Local wars and conflicts (both large and small) directly  influence stability in the world, global development of policy  and the disposition of military-political forces, as was  confirmed by events in the Persian Gulf.    However, this does not mean that we should weaken attention  to the Great Patriotic War--the richest treasure house of combat  experience. In connection with celebration of the 50th  anniversary of the war's most important events, we need to  activate the study of military history with the purpose of  deeply analyzing operations and extracting practically valuable  lessons. Declassification of archival documents and materials  should be considerably helpful. Objective analysis of these  materials will make it possible to reveal both the sources of  our victories and the causes of failures.    Thus, life itself is requiring us to create new armed forces  and to eliminate the significant gap between the composition,  structure and numerical strength of troop groupings inherited  from the former USSR, and the real needs of Russia's defense,  between the nature of modern wars and the traditional forms of  the use of troop groupings. The most unique feature of solving  these problems is that in addition to ensuring reliable defense  of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of  the fatherland, and of its state interests against external  threats, new tasks are arising before the armed forces today:  Closely coordinating with bodies of state government and  administration, making a transition to a new manning system,  providing social protections to servicemen and their families,  and resurrecting the prestige of military service and the system  of military-patriotic values and ideals.    It should be noted, in conclusion, that the time has come to  initiate broad discussion of all problems in the  military-theoretical journal VOYENNAYA MYSL and other military  publications, with the participation of scientists and  scientific collectives, in order to permit subsequent  generalization and implementation of the most sensible ideas and  proposals.    We are standing before the need for shaping, reorganizing  and  reducing the Russian Armed Forces, and within a short period of  time at that. The desire to accomplish these tasks in one or two  years is growing stronger in some circles of our society.  However, the social, political and economic situation in Russia  doesn't allow us to do this. Military development is proceeding  under complex internal and international conditions, and it  requires meticulous, extremely lengthy work.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 8 1993</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Squeeze stirs coffee futures Nearby positions in the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures market were highly volatile this week as a supply squeeze distorted values. The prompt May position climbed Dollars 131 to Dollars 1,625 a tonne at one point, dragging July, the second month, up Dollars 99 to a five-year high of Dollars 1,545. With most short positions thought to have been covered the market went off the boil and the first two contracts closed yesterday at Dollars 1,554 and Dollars 1,472 respectively. But with strong domestic demand limiting Brazilian export availability and Indonesia's harvest delayed by bad weather dealers did not rule out a renewal of strong upward pressure as further 'in-the-money' call (buying) options were operated. Coffee prices had taken a knock at the start of the week, following the Brazilian government's announcement of plans to sell 2.4m bags (60kg each) of stockpiled beans on the domestic market in this financial year. The impact of the announcement was short-lived, however, as fierce protests from growers raised doubts about the plan being carried through. Monday saw the LCE cocoa market's last, despairing attempt to break through the ceiling of its recent Pounds 900-Pounds 920 a tonne trading range (for the July delivery position). When that failed the patience of the US investment funds' ran out and the ensuing flight of cash from the market left the July price languishing a few days later in the low Pounds 970s. At yesterday's close the price stood at Pounds 880 a tonne, down Pounds 21 on the week. 'This shake-out will probably be a good thing for the market in the long run,' one trader told the Reuter news agency, 'but it could mean losing another Pounds 15 or so first.' Gold and platinum prices extended their recent retreats this week after the Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to participate in next week's South African elections eased fears that civil unrest could disrupt production of the two metals. News of a tighter US short-term interest rate policy, which would to help the bond market, was another depressant for the London gold price, which yesterday afternoon was fixed at Dollars 369.65 a troy ounce, the lowest for nearly six months. By the close it had lost another 15 cents. What news there was in the aluminium market this week appeared to be bullish  -International Primary Aluminium Institute figures confirmed that the multilateral scheme to cut excess production was bearing fruit; and at a Brussels meeting participants in the scheme agreed informally to examine ways of extending it to include big producers like Brazil, the Gulf states and Venezuela. But the mood of the market remained bearish. After slipping below Dollars 1,300 a tonne on Monday, the three months price drifted to Dollars 1,275 before finding support. At yesterday's close it stood at Dollars 1,284.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22.25 overall. Having failed in two attempted rallies the three months copper price broke through the bottom of its recent trading range on Thursday. But after bottoming at Dollars 1,877 the price was lifted by Chinese buying and heavy short-covering to end the week at Dollars 1,913.75 a tonne, up Dollars 31.25. Yesterday's Dollars 29.25 rise was aided by news of another big fall in LME warehouse stocks. Zinc had been the LME's biggest loser until a Dollars 9 bounce yesterday - in spite of a big LME stocks rise - trimmed the three months price's fall to Dollars 16.75, at Dollars 931.50 a tonne.  ----------------------------------------------            LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------- Aluminium         +5,250 to 2,601,725 Aluminium alloy   -1,540 to    40,660 Copper           -10,625 to   480,975 Lead              +1,325 to   336,900 Nickel              -702 to   135,756 Zinc              +9,525 to 1,142,100 Tin                 +220 to    25,640  ----------------------------------------------</p>

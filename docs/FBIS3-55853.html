			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Barsukov report: "IMF: 'Budget Restrictions Are </F> Needed'"]    [Text] Washington -- The IMF and the World Bank, which  have published a memorandum on policy toward Russia, have called  on the Russian leadership to pursue the reforms without slowing  down the pace.    The country's current economic misfortunes are caused by the  collapse of the former system rather than by the government's  measures for transition to a market economy, the document says.  Therefore, instead of slowing down the pace of reforms, Russia  ought to accelerate the implementation of reforms with a view to  reducing the period of slump in production and decline of the  population's living standards.    In this memorandum, perceived by local observers as a  response to criticism of the two international financial  organizations' policy toward Russia, the IMF and the World Bank  have emphasized that, in order to reduce its budget deficit and  curb inflation, Russia needs to introduce "tough budget  restrictions" on the financing of state enterprises. It would  also be worth the Russian leadership's while to step up its  efforts in the sphere of privatization, extending it to the  power industry and the military production sphere. Unemployment  will rise as a result of the closure of inefficient enterprises.  But this problem must be solved via the creation of a social  security system and not by subsidizing food and energy prices  for the country's entire population, the document says.    Citing the fact that Russia is insufficiently active in  implementing the measures to curb inflation and reduce the  budget deficit, defined by it jointly with the IMF, the Fund's  leadership will refrain from granting it the second half of the  credit line from the system transformation fund, amounting to  $1.5 billion.</p>

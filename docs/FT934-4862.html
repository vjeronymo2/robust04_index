			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: SA Express orders 12 aircraft from Canadian group SA Express, the fledgling South African regional airline, has ordered 12 de Havilland Dash-8 aircraft from Bombardier, the Canadian transport group. The order, worth USDollars 150m, (Pounds 100.6m) marks both a commercial and political breakthrough for Bombardier in the wake of Ottawa's recent lifting of sanctions against Pretoria. SA Express is a new airline 51 per cent owned by black South African interests, led by Thebe Investment Corporation, and 49 per cent by Lardel Holdings of Ontario. A group of Canadians, with experience in regional airline operations, will initially form the senior management. SA Express has an option on an additional six turboprop Dash 8s. De Havilland, which is jointly owned by Bombardier and the government of Ontario, has sold a total of 392 Dash 8s, of which 359 have been delivered. The Sydney Steel plant in north-eastern Nova Scotia has won a new lease on life with the help of China and its over-burdened rail system, Robert Gibbens writes from Montreal. After months of negotiations, MinMetals, a Chinese government trading agency, will help keep the basic steel and rail-making plant alive for a minimum of three years in partnership with the provincial government. Most of the heat-hardened alloy steel rail being produced will go to China. Sydney Steel, known as Sysco, was taken over by the province in 1967 after Hawker Siddeley Canada threatened to shut it down because of heavy losses. The provincial and federal governments have since spent more than Dollars 1bn to modernise it and cover operating losses. In 1990 it was converted into a high-technology rail making operation for nearly CDollars 300m, (Pounds 152.2m) and providing jobs for 700. Sysco lost CDollars 279m after a special charge in the year ended March 31, 1993, but expected a small operating profit this year. Basic steel output will be 233,000 tonnes. MinMetals and the province will each provide CDollars 15m in operating funds for the next three years. The province will assume Sysco's debt and pension obligations. If Sysco remains profitable, MinMetals will buy it outright for CDollars 30m cash at the end of three years and undertake to keep it open, the government said. The deal is due to be signed by the end of next month.</p>

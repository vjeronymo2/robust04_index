			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (19): Easing the payments headache - Alan Spence finds that passing the responsibility for collection of payment to a factoring company is a less tiresome way of calling in debts / Factoring THERE is nothing like handing over the task of collecting your debts to someone else. Many exporters agree and using factoring companies is the solution they have found. 'It has made life bearable,' says Geoff Mason, managing director of Surrey-based Mason Hydraulics, a company which makes and exports specialist hydraulic equipment and which uses factoring to collect payments and fund sales. In its simplest application, export factoring involves the collection of debts by a factoring company on behalf of an exporter. The exporter delivers the goods to its foreign client, but the responsibility for collection of payment is handed over to the export factor, operating in a correspondent relationship with an import factor in the buyer's country. On the due date, the import factor seeks to collect payment and pass it on to the export factor which, in turn, channels the funds to the exporter, minus the agreed commission. Should there be a payment delay, the import factor located in the buyer's own country is well positioned locally to apply appropriate pressure, especially given its familiarity with local legal practices. 'There is nothing like having a credit manager located in your buyer's market,' says David Richardson, marketing manager of International Factors, a member of the worldwide International Factors Group. But international factoring has two other applications - providing payment guarantees (effectively credit insurance) and pre-payment (effectively export finance). As with simple collection of receivables, the correspondent relationship between factoring companies is central to the process. The import factor in the buyer's country assesses and accepts the credit risk - or not - placing the export factor in a position to effectively provide the requested services to the exporter. In the case of Mason Hydraulics, which factors around 90 per cent of its export turnover through Trade Indemnity Heller Commercial Finance - a member of the International Heller Overseas organisation - the company has opted for a comprehensive service: collection, funding and insurance. Mr Mason says he is 'much more comfortable with professionals collecting our money instead of ourselves'. Collection times have improved by up to 20 per cent, he adds. On the question of pre-payment, which becomes available on evidence of shipment, the company has an agreement that it can draw up to 75 per cent of the value of a contract - which can be between Pounds 300 and Pounds 25,000. 'There are times when we draw up to the hilt, but we usually like to think that there is something left for later,' he says. By comparison, Autovalet Systems - a London-based manufacturer of garment dispensing machines - which uses the services of International Factors, uses the collection service and also the pre-payment facility, in its case up to 80 per cent of the value of invoices. The company chose to handle its credit insurance separately via NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading export credit insurer. One criticism sometimes heard of factoring is the cost. This has to be assessed by exporters in terms of administrative savings in chasing payments, the perceived risk attached to payments and the advantages of pre-payment. Mason Hydraulics pays about 2 per cent of invoice value to cover collections and insurance. Pre-payment costs are geared to prevailing interest rates. International Factors' Mr Richardson says that the company's credit collection and bad debt insurance facilities are charged 'usually towards the lower end of a 0.75 per cent to 2.5 per cent of turnover range'. Pre-payment is usually available at base rate plus 3 per cent, calculated daily. Factoring has also been traditionally accused, especially in the UK, of carrying with it a stigma: that the supplier is facing financial difficulties and therefore needs to resort to the services of professional debt collectors or that the supplier is sufficiently worried about a buyer's financial standing to consider it necessary to push for payment via a factoring company. Mr Mason sees it the other way around. He points out that for a factoring company to accept an exporter as a client, the latter must submit to a thorough examination of its operations - thus a certain kudos is attached to being accepted by a factoring company. On the other hand, if a buyer's feathers are ruffled by being factored, companies which factor most or all of their export receivables can retort that it is simply company policy to proceed in this manner regardless of a client's standing or status. International factoring is now big business. According to Amsterdam-based Factors Chain International, the world's largest factoring chain, turnover worldwide amounted to Dollars 14.9bn in 1992, with FCI members accounting for Dollars 6.6bn. Of the other factoring groups, International Factors handles the largest volume, followed by Heller Overseas. It is possible to factor exports to a vast range of countries, but geographical constraints arise from the fact that the process depends on the existence of local factoring services. While progress is being made in Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics, for example, eastern Europe as a whole lacks sufficient local factoring infrastructure to make the technique a commonly available option. This is true of Latin America - with the notable exception of Mexico. Moreover, factoring and countries with strict exchange controls do not generally mix, as local collection procedures could easily be compromised by government strictures on the release of foreign exchange.

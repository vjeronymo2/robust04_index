			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Health oil hits troubled waters A bitter row over safety and efficacy has split the evening primrose oil business, the fastest-growing sector of the UK nutritional supplements industry. Efamol, the company that pioneered evening primrose oil as a health product, issued a wide-ranging attack on its rivals in a statement headed: 'Women duped by many evening primrose oil manufacturers'. Its competitors replied with statements denying its charges and making some of their own. Seven Seas, a Hanson subsidiary which is the UK market leader, called Efamol 'an over-priced product with declining sales'. It said: 'We are sorry that a once-respected name should resort to scaremongering to prop up flagging sales.' Roche Consumer Health, part of the giant Swiss pharmaceutical group, said: 'We are dismayed that Efamol has issued such misleading, disparaging and inaccurate data which will serve only to confuse the consumer.' Evening primrose sales in the UK are estimated to have leapt from Pounds 17m in 1991 to Pounds 32m in 1992 and Pounds 36m last year. The worldwide market is worth about Pounds 200m a year. Efamol - part of the Scotia pharmaceutical company floated on the London Stock Exchange last autumn - said its products were the only ones on the market 'put through rigorous human testing to clinical standards'. Two hundred clinical trials have shown their benefits in a wide range of conditions, from skin problems to premenstrual tension. Rival products did not have the technology to extract gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) - the active ingredient in primrose oils - so cleanly from the plant's seeds and preserve it in good condition in the capsules without harmful oxidation, according to Efamol. It also claims that some other producers boost the GLA content of their capsules with oil from the borage plant. Efamol quoted three university studies which allegedly show borage oil to be ineffective in its biological effects compared with primrose oil and indicating that it may actually be dangerous. Roche and Seven Seas, however, categorically denied that any such conclusions could be drawn from the studies.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AREA GROWTH AND TRANSIT  </P> <P> Election results are now in and it appears that Prop. C won by a razor-thin  margin of 14,502 votes. As a result, 8.5 million Los Angeles County residents  are now faced with a one-half cent sales tax increase.  </P> <P> Think about it. A small percentage of the county's population is forcing the  rest of us to live with the burden of higher taxes to pay for a transit system  that is doomed to fail. Prop. C won, not because of a reasoned debate on the  merits of rail, but because of heavy campaign contributions from the railroads.  They stood to gain most from the sale of their white elephant right-of-ways to  the public.  </P> <P> Prop. C is absurd, since the county still has $370 million waiting to be spent.  Not one single major transportation improvement has been completed with the  money from the 1980 Prop. A vote, with the exception of the Long Beach rail  line, which cost $800 million more than projected. Metro Rail's overruns have  climbed to $538 million without moving one passenger! All of this would be  understandable if rail was a viable solution to our traffic problems. But rail  only diverts patronage from existing RTD buses.  </P> <P> The only way to solve our traffic problems is to deal with the underlying cause  -- out-of-control growth. In the downtown area alone, more than 55 million  square feet of new construction will be built in the next three years. The real  culprits are the Los Angeles City Council, CRA, Mayor Tom Bradley and the  County Board of Supervisors, none of whom seem to be able to understand that  overdevelopment creates traffic.  </P> <P> What we need are tough limits on growth and development, and an honest  admission of the cause of our problems.  </P> <P> GERALD A. SILVER  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

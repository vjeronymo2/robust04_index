			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMERICA CEO SAYS FOUNDER WAS PAID $5.4 MILLION  </P> <P> The new chairman of beleaguered FundAmerica Inc. said Friday that a review of  the firm's books revealed that company founder Robert T. Edwards was paid $5.4  million thus far this year and mysteriously wired $11.3 million to two foreign  entities.  </P> <P> Howard Ruff, who was also named chief executive of FundAmerica earlier this  week, said these payments and wire transfers raise serious questions about  Edwards, who was charged two weeks ago with operating FundAmerica as an illegal  pyramid scheme in Florida.  </P> <P> "To put it mildly, it blew me away," said Ruff about the company's payments to  Edwards. "That's several times more than the CEOs in most Fortune 500  companies" earn.  </P> <P> The financial revelations came as an official of the California attorney  general's office filed a statement in federal court alleging that FundAmerica  operated an "illegal pyramid or endless chain scheme" in California, where the  company is under investigation.  </P> <P> The developments come a little more than two weeks after Florida officials  arrested Edwards and charged him with running an illegal lottery. Florida  officials allege that Edwards bilked $8.2 million from state residents.  </P> <P> Edwards, who is free on a $1-million bond, has denied the charges, calling  FundAmerica a legitimate multilevel marketing company. The company sells  memberships for a fee in exchange for rebates on various goods and services.  Representatives who sell memberships receive bonuses. The firm has about  100,000 U.S. members.  </P> <P> Ruff said Friday that Florida officials have told him that they will indict the  corporation itself on criminal charges Thursday. Florida prosecutor Peter  Antonacci confirmed Ruff's statement, although he would not discuss the  specific charges.  </P> <P> "This was not unexpected," Ruff said. "Other companies in network marketing  have come under indictment and survived. It does not automatically mean the  death and demise of FundAmerica."  </P> <P> Ruff, who writes a nationally known investment newsletter, announced earlier  this week that he and several unnamed associates intend to buy FundAmerica and  try to save it from bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Ruff said in a meeting with supporters Tuesday that his first look at  FundAmerica's books indicated that there had been no improprieties and that the  company could be put on a sound footing. He seemed less certain Friday.  </P> <P> "I could PR you and say, 'No, no we are going to save this,' " Ruff said. "I  honestly don't know."  </P> <P> This came after he released a FundAmerica financial statement that purported to  show that Edwards received a $1-million-a-month salary since May and took  $316,821 in bonuses between January and June. The bonuses were paid to Edwards  for his role in attracting new members, Ruff said.  </P> <P> What's more, Edwards was paid $3.1 million in management fees, according to the  FundAmerica statement.  </P> <P> Edwards, according to Ruff, personally wired $10.5 million of FundAmerica money  to a Netherlands entity between October, 1989, and June of this year. Ruff said  these were royality payments made to an unknown individual who helped Edwards  with the idea of starting FundAmerica.  </P> <P> "Some person unknown . . . was paid 12.5% of the gross receipts," Ruff said.  Wire receipts released by FundAmerica showed that the money was transferred  from a FundAmerica account at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles to Lloyds  Bank in Holland.  </P> <P> Ruff also said Edwards wired $827,049 to another entity in Hong Kong between  Oct. 31, 1989, and May 23, 1990. Ruff said the money was interest owed to an  unknown party who made a $4-million loan to FundAmerica.  </P> <P> Edwards "went personally to the bank and wired these funds," Ruff said.  </P> <P> He said Edwards began receiving a regular salary of $1 million a month shortly  after payments to these entities stopped.  </P> <P> "The idea was rather than have the payments go in this form, they would simply  give him a $1-million-a-month salary," Ruff said. "I assume it was because he  wanted at least some of the profits of these entities."  </P> <P> The money wired to foreign countries and the salary paid to Edwards amounts to  about $17 million, according to the FundAmerica financial statement provided by  Ruff.  </P> <P> Ruff said the company's directors were aware of at least some of the payments  made to Edwards and the entities.  </P> <P> Ruff said he has not spoken to Edwards about these payments: "I have no idea of  the whereabouts of Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards made one call (earlier this week)  to the company and asked to speak to me, and I chose not to speak to him."  </P> <P> FundAmerica is struggling to survive and is desperately in need of cash. The  company has $17 million in assets, nearly all of which was frozen at the order  of the federal judge presiding over a $150-million class-action lawsuit filed  in San Francisco against FundAmerica.  </P> <P> In a legal opinion filed in that case, Susan Henrichsen, California deputy  attorney general, said Friday that FundAmerica's marketing plan emphasizes that  participants can pay money for the chance to make even more money by recruiting  people into the organization.  </P> <P> "The money earned by such participants is based principally on their recruits'  purchases from the company, and not on sales" of a product or service,  Henrichsen said.  </P> <P> Henrichsen said California's FundAmerica inquiry is continuing. She said  evidence shows that there were six to 10 times more memberships sold than there  are actual members, a sign that memberships were sold over and over again  without being used. She also said the company's controller submitted  information saying that for a three-month period, bonuses paid for services  were just $155,000, while the bonuses paid for recruiting totaled $4.7 million.  </P> <P> Henrichsen said a federal court order issued last week freezing FundAmerica's  assets should be continued. She said the attorney general's office is not  planning to file charges against FundAmerica at this point so other enforcement  actions will not be duplicated, diluting the company's assets, which may be  used for refunds.  </P></p>

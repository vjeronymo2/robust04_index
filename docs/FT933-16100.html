			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Housing market revival 'starting to falter' THE STRONGEST warning yet to government that the housing market revival has started to falter was made yesterday by the country's largest building employers' organisation. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, appealed for an immediate cut in interest rates to boost consumer confidence. He said building output was still falling after four years of decline, leaving the construction industry deeply entrenched in recession. Any attempt by the government to cut public borrowing at the expense of construction investment programmes would further damage an industry which had already lost 500,000 jobs since summer 1989. A confederation survey of 600 building companies showed that a quarter of those questioned expected to make further redundancies in the next three months. Sir Brian said: 'Any optimism felt earlier in the year and after the Autumn Statement measures to help industry has not been sustained. 'Our markets are suffering from a lack of consumer confidence caused by political and economic uncertainties, speculation about possible tax increases and a continuing fear of unemployment.' This was having a 'particularly severe impact on the private housing market which, having shown an improvement in prospects in the spring, has now faltered with reservations and house sales falling since the beginning of May'. The confederation's survey showed that 95 per cent of construction companies were still working at less than three quarters of capacity. Enquiries for work from potential customers had deteriorated in April, May and June after showing signs of improvement in the previous six months. Some companies, desperate for cash from progress payments, were winning jobs at prices which would not cover the eventual cost of doing the work. Building material price increases were also causing concern. Sir Brian, who warned that more company failures and job losses were likely to follow, said: 'From these results I can see no prospect of any sustained recovery within the next 12 months. It is therefore essential that the government takes further action to stimulate our industry.' A decision by ministers to give the go-ahead for the Jubilee Line Underground extension in London would give an important boost to the industry. Sir Brian appealed to the government to extend capital allowances for industrial building beyond the end of next year. He also wanted greater action from Treasury to promote private investment in public works such as hospitals and prisons as well as road and rail schemes. His comments came as the Department of the Environment published figures showing a sharp rise in the number of homes started. These rose 19 per cent during the three months to the end of May compared with the previous three months.</p>

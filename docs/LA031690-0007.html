			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: WATER CONSERVATION PROPOSAL DISCUSSED  </P> <P> A proposal that would penalize farmers and growers for excessive use of water  and encourage efficient irrigation drew a mixed response at a public hearing  Thursday.  </P> <P> The ordinance, proposed for 1992 by the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management  Agency, also reduces allotments to customers, now based on past usage, by 5%.  The measure is designed to reduce by 25% the water taken from underground  sources through much of central Ventura County by 2015.  </P> <P> The agency regulates the use of 150,000 acre-feet of ground water annually. The  water is used by water companies and cities within a 185-square mile region of  the county. Farmers use about 70% of the agency's water.  </P> <P> John Crowley, head of the agency, said at a hearing Thursday at the county  government center that the measure would achieve that reduction in stages over  23 years.  </P> <P> "I would definitely call this a conservation measure," Ventura County  hydrologist Rick Farnsworth said. "This will have the biggest impact on the  growers."  </P> <P> Rewards would be available to growers who can demonstrate an irrigation  efficiency of 80% or better.  </P> <P> But farmers who use more than their predetermined allotments would incur  penalties and be forced to pay as much as $200 for exceeding quotas by 15%.  </P> <P> "One of the main purposes of this ordinance is to show that farming is a  business," said Len Maulhardt, agency chairman.  </P> <P> "Growers need to make a decision whether to invest in better irrigation methods  or to pay the stiff penalties. If they're having a hard time growing celery at  80% efficiency, then they can either rotate two crops instead of three or move  to dry beans for a period of time."  </P> <P> Some attending the hearing praised the proposal. Others questioned whether the  conservation measures would be fairly applied districtwide.  </P> <P> Another public hearing is scheduled for March 23. SCOTT LAWRENCE  </P></p>

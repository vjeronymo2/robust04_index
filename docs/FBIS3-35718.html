He will try to  rely on a majority in parliament and his first moves will be  directed toward improving the work of the Presidium of the  Supreme Soviet -- deputies are at present divided and understand  each other poorly. There will be no change to foreign policy  priorities.    Describing his attitude toward Stanislav Shushkevich, the  new  chairman of the Supreme Soviet said it was normal. He stressed  that the former speaker has many fine qualities, but like anyone  else he also has adverse traits: Shushkevich and I differed  only on certain aspects of politics in relation to the CIS  countries' collective security agreement.    Hryb regretted that the process of adopting the new  Constitution has been subject to unjustified delay in parliament  and stressed that ever since entering parliament he has  constantly called for the introduction of a presidency with the  functions of head of the executive authorities.    Hryb decribed the prospects for Belarus-Russian relations as  extremely good. We are Slavs, we are neighbors. I have high  hopes regarding the arrival in Minsk of a Russian Government  delegation headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin. Hryb supports the  idea of combining the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus and  hopes that the same prices for fuel will apply in both states.    The new chairman of the Belarus Supreme Soviet dwelt on his  attitude to the concept of neutrality. He announced that to be  neutral is our wish, but pure neutrality is at present  impossible because a foreign state's troops are on Belarus soil  and will remain there under treaty until the year 2000. He  supported [Prime Minister Vyacheslav] Kebich's idea of  reorganizing the government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Denmark supports the  European Union's expansion by Central and East European  countries, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said  after his talks with his Slovak counterpart Eduard Kukan today.  Petersen, who arrived for a two-day visit to Slovakia, said  that once Scandinavian states and Austria are admitted to the  EU, "a long-term" need to expand the community eastwards would  arise because union between West and East was the only guarantee  of stability on the continent.    Asked by CTK whether Denmark preferred individual or joint  entry of Central European countries into the EU, Petersen said  the EU would apply the same model as in admitting the  Scandinavian countries and Austria. The pattern is clear and  logical: to conduct talks with each country separately, but  simultaneously to the biggest measure possible, he stressed.    Petersen said that there were no problems in relations  between Slovakia and Denmark, but added that trade was very low  and cooperation other areas could also be promoted.

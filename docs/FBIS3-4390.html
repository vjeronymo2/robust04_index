With the opening up, Beijing has called forth its  new energy and vitality. Currently, the more than 10 million  people of various nationalities in the city are struggling hard  for all-round social and economic development in an effort to  attain the well-off level in the capital three years ahead of  schedule.    This past year of 1993 has witnessed tremendous achievements  in all construction work in Beijing. Its national economy has  developed in a sustained, rapid and healthy manner [chixu,  kuaisu, jiankang di xiangqian fazhan 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256  1660 4104 0686 0467 4099 1455]. The yearly gross domestic  output value reached 85.2 billion yuan, a 12 percent increase  over the previous year. In agriculture, there was a good  harvest for the sixteenth successive year. The growth rate in  industrial output value came to 18.5 percent. The tertiary  sector saw exceptionally rapid development, giving rise to an  all-round flourish in commerce, tourism, finance, insurance, and  real estate, as well as an upsurge of new undertakings, such as  information and consulting services. An abundance of modern,  high-level, commercial facilities rose straight from the ground  in the city; the marketplace enjoyed brisk sales; and the total  retail sales volume amounted to 5.49 billion yuan, a 27 percent  increase. To meet the needs of a developing socialist market  economy, large-scale trading centers for oil, tobacco, building  materials, and industrial consumer goods have been set up and  gone into operation one after another, resulting in an  ever-greater increase in the volume of trade. The income and  purchasing power of city residents also rose rapidly. An  opening market has great potential,s indicative of bright  prospects for development. Eye-catching changes have taken  place in both urban and rural areas. Urban infrastructural  construction has recorded marked progress, accomplishing a host  of major projects in water, electricity, gas, heat supply, and  roads and communications. In urban housing, 5.5 million square  meters have been completed, initiating the "Well-Off Housing  Project" aimed at improving the living conditions of city  dwellers. Remarkable achievements also were made in tree  planting and afforestation of the environment. Science,  technology, and education registered all-round development. The  comprehensive reform work in the first light industry and first  commercical departments was carried out in an all-round way.  State- owned large and medium-sized enterprises quickened their  step in transforming management systems. The "Tianlong",  "Tianqiao", "Renjie" and "Stone" bonds were floated in Shanghai,  Shenzhen, and Hong Kong, respectively, making a new breakthrough  in the trial introduction of the shareholding system.  Explorations in marketplace construction, social security,  transference of the right to use state-owned land, and the  transformation of the management functions of government  institutions were made, and positive results were achieved. The  policy of opening up was implemented in unprecedented width and  depth. So far the city has approved the establishment of 7,321  foreign-funded enterprises, and the number of multinational  companies and international consortia that have come to invest  in Beijing has multiplied. Exchanges with foreign countries in  economics, culture, and science and technology have been very  active. Apart from the 14 large cities in the world with which  Beijing has friendly relations, it established friendly  relations with the capital cities of four more countries last  year, and it has kept up friendly ties with nearly 100 cities in  the world. Tourists coming from outside mainland China totalled  2 million.    The year 1994 is a crucial one, when Beijing will strive to  attain the comparatively well-off level three years ahead of  schedule and will march toward higher objectives. It is also an  important year for Beijing to speed up the socialist market  economy reform. In light of the goals put forward by the  party's 14th national congress, the municipal government has  decided on its general guiding principle, which is to emancipate  our minds, firmly grasp opportunities, make breakthroughs in key  projects, and advance with greater strides in reform and  construction in order to achieve the well-off level ahead of the  schedule. The whole city will do its utmost -- with the  accessible maximum standards in view -- further to promote  reform and opening up and to push forward the cause of  modernization construction.    First, we must carry out reform in revenue and expenditure,  finance, investment, planning, and foreign trade, with the  construction of a modern enterprise system and a macrocontrol  system as the key; we must accelerate the establishment of the  market system; and we must develop vigorously the production  materials, finance, labor force, real estate, technology, and  information markets, with the construction of the production  materials market as the key link. We must continue to implement  reform in the social security and housing systems; to further  deepen reform in the countryside, with the raising of  agricultural labor productivity as the goal, and with a modern  agricultural enterprise system set up at the core; and to  perfect reform in education and other areas.    Second, we must emphasize the utilization of foreign capital  and further expand the opening up. We must accelerate the  growth of foreign-invested enterprises, and attempts must be  made to improve the investment environment and to broaden the  areas for foreign investment. We must guide foreign investment  toward the construction of infrastructural facilities, toward  the transformation of old and run-down housing, and toward weak  links in the city's national economy. We must actively promote  trade and non-trade undertakings, and must cultivate overseas  enterprises energetically. We must foster domestic and foreign  markets by making better use of domestic and foreign resources,  and must extensively encourage international exchange.    Third, we must stimulate economic growth so as to make new  breakthroughs. The domestic gross industrial production value  is expected to grow by 10 percent or more. We must further  perfect the industrial structure. We must develop high-yield,  high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, and must  accelerate the construction of hilly regions. We must gather  our forces to develop supporting and key industries, and to  enhance the overall quality of manufacturing and the  modernization level. Taking advantage of Beijing's strength, we  must develop the tertiary sector in a big way so as to cater to  the needs of the developing market economy and to build Beijing  into a modern international metropolis. According to the  revised General Planning of the Municipality of Beijing, to be  implemented up to the year 2010, it is imperative to speed up  the construction of infrastructural facilities with utmost  efforts and determination. Billions of yuan of investment will  be put into electricity, transport, water supply, fuel, posts  and telecommunications, totaling more than 30 large-scale key  projects. We must accelerate the transformation of the old part  of the city, do a good job in the "Well-Off Housing Project" in  order to improve city dwellers' living conditions as quickly as  possible. We must make efforts to afforest the city and protect  its environment; to place education, science, and technology in  a strategic position; and manage to run well the city's New  Technological Industrial Experimental Zone, the Beijing Economic  and Technological Development Zone, and other smaller industrial  zones in various districts and counties; and increase investment  in education through diverse channels and train more qualified  personnel for the 21st century. While quickening the pace of  opening up and modernization construction, it is imperative to  strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and socialist  civic virtue, to try to maintain and develop the current  excellent situation of stability and unity, and to make  unremitting efforts to achieve the grand goal of the capital  city's modernization construction.    We are convinced that with the concerted efforts of the  entire population of the city, Beijing will march into the 21st  century with a completely new face, and will join in the ranks  of modernized, international metropolises.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with the Polish Ownership Transformations </F> Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek by Aleksander Geryn on the "Balance  -- Governmental Magazine" program; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Geryn] Your colleagues from  the Council of Ministers are counting very much on this revenue  from privatization. They think that with this revenue, they  will be able to close some gaps in the budget.    [Kaczmarek] I think that generally speaking, this is one of  the dilemmas of privatization in Poland: To what extent the  mechanism of selling state-owned property -- and I would like to  stress that I think state-owned property can only be sold once  since we do not plan on nationalization -- is supposed to  constitute a mechanism of a kind of safety cushion for public  finance problems. Poland is undergoing some quite significant  and major reforms and they are accompanied by disturbances in  some sectors of public finances under some of my minister  colleagues, so on the one hand they are critical of  privatization, but on the other hand they expect precisely their  expenditures to be financed by revenue from privatization. That  of course reminds me of the philosophy of applying a band-aid to  some of the wounds in the budget, whereas I am more interested  in revenue from privatization serving the purpose of  restructuring companies or branches that the state may regard as  strategic, within its industrial or economic policy, so we would  not eat our own tail.    [Geryn] Up to now, privatization has been and still  continues to be criticized. Some even say outrightly that the  concept is an implementation of a liberal dogma and that since  half of our economy has been privatized, these processes should  be slowed down a bit. Do you think that Poland can currently  afford to slow down the rate of privatization?    [Kaczmarek] This will always continue to be a dilemma and I  think the Sejm debate which is ahead of us concerning the  directions of privatization will be a debate where I hope some  -- and I will encourage them to do so -- will speak about what  needs to be done in the future, whereas some others will  stubbornly stick to the past from which I personally would like  to draw conclusions. I think there will also be some  disappointments in this regard, either by various reviewers or  by sensation-seekers, in the sense that there can be no radical  change in the directions of privatization, and the simple reason  for that is that we are just learning ownership transformations,  that is privatization. What goal should privatization serve in  Poland? Should it be financing the budget deficit, improving  the efficiency of the Polish economy, extending ownership rights  to large parts of society, or should it serve primarily to  exclusively concentrate those mechanisms which serve to improve  the economic efficiency, to increase competitiveness, and  consequently to increase prosperity? One should also keep in  mind another issue: Ownership transformations should not only  be understood to mean a transfer of state-owned property to the  private sector, but also as a process of creating the right  conditions for the functioning of the private sector from the  very beginning, from scratch. And as I have also recently been  saying repeatedly, privatization is also a system and a process  of transferring power, and that is certainly the reason it  generates so many conflicts.    [Geryn] Mr. Minister, forgive me this analogy but if I were  to close my eyes now while listening to you, I would have a  feeling of listening not to Minister Kaczmarek but to [former  Ownership Transformations] Minister Lewandowski.    [Kaczmarek] It is hard to describe some economic processes  using words other than these since these processes are simply  constant and always the same. All we can do is draw some  conclusions from the past and I think one could probably compile  quite a long list of such conclusions with regard to which there  would have to be changes in the current draft. As the  government, we intend to present in the draft some material to  the Sejm where emphases will be placed in different ways, with  regard to Polish privatization, with particular emphasis  continuing to be placed on developing the capital market,  increasing competitiveness, as well as on preference being  primarily given to restructuring, followed by the selling of  companies, and on improving the access of employee partnerships  to small companies, including performing the role of owner. But  there is immediately another dilemma here: Can Poland as a  state administration currently afford to manage 6,000  state-owned enterprises? I think the answer is no.    [Geryn] Will we finally see a law on reprivatization this  year? The issue has been dragging on for four years now.  Everybody knows that there can be no progress in privatization  without reprivatization.    [Kaczmarek] The issue is included on the list of priorities  when it comes to the directions of privatization for 1994. We  have to approach the issue of the scale of reprivatization from  a perspective of two issues, if I could phrase it this way: The  first one is the state's financial capabilities -- which means  it cannot be a process which would lead to a weakening of the  state budget whose condition is quite weak anyway; and the other  one is that we will also be guided by the principle that up to  now a law was in force -- it could have been a bad law but it  was still a law -- and so we will implement reprivatization in  cases where somebody's property was nationalized illegally,  without paying compensation, and so on and so forth. We will  try to observe these principles, or at least such is the  conclusion drawn from initial debates during sessions of the  Council of Ministers.</p>

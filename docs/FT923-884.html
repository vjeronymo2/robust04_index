			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on French franc eases THE PRESSURE on the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism eased yesterday, even though the scale of intervention by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France to support the currency was small, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank intervened continuously on the foreign exchanges to support the franc, but the amounts that were purchased appeared to be smaller than in previous days. The Bank of France also bought francs after ERM trading closed at 4pm London time as the franc fell below FFr3.41 to the D-Mark, near to its floor of FFr3.4305. It later ended in London at FFr3.4010. In US trading, the franc benefited from a wave of short-covering by investors who believed that a devaluation might be avoided altogether, and peaked at FFr3.3899. Yesterday's battle to save the franc was a clear victory for the central banks, even if the war to avoid a devaluation has not yet been won. The Bank of France held the currency without raising its five to 10-day lending rate any further and without pushing its intervention rate above 9.6 per cent. Mr John Hall, international economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, said that if the franc sees the other side of FFr3.38, the war will be won altogether. A more cynical view is that the franc and other ERM currencies are being supported by the reimposition of exchange controls in several European countries, a move with serious costs for the proposed timetable for European monetary union. Yesterday, Ireland followed Spain's lead in tightening exchange controls to ward off speculators, forcing non-residents to get official approval to engage in Irish punt swaps. Portugal also introduced exchange controls along similar lines. There were rumours last night that the Bundesbank was asking commercial banks to restrict the purchase of German Treasury bills because overnight rates in the German money market had been at uncompetitively low levels, although this could not be substantiated. All these moves reduced the purchase of D-Marks, and pushed the escudo and the punt higher. But the most seriously troubled ERM currency yesterday was the Spanish peseta, which closed at Pta69.69 to the D-Mark, not far away from its floor of Pta72.62. The reimposition of exchange controls triggered a collapse in the Spanish stock market, undermining confidence in Spain's economy. Traders reported that spot exchange was the only operation possible in pesetas, punts and escudos, and that forward markets had dried up. The volatility was felt in Asia, with investors repatriating their European investments and translating them into yen, which closed at Y120.6 to the dollar in London.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Dozens of people in Soviet Georgia were missing and feared dead after a small  village was flooded when a landslide caused a river to overflow its banks, the  official Tass news agency reported. The Tass report, filed by its reporter in  the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said that an enormous wall of earth crashed  down on the Charukh River and formed a natural dam about 325 feet high and  2,000 feet across, causing a deluge that submerged four houses with about 30  people inside. Only five people were pulled alive from the water and one died a  short time later, it said. Two bodies were recovered. A local bus believed to  be carrying more than 20 passengers also was swept away, and a search for  survivors produced no results, Tass said.  </P></p>

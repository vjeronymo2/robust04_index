			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTON UTILITIES GURU STEPS OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> To the millions of personal computer users who have come to depend on his  software programs and who have dubbed him the "software saint," the realization  that Peter Norton has limits like any other mere mortal may be a bit hard to  accept.  </P> <P> But it's true. Peter Norton -- by his own admission -- no longer can run Peter  Norton Computing, the software publishing house he founded in Santa Monica six  years ago. And so today marks the completion of one of the most critical  transitions in the life of a young company: from management by its founder to  management by professionals recruited from other successful computer ventures.  </P> <P> "I'm not an executive and never was," admits Norton, the creator of the  million-selling Norton Utilities, the program that, among other things, allows  computer users to retrieve files that were carelessly or inexplicably zapped  into oblivion. "My company has outgrown my management ability."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ads to Continue  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Norton, a tall, gawky fellow who appears far younger than his 45  years, turned over the reins of his company to a new chief executive, Ronald  Posner, whose experience in the PC software industry includes stints at Borland  International in the Silicon Valley and Ashton-Tate in Torrance. And today,  David Blumstein joins Norton from Ingram Micro D distributors in Santa Ana as  president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> What will happen to Norton, one of the Los Angles area's few high-tech  superstars?  </P> <P> Well, for starters, he gets to continue appearing in the Dewar's Scotch ads,  which are plastered all over freeway billboards and national magazines. As  company chairman, he'll also concentrate on software planning, and he should  have a lot more time to spend on his favorite avocation: patron of the arts in  Los Angeles and Santa Monica.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Job Hopped  </P> <P> Just 10 years ago, few would have predicted that Norton would become a sort of  elder statesman in the computer industry. After dropping out of college in the  middle of his senior thesis and taking another four years before completing his  education, Norton spent the next 12 years drifting from one computer job to the  next, never staying at one more than two years.  </P> <P> Today, he lives with his wife and young children in a Santa Monica mansion  filled with wild contemporary art and motors around the Westside in a gray BMW  with a "MRIBMPC" vanity plate.  </P> <P> "His program established the category of what we now know as PC utility  programs," says Stewart Alsop, a personal computer market analyst in the  Silicon Valley. "These programs overcome the shortcomings of computers, and his  overcomes the biggest shortcoming of them all: the loss of your work. . . . He  is an enormously respected figure in the business."  </P> <P> On the strength of Norton's initial utilities program, introduced in 1983, and  a couple of others, Peter Norton Computing reported sales last year of about  $15 million. The company isn't about to rival Microsoft, which is galloping  toward the $1-billion sales mark, for the No. 1 spot among software publishers.  But it is sufficient to give the company the No. 30 spot in an annual ranking  of the 100-largest software publishers compiled by Soft* Letter, a Boston  newsletter.  </P> <P> But the new management, with chairman Norton cheering them on, isn't content  with being just No. 30.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Next Generation  </P> <P> In an interview from their offices overlooking the Santa Monica pier, Posner  said he and Blumstein will be responsible for mapping and executing a strategy  to expand the business more quickly, a strategy that could include acquiring  smaller software houses and taking the company public in the not-so-distant  future.  </P> <P> Although reluctant to reveal the precise directions of the future growth,  Posner says he is eager to exploit untapped opportunities for the company's  existing product line in international markets. In addition, he said the  company, whose products so far have been written exclusively for IBM and  compatible personal computers, is developing similar programs for other  computers, such as Apple's Macintosh.  </P> <P> The company is writing programs to run on computers using Unix, a set of  computer operating instructions that typically run sophisticated and powerful  systems used by scientists and engineers. Although the market for Unix machines  so far has been limited, they figure to be used more frequently in the future  as general-purpose office machines.  </P> <P> "It's a hot market and one that we want to be in," Posner says. "And the basic  service of our Utilities program is a natural for any computer. . . . In fact,  you can expect to see us on all major machines in the future."  </P></p>

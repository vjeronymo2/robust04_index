			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts race ahead on back of inflation forecasts THE UK government bond market raced ahead on the back of the Bank of England's inflation forecasts, and even the announcement of Pounds 1.2bn in new supply failed to dampen the market's high spirits. The Bank's quarterly report provided welcome news on the inflation front for the gilt market. The Bank said underlying inflation was likely to stay below the Treasury's ceiling of 4 per cent over the next two years. In addition, news of a half-point cut in French interest rates yesterday morning fuelled hopes of a further cut in the UK base rate. Dealers reported healthy buying interest from European investors. The Liffe gilt futures contract rallied from Tuesday's close of 112.01 to reach a high of 113.05, but ended the day at 112.29. The market's strength allowed the Bank to sell the remainder of two of the gilt tranches announced last Friday - a Pounds 1bn tranche of 8.5 per cent Treasury stock due 2007 and a Pounds 200m tranche of 2.5 per cent index-linked gilts due 2024. With both tranches out of the way, the Bank announced a further Pounds 1.2bn of assorted gilt issues for sale, consisting of: Pounds 200m of 7.25 per cent bonds due 1998; Pounds 200m of 8 per cent gilts due 2003; Pounds 200m of 7.75 per cent stock due 2006; Pounds 200m of 8.75 per cent stock due 2017; and Pounds 400m of 2.5 per cent index-linked gilts due 2020. A HALF-POINT cut in French interest rates, and speculation that other European central banks would follow suit shortly, helped spur a strong rally across continental Europe yesterday with the high-yielding markets of Spain and Italy enjoying the biggest gains. The Banque de France cut its 24-hour lending rate by 50 basis points to 9.25 per cent, and the prospect of further interest rate cuts pushed the French bond market to a record high. The September futures contract on the Matif settled at 122.64, up 0.36. German government bonds rallied, with the Liffe futures contract rising from its opening level of 97.38 to reach a high of 97.60 before drifting lower to close around 97.46. A SOARING yen coupled with strong domestic demand and strong bond markets in the US and Europe, provided a boost for the Japanese debt market. The September futures contract opened at 111.77 and reached a new high of 112.01. Meanwhile, the December futures contract, which has taken over as the key contract, moved from 111.04 at the opening to reach a high of 111.37 before closing at 111.20. The yen strengthened to a record Y103.55 to the dollar in London trading, which economists point out should make it easier for the Bank of Japan to ease interest rates. US TREASURIES moved higher yesterday afternoon, recouping their morning losses after a successful auction of Dollars 11bn in 10-year notes. Following the auction, the yield of the benchmark 30-year bond set a record low of 6.43 per cent and remained at that level through the afternoon. In late trading, the long bond was quoted  1/8 higher at 109 1/16 , yielding 6.433 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note edged  1/32 higher to yield 4.066 per cent. Although last week's Dollars 16.67bn three-year note auction was reasonably successful, the market was nervous ahead of yesterday's auction following the Treasury's recent decision to reduce the long-bond issue in the last leg of the quarterly refunding auctions. The strength of the 10-year note auction was reflected in a record bid-to-cover ratio of 3.15 to 1. There was no tail and the average yield of 5.78 per cent was the lowest since the regular auction of the issue started in 1976.</p>

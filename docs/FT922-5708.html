			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Observer: On the move Did the Cadbury report say anything about putting staff convenience above shareholder value? Sir Adrian Cadbury's review of corporate governance this week happened to coincide with an announcement from his old stable Cadbury Schweppes that the sweets and drinks manufacturer is on the move. Having outgrown its corporate headquarters near Marble Arch - Connaught Place, which it owns - it is trading up some to Berkeley Square in the heart of Mayfair at a tidy Pounds 55 per square foot. Challenged about this apparent extravagance in the midst of Britain's gathering property crisis, the company says it thinks it has an excellent deal, including an unspecified rent-free period. While it looked 'around the M25 corridor', it prefers the West End; one of its primary concerns is not to uproot its staff. It adds that it is looking forward to the big cash flow boost from the sale of the old building - 'when the market picks up'.</p>

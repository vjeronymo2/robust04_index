			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Turkey arrests Kurdish MPs Turkish police yesterday detained two radical Kurdish MPs after parliament lifted their immunity from prosecution on charges which carry the death penalty, Reuter reports from Ankara. The Anatolian news agency said Hatip Dicle, leader of the Kurdish-based Democracy party (DEP), and his colleague Orhan Dogan had been detained outside the parliament building in Ankara. Parliament also lifted the immunity of Kurdish MPs Sirri Sakik and Mahmut Alinak and was expected to take the same step against three other Kurdish deputies and an MP accused of defaming modern Turkey's secular founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Ankara's state security court wants to charge all eight MPs under Article 125 of the penal code, which bans treason and crimes against the state.</p>

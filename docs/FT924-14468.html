			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Letter: Unilever chief urges industry to endorse Maastricht ratification Sir, I write to express Unilever's views on the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. We strongly believe that ratification should be firmly endorsed by business and industry throughout Europe, and that organisations within member states, such as the Confederation of British Industry, should actively support their governments through the local ratification process. Unilever is a global business, but some 60 per cent of our sales still take place within our European heartland. Unilever believes that failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty would represent a big setback in the continuous process of establishing a strong and competitive Europe within the world economic order. The formalisation of the single European market in January 1993 represents a new milestone in the rationalisation of our European markets, and it will undoubtedly bring significant benefits to our customers throughout Europe, notably in the form of greater efficiencies and reduced costs. The Maastricht treaty, as now drafted, builds on that achievement. Specifically, it provides for the evolution of a political and monetary framework which will enhance and enable the even more effective working of the single European market. Like all such treaties, it embodies compromises and trade-offs designed to address the circumstances and concerns of individual member states. Taken as a whole, however, it is undoubtedly good for Europe. As a leading international company with a base in the UK, Unilever would also wish to make its views clear on the British position. We note the specific exceptions which were negotiated by the prime minister at Maastricht, and we believe they address widely held British views. The treaty is good for Britain and we should endorse it. More important, however, is the fact that if the process of ratification in Britain were to fail, the position of Britain within Europe would be gravely damaged. Whether or not other member states decided to proceed without us, our political and economic isolation would increase dramatically, and our business competitiveness both within Europe and in world markets would be seriously threatened. Britain's status as a preferred location for inward investment to Europe would be at risk, and the competitiveness of our goods and services in world markets would be progressively eroded. Seen from a world perspective, Britain is self-evidently a part of Europe, and our future is heavily dependent on forging ever stronger economic links with our European neighbours.

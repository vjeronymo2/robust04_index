			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: City looks for clues to shape of new economic policy - Ways in which Treasury strategy may change after Britain's ERM withdrawal AS expectations in the City about an early cut in interest rates faded slightly yesterday, the focus of attention swung towards the likely building blocks for any new government economic strategy. With Britain likely to wait some months before looking to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, the Treasury will want to pay more attention to the direction of fiscal and monetary policy and the level of the pound in its efforts to influence demand. At the same time it will try to keep a close eye on trends in inflation, possibly with new ways to monitor money supply and asset prices. The word from the Treasury is that it will be in no hurry to finalise the details. In his address to parliament on Thursday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to concentrate on the background to last week's humiliating decision to suspend ERM membership, rather than to come up with any grand designs for future policymaking. That partly stems from a sense of torpor at the Treasury, which is coming to terms with having lost its main economic rudder in the shape of ERM membership. The department will also want time to assess how the devaluation of sterling may be helping to buoy the economy, even while base rates remain relatively high at 10 per cent. In tune with the lower expectations of a cut in borrowing costs, the FT-SE 100 share index fell back yesterday, after having gained nearly 200 points on Thursday and Friday last week. Last night, the pound closed in London down 7 1/2 pfennigs at DM2.5375, or about 24 pfennigs below its ERM floor of DM2.778. A rule of thumb among some economists is that a depreciation of 4 per cent in the pound as measured by the Bank of England's trade-weighted sterling index  - which tracks the pound against important currencies including the D-Mark and dollar  - is equivalent to a cut in interest rates of 1 percentage point. Applying that rule to what has happened to sterling over the past four months provides the sense of a considerable loosening in economic policy. Since May 27  - when sterling closed in London at DM2.945, just below its DM2.95 central ERM rate  - the pound has declined against the D-Mark by 14 per cent. According to the sterling index, the depreciation has been slightly lower at 10 per cent. If the economists' rule is taken seriously, that is equivalent to more than 2 points off interest rates. Calculations of this kind may explain why the government appears to be acting cautiously over cutting base rates. However, in spite of the less bullish tone in the City yesterday about immediate cuts in loan costs, many private-sector economists believe base rates will come down to 9 per cent by the start of the Conservative party conference on October 6, with possibly a further cut by the end of the year. A fall in the exchange rate influences the economy largely by reducing the price of exports and by making imports more expensive. It thus helps exporters, mainly in the manufacturing sector, and also reduces price competition for UK-based companies in the domestic market. That last factor is important for many smaller manufacturers which earn the lion's share of their profits from UK sales. With exports and imports of tradable goods each accounting for roughly a fifth of the economy, the short-term effects of a devaluation can be significant. The worry for policymakers, however, is that the benefits may be quickly eaten up through higher import prices pushing up inflation and thus influencing the level of wage costs, cancelling any gains to productivity among manufacturers. Mr Douglas Godden, economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'With unemployment at 2.8m and the labour market extremely weak, there is a good chance that companies may be in a better position than in previous devaluations to resist inflationary pressures feeding into wages.' In the new efforts to manage the economy outside the ERM, fiscal policy will also be more important. According to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, the New York bank, fiscal policy has been considerably loosened in recent years as the government has eased restraints on public spending and has been forced to step up social security spending for jobless people and their families. According to the latest consensus of City forecasts, general government spending, which accounts for about a quarter of the economy, will increase by 1.6 per cent this year in the context of a contraction in gross domestic product likely to total 0.6 per cent. In an environment in which demand is likely to be boosted both by the effects of a likely easing in monetary policy and by the large sterling devaluation, Mr Saunders thinks the government will need to tighten its fiscal policy to keep the economy on an even keel and prevent a build-up in inflationary pressures. 'If I were the Treasury I would be trying to cut into the Pounds 244.5bn planning total for public spending due in 1993-94,' Mr Saunders said. Even with some cuts, Mr Saunders is still pencilling in a public-sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 running to about Pounds 40bn, representing more than 6 per cent of GDP. With the pound's depreciation having given the economy a considerable boost, the Treasury will be keen to prevent the currency going into a further fall  - another reason for caution about cutting interest rates. Many economists feel that the Treasury would ideally like to stabilise the pound at about DM2.60, a level it might make sense to seek as a central rate if sterling rejoins the ERM over the next six months. Assuming interest rates were to fall by 2 percentage points by the end of the year, sterling could be expected to decline to as low as DM2.40. However, the currency could then find support on expectations about lower German interest rates next year. As for inflation, that is one area where Mr Lamont can fairly claim some success. In the 12 months to the end of August, the increase in the retail prices index was 3.6 per cent, as opposed to nearly 11 per cent around the end of 1990. However, some economists are worried that, should Mr Lamont let sterling drift too much and switch too quickly to lower interest rates, inflationary forces might once again be a concern. According to Mr David Smith, UK economist at brokers Williams de Broe, the correct course for Mr Lamont is to treat pleas to cut credit rates with extreme caution and to concentrate on ways to help exporters via a lower exchange rate. 'There is a lot of money sitting in interest-bearing deposits in the consumer sector which, should interest rates come down too quickly, could quickly find its way into the economy and give a big boost to inflation,' said Mr Smith. 'Mr Lamont has to be extremely careful about the consequences for inflation of whatever he decides on economic strategy.'</p>

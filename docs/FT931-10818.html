			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / BMW develops small city car for urban commuting BMW has developed a small city car for urban commuting (pictured left), which could go into production in the second half of the 1990s in a radical departure from its traditional product policy, writes Kevin Done. The German producer of high-performance executive and luxury cars plans to unveil a concept city car, code-named Z13, at the Geneva motor show next month, upstaging its arch domestic rival Mercedes-Benz, which last week said it planned to develop such a car for the late 1990s. The BMW city car has been designed and developed for a 'single' driver travelling alone in city traffic. The driver would sit in the middle of the car with a central steering wheel, but with two full-sized seats for possible passengers seated half behind the driver in a clover-leaf formation. The planned city car is powered by a 1.1-litre BMW motorcycle engine mounted at the rear with a continuously variable automatic transmission. At just over 11 ft it would be smaller than current small cars, such as the Ford Fiesta or the Renault Clio, but would have a top speed of 112 mph and fuel consumption of 47-56 miles per gallon. The car would have an aluminium frame and aluminium panels, and despite its small size BMW said it could include an airbag, air-conditioning, a mobile telephone, a computer controlled navigation system and a mobile fax machine. The Z13 is a further sign that the German luxury car-makers are urgently seeking to move into new segments of the world car market.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: The triumphant return of the Empire - A look at an inspiring triple bill worthy of Edinburgh's refurbished theatre I have two vivid memories of the old Empire Theatre in Edinburgh. Festival habitues still speak of the terrible crashings and ill-muffled cries that attended scene-changes. (Gang warfare? Burke and Hare recruiting fresh bodies?) During a Royal Ballet visit to the 1962 festival, Kenneth MacMillan's recent Baiser de la fee, with glorious decors by Kenneth Rowell, was presented. Lynn Seymour, as the Bride, made her first appearance through an arch. As she did so, the structure keeled forward, and nearly guillotined Donald MacLeary, her waiting beloved. A decade later, de-commissioned as a theatre, the Empire was pressed into service for the festival, when John Cranko brought his Stuttgart Ballet for its first visit. Somewhere there is a photograph of Cranko and MacMillan standing either side of the notice which had been so graciously provided by patrons: 'The management regrets the inconvenience to patrons. Bingo will resume in three weeks.' Ah, the Athens of the North] Edinburgh's need for another lyric theatre - larger than the pretty Kings; less like Moscow airport than the dour Playhouse - has at last rescued the Empire from its fallen state. As David Murray reported from its Wagnerian opening last month, we now have the revised, refurbished, re-thought Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and jolly good it is, too. It is especially good in its stage - broad, deep, well-equipped - and in its gleaming glass and steel facade and spanking new front-of-house. (Gone are the dingy days of crowded foyers, strange side-doors through which people could sneak in, and a lingering whiff of something un-dainty.) The entrance is bright, spirit-rejoicing, with glassed-in promenades, bars, balconies, and a sense (as at the Opera Bastille) of an immediately welcoming and user-friendly location. About the auditorium I have reservations. The policy has been to restore the old and familiar setting that had existed since 1924. Such nostalgia accepts the dreary colour scheme - omnipresent mulberry for seats, walls, curtain; a good deal of cream paint with a built-in hint of grime - that may recall the good old days, except that I doubt if they were in any way decoratively good at all. But the house is spacious, with a fine acoustic and sight-lines. It offered an admirable showcase for English National Ballet, which has just completed a two-week season. (Several more dance visits are scheduled, which is good news.) Were anyone to seek concrete evidence of the transformations wrought by Derek Deane in the year since he assumed artistic control of the troupe, it was there in the triple bill I saw in company with a large and enthusiastic audience. Triple bills are notoriously hard to sell nowadays. ENB played an even more dangerous game by programming three less than sure-fire pieces: the Shades scene from Bayadere; the new XNTricities; and Etudes. All are plotless. All make big demands on their casts. The audience reaction was, clearly, one of delight. The evening was, on these terms, inspiring. And no less so on terms of most of the dancing. The Bayadere showed a corps of 18 girls who understood the nuances and academic grace of Petipa's sublime inventions: they made complete and beautiful sense of every moment. Margaret Illmann, a guest with the ENB, does not yet have the stylistic command to show us Nikiya's transcendant purity - in drama as in step. Her partner was Thomas Edur, and with him we see classic dancing whose dignity and emotional power is uniquely satisfying. He is a rare balletic being: an authentic, pur-sang aristocrat, able to give noblest utterance to every role he assumes. His Solor was princely in technique  - the dance sure, luscious  -and emotionally true. XNTricities, by the young Italian choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti, has settled well into ENB's repertory. Its imagery combines sexual and physical challenges. Its players strut and race, and are riven by curious tensions and confrontations. Its great merit is that Bigonzetti holds our interest by choreographic means. No less real is the brilliant response of its cast to their tasks, led by Yat Sen Chang, who tears through the action like a well-guided missile. Etudes, still fascinating as a portrait of dancers in class, seemed to me under a bit of a cloud. I must in all fairness record that I lately saw it in brilliant performance by the Paris Opera Ballet. ENB's dancers work with a will, and I salute the 18-year-old Giuseppe Picone, who whipped through a leading role with exultant clarity and a joie-de-danser that presage wonderful things to come. A second evening brought Swan Lake in Raissa Struchkova's version of the old Bolshoi staging. It is effective, and the company dance it with much goodwill: the first act waltz had a pleasing swing to it. Margaret Illmann and Rex Harrington were guest principals from the National Ballet of Canada. Their interpretations were well-meaning, and Harrington is a fine partner, but their manner suggested the emotional basics of soap-opera - Santa Barbara, perhaps - rather than the sublimities of this predictable but still-hallowed text. As a traveller's note, let me recommend to anyone visiting Edinburgh the upper rooms of the National Gallery of Scotland, where the French paintings are a small but marvellous treat. Cezanne, of course, but also two miraculous Boudins, and a stunning Mauve, Vaut le detour. English National Ballet will open a week's season at the Coliseum on July 25.</p>

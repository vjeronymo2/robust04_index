			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC PRESIDENT ASKS RENEWAL OF PACTS FOR WEAPON LABS  </P> <P> Despite faculty opposition, UC President David P. Gardner on Thursday urged  that the university renew its federal contracts to run nuclear weapons  laboratories because of benefits to national security.  </P> <P> His statement was widely viewed as proof that the regents will vote next week  to continue the controversial ties with the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos  national laboratories.  </P> <P> UC has managed federal weapons research facilities since World War II and to  drop that relationship now "could place at risk laboratories that have proven  to be such significant assets to the nation's security and its scientific and  technological advancement," Gardner said in a report to the regents released  Thursday.  </P> <P> Moreover, Gardner contended that the easing of tensions between the United  States and the Soviet Union may shift the labs to work on more non-defense  energy projects. Such unclassified experiments, he said, would allow greater  involvement by UC faculty and students. Critics now complain that the  top-secret nature of the labs is at odds with academic freedom.  </P> <P> The current multibillion-dollar contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy  expire in 1992. The regents must indicate at their meeting at UCLA next  Thursday and Friday whether they intend to start negotiations for another  five-year renewal.  </P> <P> UC management of the labs has been debated since the 1960s, raising issues  usually not discussed by the regents: relations with the Soviet Union, morality  of nuclear weapons, storage of atomic wastes and feasibility of the Strategic  Defense Initiative, popularly known as the Star Wars defense system. Never  before, however, has the UC faculty so clearly voiced its opposition to the  contracts.  </P> <P> Last November, a UC-wide faculty committee voted 6 to 2 to recommend that ties  to the laboratories be ended, saying that the secret research "is contrary to  the fundamental nature of the university" and that the labs require too much  attention from UC administrators. Last spring, 64% of all professors who  participated in referenda on UC campuses voted to urge the regents to drop the  labs. The faculty senates of all nine campuses agreed, although the margins  against contract renewal ranged from the overwhelming 312 to 75 at UC Santa  Barbara to the squeaker 204 to 201 at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Gardner's aides claim that opposition to the labs may be overstated because  only 42% of the professors participated in the votes last spring, although  faculty leaders stress that such a turnout is higher than in state and national  elections. Some UC professors complain that Gardner has tried to shield the  regents from faculty dissension on the issue and predict long-term friction  between the administration and faculty. Gardner insists the regents have been  kept fully informed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Charles Schwartz, a UC Berkeley physics professor and a longtime  opponent of the labs, was arrested and cited for trespassing late Wednesday for  refusing to leave the UC system headquarters in downtown Oakland at closing  time. Schwartz had spent most of Wednesday unsuccessfully seeking to meet with  Gardner on the labs. Gardner, however, met Thursday with two of Schwartz's  colleagues in the campaign against the labs.  </P> <P> Gardner did not accede to a call from 14 legislators this week for UC to drop  the contracts because of alleged toxic and radioactive leaks at the labs that,  the lawmakers said, "pose serious public health and environmental hazards."  </P> <P> Even opponents of the lab ties concede that approval next week by the regents  to start contract negotiations with the government is a foregone conclusion.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid it's not going to be even a close vote. And I'm disappointed with  that," said Karl Hufbauer, a UC Irvine history professor and an expert on the  development of nuclear weapons who served on the systemwide committee that  called for contract phase-out. However, Hufbauer predicted that UC eventually  will drop the labs.  </P> <P> The federal government owns the labs at Livermore, 35 miles east of Oakland,  and Los Alamos in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was developed. The U.S.  Energy Department sets policies and pays UC about $2 billion a year for  equipment, management of the experiments and salaries for the 16,000 employees  at the two facilities. UC clears about $11 million a year, a figure that  Gardner said may have to be increased in the next contracts.  </P> <P> UC's involvement attracts top scientists and allows internal debate that a  private company or the military would not permit, UC officials contend. But  critics complain that UC really has little say and that the government uses the  university as a cover of academic respectability for weapons of mass  destruction.  </P> <P> Two years ago, UC beefed up its supervision of the labs by adding new liaison  officers. That was in response to a series of political and environmental  controversies.  </P> <P> Critics of the laboratories alleged that Livermore officials exaggerated  technical progress on the Strategic Defense Initiative to ensure more funding  and improperly lobbied members of Congress to vote against further limitations  on underground testing of nuclear weapons. The feasibility of SDI remains hotly  debated, although a report by the federal General Accounting Office found the  lobbying was not illegal.  </P> <P> In addition, the Livermore facility has received much bad publicity about  possible leaks of toxic and radioactive materials, drug use by employees and  theft of government supplies.  </P> <P> UC's contract to run the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley also is up  for renewal but is not controversial because the energy and biotech research  there is not related to weaponry.  </P> <P> The regents' meeting next week at UCLA coincides with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish  New Year. Some professors and staff interested in the labs issue but unable to  attend because of religious observances asked for a delay in the vote. But UC  officials declined, saying that regents must settle the matter at this month's  session.  </P></p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Bedfordshire may be split Bedfordshire yesterday became the eighth county in the space of a week to be recommended for abolition by the Local Government Commission for England. The commission recommends replacement of the two-tier system of local government for the county - a county council and four lower-tier district councils - by two new all-purpose unitary authorities, with boundaries created by merging existing districts. These would be North Bedfordshire, merging Bedford borough with Mid Bedfordshire District Council, which includes Biggleswade, Flitwick and Sandy, and South Bedfordshire, formed by a merger of Luton borough with South Bedfordshire District Council, including Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard. The commission says this option would cost between Pounds 9m and Pounds 12m to start up, with annual savings thereafter of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 4m. A second preference from the commission would split Bedfordshire into three unitary authorities, with Luton and Bedford becoming independently self-governing, and Mid and South Bedfordshire merging to form a third unitary. The commission believes this would save Pounds 1m per year at most. A final option would be to create a unitary authority for Luton alone and merge the other three districts. In a departure from its practice in most of the recommendations of the past week, the commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has not left continuation of the two-tier status quo as an option for local residents to consider. A nine-week consultation period will now start, with freepost questionnaires sent to every household in the county, asking people to state their preference between the options. This week, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Lancashire and Oxfordshire county councils have all been recommended for abolition, after similar recommendations earlier in the year for Avon, Cleveland, Humberside, North Yorkshire, and Somerset.</p>

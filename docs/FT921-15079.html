			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (21): Collapse of the Maxwell empire THE MOST spectacular change affecting a ranked company since the FT500 snapshot date of September 30 is the collapse of Maxwell Communication Corporation. The unravelling started on November 5 with the death at sea of Mr Robert Maxwell. Details flowed out about MCC's debt, which totalled about Pounds 1.3bn, and about the transfer of cash from the pension funds of MCC and its sister company Mirror Group Newspapers to private companies in the Maxwell empire. Other investigations focused on share transactions in MCC. Its shares were suspended on December 2 at 35p, little more than a fifth of their value on September 30 when MCC ranked 262 in the list. Later in December, MCC obtained protection from its creditors in the US under Chapter 11 legislation and went into administration in the UK. Other companies in the FT500 will not be there next year for more regular reasons. Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, was acquired by the industrial conglomerate BTR in a Pounds 1.55bn deal. The bid accounts for Hawker's sharp rise to 185 in the rankings. Ultramar, the oil and gas group ranked at 316, narrowly lost its independence to Lasmo, the oil exploration company. The Pounds 1.1bn acquisition turned Lasmo, ranked 258, into one of the largest oil explorers in the world. Racal Electronics escaped a Pounds 700m-plus hostile bid from Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, just before Christmas. Racal will, however, go ahead with the demerger of its Chubb securities division.</p>

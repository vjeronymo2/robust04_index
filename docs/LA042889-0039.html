			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Tony Scherman specializes in sidelong glances and magnetic first impressions.  His paintings, tenderized with layers of encaustic, often offer dreamy images  of single women who leap out -- as in a lover's vision -- from the duller  stream of humanity at bars and restaurants. Backgrounds are more or less  monochrome, textured rectangles that nonetheless suggest the feel of cozily  wood-paneled places with lustrous mahogany table tops. Women's outstretched  arms and shoulders, a dangling earring, a purple blur of lipstick become  instant objects of desire.  </P> <P> Faintly rendered double-images or extra limbs in some of these works seem ill  at ease with such a comfortably traditional style; rather than adding temporal  complexity, they call awkward attention to themselves. In "The Red Leash," for  example, the Toronto artist peers under the tablecloth and lights on the legs  of a waitress in a swirled skirt, the demurely crossed ankles of the customer  and her perky dog. Scherman's easy painterliness -- the leash is just a curling  red brush stroke -- gives the little genre scene a pleasurable fillip. But the  floating, lightly outlined arm that curls down from the top of the table --  presumably showing a gesture the waitress makes either before or after this  moment -- seems an overly self-conscious distraction.  </P> <P> In a group of airy black paintings on paper -- the darkness is eaten away by  waxy incursions -- Scherman nails down quick takes of dogs, a rabbit, still  lifes and women's faces. The viewer senses that the artist likes to pounce on  ordinary things at odd, disjointed moments. A few of the full-scale paintings  venture into realms beyond bustling eateries -- in one canvas, a couple dally  in a moonlit pool; in another, a black servant tends to a white woman in bed.  But these images somehow lack the extra spark of the heady stare in  semi-darkness that picks a single, entrancing detail out of the rushing world.

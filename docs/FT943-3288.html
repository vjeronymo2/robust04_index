			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Flexibility 'no easy solution on jobs': Conventional view on labour mobility not borne out by Commission report Increased labour flexibility and higher job turnover provide no simple solution to Europe's unemployment problem, the European Commission declared yesterday in its sixth report on Employment in Europe. The report challenges the conventional view that ease of movement into and out of jobs is a necessary condition of low unemployment. About 17 per cent of people in work in European Union countries changed jobs in the last year. But countries which have above average labour turnover, including Spain - where 28 per cent employed people changed jobs in the last year - Denmark, the UK and the Netherlands, range across the unemployment spectrum. Spain, for example, has the highest level of unemployment in the EU and both the UK and the Netherlands are now below the average. At the other end of the mobility scale, the rate of turnover was under 13 per cent in Greece as well as in Italy, and only around 15 per cent in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg, which also represent wide variations in unemployment rates. The report, which picks up many of the themes first discussed in the Delors white paper on employment published last year, concludes that countries with a low level of external labour market flexibility may compensate with higher flexibility within companies. The report also reflects the white paper's concern with high non-wage labour costs in Europe and the relatively poor employment creation record compared with the US and Japan. Social contributions in the EU averaged 22 per cent of labour costs in 1991, only slightly above the US figure of 21 per cent. The Japanese figure was 15 per cent. However, if employer and employee contributions, plus taxes on wages are added together, the average 'wedge' - between the cost of employing labour to companies and the net earnings which workers receive - is 45 per cent in the EU, 40 per cent in the US and 30 per cent in Japan. The report says that in nine out of 12 EU countries the non-wage labour costs imposed by government bear proportionately more on workers at the lower end of the earnings scale than on those at the higher end. But the UK is a notable exception. 'The only country where differential contributions provide any incentive for employers to take on lower paid workers is the UK,' states the report. The UK government may also draw some comfort from the fact that incentives to work are in good order. Unlike most EU countries low pay is a relatively minor source of poverty in the UK. 'Overall in the EU, there are more households which fall below the poverty level of expenditure because of low pay than because of unemployment or disability. Only in four member states - Belgium, the Netherlands, and most especially, Ireland and the UK, where being out of work was the major source of poverty - was this not the case.' Another finding of the report helps to explain the UK's strong resistance to the European working time directive. Nearly half of the EU's 7m male employees working 48 hours a week or more are employed in the UK, helping to put the UK on top of the union's longer-hours league. Between 1985 and 1992 business services made the largest contribution to employment growth across the EU, accounting for almost one in five of the net addition to jobs. But high job losses between 1990 and 1992 occurred in many of the former high growth areas including estate and travel agents and research and development institutes. The areas of job growth in the EU over the past 20 years have been much the same as in the US and Japan. 'The most striking difference is not in the areas where employment has risen, but in terms of the scale of jobs losses which have occurred in declining sectors (particularly agriculture). This seems largely responsible for the lower overall rate of employment growth in the EU than elsewhere.' Professional and technical jobs, which accounted for only 15 per cent of the total in 1983, were responsible for 40 per cent of the rise in employment between 1987 and 1992. But there are still marked variations between countries in employment structure. In Germany, for example, 50 per cent more of the workforce are employed in engineering and motor vehicles than elsewhere. Germany also continues to have a relatively small proportion of its workforce in services. It is sometimes suggested that this is a statistical illusion and that much the same jobs are performed in Germany as elsewhere but they are located in industrial companies rather than specialised services companies. The report maintains otherwise. 'Fewer service activities are performed in Germany than in other comparable European countries - or, at least, fewer people are employed which might possibly be the result of higher productivity in services in Germany than elsewhere.'</p>

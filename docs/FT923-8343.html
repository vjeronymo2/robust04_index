			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Losses at Embassy reach Pounds 2.4m EMBASSY PROPERTY Group has still not completed its refinancing negotiations. In December last year the USM-quoted company announced that it had reached agreement in principle but yesterday said it was only in the final stages of negotiations. It also reported losses deepened from Pounds 875,000 to Pounds 2.4m pre-tax in the six months to September 30. The deficit included Pounds 1.12m of accrued interest which the company said would not have to be paid under the refinancing. Embassy said it had reached agreement with an investor group to take up a proposed placing to raise Pounds 2.8m gross. It had completed the negotiations on the commercial terms on restructuring the large majority of its bank debt and was in the final stages of negotiating the remainder. In the six months the construction and shopfitting companies contributed 'positive returns' but housebuilding incurred a loss and property sales had been difficult. Turnover fell to Pounds 6.33m (Pounds 10.8m) of which property development and trading contributed Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 7.36m). Losses emerged at 26.1p (8.5p).</p>

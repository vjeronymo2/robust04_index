			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Government faces revolt on VAT - Tory misgivings remain on fuel compensation package for pensioners The government was last night facing the prospect of a fresh backbench rebellion over value added tax on fuel after Mr Kenneth Clarke failed to allay Tory misgivings with a new package of compensation measures for pensioners. Some potential rebels said they would study the chancellor's proposals for countering the impact of the planned increase in the rate of VAT from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent before forming a view. But others indicated that the package would not be enough to persuade them to support the government. Last night it appeared that MPs would have their chance to vote again on the issue as soon as next Tuesday. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said Labour had tabled a resolution 'to force a full debate on the VAT rise'. He challenged Tory rebels 'to vote to stop the increase in the vote next Tuesday'. The effect of the Labour resolution would be to force a debate on whether MPs should be entitled to table amendments on VAT on fuel during the Commons' line-by-line scrutiny of the finance bill. Unlike Monday's vote on the European finance bill, when they supported the government, the nine Ulster Unionist MPs are expected to vote in favour of Labour's resolution. This leaves Labour apparently needing the support of eight or nine Tory backbenchers to force a highly damaging government defeat. Adding to the government's difficulties, Sir Richard Body, the Tory MP for Holland with Boston, confirmed that he had resigned the Conservative whip, reducing the government's notional minority to four. Mr Geoff Hoon, a Labour whip, said last night that he was preparing to send letters to 'at least 60' Conservative MPs in marginal seats, pointing out how important next week's expected vote would be. Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, said that he thought Mr Clarke's compensation package was 'a very good one', but expected. He said it would not reach people in the lower-to-middle income bracket and he would not support the government if Labour succeeded in forcing a procedural vote on the issue. Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, said Mr Clarke had missed 'a golden opportunity' by not announcing that he had decided against raising the VAT rate to 17.5 per cent. He said the chancellor's package was 'very modest' and would account for only a 'tiny proportion' of the revenue the Treasury would receive from the increase. He said he would 'probably' vote in favour of a procedural motion on the issue. Mr Bill Walker, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Tayside North, said he thought the package would help to 'defuse the argument'. He added: 'It will go a long way to taking the heat out of it.' Mr Paul Marland, Tory MP for Gloucestershire West, said before the chancellor's speech that he would vote against the government 'provided I am just voting against VAT'. He said he thought a Labour resolution would have 'quite a lot of support'. One of the Eurosceptics who failed to support the government in Monday's crucial European votes said: 'If I have the government whip, I shall certainly vote with the government. If not, I shall have to make up my own mind.' The threat of a revolt over VAT took the gloss off a reasonably favourable response from Tory backbenchers to the overall Budget package, although some complained about its predictability. A senior rightwinger said: 'There was nothing that set the lads alight.' Mr John Butterfill, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, said the measures announced were 'very useful from an investment point of view'. He said the limit on business rates was 'probably the most important thing he has done'. Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North and a former minister, seemed disappointed that the chancellor had decided against lowering taxes. He expressed reservations about VAT on fuel. He said: 'Pensioners are concerned because interest rates are low and they are the age group that votes the most.'</p>

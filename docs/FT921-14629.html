			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Stena Line sees turnround on all operations this year STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping group, expects to make a profit on all operations this year after a pre-tax loss of SKr300m (Dollars 52m) in 1991. In an optimistic statement yesterday about Stena's future Mr Lars Erik Ottosson, chief executive, said that rationalisation measures taken last year, as well as increased loans and credit facilities, had ensured the group 'now has a sound and competitive cost structure in all operations'. But he declined to indicate just how large Stena's profit would be this year, pointing out this would not be clear until after the end of the peak summer season which accounts for more than half of annual volume. Mr Ottosson added that the SKr500m cost savings programme in its ailing Sealink cross-Channel operations had now been carried out satisfactorily, along with a wage freeze until 1993 and closure of the Folkstone-Boulogne route. The investment plans have also been implemented in Sealink, said Mr Ottosson. The aim now was to utilise the additional capacity, he said. For this reason, Stena Line viewed the future in a positive light.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EASES CURB ON CHINA MEETINGS;  </P> <P> SANCTIONS: THE CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER IS INVITED TO WASHINGTON AS THE  ADMINISTRATION SEEKS BEIJING'S BACKING ON U.N. VOTE AGAINST IRAQ.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, which is seeking China's backing for a new U.N.  resolution against Iraq, on Tuesday substantially eased the ban on high-level  meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials that was imposed after the 1989  massacre in Beijing.  </P> <P> The State Department announced that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has  invited Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Washington on Friday, where  Qian will be the highest-ranking Chinese visitor in the past 18 months. U.S.  officials also left open the possibility that Qian will meet with President  Bush.  </P> <P> For months, U.S. China scholars and experts had been predicting that the  Administration would loosen its sanctions against Beijing soon after the U.S.  congressional elections. Administration officials insisted Tuesday that they  are not abandoning the sanctions adopted after China crushed the pro-democracy  movement at Tian An Men Square in June, 1989. But they gave the ban on  high-level exchanges a much narrower interpretation than previously.  </P> <P> "We're being tentative," one Administration official explained. "We want to try  to give them a little and then watch."  </P> <P> The announcement of the Washington visit by Qian Qichen (pronounced Chien  Chee-chun) came only days after authorities in China charged two pro-democracy  activists with counterrevolution and sedition -- crimes punishable by long  prison sentences or even death.  </P> <P> "It (the Bush Administration's action) must cause deep disappointment among the  Chinese people," Liu Binyan, a leading Chinese writer and dissident, said in an  interview Tuesday in Washington.  </P> <P> Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the American human rights group Asia  Watch, said the Bush Administration's invitation to Qian sends a message that  "continued cooperation in the (Persian) Gulf can bring an end to international  criticism and isolation, no matter how severely China abuses the rights of its  own citizens."  </P> <P> The State Department also confirmed Tuesday that Baker will meet with Cuban  Foreign Minister Isidoro O. Malmierca in New York City later this week, the  highest-level meeting between the United States and Cuba in two years. Cuba,  one of the 15 members of the Security Council, generally has opposed U.S.  policy in the gulf. The council is expected to vote later this week on a  resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq.  </P> <P> As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China has  the power to veto council resolutions. State Department spokesman Richard  Boucher noted Tuesday that "to date, China has consistently held to the  Security Council consensus on the gulf crisis and has voted for every one of  the 10 U.N. Security Council resolutions in response to Iraq's continuing  aggression."  </P> <P> Asked whether Baker's invitation to Qian amounted to a payoff for China's vote  on a new U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq, Boucher replied:  "China's vote . . . will be based on its own national-interest determination."  </P> <P> Since August, China has criticized Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But it has also  often emphasized that it opposes the use of force by superpowers in the Middle  East.  </P> <P> Most diplomats, scholars and U.S. officials have said they believe China would  not veto a U.N. resolution allowing the use of force against Iraq because the  Beijing regime needs foreign loans, trade and investment and does not want to  jeopardize its efforts to improve ties with the United States and other Western  countries.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's sanctions against meetings with Chinese leaders date  back to June 20, 1989, two weeks after the massacre in Beijing, when Baker  announced on Capitol Hill that the Administration was suspending talks between  officials of the U.S. and Chinese governments at the level of assistant  secretary or higher.  </P> <P> Only two weeks later, the Administration dispatched National Security Adviser  Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to  Beijing on the first of two secret missions aimed at smoothing ties with the  Chinese leadership.  </P> <P> Administration officials argued that the Scowcroft missions did not violate the  policy because it applied only to "exchanges" between the two governments --  that is, official visits to each other's capitals.  </P> <P> Baker himself has met with the Chinese foreign minister four times over the  last 18 months. But the sessions were restricted to foreign capitals or the  United Nations and were aimed largely at discussing Cambodia or the Persian  Gulf.  </P></p>

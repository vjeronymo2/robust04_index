			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTIMS LINKED BY DESEGREGATION CASES;  </P> <P> BOMBINGS: U.S. APPEALS COURT JUDGE HAD ORDERED SCHOOL BUSING. ATTORNEY HAD  REPRESENTED NAACP IN SCHOOL LAWSUIT.  </P> <P> The two victims of mail bombs in the South had something in common -- both were  known as civil rights advocates, and both may have died for their activities.  </P> <P> Judge Robert S. Vance, 58, had ordered busing for school desegregation, sided  with blacks in suits against white-controlled city governments and reinstated a  federal lawsuit against members of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama during his 11  years on the federal appeals court based in Atlanta. He died after the bomb  exploded at his home near Birmingham on Saturday.  </P> <P> Robert Robinson, a 42-year-old black attorney and city alderman in Savannah,  Ga., represented the NAACP earlier this year in seeking a stronger  desegregation program for his hometown school system. He was killed by an  explosion at his office Monday.  </P> <P> Federal investigators said Tuesday they suspect a "possible racial motivation"  in the two killings.  </P> <P> The civil rights link was heightened Tuesday when a bomb was discovered at the  Jacksonville, Fla., offices of the NAACP. A fourth bomb addressed to the clerk  of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals was discovered and dismantled Monday.  </P> <P> Just three months ago, Vance, who was white, spoke for a three-judge panel of  the 11th Circuit Appeals court in reviving a school busing order in  Jacksonville. Siding with NAACP lawyers, Vance reversed a district judge who  said court-ordered busing should be ended after 18 years.  </P> <P> Vance lambasted Jacksonville school officials for what he called their  "consistent failure" to meet the desegregation goals of a 1971 decree. The  failure to hire more black teachers and administrators also "perpetrated the  effects of the prior system of segregation," he wrote in an opinion issued on  Sept. 15.  </P> <P> The 11th Circuit, which handles appeals from Florida, Georgia and Alabama, has  continued to order busing for school desegregation, even as federal judges  elsewhere have eased the pressure on school officials.  </P> <P> In October, for example, the court in a highly publicized ruling in Georgia  said that DeKalb County schools in suburban Atlanta must consider new busing as  a way to remedy increasing segregation. Lawyers said Vance did not sit on the  three-judge panel that decided the case.  </P> <P> Attorneys described Vance as a passionate liberal on most social issues, but a  tough, accusatory questioner in the courtroom. His aggressive style had gained  him a certain prominence among appellate lawyers in the Southeast.  </P> <P> "He was a very aggressive jurist. At one point during the argument, he was  shouting at me and was red in the face," said Cindy Laquidara-Kenney, the  attorney who represented the Jacksonville school district. "If he didn't like  what you were saying, he would cut you off in mid-sentence," she added.  </P> <P> "He liked to pick on lawyers, and a lot of them didn't like it," said Neil  Bradley, an attorney with the Southern regional office of the American Civil  Liberties Union in Atlanta. "He was a liberal across the board, except for  capital punishment and the Cuban refugees."  </P> <P> In recent years, Vance took a hard-line stance against convicted murderers who  appealed their death sentences, and he was impatient with lawyers representing  them.  </P> <P> But ACLU attorney Bradley noted that Vance was a different person off the  bench.  </P> <P> "He was quite likable. Garrulous. A joke teller. He liked to tease you," he  said.  </P> <P> Despite Vance's prominence in legal circles, Bradley and other attorneys say  they find it hard to believe that his court rulings could have prompted the  bomb attacks.  </P> <P> "The appellate judges are generally invisible. You hear about trial judges, but  not appeals court judges," he pointed out.  </P> <P> In 1967, Vance became chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party and is credited  with wresting control of the party from Gov. George C. Wallace. In 1978,  President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the federal appeals court.  </P> <P> Friends of Robinson, the Savannah attorney, say he was not known as a prominent  civil rights attorney. They expressed surprise Tuesday that he might have been  chosen as a target by extremists.  </P> <P> Robinson practiced out of a modest Savannah townhouse and handled a variety of  civil and criminal cases. While he represented black plaintiffs in the Savannah  desegregation case, a New York-based attorney handled most of the appellate  work, a friend said.  </P> <P> "It was a one-man firm. He was a surviving attorney," said fellow alderman  Willie Brown.  </P> <P> Staff writer Douglas Jehl in Savannah contributed to this story.  </P></p>

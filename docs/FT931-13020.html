			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Russians urge even-handed Balkan policy RUSSIA'S warning yesterday that it may seek sanctions against Croatia fits in with its long-standing advocacy of an even-handed approach towards warring parties in the former Yugoslavia. Moscow argues that any party, and not just the Serbs, should be punished for violations of international agree-ments. But both western diplomats and Russian conservatives say that Russia's fundamental alignment with the west on Yugoslavia is unlikely to change as long as pro-western reformers remain in power. Western diplomats add, however, that Russia would find it difficult to support tough new action against Serbs in Bosnia if it appeared that the west was prepared to overlook violations by other ethnic groups. The eruption of fresh fighting in Croatia's UN-monitored enclave of Krajina prompted the statement yesterday by Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister, that Moscow might propose international sanctions against Croatia if its forces continued to attack Serbs. The Foreign Ministry said later: 'Such action, undertaken at a time when a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina has become a real possibility, is an extremely ill-thought out move. It has become another link in the chain of violations of UN Security Council requirements.' It added that the Croatians had long ignored the no-fly zone over Bosnia, supplied weapons to Croat forces and led military actions against Moslems there. 'Such actions are unacceptable and must receive an adequate reaction from the international community.' The tentative nature of Mr Churkin's warning - the government has no immediate plans to propose sanctions - appears to be part of the Foreign Ministry's balancing act between conservatives and reformers at home. Reassurance on this point came from an unusual quarter yesterday. Mr Vladimir Isakov, leader of parliament's hardline Rossiya faction who has just returned from talks with Serbian leaders in Belgrade, said that although he supported Mr Churkin's suggestion as 'an option for balancing out the situation', it was unlikely to be implemented. Serb nationalists have fostered close links with Russian hardliners opposed to President Boris Yeltsin. The co-operation ranges from sanctions violations to Cossack volunteers fighting on the Serb side in Bosnia. The media had appealed to the Russian government to take its little brother Serbia under its protection.</p>

(70&hyph;8317) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Columbia Gas System, Inc. (``Columbia''), a registered holding company, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and its nonutility subsidiary company Columbia LNG Corporation (``Columbia LNG''), both of 20 Montchanin Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19807, have filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 12(c) of the Act and rules 42, 43, 45 and 46 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On July 31, 1991, Columbia and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary which is not an applicant-declarant hereunder, filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Case Nos. 91&hyph;803 and 91&hyph;804) and were thereupon continued in the management of their respective businesses and possession of their respective properties as debtors-in-possession. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Columbia LNG owns and is currently maintaining in a standby mode a one Bcf per day liquefied natural gas (``LNG'') importation terminal at Cove Point, Maryland (``Terminal''). Columbia LNG also owns and operates an 87-miles, 36-inch natural gas pipeline from Cove Point to Loudoun County, Virginia (``Pipeline,'' collectively, the ``Facility''). Columbia owns 90.8% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Columbia LNG, and Shell LNG Company (``Shell LNG'') owns the balance (9.2%). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia LNG and PEPCO Enterprises, Inc. (``PEI''), a wholly owned subsidiary of Potomac Electric Power Company (``PEPCO''), a public-utility company unaffiliated with Columbia, have agreed to develop a peak shaving service (``Peaking'') at the Terminal. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The business plan contemplates the use of the Terminal's existing storage tanks, vaporization equipment, and other plant infrastructure to provide the Peaking service. A liquefaction facility (``Liquefaction Unit'') would be constructed at the Terminal to liquefy natural gas received from Peaking customers for storage in the existing tanks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A peak shaving facility has the ability to deliver large amounts of gas on very short notice over brief periods of time for use on occasions, such as very cold winter days or very hot summer days, when such increased supplies are needed to meet the requirements of heating or electric generating customers. Peaking service is distinguishable from storage service because storage is typically designed to provide meaningful deliveries of natural gas on a more frequent basis over a longer period of time, e.g., 120 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants-declarants propose that, a limited partnership between Columbia LNG and a subsidiary of PEI, Cove Point Energy Company (``Partnership'') will: (i) Own and operate the Facility; (ii) provide Peaking and pipeline transportation services; and (iii) pursue the implementation of an ongoing baseload LNG import trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Partnership agreement will provide for the contribution of the Facility (including specified associated rights and liabilities) by Columbia LNG to the Partnership, and for PEI's contribution to the Partnership of up to $25 million which will consist of $10 million in cash to the Partnership in the form of equity plus a $15 million loan secured by the assets of the Partnership. The transfer of assets and PEI's contribution of capital would take place at a closing to occur on a date after all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained and certain conditions precedent are satisfied (``Construction Capital Closing''). Columbia LNG and PEI, either directly or through subsidiaries, will each obtain a 50% interest and equal voting rights in the Partnership. Applicants-declarants expect that Columbia LNG will hold a limited partner interest and a general partner interest either directly or indirectly through one or more new, wholly owned subsidiaries of Columbia LNG (``CLG Subsidiaries'') that will be the operator of, and/or hold partnership interests in, the Partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

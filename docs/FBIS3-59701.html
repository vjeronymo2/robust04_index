Inc.]    [Text] The Kansai Electric Power achieved significant  results as a leader in the development of phosphoric acid  ``first generation'' fuel cells. We are now making excellent  progress in the research and development of molten carbonate  ``second generation'' fuel cells. Developing a 100kW class  stack, the largest of its type in the world, is one of the  results of our current program.    Molten carbonate fuel cells have not only the same  attractive  features as phosphorous acid fuel cells, but also other  advantages which are high generating efficiencies, low cost from  not using platinum catalysts at all and the availability of coal  gas.    Fuel cells produce hydrogen in their reformer from fuels  such  as natural gas. Internal reforming is accomplished by fuel cells  that contain this reformer within the main body of the fuel  cell. The two types of these fuel cells are the direct and  indirect types; they are distinguished by how their reformer  catalysts are filled. In the indirect type, since the reformer  is isolated from the electrode within the fuel cell,  deterioration of the reformer catalyst caused by the electrolyte  can be prevented. This type of fuel cell also features high  efficiency because it utilizes heat from the cell reaction.    We anticipate that indirect-type internal reforming fuel  cells will yield high generating efficiency, feature a long  service life, and be feasible for near-term commercial  installations. For these reasons we, jointly with Mitsubishi  Electric, have been proceeding in earnest with their  development. We began in 1988 by developing a 3kW class stack.  By 1992 we had developed 10kW class, 30kW class, and 100kW class  stacks. Operating them for over 2,000 hours yielded promising  results, including favorable basic characteristics and low  deterioration rates. While developing these stacks, we also  developed a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recycling system in which PSA  (Pressure Swing Adsorption) equipment is used to extract  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from exhaust gas of the anode and recycle  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  to the cathode. Each of these technologies was  developed with the intention of future commercial application.    Based on what we have learned, we expect to achieve  generating efficiencies of 60&percnt; for about 50MW class, and  50&percnt;  for small scale 1MW class internal reforming molten carbonate  fuel cells plants.    We now intend to verify our expectations regarding  generating  efficiencies and other basic characteristics by developing and  operating a small-size plant. After doing so, our next step will  be to develop a high-efficiency MW class plant.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

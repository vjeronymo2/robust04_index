			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Net income at US broker rises slightly to Dollars 32m Charles Schwab, the US retail stockbroker, yesterday reported net income for the second quarter of Dollars 32.1m, or 55 cents a share. The result was at the top end of the expected range it announced less than two weeks ago. The year before, it reported after-tax profits of Dollars 31.6m, or 53 cents a share. The latest profits were earned on revenues of Dollars 258.2m, up from Dollars 232.4m, with the growth coming mainly from the firm's mutual fund service and higher money market balances. First-half net income reached a record Dollars 70.3m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, compared with Dollars 67m, or Dollars 1.13, in the first six months of 1993.</p>

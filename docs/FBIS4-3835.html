			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Let the Entire Society Show </F> Concern for the Growth of Orphans"]    [Text] Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi have written  inscriptions respectively for the "social welfare plan to help  raise and educate orphans on China's mainland" (also called the  plan to save orphans), calling on all sectors of society to  concern themselves with the growth of orphans. This indicates  that the party and government, as well as the general public,  are very much concerned about the healthy growth of children and  attach great attention to developing socialist undertakings  supporting the poor and orphans.    The Chinese government has always paid great attention to  developing social undertakings of supporting the poor and  orphans, one task of the undertakings being to protect the  orphans' right to live. The government has formulated relevant  laws and regulations, mapped out plans for the growth of  youngsters, including orphans, and set up social welfare  institutions to adopt orphans. Central and local governments  provide funds to support orphans every year. Various localities  have provided special workers to take care of orphans and set up  a number of relevant scientific research institutes and  organizations for rehabilitating and training orphans. In  helping the orphans, many people in society were so warm-hearted  that they produced many moving stories. With affectionate  support from the party and government and from those who are not  but are even dearer to them than their relatives, a great number  of orphans have grown up and have worked hard on various fronts  to help build up the country and to repay society's kindness.    In general, China's undertakings to save and support orphans  have developed healthily. However, in the process of building a  socialist market economy, the work is facing many new problems,  some of which are knotty, such as the greater number of orphans,  a serious shortage of funds, poor quality of education, poor  living conditions for orphans, and so on. All of these problems  cry out for immediate solution.    Saving and supporting orphans calls for the persistent  participation of all sectors in society. Governments at all  levels must tighten up leadership over the work of saving and  supporting orphans and should mobilize and organize all social  forces to raise and educate orphans in a down-to-earth manner.  Civil affairs departments at all levels, which are functional  departments in charge of the work, must conscientiously  implement the State Council's regulations on protecting  children, strengthen research in relevant legislation and  policies, set up and improve regional social welfare networks  with all-inclusive functions, encourage more volunteers to join  in the work, explore new ways to save and support orphans in  various types of regions, and focus on saving and supporting  orphans in the countryside. All types of social welfare  organizations must earnestly perform their duties in raising,  protecting, and educating orphans; and deepen reforms, improve  management, and promote the development of social welfare  organizations in surrounding areas. It is imperative to try in  every possible way to find more sources of funds for supporting  orphans and improving service facilities to provide more  services to orphans. Government departments concerned should  energetically support operations to save and help orphans,  providing sufficient funds and introducing appropriate policies.    Saving and helping orphans is a noble undertaking and also a  traditional virtue of the Chinese nation. We should answer the  party Central Committee's call by displaying the socialist  humanitarian spirit, extending a helping hand, feeling sympathy  for orphans, and concerning ourselves with the healthy growth of  orphans. We expect that the activity to cultivate love for the  Chinese nation and for orphans will become the order of the day  throughout the country. The realization of the "plan to save  orphans" will certainly usher in a blooming spring for China's  undertaking to save and support orphans.</p>

The issue now is not whether to continue negotiating but  primarily how to protect the Palestinians, adopt measures to  prevent a recurrence of the crime, and stop the settlers and  extremists from threatening and terrorizing the Palestinians.  The Israeli Government has primary responsibility for this.  Likewise the United Nations must begin effective action for the  same purpose and must issue clear and firm resolutions,  including the confiscation of weapons, to prevent a recurrence  of irresponsible and illegal violent acts by the Israeli  settlers and provide protection for the Palestinian civilians.    The Israeli cabinet adopted some measures two days ago  taking  weapons away from some settlers and limiting their movements.  The Palestinians found these decisions unsatisfactory because  they tackle matters superficially and do not touch the basic  issue, which is their protection.    Egypt has consistently stressed this point and President  Mubarak has always voiced grave concern about the threats to  which the Palestinians are subjected. Egypt made the same demand  in its statement to the UN Security Council, urging it to adopt  a clear resolution that will guarantee Palestinian safety in the  occupied territories. Egypt also emphasized that the security  requirements, which Israel never stops advocating, are not  limited to the Israelis. It announced that similar attention  must be paid to the Palestinian people's security requirements,  especially in the coming stage when Israel will need to make  confidence-building moves and prove its sincere peace intentions.    Since the bloody incident occurred, Egypt has conducted  contacts with all parties to protect the Palestinians and  prevent a recurrence of the incident which U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher described as the occupation's bloodiest day.  President Mubarak telephoned U.S. President Clinton,  Palestinian leader 'Arafat, and Yitzhaq Rabin. The Egyptian  diplomatic establishment undertook other positive actions in  many directions, particularly in the Security Council, to ensure  that a positive and effective resolution is adopted.    In this connection, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has asserted  that the Security Council will lose its credibility unless it  adopts a resolution condemning the incident and providing  international protection for the Palestinians.    News agencies have reported Israel's agreement, for the  first  time ever, to allow international observers in Gaza and Jericho  and to disarm the Jewish settlers' weapons in Gaza and the areas  surrounding Jericho, something described by some news agencies  as an important concession. We say that, first of all, this is  an auspicious step that came as a result of Egyptian and U.S.  efforts. We note, however, that it does not represent an Israeli  concession but is a necessary step to create a modicum of Arab  trust and demonstrate a goodwill gesture and a constructive  movement toward peace.    The Arabs, all the Arabs, are seeking peace and are doing  much for this purpose. The other side, the Israelis, must act  in the same spirit until both sides meet on the road leading to  this objective.    The criminal assault on the Ibrahimi Mosque, causing so many  casualties, has dealt a strong blow to the peace efforts.  Objective Israeli measures that guarantee Palestinian rights  can, however, end the crisis. This of course will need arduous  efforts and time.</p>

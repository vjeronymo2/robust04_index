			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> MAKO SUSHI'S PERFECT PRESENTATION NOURISHES DINER WITH 'HAPPY MOMENTS'  </P> <P> For weeks or even months on end I can forget the greatest virtue of good food  -- that it can make me happy. No doubt my memory fails because most of the food  I eat isn't all that great. I only recall how happy a meal can make me when  suddenly I look up from my plate and feel well-taken-care-of, nourished, safe  and delighted.  </P> <P> Two such moments occurred recently, and both took place at Mako Sushi in  Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> Mako Sushi has only been open about six months. It's another one of those  mini-mall restaurants that turns out to be far more tasteful and charming than  it looks from the parking lot. Inside it's spare, with a lot of pale wood, some  judiciously placed red lacquer, a glassed-in kitchen area, and a small sushi  bar where Mako and his son prepare some of the best sushi available.  </P> <P> The first time I experienced happiness there, I was sitting at the sushi bar  with my friend John. We were chatting intermittently with the man on John's  left, who was a great fan of the head sushi chef, Mako. "He used to be at  Gennmai sushi," the man said, "and before that, he was at what is now  Matsuhisa's on La Cienega." Then he suggested we try the bonita, two mild,  dense parallelograms of a tuna-type fish topped with smelt roe and ginger.  Also, he urged us to try the salmon, which is cured on the premises and is very  subtle and refreshing.  </P> <P> We also tried tuna that was a deep, translucent red, and melt-in-the mouth  barracuda. Then we ate a brown rice tempura vegetable roll. This is a  particularly large roll because it contains actual tempura vegetables -- fried  yam and bean and broccoli -- wrapped in seaweed and rice. We found that the  brown rice was indeed different from the white rice in that it's rounder, less  sticky and slightly more nutty in flavor. We were just finishing that roll when  an irregularly shaped, sputtering piece of fish appeared before us. John had  ordered it. "It's kama," he said. "Yellowtail collar. You just dig at it with  chopsticks."  </P> <P> I dug. And every bite was a revelation. I never knew that the neck of a  yellowtail could provide such a wide range of flavors and textures. Some of the  meat was fluffy, some dark and oily, all of it very rich and delicious.  </P> <P> It was my first moment of happiness at Mako.  </P> <P> And, at the risk of sounding a bit crass, my sense of well-being wasn't  diminished when the bill came. After having eaten as much sushi as we could,  our bill was exactly $30, including tea.  </P> <P> The next time happiness hit at Mako Sushi, I was again at the sushi bar, this  time with two good girlfriends. Japanese pop songs played on the sound system.  Mako was speaking Spanish to one of his customers and slicing up gorgeous sushi  and sashimi. We had salmon sashimi that was wrapped in cucumber, an excellent  scallop hand roll, and a jazz roll (yellowtail and salmon). When the special  vegetable roll was delivered, we had to just sit and stare.  </P> <P> The cross-sections were like tiny, perfectly composed abstract paintings, or  like laser photographs of some microscopic, perfect world. We pored over it,  heads bumping. "It's just too beautiful to eat," said Annie. And then suddenly,  we were all smiling and laughing, just from being nourished and pampered and  having been given something beautiful to look at.  </P> <P> On another visit to Mako Sushi, I made myself sit away from the sushi bar and  try some entrees and noodles. Though I wouldn't go so far as to describe eating  at a table in Mako Sushi as a disappointment, it definitely did not yield the  same pleasures that the sushi bar did.  </P> <P> At the table, the service was attentive and yet sporadic: Our waters were  eagerly replenished, but food came out of the kitchen in no particular order.  My friend Pablo finished off a good miso soup, an ordinary dinner salad, and an  excellent teriyaki New York steak a good 15 minutes before the arrival of his  father's chiri dofu, a soup of fish, noodles and tofu.  </P> <P> As late as the soup was, it was exceptional -- light and clear and nobly  simple. Meanwhile, I worked my way through an array of appetizers: a limp  soft-shell crab; some acceptable, if slightly soggy, grilled eggplant; and an  assortment of dazzling, delicious sushi.  </P> <P> Pablo had finished so far ahead of us, he became fidgety, so we kept ordering  him bowls of green tea ice cream to keep him occupied. And when he didn't want  any more ice cream, he wrote a poem:  </P> <P>  The most I love  </P> <P> Is the dessert  </P> <P>  Named green tea  </P> <P>  It tastes like cold tea  </P> <P>  Like ice cream  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Mako Sushi  </P> <P> 13905 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks; (818) 789-1385.  </P> <P> Open for lunch noon to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday to Friday; dinner 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.  Tuesday to Thursday, 6:30 to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 5 to 10 p.m. Sunday.

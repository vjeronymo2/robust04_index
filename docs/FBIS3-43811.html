About 175 representatives of General Aidid's Habr Gedir clan  and the Abgal of Ali Mahdi are taking part in the talks. They  have been convened and chaired by a respected Islamic leader,  the Imam of Hirab. But the talks are being funded by the United  Nations.    The world body has opted for a lower-profile, "catalytic"  role in brokering the restoration of civilian authority in the  increasingly lawless Somali capital since talks among the main  warlords collapsed without agreement in Addis Ababa last month,  senior UN officials said.    "We welcome the talks. They are being held among clan elders  and we will not interfere," said a senior official of Aidid's  Somali National Alliance (SNA), Issa Mohamed Siad. "They are  non- political," said Issa, who denied reports that a senior SNA  official, Abdi Qaydid, was attending.    Independent Somali observers said no talks could achieve a  lasting settlement without the participation of the warlords  themselves. UN officials, however, expressed optimism about the  inter-clan talks in Mogadishu. "Pressure is building from the  rank- and-file to stop fighting," said one official. "The foot  soldiers are tired." [passage omitted]    Meanwhile Mogadishu residents complained of a mounting wave  of banditry that spares no one, not even Aidid's inner circle.  The brother of SNA secretary-general Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali was  shot dead by bandits who stole his car on Thursday, SNA  officials said.    The sandy, potholed roads leading out of Mogadishu, choked  with donkey carts and overloaded, antiquated trucks, are again  infested with armed bandits to an extent not seen since before  the multinational military intervention began 13 months ago, UN  officials and Somali residents said.    "We've reduced our presence on the streets and people are  paying the price in terms of banditry, but it's time for Somalis  to understand that the international community only has limited  patience and limited resources for Somalia," one senior UN  official said.    On Thursday about two dozen Somalis with gunshot, shrapnel  and knive wounds streamed into UN hospitals in Mogadishu, but  the cause of the violence in which they were hurt remained  mysterious.    Food prices have risen ahead of the Moslem fast Ramadan, and  the value of the Somali shilling has fallen 10 percent against  the dollar, making foreign products more expensive.    "As the Western forces pull out, merchants have stopped  bringing in commodities," said a Somali businessman, Mohamed  Sheikh, who imports domestic goods from Kenya on dhows, the  traditional Arab boats that ply the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.  "Everyone fears insecurity," said Mohamed, 50.    Aidid remained in Nairobi on Saturday, where he has met  other  factional leaders and US envoy Richard Bogosian, a US official  said. The outcome of his contacts with representatives of the  Group of 12 factions led by Ali Mahdi that oppose him seemed  uncertain.    Meanwhile five US congressmen were expected here later  Saturday for a brief fact-finding tour. Leading the delegation  is Representative John Murtha, chairman of the House Defence  Appropriations Committee, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. [passage  omitted]</p>

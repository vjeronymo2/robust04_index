			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Belgium keen to contribute to Euro-corps BELGIUM is poised to contribute military forces to the Euro-corps being set up by France and Germany, which it sees as a vital building block in constructing a common European foreign and defence identity. The Belgian government, which takes over the EC presidency from the Danes in six weeks, is expected to give renewed impetus to European integration after a year dominated by the crisis over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, this weekend dismissed recent speculation that the Belgian presidency would push for an early reform of EC decision-making to make it more federal and supranational. Mr Claes said France, Germany and Belgium had now agreed that the Euro-corps, expected to number around 40,000 by 1995, should be under Nato command and be part of the Western European Union, while its command would rotate between its members. Mr Claes said he hoped European military co-operation could be pulled together by 1996, when the Community is due to hold its next review of Europe's integration. According to Maastricht, ratification of which was unblocked last week by approval in the Danish referendum and the UK House of Commons, 1996 is also the date at which reform of EC decision-making will be examined. More streamlined decision-making, implying less room for national vetoes, is seen as the inevitable consequence of the EC taking in new members. Despite speculation that Belgium will insist on institutional reform talks now, Mr Claes said it would be 'logical, democratic and fair play' to wait until the new members were in. Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway are all negotiating entry by 1995. But he added that the goal of the Community 'is not an economic one but a political one. We need an open debate and a sincere debate in Scandinavia and in Austria on this target.' He said the Belgian presidency's 'pragmatic' priorities would be to develop foreign and security policy and EC co-operation on emigration and asylum foreseen by Maastricht; to accelerate the enlargement negotiations; 'a serious effort' to combat recession and unemployment; and preparing the second stage of economic and monetary union, due to start in January. Mr Claes insisted that recent remarks by his colleague, finance minister Mr Phillipe Maystadt, that Emu's tight fiscal convergence criteria might have to be reviewed, had been exaggerated. 'What Maystadt said was that if the recession drags on, the figures (which set limits on budget deficits and public debt), not the criteria, may have to be reviewed.'

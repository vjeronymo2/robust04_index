			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Lu's Uncivil Attacks"] </F>   [Text] With the breakdown of the Sino-British political  talks, Lu Ping has reverted to launching personal attacks on  individual Hong Kong officials. In the space of a single speech  the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO)  accused Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod of insincerity  and cast doubt on the credentials of Michael Sze Chocheung. Mr  Lu insinuated that the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs was  not a representative of Hong Kong people: He was too much of a  dedicated follower of Chris Patten.    Such attacks may be a sign of Mr Lu's own difficulties in  Beijing. To his credit he pushed for the Sino-British talks --  against the advice of Zhou Nan, his rival at XINHUA (the New  China News Agency). But he is now having to appear tougher than  Mr Zhou.    China's criticism of those who speak out (like its  invitations to others to appear before the Preliminary Working  Committee to explain themselves) work to undermine the  administration's loyalty to the Governor. Mr Lu's barbs can  hardly fail to increase the pressure on Hong Kong civil servants  and add to their sense of unease about the future. Taken to its  logical extreme, his argument is that the 30 per cent or so of  the population who have supported Mr Patten in opinion polls  over the past year have no right to be considered Hong Kong  people. For the bulk of the population that is absurd. But at  the top of the civil service, where public explanation of, and  vocal support for, official [as published] are part of the job  in our executive-led system of government, the menace of a  post-1997 witch hunt is unmistakeable.    Mr Sze's case, like that of Sir Hamish -- and of Anson Chan  Fang On-sang when she came under attack, as Secretary for  Economic Services, for her defence of the airport -- is a strong  argument against Hong Kong-style executive-led government; it is  an argument in favour of putting elected politicians or  appointed Executive Councillors in charge of policy branches.    Career civil servants are supposed to be neutral, back-room  workers. But under the system invented by Britain, and  preserved by China under the Basic Law, they have to play a role  similar to that of cabinet ministers in defending policies for  which they are not politically responsible and with which they  may privately disagree. Politicians elected or appointed, are in  the job by choice and should be ready to face the consequences.  Civil Servants have no choice.    Mr Lu and his Government are in large part responsible for  the quandary in which civil servants find themselves. They are  under attack, unfairly, for working within a system which  Beijing has endorsed and insists must continue.</p>

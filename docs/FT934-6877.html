			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Feeling the pinch - The death-knell is sounding for many of Japan's subcontractors Kiyoshi Ikeda, owner of IKD, a small machine-tool and precision parts maker in Ota, Tokyo, sighs as he looks out at his neighbourhood from an office above his factory. 'The area used to be full of other businesses like ours. At night we all used to go drinking at the local yakitori shop. Now it's empty most nights,' he says. Ota, populated mainly by small manufacturers and subcontractors of large car and electronic companies, is one of Japan's deteriorating mini-industrial districts. In these areas, small-business confidence has recently sunk to lows last reached during the 1975 recession. According to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private credit research agency, bankruptcies at small and medium-sized businesses are up 30 per cent on the previous year, compared with about 4 per cent at large companies. On top of the economic slump, Japan's subcontractors, which make up 56 per cent of the country's small businesses, have been hit by restructuring at larger corporations. Much of this was planned in the early 1980s but the changes were never implemented as the economy boomed later in the decade. The effect of the restructuring is that leading manufacturers are making fewer model changes and lengthening their product cycles. Components are designed to be shared among a number of models, while the big companies are starting to produce many of the parts and components themselves. Meanwhile, the appreciation of the yen is accelerating the move to lower-cost production centres overseas, leaving smaller subcontractors behind. As a result, many large manufacturers are reviewing existing relationships with their subcontractors. Mazda, the car manufacturer, for example, is cutting its first-tier suppliers from 62 companies to 16, while Isuzu is telling its suppliers to reduce their reliance on the company. Until now, the competitiveness of large Japanese car and electronics makers had been supported by pyramid keiretsu, or corporate grouping structures consisting of four to five layers of subcontractors. Sony has about 100 first-tier subcontractors and Toyota Motor has more than 300. These in turn are supplied by scores of second- and third-tier smaller businesses. These small companies have been a vital source of flexibility, allowing not only employment stability in large companies but bearing the brunt of price cuts by agreeing to sharp cuts in profit margins during the hard times. Close co-operation in the research and development of a new product allowed large manufacturers to procure high-quality, low-cost products. At the same time, subcontractors were able to acquire sophisticated technology, allowing even small concerns such as Ikeda's to use computerised machine tools. Because of this reliance and the lack of formal contracts, most suppliers are now vulnerable. Car and electronics makers may be telling subcontractors to diversify and reduce dependence on a sole customer, but many are exploiting the situation. There are many stories of small companies forced to choose between slashing prices or being cut off the pyramid. Business associations which support small enterprises claim many large companies are breaking a law which forbids them from cancelling orders to subcontractors without due notice, or demanding discounts on goods at the time of payment. 'There are lots of cases under the surface, but most small companies cannot complain for fear of angering the larger companies,' says the National Federation of Merchant and Industrialist's Organisations. Large manufacturers say they have no control over what happens beyond the second tier of suppliers. 'We only deal with our first-tier suppliers and as far as we know, we are abiding by the rules,' says Nissan Motor. The Japan Communist Party, currently lobbying for the rights of subcontractors, wants regulations at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry changed so that the manufacturer at the head of the pyramid takes responsibility for businesses within the whole structure. If there is little prospect of regulatory protection, the chances of economic salvation also look fairly remote. Hopes of a recovery in the economy in the second half of the year have receded as fears over falls in real income among workers have depressed consumer confidence. Initial hopes of a recovery boosted commercial lending to small businesses with capital of Y100m (Pounds 629,000) or less and workers of 300 or less by 15.1 per cent during the April to June quarter. But the trend failed to last and bankers do not expect demand for funds to recover in the near future. In order to avoid interest costs, small companies are liquidating deposits rather than applying for new loans. Even though Japan's small manufacturers managed to survive two oil shocks in the 1970s and the surge of the yen in the mid-1980s, many fear there may not be a way out of the current business downturn. According to a study by the Small Business Finance Corporation, more than 60 per cent of a sample of 840 subcontractors said they would seek salvation from their parent companies during the endaka (or the 'high yen' recession) in 1986. The most recent survey by the same organisation, however, indicated that more than one fifth of 1,600 businesses polled did not know what to do, while 43.1 per cent said they would try to diversify business relationships. Miti, which established Japan's post-war manufacturing industry, is aware of the negative consequences of the demise of small businesses. However, the ministry, which virtually established Japan's economic success with its strong guiding hand, has lost the control it once had over industries as corporate Japan has become increasingly international and powerful. Moreover, the squeeze on small businesses comes as many business owners are ageing and many younger Japanese, captivated by the image of suit-clad businessmen clutching a portable telephone, are avoiding jobs at smaller businesses. Ikeda sums up many attitudes. 'I've gone through a few recessions but everyone is saying this one is different. Besides, we're all growing old. We don't have the energy to fight any more,' he says.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US puts weight behind Third World labour Children in Thailand who labour in back-alleys assembling goods, or who sell themselves as prostitutes, might be reassured to know that the US government has taken up labour rights cases such as theirs. US officials say that threats made by the US Trade Representative to eliminate duty-free status on Thai goods, and on imports from other developing countries, under the US Generalised System of Preferences GSP, have produced 'concrete actions' on labour conditions throughout the Third World. In a recent report, Mr Mickey Kantor, trade representative, noted with satisfaction that the Thai government has approved draft legislation which brings worker rights 'closer to international norms'. Final enactment is expected before the next session of the Thai parliament ends in late July. Meanwhile, Mr Kantor's office will be monitoring progress. It is also watching in Malawi, Guatemala, El Salvador, Indonesia and other countries where labour organisers are often jailed or murdered, where the growth of unions is curbed, where workers are exploited and ill-treated, and where conditions are unnecessarily hazardous. For the past decade, US law has required the trade representative to use GSP benefits to press for improvement in workers' rights in developing countries. The law was passed despite objections in the 1980s of the Reagan administration, which never seriously attempted to implement it unless unfriendly governments were the accused. The Bush administration improved enforcement, fearing a loss of flexibility when the GSP came up for congressional renewal. But it investigated labour petitions with nothing like the enthusiasm it displayed in pursuing violators of intellectual property rights. Activity has quickened with the arrival of Mr Kantor as trade representative under the Clinton administration which began a year ago. He began his law career helping migrant farm workers. Cases filed at the trade agency by labour and human rights groups are now seriously investigated and programmes have been set up to prod various governments. In its most recent review, the representative's office closed cases against Costa Rica and Paraguay, these having enacted labour rights legislation. It commended Malawi's release of a labour leader, Mr Chakufwa Chihana, from prison and noted that free union elections are scheduled there for early this year. 'We are terminating the review on the basis of these actions, with the expectation that union elections will be free and fair and conducted on schedule,' Mr Kantor said, adding a warning that any reversal of this trend would lead the US to reopen the case. The representative gave Guatemala six months to continue progress in training and hiring labour inspectors, and in reducing the backlog of unions applying for formal recognition. Oman, too, was given a further six months to show progress, after it had agreed to joint the International Labour Organisation and begun to revise its labour laws. Mr Kantor said a case against El Salvador could be dropped soon if, as expected, it passes revised labour legislation before the end of the current legislative session in March. Although trade officials complain they are not being given sufficient credit, human rights and labour activists say Mr Kantor still allows foreign policy considerations to play a role in his office's findings. 'In countries like Mexico, facts fly out the window,' says Mr Pharis Harvey, executive director of the International Labour Rights Education and Research Fund. However, he added, labour groups are at least getting the same 'respect' from trade officials as business representatives. 'We are no longer seen as something akin to plague of locusts.'</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREAT TO SALVADORAN PRIESTS IS NOTHING NEW;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: RIGHTIST EXTREMISTS VIEWED THE SLAIN JESUIT RECTOR AS THE  BRAINS BEHIND THE GUERRILLAS.  </P> <P> Symbols are rarely subtle in El Salvador, as in the execution-style slayings of  six Jesuit educators last week. The killers not only left the bodies for all to  see but, in case anyone should miss the point, they shattered the priests'  skulls, too.  </P> <P> Father Ignacio Ellacuria, 59, rector of the Jesuit-run Central American  University, was the country's leading intellectual and an advocate of peace  with justice for the poor. For that, rightist extremists believed he was the  brains behind leftist guerrillas in the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front.  </P> <P> "Like in the Spanish Civil War, they are crying, 'Death to the intelligentsia!'  " Father Cesar Jerez said after a Mass for the victims Saturday.  </P> <P> "Jesuits have always wanted peace with justice -- not war, but justice, and  there you touch very profound (economic) structures. That is why they were  killed," he said.  </P> <P> Jesuits, and Roman Catholic priests in general, are an integral part of  Salvadoran history and society, and such violence against them is nothing new.  The Jesuits have educated most of El Salvador's elite, including many of those  who now view them as Communists and traitors.  </P> <P> Throughout a decade of civil war, the UCA, as the university is called, has  been a bastion of liberal thought in El Salvador. Ellacuria and the other  university leaders who were killed had pushed for dialogue between the  government and rebels and put forth proposals for a political solution to the  decade-long civil war.  </P> <P> When the media were bombed or gagged, the university was one of the few sources  of independent information. Ellacuria tried to be a voice of reason.  </P> <P> "These were not the only reasonable men in El Salvador," said a former faculty  member. "But this shows that El Salvador is not a safe place for reasonable  men."  </P> <P> The Jesuits' first conflicts with the country's landed oligarchy were over  education. In 1974, priests teaching at the elite Externado de San Jose decided  to open the doors of its elementary through high school to poor students. The  decision offended the rich.  </P> <P> "The dominant classes felt betrayed," said Jerez, who served with the Society  of Jesus then. Today, he is the rector of the UCA in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> In the following years, many young Salvadoran priests took up the Vatican's  call to denounce institutionalized violence and to work for the "preferential  option of the poor," a religious current that became known as "liberation  theology."  </P> <P> One of those, a Jesuit named Rutilio Grande, moved to the town of Aguilares,  north of San Salvador, where he lived with impoverished farmers and backed  their demands for land and better salaries.  </P> <P> Grande was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in March, 1977. Two months  later, another priest, Father Alfonso Navarro, was killed in his parish in the  capital. More than a dozen others were expelled or denied re-entry into El  Salvador. The Jesuit-run radio YSAX was bombed, and pamphlets circulated that  said, "Be a Patriot! Kill a Priest."  </P> <P> Amid the violence, several young seminarians joined the armed Popular  Liberation Forces, one of the five groups that eventually would make up the  Farabundo Marti front. Ellacuria opposed their decision, arguing that they  should work within legal institutions; instead, they left the Jesuit order.  </P> <P> In 1979, a group of reform-minded army officers ousted the military government  in a coup. The new civilian-military junta included Ramon Mayorga, the rector  of the Central American University. The new Cabinet was filled with professors  from the UCA, and Ellacuria replaced Mayorga as rector of the university.  </P> <P> The violence continued. The archbishop of San Salvador, Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo  Romero, issued a public plea to soldiers to "disobey orders" and cease the  repression. In March, 1980, Romero was gunned down while saying Mass. Ellacuria  spent much of that year in exile.  </P> <P> Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, a founding father of the ruling Nationalist  Republican Alliance, often has been accused of masterminding the Romero  killing. Now, a member of the Legislative Assembly, D'Aubuisson has always  denied that charge and all allegations that he operated death squads.  </P> <P> In a 1983 interview with The Times, D'Aubuisson said he considered Jesuits to  be more dangerous than armed rebels -- the "worst scum," he called them. He  said the "black Pope" -- invoking the ancient nickname of the head of the order  -- may have masterminded leftist rebel operations in El Salvador, Cuba and  other countries.  </P> <P> To many church and political observers, the deaths of Ellacuria and the five  other priests mark a return to the violence of the early 1980s.  </P> <P> The military has denied any involvement in the killing of Ellacuria and his  colleagues.  </P> <P> The church, meanwhile has renewed Ellacuria's call for dialogue. Pope John Paul  II has appealed to the two sides for a cease-fire.  </P> <P> A reply to the Pope was circulated among foreign journalists Saturday, calling  for the expulsion of several unnamed Salvadoran bishops. The letter bore the  seal of Atty. Gen. Francisco Colorado and a signature. Colorado could not be  reached to verify its authenticity.  </P> <P> "For a long time in this suffering country, there has existed a tendency called  the Popular Church, which large sectors of society blame for the violence that  has shaken El Salvador for many years, which has culminated in the rebels'  violent actions this week," the attorney general wrote.  </P> <P> "For that reason . . . I would like to suggest to the Beloved Father, for the  security and well-being of all the Salvadoran flock, the at least temporary  withdrawal from Salvadoran territory of the bishops," the letter said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EFFORT TO LIMIT CITY OFFICIALS TO TWO TERMS ABANDONED  </P> <P> Supporters of a ballot initiative that would impose a two-term limit on Los  Angeles city officials said Monday that they have abandoned their effort to  qualify the measure for the November election, but vowed to try again.  </P> <P> Representatives of the grass-roots coalition of community groups, who had  planned to deliver thousands of petitions to the city clerk today, said they  were far short of the 205,000 signatures needed to qualify the measure.  </P> <P> "We got a very good amount of signatures, but not enough," said spokeswoman  Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood.  </P> <P> Organizers said the failed campaign will serve as a foundation for a second  effort, which could begin as early as next month to qualify for the ballot in  April, 1991. Supporters said, however, that they will go forward only if they  raise enough money to hire professional signature-gatherers.  </P> <P> "We have discovered that the cynics were right," said Harald Hahn, the group's  treasurer. "You can't do it on volunteers alone. It is one of the problems of  volunteer services. Everyone promises you support, but when you need them, they  may or may not be there."  </P> <P> The campaign, called L.A. 2-Term Limit, raised about $35,000, but Lake said it  needed about 10 times that amount.  </P> <P> Under the proposed charter amendment, elected city officials, who now have no  limits on their terms, would have been able to serve two four-year terms in a  row, but would have been required to sit out at least one term before running  again for the same office.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, City Atty. James K. Hahn, Controller Rick Tuttle and 12 of  the 15 City Council members would have been blocked from running for reelection  if the measure were approved by voters. Only Council members Richard Alatorre,  Ruth Galanter and Nate Holden, who are serving their first full terms, would  have been able to run again without waiting a term.  </P> <P> Supporters of the initiative would not disclose how many signatures they  gathered since launching the campaign in December.  </P> <P> "We want the articles to say why we lost, not what we lost by," said Bob  Carcia, who coordinated volunteers.  </P></p>

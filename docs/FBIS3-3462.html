			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Li Lanqing said here today that China's re-entry into the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will make  significant contributions to a healthy development of global  trade.    Li made the remark at a reception for Chinese and foreign  reporters covering the National People's Congress.    Li said that major progress was made during the sixteenth  round of negotiations on China's resumption of its contracting  party status in GATT.    Li said that the overwhelming majority of GATT contracting  parties have supported an early resumption of China's GATT  membership except one contracting member.    Li said China has become the 11th biggest trader in the  world. "China's re-entry into GATT will make significant  contributions to a healthy development of global trade," he said.    The vice-premier said that China will, as always, have  further negotiations with other contracting parties with a  positive approach and in accordance with the principle of  balance between rights and obligations.    The European Community and other contracting parties have  already put forward a draft protocol on China's re-entry into  GATT, Li pointed out, and other contracting parties have also  had discussions with China.    Regretably, he said, there is one contracting party  obstructing China's re-entry into GATT, in disagreement with its  earlier promise of support in bilateral negotiations. Li  expressed the hope that the contracting party would implement  its earlier commitment.</p>

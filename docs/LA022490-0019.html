			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMAN UNIFICATION AND WORLD PEACE  </P> <P> Could it be that the rush for consensus between the Soviet Union and America  over German unification portends a greater threat to world peace than  politicians are willing to concede? Sure, the potential savings in troop  budgets can help stem the red ink in both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. Certainly, too,  West Germany is now well schooled in democracy and is showing itself ready to  teach its Eastern brethren. But these are hardly reasons to believe that united  Germans will not destabilize world peace and prosperity.  </P> <P> The strengths of democracies rest in their functioning differently in different  cultural environments to express their peoples' genuine desires. This cannot  mean that democracies do absolute "good"; rather, if they are true democracies  they follow their peoples' ideas, whether for "good" or "evil" in the rest of  the world. It's not the governmental form that contributes to world peace; it's  the content. Hitler, after all, manipulated the democratic German state by  appealing to German cultural norms which had wide support in pre-World War II  Germany and he achieved pre-eminence constitutionally.  </P> <P> Hitler's "evil" was no more (nor less) than the realization through the state  of his vulgar expression of German "greatness," "racial exclusivity," "manifest  destiny," and "cultural imperialism" -- themes developed from great German  artists and thinkers such as Nietzsche and Wagner -- and themes which had, and  have, a wide following in the Germanys. As artistic or philosophic themes they  can enliven and expand cultural surroundings; but, as exploited by popular  politics, they can only refer back to Hitler's actions. The refrains of the  militaristic "Deutschland Uber Alles" in the East and the West thus ominously  reaffirm popular cultural ideas in the political arena.  </P> <P> Read in this larger context, the growing electoral power of right-wing parties  in democratic West Germany over the past decade argues strongly against uniting  Germans still holding notions of cultural supremacy. And, the sporadic violence  against Jews and non-Germans (particularly Turks and Italians) which has  peppered German society recently shouts that unification now would be a  terrible mistake for Germany as well as the world.  </P> <P> This is not the time to rush to consensus for the politically expeditious  reasons obvious in the U.S. and Soviet accords. Rather, it is time to listen  closely to the Europeans' judgments of the German popular cultural environment,  which in the immediate past countenanced atrocities against them, and not to  promote the threat to peace in German unification until they are satisfied that  a united German democracy will express the positive aspects of the German  cultural environment.  </P> <P> ROBERT L.

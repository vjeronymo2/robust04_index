			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Halifax fund management move Halifax Building Society is to set up its own fund management operation, as part of the strategy that sees it setting up its own life company and unit trust subsidiaries in January. It has appointed Gartmore and Morgan Grenfell Asset Management to undertake the fund management, along with the in-house team which is already managing the society's Pounds 1bn staff pension fund. The society, the UK's largest, announced last autumn that it was ending its 'tie' with Standard Life. The arrangement meant that the only financial services products sold through the Halifax branch network were those from the mutual insurer. One of the reasons for the Halifax decision to set up its own life company was the desire to have more say over the financial products it sold, and yesterday's announcement is a further indication of its intention of controlling the full process. Gartmore, Morgan Grenfell and the Halifax investment team will each manage about one-third of the funds from the life and unit trust subsidiaries. Gartmore's brief is said to have a 'growth tilt' while Mortgage Grenfell's remit has more emphasis on income. Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, yesterday highlighted the important of assuming responsibility for 'the quality of the financial solution' suitable for the society's customers' needs' and placing this under the society's brand. It would, he said, provide a 'spur' to the organisation's continuing customer service efforts. One of the changes that will accompany the setting up of the society's own operations will be a move to giving staff similar commissions across the range of financial services policies, instead of giving different incentives depending on the type of investment product sold. Both Gartmore and Morgan Grenfell said Halifax was potentially a very significant client. Gartmore has more than Pounds 20bn group funds under management, while Morgan Grenfell has Pounds 30bn funds under management. Among other large societies, the fund management for Woolwich Building Society's life and unit trust subsidiaries is conducted by Mercury Asset Management.</p>

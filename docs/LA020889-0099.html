			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> INTEL LOSES ITS COPYRIGHT BATTLE OVER CHIP CODES  </P> <P> U.S. District Court Judge William Gray ruled Tuesday that NEC Electronics Corp.  did not infringe on Intel Corp.'s copyright in the latest development in a 4  1/2-year dispute over microprocessors.  </P> <P> Gray, a Los Angeles federal judge asked to decide the landmark legal fight,  said that the microcode in Japan-based NEC's V20/30/40/50 microprocessors did  not infringe the copyright Intel alleged it had in the microcode for its  8086/8088 chips.  </P> <P> In fact, Gray held that Intel had forfeited its copyrights for the 8066/88 by  allowing the distribution of copies without copyright notice.  </P> <P> "This is a tremendous victory for NEC," said company spokesman Hank Josefczyk.  "The real winners, though, are the customers. This decision means that they can  take advantage of the superior benefits of these V Series microprocessors  without any concern about the outcome of the trial."  </P> <P> The case had been keenly monitored in Silicon Valley because of its potential  precedent-setting implications for the computer industry. The ruling giving  copyright protection to microcodes meant that some of the most sensitive  secrets of U.S. high-technology companies could be protected, observers said.  </P> <P> Intel alleged that NEC infringed on the copyrights of its microcodes with the  introduction of its so-called V-Series chips and sought a court order to stop  the Japanese chipmaker from continuing to market the product.  </P> <P> NEC countered with two arguments: That Intel failed to take the necessary steps  to ensure the copyright of its microcodes and that, in any case, the NEC  product was not a duplication of the Intel technology.  </P> <P> Gray was the second judge to enter the case, having taken over from U.S.  Northern District Judge William Ingram, who disqualified himself in December  1987 because he owned about $80 in Intel stock through an investment club.  </P></p>

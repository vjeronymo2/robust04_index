			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SORRY SAGA OF EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON PREGNANCY AND  UNBORN INFANTS  </P> <P> Question: I recently read an article advising against drinking alcohol during  pregnancy. The author said that the dangers of alcohol were first identified in  a report published only 20 years ago. Is that true?  </P> <P> Answer: Not exactly, although the modern process for studying the problem fell  into place around then. An issue of the journal Public Health Reports devoted  to alcohol-related problems contains an article by Dr. Kenneth R. Warren of the  National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and Richard Bast of the  National Clearinghouse for Alcoholism and Drug Information that reviews the  sorry saga of concern about the effects of alcohol on unborn infants.  </P> <P> Lower birth weights and a rise in deaths were observed during the London "Gin  Epidemic" between 1720 and 1750. It was a period of good wages, plentiful food  and relative freedom from epidemic diseases. However, Parliament had reduced  controls on the distilling and sale of gin in order to support the gentry who  furnished the raw materials. This encouraged alcohol consumption. Reports and  petitions from physicians and others referred to effects on children that  correlate with what we today call Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS).  </P> <P> Such reports on the impact of alcohol on growth and development continued  through the 18th and 19th centuries, often mixing science and mortality. In  1899, Dr. William Sullivan reported his observations of 600 offspring of 120  women alcoholic prisoners in Liverpool, describing what was later called FAS.  </P> <P> Here in the United States (as well as Great Britain), with the arrival of  Prohibition, concern about the effects of alcohol on pregnancy were largely  ignored for about 20 years. Ironically, much of the research conducted during  the 1940s and beyond tended to refute the harmful ramifications of drinking.  Alcohol was even recommended to pregnant women for "sluggish digestion" and was  used to delay labor.  </P> <P> Then in 1967, Alexandre Lamache, a family physician in Rennes, France,  presented to the French Academy his observations of 1,245 children, collected  during 37 years of practice. This signaled a rebirth of interest in  alcohol-related birth abnormalities. A year later, a group of French  researchers published what was apparently the first well-organized study of  birth defects. In 1970, the pattern of characteristic abnormalities labeled FAS  was first described in this country.  </P> <P> Sadly, estimates based on 20 studies from Australia, Europe and North America  indicate that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading cause of mental  retardation, ahead of Down's syndrome and spina bifida.  </P> <P> Q: Please tell me something about the vegetable called kohlrabi.  </P> <P> A: Botanically, kohlrabi (the name derives from the German word for cabbage and  the Latin word for turnip) belongs to the cabbage family. Although the leaves  are edible, the turnip-like root is usually considered the best part.  </P> <P> Nutritionally, a half cup cooked contains about 40 calories and provides some B  vitamins and Vitamin C. It is an excellent source of potassium, a useful  vegetable for people taking diuretics that cause them to lose that nutrient.  </P> <P> While it can be easily diced and cooked until tender, it can also be braised in  broth, whipped with potatoes, served with sauces, stuffed, cooked in soup, or  served cold with vinaigrette dressing. Introduced in China from Europe during  the 7th Century, it appears in various Chinese recipes.  </P> <P> Q: I've noticed that when nutrients are added to foods, the word "enriched"  sometimes appears on the label, while other times the word "fortified" is used.  What, if any, is the difference?  </P> <P> A: Both terms are associated with the addition of nutrients, but the underlying  concepts differ. "Enrichment" refers to the restoration of nutrients discarded  during processing. Nutrients are added back at levels equal to or not much  greater than those in the original food. The classic example of enrichment is  the restoration of iron along with the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin and  niacin to white flour.  </P> <P> "Fortification" is the addition of nutrients that either are not normally  present in food, or the amount available is too small to be nutritionally  significant. A number of fortification measures have been dramatically  effective in combatting major nutritional deficiencies.  </P> <P> For example, more than 40 years ago, carotene, which the body converts to  Vitamin A, was first added to margarine in Denmark when it was discovered that  the switch from butter to margarine during World War II was linked to blindness  among children there. Similarly, milk was a logical vehicle for Vitamin D  fortification to prevent rickets. And the addition of iodine to salt was an  effective tool in preventing goiter.  </P> <P> Those were important public-health measures. In recent years, the basis for  much fortification seems far less clear. In many cases, the addition of  generous helpings of vitamins and minerals appears to be inspired more by the  goal of selling products than by a demonstrated need for the added nutrients.  Selecting heavily fortified cereals or other foods containing as much as 100%  of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for some nutrients is no substitute for  consuming a varied and well-balanced diet.  </P></p>

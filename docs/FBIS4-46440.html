			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan by the </F> German-based Kurdish news agency KURD-A; place and date not  given]    [Excerpts] KURD-A: Mr. Ocalan, we want to hear  from you about the outcome of Turkey's extensive military  operations against the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party].    Ocalan: It could be said that the special warfare  is now trying to launch its final onslaught by turning for the  last time to its domestic and foreign supporters and to its  highly developed combat experience. In his latest statement,  the Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures said: "They have three  to four months to live." During his visit to Sirnak he also  said: "We have other weapons not used so far." He was, of  course, implying chemical weapons. He says: "If need be, we  can use them too." This is a great threat. Already, nothing has  remained unused. Such statements clearly show that the regime  is in a difficult bind. He wants to use the last few months in  office to accomplish his annihilation mission -- and this has  been practiced for the last millennium -- in a manner befitting  his ancestors. This is barbarism. [passage omitted decrying  regime]    KURD-A: You know the situation in South Kurdistan  [Iraqi Kurdistan]. How do you assess Turkey's role in the  clashes between the Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]?    Ocalan: This is how the plan worked out recently  is unfolding. The head of the special warfare is shouting every  day: "We want to attack northern Iraq with a joint plan." They  have forged an underhanded agreement with the Iraqi regime.  [passage omitted]    Besides, there is also the interests of the United States  and  the "new world order." Under this "new order" the United States  cannot give unconditional approval to Turkey's blind,  colonialist-imperialist ambitions. Otherwise, its own interests  will be under threat. Turkey also wants to launch an  imperialist-colonialist policy no less inferior than the U.S..  Therefore, there are contradictions among them, even if at  tactical level. Turkey will also experience similar  contradictions with Iran and Syria. [passage omitted]    Unlike Turkey, the United States might not like the Saddam  regime to exist in its present form. Turkey has oil pipeline  problems, a serious economic crisis, and wants to monopolize the  economic plunder in Iraq. This is a vital issue. Therefore,  friction with the United States was inevitable.    Essentially, there is a plan, which has been worked out over  the last three months, to completely eliminate the PKK. The  Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures has made a promise to the  Turkish nation and is now saying: "I will definitely fulfill  this promise." They have now formulated a plan, which somewhat  resembles the 1992 plan, but it is not completely identical.  This is rather a Turkey-patented plan. We are not in a  position to say exactly what extent this plan obtained the  United States' approval. The Germans and the French are  possibly behind this plan. It could even be that Russia has  decided not to raise much clamor about it. They might even want  to enlist Iran in this plan. We know that initiatives in this  direction are taking place, Demirel has decided to pay a visit  to Iran. Demirel also went to Egypt, most probably to enlist  Egypt in this plan. He might want to secure an Egyptian role in  Kurdistan similar to the latter's role during the Iraqi  incursion into Kuwait. The United States might decide to give  direction to this plan. We think that the United States will  not do such a thing because of its differences with other  states, but then on the other hand it might support this plan.  The situation is confusing because of these uncertainties. Who  is in this plan and to what extent? What we know at this stage  is that Turkey is guiding this plan, and England, and hence the  United States, will not fully support it.    KURD-A: What are the dimensions of this plan in  the North [Kurdish regions in Turkey]? You know that there are  ongoing efforts or preparations to form a Kurdish party  dependent on the state.    Ocalan: Yes, one wonders how a traitor Kurd  [former Turkish cabinet minister Serafettin Elci], who was in  the service of the special warfare just yesterday, could raise  up his head? He will admit his Kurdish identity but will remain  thoroughly loyal to the Turkish state! He will be Muslim but  will not endorse Shari'ah. He will oppose if (we describe  Shari'ah as the correct Islam)? [sentence as published] What  sort of a Muslim would he be opposing Shari'ah? This is enormous  duplicity and hypocrisy. I do not know if he will be liberal,  but it is said that he will have links to this or that! There  has never been such an extreme blend of reactionism and  progressivism! It is said that the person in question is aiming  to become the Ozal of the Kurds. They say the revolutionary war  will be crushed within few months, that the plan has already  been put into effect, and that they have great hopes of success.  They would not have been able to prolong their success had they  not been so hopeful. The traitors have pinned great hope on  Turkey's success. They were also pinning the same hopes on the  1992 Southern war [when Turkey launched attacks in northern  Iraq] and were shouting "long live Turkey." These were the  slogans used in greeting their real masters in their difficult  days. Now they trust Turkey even more, apparently they have  received guarantees. This movement of agents and traitors is  biding its time.    The revolutionary militanism and patriotism is being  suppressed and eliminated in the South. The plan is also to  eliminate them in the north and lay a huge Kurdistan table in  front of them [agents and traitors]! They would be allowed to  sell off as much as they could, eat as much as they want, but it  would be sufficient not for forty but for four hundred years,  and that would save their lineage!    Yes, all the collaborationists are acting within this plan.  It is obvious how cruel the plan is. It applies to those who  have no relation to homeland, people, freedom, and life, and who  have involved in plunder, exploitation of labor, and sucked  human blood to make such ghastly fun of people as old as  mankind, not to let-up their oppressive grip on the people, and  to deceive themselves with the claim that they are "succeeding"  on this issue.    KURD-A: Finally, we want to know how you assess  this existing situation from PKK's perspective.    Ocalan: At this point revolutionary tactics enter  the developments. Sometimes, a situation arises requiring the  reassessment of tactics. PKK has some experience in this  direction. We have prepared ourselves considerably against DPK's  stealthy politics. For the last 20 years of ideological,  political, and practical work, we have been duty-bound to  formulate correct positions against it. Basically, our tactic  is to prevent DPK's collaborationism. We are faced with a  situation of constantly giving replies. This will not only be a  wide initiative within Kurdistan, it will also spill the problem  over to the international level; it will lead to the emergence  of some sort of an independent force and open the way for  intensive diplomacy. It will seriously affect Turkey. It will  not only bring its plan to destroy Kurdistan to naught, but also  open the way for revolutionary war plans to gain strength. It  will not lead to suffocation but breathing, not to retreat but  advance and growth. Already there are Northerners now going to  the South. Already the people in the North have physically  joined with the people in the South. The people living on two  sundered fragments should unite in some way. In 1990 the people  of South got to know the people of the North, and now the people  of the North are uniting with the people of the South. This  will have international repercussions. It may open the way for  UN support. All these will enormously strain Turkey's regional  balances and status quo.    Without a doubt we will put all these into effect. More  importantly, we will intensify our activity. We will apply  pressure in the political and diplomatic arenas. It appears  that this counter-revolutionary plan has increased the chances  of the revolutionary plan. That is, this counter-revolutionary  plan might feed the revolutionary plan; it could be utilized for  that purpose. We are not carried away with illusions. Most  importantly, we are not waiting for developments to take their  own turn. Developments could be given a direction by hard work.</p>

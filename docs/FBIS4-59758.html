			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abd-al-Malik Mansur, head of the </F> political and foreign relations department at the Yemeni General  People's Congress, in Sanaa, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo,  on the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] How can the Yemenis emerge from the  crisis and protect their unity, resources, and achievements?    [Mansur] First, I would like to thank you for contacting us  to seek reassurance about conditions in our country.    What is happening in the Yemeni arena today is the last  chapter, not the beginning, of the crisis. Things were settled  democratically in Yemen; the Yemeni people elected their  representatives in public elections, which were clean, as  certified by the organizations that supervised them. The  elections elected people's representatives to parliament, which  freely elected a presidential council ...    [Abu-al-Majd interrupts] We do not want to discuss the past.  We are trying to find a solution that stops the bloodletting.  How can we do that?    [Mansur] Yes, this is possible. It is what we hope and work  for. No rational or civilized person would choose war. We  neither opted to fight nor sought to wage a war. But we welcome  any peaceful initiative in the context of recognizing  constitutional legitimacy.    [Abu-al-Majd] You say you welcome any peaceful settlement.  The Arab League put forward a peaceful settlement to end the  bloodshed. You reportedly did not accept that initiative. Why?    [Mansur] We accept no mediation based on the idea that there  are two equal parties in the arena. If a mediation effort  admits that there is a legitimate government based on parliament  and the Constitution and that seeks to reconcile parties, it is  welcome to that.    [Abu-al-Majd] But some say the military option will take  time. So the bloodletting will continue. Even if the situation  is settled in your favor militarily, this will create hatred in  hearts and trigger more bloodletting.    [Mansur] We are optimistic. We expect the future to be  bright and to bring much good for the Yemeni people, the  neighboring region, and the entire Arab people. We do not think  the future will be one of vengeance and bloodletting. No wise  man chooses war as an approach.    [Abu-al-Majd] Why do you not sit with them now through Arab  mediation--by the Arab League, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates,  or others--to make things clearer and stop the bloodshed?    [Mansur] This is a wise thought. That is exactly what we  did. We have sat with them 1,001 times since the beginning of  the crisis. We got together in Jordan in the presence of His  Majesty King Husayn and we signed a document named the Pledge  and Accord Document ...    [Abu-al-Majd interrupts] Why do you not try again one last  time?    [Mansur] Only an irrational person rejects reconciliation.  But man reconciles with people who accept reconciliation.    [Abu-al-Majd] But the Socialist Party people say they accept  reconciliation. Do we understand from this that you have chosen  the military option and, if so, why do you send envoys to Arab  states?    [Mansur] I would like to say that a political decision is  delaying the entry of the legitimate army to Aden. The brother  president does not want to devastate Aden, because he loves its  people and sympathizes with them. That is why he might throw a  siege around it. The envoys being sent to Arab leaders are part  of bilateral consultations; they brief our brothers on the  situation in our country.    [Abu-al-Majd] Some say unity cannot be imposed by the force  of weapons.    [Mansur] This is true. Our unity was established peacefully  by consensus and consent on 22 May 1990.    [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think the Pledge and Accord Document  can  still guarantee the continuation of unity after resorting to the  military option?    [Mansur] The document retains the necessary elements for  success and survival although it needs to be developed and  reviewed in light of new developments.    [Abu-al-Majd] Thank you.    [Mansur] Thank you.</p>

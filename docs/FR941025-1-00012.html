The effect of this action would eliminate unnecessary discomfort to animals used in vaccine testing. This amendment would provide the firms with a previously unauthorized option for test animals that are accidentally injured or become ill or exhibit unfavorable reactions for reasons not due to the test. These animals may be removed from the test and treated or humanely destroyed. In addition, test animals that show clinical signs of illness resulting from the test may be treated or humanely destroyed when death is certain to occur without therapeutic intervention. This action is necessary to provide for the treatment or humane destruction of ill or injured test animals under defined conditions, an option not currently allowed by the regulations for test animals as a group. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before December 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, P.O.

In the course of evaluating a biological product, it may be necessary to conduct potency, safety, or efficacy tests in animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulations in 9 CFR part 117 require that once an animal test has begun, no treatment which could interfere with a true evaluation of the biological product may be used ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;117.4(c)). However, test animals may become accidently injured or ill or exhibit unfavorable reactions as a result of factors not due to the test. These occurrences are unpredictable, and no provisions are available in the current regulations for the appropriate treatment or humane destruction of such animals. The proposed rule would provide that test animals which exhibit clinical signs of illness, become accidentally injured or exhibit unfavorable reactions not associated with the test, may be removed from the test and be treated or humanely destroyed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

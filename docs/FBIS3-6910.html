			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "In the Boxing Ring With the Khmer </F> Rouge"]    [Text] With a spirit of national reconciliation and unity,  the royal government has repeatedly called on the opinionated  Khmer Rouge to stop the war and return to the national  community. The group, however, continues to refuse and ignore  the offers. Moreover, it has also accused First Prime Minister  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of causing the failure of  talks in the past. Now the group is nearing an irreversible  point where it will inevitably face a danger, since the Khmer  Royal Armed Forces have pledged to preserve the unity of the  country.    The Khmer Rouge should correct their mistakes and proceed  along the right path by being content with national  reconciliation. With promised aid worth nearly $1,800 million,  it would be wise for the Khmer Rouge to join the national  community to serve the country and rebuild it toward glory. It  is certain that difficulties still remain. However, if the  former warring parties, such as the FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia] Party, the Cambodian People's Party, and the Buddhist  Liberal Democratic Party, can forget past differences and unite  for the interests of the nation and people, the Khmer Rouge  should follow their fine model and join them. This will  certainly allow all of them to live in prosperity.</p>

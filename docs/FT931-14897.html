			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: 3i raises Pounds 24.6m from sale of trust stakes 3i GROUP, the venture capital company, has sold its holdings in two publicly-quoted investment trusts, London Atlantic Investment Trust and North British Canadian Investment Company, for Pounds 24.6m after costs. This represents the second largest disposal of an investment - after the sale of a Pounds 38m stake in the Frizzell financial services group  - by 3i in the past 12 months. The proceeds will be devoted to its core activity of investment in unquoted companies. 3i held stakes of 55 per cent stake in London Atlantic and 27.2 per cent in North British. It will continue as investment manager for both the trusts, which specialise in smaller quoted companies, and is still keen to take on the management of other investment trust portfolios where possible, said Mr Rupert Wiles, executive director. 3i's portfolio management division still has responsibility for its direct stakes in quoted companies and for managing the group pension fund - a total of about Pounds 500m worth of investments. 3i held the stakes for several decades and originally acquired its holdings so as to have a home for some of its quoted investments. This was no longer appropriate, Mr Wiles said. 3i has its own much delayed plans to obtain a public listing in investment trust form. The disposal involved 25.1m shares in London Atlantic which were placed with about 20 institutional investors at a discount of 2 per cent to the mid-market price of 71 1/2 p by stockbrokers James Capel. Some 7.3m shares in North British were placed with about 10 institutions at a discount of nearly 4 per cent to the mid-market price of 103p. London Atlantic has recently traded at a 13 per cent discount to net asset value and North British at a 9 per cent discount. The sale is expected to increase liquidity in the stock. 3i still has an 18 per cent stake in the Investment Trust of Guernsey.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China has completed a  new snow-monitoring system for pastoral areas.    The satellite monitoring system can forecast the possibility  of disastrous snowstorms and estimate the damage that can  result, through remote sensing techniques, over a vast pastoral  area from western China's Tibet-Qinghai Plateau to the Greater  Hinggan Mountains in northeast China.    Snow disasters cause heavy losses to livestock in northern  China every year, sometimes as much as five percent of the total.    Scientists from the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and  Cryopedology in northwest China's Gansu Province prepared the  data for the satellite monitoring covering an area of about  590,000 sq [square] km.</p>

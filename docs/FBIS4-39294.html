			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Stanislav Bychkov and Oleg </F> Velichko]    [Text] Kuala Lumpur June 6 TASS -- Russian First Vice-Prime  Minister Oleg Soskovets arrived here today at the head of a  Russian parliamentary delegation on a two-day visit. The chief  event of the visit will be the signing of a contract under which  Russia will supply "MiG-29" fighter aircraft to Malaysia.    The signing ceremony for the contract is scheduled to be  held  on Tuesday. Oleg Soskovets will also meet with Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar  Ibrahim on Tuesday.    Acting Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar, who received the  Russian delegation at the airport, told ITAR-TASS in an  interview that the Malaysian side sees the contract as one link  in a chain of broader cooperation with Russia in different  spheres, including the military one. According to the minister,  the "MiG" contract will act as a catalyst in the development of  Malaysian-Russian-business ties.    Stanislav Filin, deputy director-general of the state-owned  arms and military equipment export-import company  "Rosvooruzheniye", told ITAR-TASS that the work on the contract  had taken two years. The deal is worth 550 million U.S.  dollars. The first "MiG" will be delivered in April, 1995. The  full consignment of 18 aircraft will be shipped to Malaysia  within 11 months. In collaboration with Malaysia, Russia is  expected to set up a technical centre for servicing the planes.  The contract also provides for training Malaysian pilots in  Russia. According to the contract, 25 per cent of the planes'  cost will be paid with supplies of palm oil with the right of  export to third countries.    Meeting Malaysia's wishes halfway, the Russian side has made  changes in the fighters' instrument system. In particular, a  navigation apparatus working on frequencies used in south-east  Asia will be installed in the aircraft.</p>

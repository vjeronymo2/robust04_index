			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> DEFTLY BALANCING THE BOOKS IN BRAZIL;  </P> <P> THE CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY'S CONTROVERSIAL ECONOMY MINISTER, IS TO KEEP  INFLATION UNDER CONTROL. DESPITE SOME GAINS, HER ULTIMATE SUCCESS IS FAR FROM  ASSURED.  </P> <P> Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello is a "zebra" -- Brazilian parlance  for something rare and improbable.  </P> <P> In a country with a macho tradition in government power, she is a female  super-minister. In a job previously thought to require maturity and experience,  she is 36 years old and relatively unseasoned. And in command of a  market-oriented economic policy, she is a former Communist.  </P> <P> In three months on the job, Cardoso has worked hard and achieved much. When she  took over as economy minister March 15, Brazilian inflation was the highest in  the world, soaring at a rarefied rate somewhere over 80% a month. Cardoso's job  was to stop it.  </P> <P> She did -- at least temporarily. Now the challenge is to keep inflation under  control while at the same time preventing Latin America's largest economy from  sinking into a deep recession. It's a difficult balancing act, and as  inflationary pressures build and Brazil's economy sags, her ultimate success is  far from assured.  </P> <P> Whatever happens, she has already proven controversial. Some analysts say  Cardoso's lack of administrative skill is seriously impairing the ministry's  performance; others counter that she has grown surprisingly in the job, showing  toughness and tenacity that may make up for other shortcomings.  </P> <P> What no one denies is that she is close to President Fernando Collor de Mello.  </P> <P> The middle-class daughter of a Sao Paulo police inspector who died when she was  23, Cardoso met Brazil's future president while working in the National  Treasury in the mid-1980s. Her job was to negotiate with Brazilian state and  municipal governments on their debts to the treasury. Collor was the governor  of tiny Alagoas state, and, as an economist himself, a man who dealt personally  with its debt problems.  </P> <P> At the time, both she and Collor belonged to the centrist Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party, which had come to power after the armed forces ended 21 years  of military dictatorship in 1985.  </P> <P> (Cardoso had joined the Communist Party while a student, but her association  with the party was short. "It lasted for as short a time as she dated the  professor of general history in the course, who encouraged her Communist  ideas," according to the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo.)  </P> <P> Cardoso left the treasury in 1987 and created an economic consulting firm that  helped Collor start his campaign for the presidency. Later, she joined Collor's  new National Reconstruction Party and became his chief economic adviser.  </P> <P> Some of her leftist friends criticized Cardoso for joining Collor, 40, whose  political background is conservative. "I lost some friends," she admitted, but  the team of advisers she formed included economists of both the right and left.  </P> <P> Near the end of the campaign, when Collor blasted his leftist opponent with a  barrage of anti-Communist rhetoric, Cardoso threatened to quit, according to  press reports.  </P> <P> But she stayed, and after his election last December, she was put in charge of  the new "super-ministry" of the economy that Collor created by combining  Brazil's old Planning and Finance ministries. That made Cardoso, by all  accounts, the most powerful woman official in Brazilian history.  </P> <P> She is said to be one of the few people around the president who calls him  Fernando. The close relationship gives her political clout that someone hired  only for technical expertise would not enjoy.  </P> <P> "Her strong point is that she is a political finance minister," said Richard  Foster, editor of a political and economic intelligence service called Brazil  Watch.  </P> <P> Foster said the economy minister needs political support because parts of the  anti-inflation program have been opposed by powerful sectors. Business people  have been hurt by price freezes and a drastic cutback in money circulation;  middle-class consumers have been squeezed by a freeze on savings accounts and  deposits in financial markets; banks have lost big profits previously derived  from inflated interest rates, and labor unions have been frustrated by the  government's refusal to order new cost-of-living raises.  </P> <P> Cardoso certainly has her critics.  </P> <P> "She is not an effective communicator with the public at large," said a foreign  bank executive in Brazil, who described the minister as "distant, removed,  impatient."  </P> <P> As long ago as the early 1980s, during her tenure as an assistant professor at  the University of Sao Paulo's School of Economics, she was known as "cold and  formal with those she didn't know well, but sweet and cheerful with her  friends," according to O Estado de Sao Paulo.  </P> <P> Gustavo Franco, an economics professor at Rio's Catholic University, was among  Brazilians surprised by Cardoso's ministerial appointment.  </P> <P> "Most economists were sort of expecting that the minister of economy would be  handled by a first-rate economist," Franco recalled. "Zelia certainly was not  regarded as one of the major economists in the country. Far from it."  </P> <P> She chose a competent second echelon of economists to work with her, Franco  said, but the problem is that Cardoso and a small circle of her closest  collaborators make major decisions "in a bunker style," without consulting  outside experts or lower levels within the ministry.  </P> <P> As a result, some of the ministry's measures have contained legal and technical  flaws that have threatened to undermine the credibility of the whole  anti-inflation program. For example, two measures that set prison terms for  "economic crimes" were unconstitutional; they had to be withdrawn and  rewritten.  </P> <P> Several similar errors led O Estado de Sao Paulo to conclude that the  government had completed "two months of juridical bumbling." Such criticism fed  widespread fears that the stabilization program was in danger of falling apart.  </P> <P> Cardoso's style also has created morale problems within the ministry, according  to economist Franco. Many skilled employees who are not called upon for  contributions worry that they will lose their jobs.  </P> <P> "The impression one gets from visiting the ministry is that 50 people are  working all night long and the rest, 1,500, are doing nothing, just trying to  figure out how not to get fired," Franco said. "Something is missing in the  capacity to organize this big machine."  </P> <P> Carlos Langoni, another non-government economist, agreed.  </P> <P> "One problem of this group is that they are a very small group and very closed  in terms of debating future measures," Langoni said. But he said Cardoso  recently has begun consulting more with experts outside the closed circle.  </P> <P> "It's slowly beginning to open up," he said.  </P> <P> Brazil Watch editor Foster said Cardoso may have been outmaneuvered by Sao  Paulo industrialists who quickly criticized her austerity methods as  threatening mass layoffs. "Zelia got frightened" and allowed a substantial  increase in the money supply, possibly adding to inflationary pressures, Foster  said.  </P> <P> "I think the business community exaggerated to try and get Zelia nervous and  get her to do what she did, to loosen up a bit," he said. "She was outsmarted  because she didn't have enough experience."  </P> <P> As inflation has crept back up to monthly rates of 3% in April and at least 5%  in May, Cardoso has taken a tougher line. Early in June she warned that  inflation would be controlled even at the cost of a recession.  </P> <P> "Our concern is called inflation. That is concern No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the  government," she said recently.  </P> <P> She also has talked tough with private banks that hold most of Brazil's $115  billion foreign debt, the largest in the Third World. Meeting with major  bankers in New York in late May, she emphasized that Brazil has no intention of  making payments on $5.5 billion in overdue interest until the debt is  renegotiated.  </P> <P> Before taking her current job, Cardoso, who has never been married, would  sometimes cook dinner for a small circle of friends in her one-bedroom Sao  Paulo apartment. She enjoyed tennis. She reportedly spent much of her income on  elegant dresses and suits from fashionable boutiques and meals in good  restaurants.  </P> <P> But since moving to a government flat in Brasilia and to her super-ministry,  there has been little time for social life. "I leave here at midnight, every  night," she told a recent visitor to her office.  </P> <P> In a television interview last month she said she was in love, but "it is a  platonic love. I don't have time for dating because of my work."  </P> <P> The signs of strain and fatigue can often be seen on her face. What keeps her  going? "I believe we are building a new country," she told a Brazilian  newspaper.  </P> <P> A Formula for Brazil's Recovery  </P> <P> Key measures of Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello's anti-inflation  package:  </P> <P> * Freeze most deposits in individual savings and checking accounts for 18  months.  </P> <P> * Freeze all but 20% of individual assets in financial market for 18 months.  </P> <P> * Prohibit price increases without authorization of Economy Ministry.  </P> <P> * Suspend requirement for salary increases based on monthly inflation index.  </P> <P> * Create tax on financial operations and increase some other taxes.  </P> <P> Goals of Zelia's anti-inflation package:  </P> <P> * Reduce inflation to 10% a month in 100 days and 3% a month in 18 months.  </P> <P> * Turn public deficit of about 8% of domestic economic production into a  surplus of about 2%.  </P> <P> * Cut federal payroll by 360,000 jobs.  </P> <P> * Privatize government-owned enterprises at a rate of one a month.  </P> <P> * Sell off 10,700 government-owned apartment buildings and 42 "mansions"  previously occupied by public servants.  </P> <P> * Double tax revenues.  </P> <P> Biography  </P> <P> Name: Zelia Cardoso de Mello  </P> <P> Position: Brazilian economy minister; former economics professor.  </P> <P> Age: 36  </P> <P> Personal: Born to a middle-class family in Sao Paulo, the daughter of a police  inspector.

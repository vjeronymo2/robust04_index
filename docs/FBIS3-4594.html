			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 26 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government will propose to North Korea to meet at the southern  side of the truce village of Panmunjom on March 2 to discuss  exchange of special envoys in a telephone message on Feb. 28.  Seoul's action comes after North Korea agreed to allow  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in its  nuclear sites from March 1 in a working- level meeting with the  United States late Friday. The North Koreans said they will  resume inter-Korean dialogue if the South proposes it in the New  York meeting.    Seoul's telephone message to be sent under the name of Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang to his North Korean counterpart Kang  Song-sang will propose a working-level contact on March 2. If  realized, South and North Korea would be resuming their first  dialogue in four months after the third meeting last October  broke down.    The government is likely to announce suspension of this  year's Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" if North  Korea fully cooperates with IAEA inspections and shows sincerity  in inter-Korean dialogue around the same time South and North  sit down for working- level talks.    If the talks go smoothly, the first exchange of presidential  envoys is expected to take place sometime in March 10-15 before  the third round of high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks.    Seoul and Pyongyang have so far differed in the form,  schedule, and content of discussions by their special envoys,  but Seoul officials say they hope to sign an agreement on the  exchange in the fourth or fifth contact.</p>

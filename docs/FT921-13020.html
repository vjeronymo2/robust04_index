			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Observer: Snap shot There could hardly be a sharper image of New York's ills. 47th Street Photo, the eccentric Manhattan electronics retailer known to bargain-hunters the world over, has hit bankruptcy. Irving Goldstein, a Hungarian refugee, opened his first store in 1965 in the heart of the city's diamond district. It was staffed largely by Brooklyn's Hasidic jews and was quintessential New York. Service was fast and feisty, customers pushy and plentiful, and price counted above all. By the 1980s, 47th Street Photo had expanded to a five-outlet chain. But those were the good old days. More recently, a vicious legal battle erupted between Goldstein and Joseph Fischer, a one-time consultant of his. Investments in real estate went sour, and price wars engulfed the electronics retailing sector generally. The last straw was when Transamerica froze bank accounts - prompting 47th Street Photo to seek refuge under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Ironically, the largest creditor is New York State, which claims to be owned Dollars 10.8m in back taxes.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: City delays verdict after its initial surprise NEWS OF Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland Bank took London by surprise. Only a few City voices had any inkling that ideas of a merger had been revived. Fewer still had a clear sense of how it will turn out in practice. The initial reaction of fund managers and ratings agencies was to remain cautious until more details emerge. IBCA, the London-based international bank rating agency, said that it had put both banks on credit watch. 'We want to know more details before we make up our minds about this. We need to see the financing of the merger and how they propose to structure it,' said one agency's banking analyst yesterday. He agreed with fund managers who said that the two fundamental facts about the merger were that Midland has staged a fairly convincing recovery and does not need to be taken over, while there is no doubt that Hongkong bank does need to diversify out of Hong Kong ahead of the transfer of its government to China in 1997. 'Midland Bank was probably the best-geared recovery situation in the sector,' said the fund manager. One international banker said Hongkong Bank is in a much stronger position now than in 1987 when a merger was first mooted and can expect less resistance when imposing its will on Midland.</p>

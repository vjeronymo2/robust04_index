			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Ideas of Communism Are Alive in </F> Ukraine"]    [Text] The results of the latest elections in Ukraine  attest to the fact that the ideas of communism are still alive  and--at times--prevail. Why is that?    In the opinion of respondents questioned during a  republic-wide investigative poll, the most attractive features  of the communist regime were as follows: economic stability,  guaranteed work, and the absence of nationality-type or ethnic  conflicts. That is to say, it concerns what is lacking nowadays  (with the partial exception of the last-named factor). Only 8  percent of those polled consider that communism had no positive  traits at all.    In order to gain a more complete idea of the image of  communism which had been formed in the social consciousness, the  respondents were also requested to cite its most negative  features. It turns out that communism's "greatest sin" is its  bureaucracy (so think one-third of the respondents), as well as  oppression of the people and corruption. Some 13 percent have  remained steadfast and unshaken dreamers about the cloudless  serenity of the communist past.    Such a distribution of opinions is combined with an overall  decrease in the adherents of the communist idea. Their number  has been reduced by more than two-thirds and now  amounts--according to data drawn from the above-mentioned  poll--to approximately 15 percent. Moreover, 11 percent have not  yet determined their own political priorities. In contrast, the  proportion of communism's opponents has doubled and now amounts  to 74 percent. One-third of all the supporters of communist  ideas comprise pension-age respondents, whereas only one-tenth  of those under the age of 30 maintain such a political  orientation. It is noteworthy that among former communists  nowadays there are twice as many persons who are indifferent to  communist ideas than there are faithful adherents to these ideas  (the figures are 60 percent and 30 percent respectively).    The logic of those voters who cast their ballots for the  communists is roughly as follows: "Since the democrats and the  members of the independence movement were incapable of providing  us with a better life, I am voting for the communists, that is,  for the good old days." However, few of these voters really  think that those communists who suceeded in being elected to the  office of deputy will carry out their pre-election promises.    By the way, the telephone number to call in order to  contact the Sotsis-Gallup organization in Kiev is: 28-64-32.</p>

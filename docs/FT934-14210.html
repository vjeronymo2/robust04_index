			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP shares expected to trade at a premium SHARES in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the bank spearheading the French government's privatisation programme, are expected to rise to a premium when they start trading this morning. BNP's new shares, which were sold at the unexpectedly low price of FFr240, were trading at FFr277 on the 'grey', or unofficial, market late last week. Analysts expect the shares to rise to a similar level when trading begins. 'The original issue was so heavily oversubscribed that there is bound be to strong demand,' said one analyst. 'Also, the offer price is generally accepted as having been too low, which should make the institutions even keener to pick up stock in the market.' The BNP issue, which values the bank at FFr43bn (Dollars 7.5bn), was heavily oversubscribed. The institutional part of the issue was closed after only two days, having attracted applications for 12 times the number of shares available. The public issue was five times subscribed, with 2.8m investors applying for shares against the original target of 1m. The government has increased the allocation of shares to the public by reducing the number earmarked for institutional investors and 'hard core' shareholders. But it has also rationed the shares given to the public from the original 40 to 15 each. In spite of the high level of interest in BNP's shares, analysts do not expect the French to 'stag' the issue by taking quick profits on their shares, as UK investors did in the 1980s privatisations. The next phase of the privatisation programme will be the announcement, expected today or tomorrow, of the next candidate for sale. The government last week said the next issue would be either Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, or Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group.</p>

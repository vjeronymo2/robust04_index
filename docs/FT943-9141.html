			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses derailed by Swedish interest rate rises Swedish rate rises derailed bourses after a morning on the upgrade, reminding investors of the next turn in the cycle, writes Our Markets Staff. Merrill Lynch put this in perspective, saying that the first German interest rate rise could well be over a year away, and that the key was the inflation outlook. Sweden devalued in 1992, the broker noted, the export sector boomed, unemployment there has been falling for over a year and wages have begun to rise. Italy's rate increase came too late to affect bourses. The initial response was that this was another country with one of the biggest budget deficits in Europe, and one of those with the greatest uncertainty about its economic prospects. STOCKHOLM dropped 1.9 per cent after the Riksbank raised its key lending rate by  1/2 percentage point to 8 per cent, citing fears that the economy was overheating. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 27.30 lower at 1,441.50. Banks and insurers sustained the worst damage, the sector index shedding 5.4 per cent. Analysts remained negative over the short term, feeling that the market was uncertain even before the rate rise with an election and European Union referendum in prospect, and the largest budget deficit in the OECD. The ball bearings group SKF dipped SKr5 to SKr148 after announcing first-half profits of SKr543m, against a previous loss of SKr503m. Analysts suggested that, in spite of the good results, many in the market were hoping for a signal of strong growth in the second half, and this was not forthcoming. MILAN had closed by the time the news came out of a 50 basis-point rise in the domestic discount rate, an action, said the central bank, to defend the lira. However, the market had already been buffeted by further political worries and weakness in the bond market. The Comit index finished 5.35, or 0.8 per cent, down at 669.17. Brokers remarked of the continuing political unease, that differences between members of the governing coalition, over issues such as cuts to be made in the pension system, had undermined confidence even further. COPENHAGEN lost 2.3 per cent on Sweden's rate rise, the KFX index falling 2.34 to 101.07 in weak trading. Mr Soeren Dalgaard, chief economist at Jyske Bank, said: 'The Danish share market has been affected by rate nerves; there is a tendency for foreign investors to lump all the Scandinavian markets into one.' HELSINKI fell into the doldrums as the market lost 1.25 per cent on fears of interest rate rises. The Hex general index declined 23.4 to 1,852.7. Within that, the banking and finance sector dropped by 3.1 per cent, but analysts expected the market to bounce back soon. FRANKFURT was a case of what might have been. The Dax index was reported at 2,184.23 in midsession but bund futures dropped sharply towards the end and the key index closed 5.09 lower at 2,155.09 as turnover rose from DM5.5bn to DM7.1bn. Equities saw little reaction to US PPI data in the post-bourse. There were similar stories at corporate level. The energy and chemicals group Veba rose as high as DM539.50 in the pre-bourse on a 43 per cent increase in half-year net profits, lifting the market as a whole in the process. But it fell by as much as DM10 from that level before closing at DM532, down DM2.20. Thyssen, the steel and engineering major, managed to sustain its outperformance. A series of buy recommendations, interest after the Hoogovens results in the Netherlands, and some switching out of financials into cyclicals, took the shares up DM4 to DM318.50 on the session. They rose to DM319.40 after hours. Deutsche Bank plunged late in the session, partly on the financials/cyclicals switch, but more on what traders described as heavy selling pressure from a major US investment house. The shares ended DM17.50 down at DM706. ZURICH closed a percentage point below its best, the SMI index ending 2.6 lower at 2,588.8. SMH provided the outstanding feature of the day, rising SFr20 to SFr824. Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich said that SMH had risen by 13 per cent since the beginning of August, mainly on buying from London. He offered two reasons: first, a 1994 price/earnings ratio of 12; and secondly, the prospect of better shareholder information from the watchmaker in future. PARIS was dragged lower by events taking place elsewhere in Europe and fears that this could trigger a round of interest rate rises elsewhere. The CAC-40 index fell 25.24, or 1.2 per cent, to 2,038.93 in turnover of FFr3.1bn. Alcatel Alsthom dropped FFr11 to FFr623, adding to Wednesday's similar fall, and announced a rise in first-half sales after the market had closed. AMSTERDAM took a good look at the KLM results and, in spite of the better than expected first-quarter results, was disappointed by the airline's appraisal that it was only 'cautiously optimistic' regarding full-year figures. The shares strengthened to Fl 55.60 when the results were first posted, before investors had time to take a closer look and drive them down to Fl 52.30, the session's low. They ended Fl 1.20 off at Fl 53.60. The AEX index, upset by the Swedish rates news, slipped 0.81 to 416.81, but was up from the day's low of 413.72, on a day that saw three other major companies reporting. Philips pleased the market as it trebled second-quarter net profits, far exceeding analysts' expectations - they had been forecasting a doubling in profits. The shares added Fl 1.90 at Fl 57.80 in high volume. The results also helped its subsidiary Polygram, whose own figures had disappointed the market earlier in the week, to a gain of 10 cents at Fl 78.00. Elsevier, down Fl 2.10 at Fl 171.90, lost ground on profit-taking after posting a good set of figures and announcing a 10-for-one share split and a proposed listing on the NYSE, probably in the form of ADRs. Royal Dutch, down 80 cents at Fl 195.90, was another to disappoint the market with second-quarter results at the lower end of expectations.

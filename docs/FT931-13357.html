			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Gardening: As sterling wilts, sow seeds of British growth - The Belgian and Dutch plants which fill garden centres have shot up in price. Robin Lane Fox has a plan . . . In a sudden leap, there are flowers again, a wonderful prelude to the unpredictable dance which the seasons now work for us all. Last week, there seemed to be nothing; then, on Saturday, there were hundreds of crocuses wrapped like yellow pencils; on Sunday, there were aconites in churchyards and on Monday, snowdrops were spattering the ground once more. We are a month ahead of schedule, while the last of the winter's roses are still waiting to leave the stage and their green leaves make a curious backdrop to a new year. After weeks of gloomy rain, these early visitors stand out like drops of sunshine. They remind me that it is time for gardeners to get moving. Before they start, they will need little reminding that their art is never cheap. Mirrored in our gardens' microcosm, all economic life is reflected. Once upon a time, we used to supply ourselves, grow our own plants and pay people to help us look after them. Since the 1970s, the trade has changed as rapidly as anything in business life. Consumers want different things: busy householders will pay for shops to display plants for immediate sale; garden centres have multiplied and keen, fresh stock has become the cult of the visiting public. With their usual subtlety, sellers have traded on their two best human allies, impulse and impatience. Why wait for years when money can buy you a plant which already looks reassuringly bigger than other people's? If you like it, take it away in the car boot. Here, technology has come to the rescue. In this new age of polythene, plants can be turned out of their plastic containers at almost any season: they can also be moved from one country to another. At this point, the question of the economy and its prospects confront us all through a twist in our national idea of ourselves. We all know the stereotype: British goods may be declining; the monarchy may be intercepted on the wrong frequency, but at least we Brits know how to garden and our gardening is the envy of Europe. Tourist boards promote it; even the French have to admit that it is better than theirs; economists sometimes blame it for other sins. I have sometimes been told by serious pundits that a reason why British industry is losing its competitive edge is that employees are more interested in their gardens and that the managers are waiting every day to get back to the roses or the real business of life, so amply covered in the Weekend FT. Nobody could dispute the art of our flower gardens at their best or the widespread love of gardening, planting and growing. However, I do think that the better examples are rather rare and that visually, much of our gardening (including bits of mine) is engagingly awful. I do also notice how this national art is called 'English gardening', as if nothing of any significance happened on the Celtic fringe. If I had to choose only one public garden in the kingdom, it would always be the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, but perhaps it is too Olympian to object to the English insult. What does amuse me, and in future may alarm me, is that the backbone of the best garden centres, many of our nurseries and our garden landscaping is not actually grown in England or even in Britain. Dreamy English gardening is all very well in a summer's haze, but many of its greatest nurseries buy the plants for it in the Netherlands and Belgium. You can see why this piece of national double-think will soon have economic consequences. Personally, I will rely ever more on seeds. But the irony is not going to disappear quietly or without cost. Of course there are planty 'people' all over Britain with their own cottage industries and home-grown lists of lesser-known specimens. Yet they cannot supply the trade with much of its better shrubs, hedging plants, bulbs and border plants because they do not specialise or grow to the right scale perhaps, or, to be charitable, have such a good European soil. Whenever you see a particularly big and seductive plant in the garden centre, it is highly likely to have been imported from a Dutchman or a Belgian who would not know how to pronounce Miss Jekyll's name. This nice little irony prompts me to two conclusions, one of which is analytic, the other is commonsense. Like machine tools, the plants for Englishpersons' gardens are now being imported en masse from abroad. Many argue that Britain would have a bright economic future in heavy industry if only engineering was part of our daily culture. Those people ought to stop and consider the case of gardening. Gardening is agreed to be not just a cultural taste but a national obsession: nonetheless, our big traders and designers have to import a mass of its basic materials because their obsessive nationals cannot grow it for themselves. My second conclusion is simply prudential. Now that so many retail sources are depending on plants from Europe, their cost is not exactly going to obey the chancellor's happy predictions while the currency is suffering from wilt. Flower bulbs have already made a nonsense of the retail index because most of them come in from the Netherlands and this season's summer lilies, hyacinths and gladioli have had surcharges of 15 per cent or more imposed on them. Matters have not been helped by an awkward season in 1992 for many of the maincrop bulbs in which the Dutch, especially, excel. As for evergreen yew, box and well-grown specialities such as viburnum or witch hazel, the same price rises will soon apply wherever the retail trade has grown to depend on foreign stock. The moral, therefore, is to swap impatience for self-sufficiency and start to grow as much as possible from seeds from one's own garden and seed lists. The choice of seeds is one of the pleasures of late January and next week, I will be scanning for a short list. This year, however, it has an extra economic thrust. I have already pre-booked my seeds of regale lilies, white galtonias and mixed agapanthus. I have opted for patience with the late-flowering lespedeza whose silky leaves and rose-purple flowers are such a blessing in autumn and I will be trying for half-hardy daturas from seed. Anything the Dutch can do I can surely do half as well: from a seed packet, you always raise more than you need, with a margin of error which allows even an Englishman without illusions to compete.</p>

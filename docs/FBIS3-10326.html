Reynaldo Blanco, of the Salvadoran  Human Rights Commission [CDHES], has affirmed violations of  fundamental rights are becoming a rising trend.    [Begin Blanco recording] I must say there is an upward  trend.  We have not reached the level that existed before the peace  accords were signed. By comparing the period from the time the  peace accords were signed to date, say, comparing the first half  of 1992 with the second half of that same year, we begin to  notice, however, an increase, chiefly regarding the right to  live. [end recording]    According to Blanco, the increased violations are the result  of the impunity with which the state intelligence corps continue  to operate, despite the terms established in the peace accords;  in this respect, the CDHES representative reiterated the need  for the United Nations to keep monitoring the country.  Lutheran Bishop Medardo Gomez has concurred, saying death  squad-style human rights violations increased during recent  months.    [Begin Gomez recording] As Salvadorans can attest, people  are  found murdered in the streets everyday. Taking a closer look at  those bodies, we find they show signs of torture, something that  reveals the existence of death squads; for that reason, Mr.  Nikken is correct in saying human rights are still violated in  the country. We cannot remove the country from the list of human  rights violators. [end recording]    CDHES and the Lutheran Church stated the peace accords and  the Truth Commission recommendations should be complied with to  achieve stability in the country.</p>

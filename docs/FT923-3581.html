			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Management: Chewing over the expense account - In the latest of our series on power lunching around the world, Robert Thompson finds restraint and excess At the most powerful of all power lunches, the monthly gathering of the 29 Mitsubishi group heads, the fare is often humble 'curry rice', a gently-spiced, dun-coloured dish which is also the staple of the average office worker in a hurry. The Kinyokai, as the Mitsubishi meal is called, reflects the general restraint exercised by the Japanese executive at lunchtime, when few deals are done and the emphasis is on quick and sober consumption. Such modest daytime habits are a source of frustration for those foreign competitors who hope that luxury and decadence will undermine the Japanese work ethic. But while there may be no wine bottles on the table at lunch, after dark the picture is very different, for Japanese business people do their best networking at night. In the evening there will be as much beer, sake and whisky as the body and expense account can bear. Relationships will be lubricated in exclusive clubs after dinner guests have been jollied in the private rooms of traditional-style restaurants. With important decisions often requiring the approval of more than one executive, the back rooms allow the company the space to seat all who must reach a consensus. The real entertaining - not the novelty sampler presented to most visitors - tends to be aimed at servicing already-established links and making a contact aware of an impending deal. Indeed, the deal could even be done with a knowing nod between courses. However, there are some signs that the current lavish entertaining could be under threat. These are supposed to be tough times for executives who are taking ritual salary cuts to express their grief for plunging profits. Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Japan's largest bank, announced recently that directors would take a 5 per cent drop in pay, but an unkinder cut was the 20 per cent reduction in the entertainment budget. For a top manager in Japan, a chauffeur and fat expense account have always been the expected rewards for 35 years of dutiful service, particularly given that many executive salaries are, by western standards, modest. But now, if the anecdotes of bar owners are to be believed, instead of drinking at two or three different clubs in an evening, managers are restricting themselves to just one venue. Back at the Mitsubishi lunch table, even in the bleakest times the group's presidents could probably have champagne with their curry if they demanded it. But they appear genuinely more content with a cup of green tea or a weak coffee. A secretary charged with arranging the Mitsubishi lunches explains that the food is supposed to be consumed within 30 minutes, giving the executives about an hour to divide up the world's riches. But if participants are to be believed, the talk is as innocuous as the menu, for they say they are more likely to listen to a lecture or discuss the use of the Mitsubishi logo than corner markets or create cartels. Says the secretary: 'They don't like me to order food that's difficult for them to chew. They generally prefer something warm. They may have a bowl of noodles or rice with raw fish or sandwiches.' In most Japanese offices on most days, the lunch of champions comes in a lacquered box with quaint little compartments. The centrepiece of this boxed lunch, called an obento, could be strips of eel, sushi or a rissole, livened with shredded cabbage, pickled vegetables, a slice of a sweetish omelette, rice and a small pile of cold spaghetti. If a meeting is destined to drift into lunchtime, a Tokyo obento specialist such as Yumeya or Hisago would be called, and the lacquered boxes delivered on the back of a motorcycle. For guests, perhaps Y2,500 (Pounds 10) would be the appropriate amount to spend, while the desk-bound worker ordering his or her own would probably opt for a cheaper version with more rice and less substance. Takashi Taniguchi, manager of the Yamamaru restaurant, a favourite among business people who eat out, offers set lunches ranging from Y1,200 to Y3,500. He says one consequence of economic downturn is that bills are being split, reflecting the supposedly lower ceilings on expense accounts. The National Tax Agency reported that expense account claims last year rose a record 13 per cent. The agency's report early next year will prove the best guide to the success or otherwise of the cost-cutting campaign on the feverish evening entertaining that companies feel is necessary for the cementing of long-term business relationships.</p>

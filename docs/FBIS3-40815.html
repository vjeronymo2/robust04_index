The Union Finance Minister, Dr.  Manmohan Singh, today declined to plead guilty to the points  raised by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probing the  securities scandal with regard to his personal role as the  Finance Minister or that of the Ministry of Finance.    In his reply to the special debate in the Lok Sabha, Dr.  Singh made it clear that he was addressing the House in his  capacity as the Finance Minister and went ahead to accept full  constitutional responsibility for the actions and the area of  responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Stating that he would  not take shelter behind Constitutional niceties, he listed out  the five points on which the JPC has criticised the Finance  Minister or the Ministry in general -- failure to anticipate the  problem; failure to respond purposefully to the problem; failure  to manage the consequence of the scam; failure to apply  immediate corrective measures and failure to punish the guilty.    Prompt steps taken: Confessing that it was a  "matter of deep personal regret that the irregularities in the  misuse of funds got accentuated in the first nine months" of his  Ministership, Dr. Singh responded to the first point that as  early as July 24, 1991 he had referred to the grave weakness in  the banking and financial system of the country during the  course of his first Budget presentation. Within a month of that,  the Narasimham Committee had been set up to suggest the reforms  in the financial sector, "I was aware of the weakness in our  system. But what I was not aware of was that some people sitting  in the State Bank in Bombay were robbing the bank," he added.    The Minister also pointed out that he had also said the  Indian capital market was unregulated and that the four people  comprising the Stock Exchange division in the Finance Ministry  were neither adequate not competent to oversee the market.  Consequently, he had emphasised on granting statutory powers to  the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) which had been  set up about three years ago but had not been granted statutory  powers. By early 1992, the SEBI had been granted statutory  powers and its authority had the full backing of the Ministry,  he added.    Cell to check frauds mooted: Dr. Singh also  disclosed that in August 1991 he had sent a note to the then  Minister for Banking, pointing out that the system was prone to  frauds and that he felt it necessary that the Reserve Bank  should set up a cell to prevent frauds.    Stressing further his point that he was conscious of some  problem in the stock markets, the Minister said he had asked the  Reserve Bank to stop bank finances for investment in shares in  October 1991 and this had an effect on the market which remained  more or less stable till December. By January 1992, however, the  market had started rising again and RBI (Reserve Bank of India)  was asked to strictly enforce the ban on bank finances for  speculative purposes.    At that point, the Finance Minister asked the then Finance  Secretary to find out where the brokers were getting funds for  their activities and for this purpose the accounts of leading  brokers were scrutinised and raids conducted on Mr. Harshad  Mehta's premises on February 28, 1992. "Unfortunately, the  information procured was on floppy disks and it took time to  decipher," he added.    In early March, the RBI asked financial institution chiefs  to  see the accounts of the leading brokers and through that it was  first found out that there was some leakage from the SBI and  eventually the scam came to the notice.    On the JPC point that in his meeting with Stock Exchange  authorities in early 1992 the Finance Minister had failed to  mention the fluctuations in the market, Dr. Singh said it would  have been extremely foolish on the part of the Finance Minister  to indicate what should be the share prices. "I told them that  the behaviour of the stock markets could bring the whole process  of liberalisation to disrepute and that the Government would  relent on the powers of the SEBI," the Minister said and pointed  out that any comment by him about share prices could have led to  brokers making "millions on the exchange."    Crisis management steps: Dr. Singh also referred  to the comment about his being "in slumber" and refuted the  charge by mentioning the series of crisis-management measures he  had undertaken on becoming the Finance Minister on June 24,  1991. About the laxity in taking follow-up action too, he said  that in May 1992 the Janakiraman committee was set up which gave  its first report in one month. Within three to four days, the  Government followed up the recommendations by setting up a  Special Court in Bombay to try the offenders, handed over cases  for investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation and  sacked various bank officials from their posts.    About the foreign banks and their role in the scam, the  Minister reiterated that they would not be allowed to get away  with any violation of rules and regulations and that special  audits had been undertaken and their lapses identified. The RBI  had also set in position various measures to improve supervision  over the banks in the country, including the provision of  stricter audits.    The financial sector reforms too would ease the pressure of  banks to earn higher income through "the back door," as the  Finance Minister put it, because the new system would enable  them to earn reasonable returns through normal operations and  present acceptable balance sheets. On the other recommendations  of the JPC, the Minister promised to get back to parliament in  three months with reports of action taken on the suggestions.</p>

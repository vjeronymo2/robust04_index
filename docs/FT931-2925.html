			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Plantsbrook improves to Pounds 9m after halved interest charges PLANTSBROOK Group, the funeral services provider, raised pre-tax profits by 38 per cent from Pounds 6.55m to Pounds 9.05m in the year to December 31. Gearing fell from 75 per cent at the half year to 54 per cent, mainly because of a Pounds 10.5m rights issue and a private placing of more than Pounds 2m in December. Borrowings were Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 29m) giving halved interest payments of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 3.7m). A maintained final dividend of 2p gives a same-again total of 3p, payable from basic earnings of 6.78p (5.51p). Plantsbrook disposed of a memorial maker and six memorial retailers. It closed 52 small branches and reduced staff by 17 per cent. The group is looking for suitable acquisitions. Group turnover declined to Pounds 49.8m (Pounds 53.5m), operating profits rose to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10.2m) and margins rose to 22 per cent (19 per cent). The previously loss-making Dignity pre-paid funerals division broke even. The group's corpse rescue and repatriation business, Kenyon Emergency Services and Kenyon Air Transportation, contributed Pounds 1.5m to turnover and Pounds 500,000 to pre-tax profits. Its work included two air crashes in Katmandu and a helicopter crash in Scotland. Mr Peter Hindley, Plantsbrook's chief executive, said: 'Two years ago gearing was 400 per cent and market share was declining. We have reduced gearing and our market share is stable at about 9 per cent.' Mr Geoff Douglas, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'Mortality rates for 1993 are so far down 6 per cent but hopefully the shortfall will be clawed back.' He expects profits to reach Pounds 10m next time mainly from reduced interest charges.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday  called on the People's Republic of China to "exercise restraint  in discharging their responsibility over fearsome technology"  and to forego any further nuclear testing after the Maoist state  conducted another nuclear test at Lop Nor last 10 June.    Mr. Romulo made the call on the eve of bilateral talks  between the Philippines and China to be held today at the  Department of Foreign Affairs office. Both governments will  discuss a whole range of bilateral concerns, including Beijing's  worry on the Philippines' growing relationship with Taiwan.    "The Philippines finds this (nuclear test) extremely  unfortunate and regrettable. Last October, during the United  Nations General Assembly, the Philippines asked for a moratorium  on nuclear testing. And because China will be participating in  the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional  Forum in Bangkok this July, we will hope that they will seize  and desist from further nuclear testing in this part of the  world," Mr. Romulo said.    As a signatory to the United Nations Treaty on  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Philippines has  affirmed to all of the accord's objectives, he said.    Mr. Romulo said under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the  testing of nuclear devices should "cease forever" because it  "gravely threatens the very existence of the human family."    The 10 June incident was China's second nuclear test after  it  conducted a previous one in October last year.    Mr. Romulo said the incident will seriously undermine the  negotiations currently taking place in Geneva on a Comprehensive  Test Ban Treaty. "It also breaks the current moratorium on  nuclear testing being observed by other nuclear states," he  added.    The annual bilateral talks between Manila and Beijing will  be  chaired by Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino and  his counterpart from the Chinese foreign ministry.    The two panels are expected to discuss political and  economic  issues affecting both countries, as well as regional ones like  the forthcoming ASEAN Regional Forum where China is expected to  participate.    Mr. Romulo, declined to comment on whether Manila's concern  on China's nuclear testing will be a hotly debated topic during  the bilateral meet.    The two groups are likewise expected to tackle other issues  like the Philippines' one China policy.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Nomura to shed 1,400 jobs as part of cost-cutting plan NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest broker, will shed 1,400 staff - 10 per cent of its workforce - over the next three years and close at least half of the 18 broking 'boutiques' opened in Japanese department stores and shopping malls. The broker has broadened a cost-cutting programme intended to increase profitability after a net loss of Y8.49bn (Dollars 68.3m) during the first half, when stock brokerage commissions fell by 39.6 per cent and the value of stocks underwritten was 77.4 per lower. A continuing fall in retail investment has prompted Nomura to close or plan to close nine of its 18 'boutiques', which were opened to make investment more convenient for shoppers. The future of the remaining nine sub-branches is apparently under review. These boutiques, opened during the late 1980s, are also on the cost-cutting list of other leading brokers. Yamaichi Securities, which had a net loss of Y15.8bn for the first half, has closed all 10 of the sub-branches established since the Finance Ministry approved the concept in 1985. Nomura also plans to cut computer system spending by 20 per cent over the next three years, and has asked staff to reduce general expenses, including entertainment and transport costs, by 20 per cent in this half. General expenses were supposed to be 5 per cent lower during the first half. The reduction of 1,400 jobs will be done by cutting the annual intake of graduates and by not replacing general staff who retire or resign. Nomura said yesterday that none of its employees in Japan would be sacked. Cutting staff and computer expenses is in stark contrast to the industry trend of the late 1980s, when companies installed computer networks able to handle a share trading volume far in excess of their needs in the 1990s. Daily share turnover on the Tokyo exchange last month was about a fifth of the 1988 level. Nomura has already announced a lowering of its international profile. The broker recently cut 35 staff from its London operations and closed three continental European offices.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE  </P> <P> For 10 years I have watched in frustration as the Republicans (for the most  part) smeared the Democrats with negative campaign advertisements.  </P> <P> Now it appears that the Democrats are going to employ the same disgusting  tactics on each other. How delightful it is to face another election in which  none of the candidates are worthy of my vote.  </P> <P> One would hope that citizens of good conscience would refrain from voting for a  candidate who employs such ads. Unfortunately, the wicked are usually elected  anyway.  </P> <P> PAUL E. STEVENSON  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

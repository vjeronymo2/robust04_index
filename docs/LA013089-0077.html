			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> John H. Cleveland of Washington became the second Teamsters vice president to  resign, clearing the way for him to be dropped as a defendant in a government  racketeering case. The action by Cleveland and Robert H. Holmes, a vice  president in Detroit, was part of an agreement with the Justice Department,  said Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in New York.  Corley said the agreement would be submitted for court approval. Holmes'  resignation was announced as Teamsters leaders met in Washington to discuss a  government proposal to settle the racketeering case. Cleveland made no public  announcement of his resignation, but a union source confirmed Corley's account.  The union rejected the settlement.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Joyce Russi] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The PT [Workers Party] yesterday asked  the Federal Supreme Court [STF] to declare the electoral law  that forbids parties and candidates from receiving donations  from labor unions as unconstitutional. The PT wants the STF to  declare the law unconstitutional, alleging that it contradicts  the principle of equality because it does not forbid companies  from contributing to the campaigns of parties or candidates of  their liking.    The petition pertains to Paragraph 6, Article 45 of Law No.  8713/93. The PT's decision to question the mentioned law follows  an incident a week ago involving PT presidential candidate Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva, against whom charges have been filed for  having campaigned outside factories in Sao Bernard do Campo  using the public address truck of the metal workers union of the  Sao Paulo ABC industrial region.    The PT does not like the fact that it can speak to a group  of  businessmen in the auditorium of the Sao Paulo State Federation  of Industries (FIESP) but cannot address a group of workers  using their labor union public address truck.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz by Xavier </F> Batalla in Budapest; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Batalla] Mr. President,  four years ago, after the fall of the Communist regime, the  Hungarians were enthusiastic about the West. Now, the Hungarian  prime minister has referred to a five- or six-year period for  joining the European Union (EU), but Community sources continue  to speak of a longer delay. Could this stance create a critical  attitude to the EU in Hungary?    [Goncz] I believe that the criticism must be placed in the  background; first comes necessity. I agree with the prime  minister -- namely, with the five- or six-year period for  joining the EU -- but no one could say that what we have  received is little. We never expected subsidies; rather,  assistance to modernize our economy, and, in return, we offer  the West a market. Unfortunately, because of the economic  recession, this process is slower than expected.    [Batalla] Do you trust in the Spanish Government's support  to join the EU?    [Goncz] It is absolutely essential. I am going to raise the  matter (on the visit to Spain), but I am aware that I am  knocking at an open door, because over the past two years there  have been Spanish statements in favor of our stance. The  reservations which may exist in Spain stem from agricultural  issues, but the apprehensions seem to have diminished.    [Batalla] But while Hungary is seeking to open the EU's  doors, those of NATO have been closed to it. How do you  interpret the Partnership for Peace? Do you believe that it is  a new Yalta, another division of Europe?    [Goncz] To put it in those terms is rather exaggerated. I  do not believe that they wish to exclude us from NATO. There is  a certain feeling of anxiety in NATO because it has not yet  defined its role in the new European system, and I believe that  it has become somewhat alarmed at the responsibility of coping  with the security of so vast an area. Therefore the Partnership  for Peace is a very important step to guarantee European  security.    [Batalla] But do you believe that the aim announced by  President Clinton of preventing another wall from being erected  in Europe will be achieved in this way?    [Goncz] I hope so.    [Batalla] That is, you do not interpret the Partnership for  Peace as a concession to Russia.    [Goncz] Obviously there are signs that, following the change  which has occurred in Russia, the Western powers are trying not  to provoke Moscow, and so the Russian attitude also influences  NATO's decisons. It must not be forgotten that this part of  Europe is an intermediate area between Germany and Russia, and  if I say that Russia is neither Asia nor Europe but Russia, we  have the responsibility of trying to attract Russia as close as  possible to Europe, but in view of the internal situation in  Russia, the central European countries' entry (into NATO) could  be necessary at any time.    [Batalla] So do you fear Russian nationalism?    [Goncz] I do not fear nationalism, but I observe it with  concern. However, I do not believe that it could stimulate  Hungarian nationalism either on the right or on the left. I  trust that the Russian process of change will continue.    [Batalla] But in Budapest there are those who believe that  the Partnership for Peace is -- like 1938 (Munich), 1956  (Budapest), and 1968 (Prague) -- further proof that the West is  not prepared to die for central Europe. Do you agree with this  opinion?    [Goncz] Thank God, now it (the West) does not have to die  for these countries. And let me say that this criticism is made  more frequently in the Western press than in the Hungarian press.    [Batalla] Then how do you explain Hungary's change of  attitude to Serbia? Why has Budapest softened its attitude to  Belgrade, as is clear from a visit by the Hungarian foreign  minister, in return for guarantees concerning the Hungarian  community of Voivodina?    [Goncz] The economic embargo against Serbia is costing  Hungary a very great deal, and we have strictly observed the  international sanctions. So far we have received over 70,000  refugees -- many of them of Hungarian origin -- from Bosnia and  Serbia. And from the practical viewpoint, we would not be  opposed to easing sanctions, if the UN demands are accepted,  because what they are doing is to increase the misery -- not  resolving the military conflict. Nor must it be forgotten that  around 400,000 Hungarians and around 200,000 Serbian refugees  live in Voivodina (an autonomous region of Serbia). I believe  that it could be of great assistance to Europe that the  representative of the Hungarian minority in Voivodina negotiated  with Serbian President Milosevic two weeks ago. And so I would  not say that we are being softer but that we are in favor of  talking. We will not act unilaterally as far as reviewing  sanctions is concerned, but -- I emphasize -- this atttitude is  a sign of change not only on Hungary's part but also on Serbia's  part.    [Batalla] How could the Yugoslav conflict affect the issue  of the Hungarian minorities outside Hungary? Do you deem  possible a conflict with the neighboring countries in which  Hungarian minorities live?    [Goncz] If by conflict you mean war, I do not believe so,  but if you are asking whether we are concerned about the fate of  these Hungarian minorities, we will indeed be concerned until an  international agreement laying down each side's responsibilities  is reached.    [Batalla] Does Budapest have any territorial claim to the  regions with Hungarian minorities?    [Goncz] The history of Transylvania (Romania) or Slovakia  cannot be understood without the Hungarians, who have lived  there for 900 years. We do not wish to change the borders, but  we want these minorities to be able to preserve their  identities. Any minority is always a part of two systems -- the  motherland and the country in which it lives. If we decide that  Catalonia is a constituent element of Spain, Catalonia is  obliged to have two kinds of loyalty -- to Spain and to  Catalonia. As far as irredentism is concerned, 6 million  Romanians and 2.5 million Hungarians live in Transylvania.  Nobody can believe that we would want to have 6 million  Romanians within our borders.    [Batalla] Hungary has experienced a major transformation  since 1990. But, with a view to the elections on 8 May, polls  indicate a strong advance by the Socialist Party (formerly  communist). Do you believe that the social discontent of part  of the electorate with the pace of change could benefit the  former communists, as has happened in Lithuania and Poland?    [Goncz] We are talking about the Socialist Party, which was  originally created by ex-communists who support reform, which  currently identifies itself with social democracy, and which has  for the last four years been working in parliament as a  democratic party. But in any case, I believe that two  possibilities could arise from the elections: either a  conservative-liberal coalition or a socialist-liberal coalition.  One thing is clear, and I can guarantee it: Hungary's  positions on the economy and on foreign policy are not going to  change in either case.</p>

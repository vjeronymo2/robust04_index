			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Accountants seek merger agreement Partners of BDO Binder Hamlyn met yesterday in a bid to reach consensus over a proposal to merge the eighth biggest UK accountancy firm with its larger rival, Arthur Andersen. It was expected that senior partners supporting the deal would try to persuade five regional offices opposing the merger to change their minds. Last week Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and the partnership covering London and Leeds all expressed support for the idea of a merger, proposed by Andersen last month. These four represent more than two-thirds of Binder's total partners and more than 70 per cent of its staff and fee income. The partnerships opposed to the deal are Scotland, East Anglia, Northern Ireland, Bristol, Poole, Nottingham and Wolverhampton.</p>

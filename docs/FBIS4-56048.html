			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["mh"-signed report: "According to Prime Minister Moravcik, </F> the Abolition of the Screening Law Is Out of the Question"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava -- [passage omitted] Asked by SME  about his course of action regarding the request to have members  of the coalition government screened, Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik replied that at present he cannot ask the Slovak  Information Service [SIS] to issue screening certificates for  government members because it would constitute an illegal act.  Even though the prime minister had requested screenings, he did  so on the basis of material law [hmotny zakon]. "After we  realized that the procedural conditions had not been met, we  agreed that the screening certificates would not be issued,"  Jozef Moravcik said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Actively and Properly Develop the </F> Land Market"]    [Text] Today we hail the arrival of the fourth "Land Day."  The theme of "Land Day" this year is "land and market."    As an element of production simultaneously boasting the duel  properties of resource and asset, land is of particularly vital  significance to social and economic development in China. Over  the past few years, along with the establishment and development  of a socialist market economic structure, and impelled by the  land use structural reform, China's land market has grown out of  nothing and has gradually taken shape. In some key cities of  the developed regions, its development has been even faster.  Land, having been sluggish for a long time, began to be  enlivened as an important element of production, and the right  to use it began its compensatory flow as a special commodity  between owner and user and among users. The proportion of land  transferred through the market rather than administrative  allocation is increasingly larger.    The formation and development of the land market with  compensatory use of land as its core content has played a  vigorous role of promotion in China in such aspects as effecting  rational allocation of land resources, increasing government  financial revenues, accelerating urban construction, developing  secondary and tertiary industries, improving the investment  environment, absorbing foreign capital, and so on. The  formation and development of the land market is the product of  China's economic structural reform on the one hand, and has  energetically pushed forward other related in-depth reforms on  the other. For example, the achievements attained in the  structural reforms in planning, banking, housing, and farm land,  as well as in the establishment of a modern enterprise system  and the invigoration of large and medium-sized state  enterprises, for which the entire people, from top to bottom,  have shown great concern, are all closely related to the reform  of the land use system and the construction and cultivation of  the land market. The newly emerging land market in China has  become part and parcel of the socialist market economic  structure.    In the meantime, we should also soberly note that the time  for reforming China's land use system is short, and the problems  left over from the old land use system are numerous. The land  market is still in a growing and shaping stage, so it is  immature and has yet to be standardized. Therefore, it is  unavoidable that some problems exist, though they should not be  neglected. Take, for example, the phenomena of giving  overlapping approval of land and of approving land ultra vires  in violation of the law, which have emerged in some localities  in large multitude. Market transparency is low, administrative  interventions are excessively numerous, and there is a tendency  of unstandardized development in the land market. A  considerable portion of organizations and individuals engaging  in land development and operation have not conducted normal  market trading activities in accordance with laws and  regulations. On the other hand, they have been keen on  speculation in land and projects in order to reap exorbitant  profits, which has stimulated the speculative activities in land  and intervened in the normal order of the land market. In  addition, the land supply plan has not been carried out  conscientiously, the land taxation system has yet to be  straightened out, the building of the law regarding the land  market is in urgent need of augmentation, and the unified  management structure of land should be further enhanced.    The above problems indicate that while positively pushing  forward and cultivating the land market, we should also make  necessary preparations in structure, policy, and law in order to  positively and properly cultivate the land market. Only by so  doing can the building of the land market in China advance to a  healthy and smooth orbit. With regard to the problems existing  in the development of the land market, the party Central  Committee and State Council have taken them very seriously, have  issued to lower levels a series of relevant policies and  documents since the latter half of 1992, and have taken the  standardization of the land market as a major aspect of  macroeconomic regulation and control. After nearly a year of  rectification of these problems the land market has been  standardized to some extent. In spite of this, some deep-rooted  problems in the development of the land market still have to be  resolved through the in-depth reform of the land use system and  the cultivation and standardization of the land market.    An important issue at present is the necessity to work hard  to expedite the building of a socialist land market system and  to form a standardized and perfect land market as quickly as  possible. In addition, it is necessary to further increase the  intensity of allocating land resources by way of the market  mechanism, increase the proportion of land supplied via the  modes of selling by tender and auction, and tighten the  management of land which was allocated previously; to bring into  full play the role of regulation and control in planning,  banking, taxation, and other means, and put into effect the  macroeconomic regulation and control of the land market; and to  intensify the management of land prices, perfect the land price  assessment system, improve and amplify the land registration  system as quickly as possible, and institute a sound legal  system in the land market. Moreover, it is necessary to further  reinforce the in-depth structural reform of land management in a  bid to suit the requirements of the ever-growing land market  construction. Governments at all levels and pertinent  functional departments should pay serious attention to and  coordinate with one another closely in performing the above  tasks well, so that China's land market will head for maturity  at an early date on an open, fair, just, orderly, and  standardized basis.</p>

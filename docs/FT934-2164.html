			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Trafalgar House loses Pounds 347m: Rights issue to raise Pounds 404m - Charges total Pounds 468m / 1p payout this year Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar House, yesterday described the group's Pounds 425m rights issue and placing as a 'fresh start' for the troubled conglomerate that posted a pre-tax loss of Pounds 347.2m in the year to September 30. The loss, which compares with a restated pre-tax deficit of Pounds 11.2m, was struck after the group recorded exceptional charges totalling Pounds 397.3m (Pounds 97.3m), comprising asset write-downs, property provisions and rationalisation costs. Shares in Trafalgar, which has interests ranging from engineering and construction to London's Ritz Hotel and the Cunard liners, fell by 10p to close at 77 1/2 p yesterday. Mr Keswick, who is also chairman of Hongkong Land Holdings, which holds a 25.3 per cent stake in Trafalgar, said the Pounds 404m net proceeds of the 1-for-3 convertible preference share issue and placing would provide the group with 'a strong and transparent balance sheet'. The Pounds 70m placing was designed to attract new institutional investors to the group. 'It is all part of starting afresh,' he said. Hongkong Land, which has already invested about Pounds 200m in its Trafalgar equity stake, said it planned to take up its full entitlement at a cost of about Pounds 90m. It would also apply for additional shares under the placing. The announcements underline the degree to which Hongkong Land dominates Trafalgar's new management team, which took over from Sir Nigel Broackes, the former chairman, and Sir Eric Parker, former chief executive, last year. In addition to Mr Keswick, Hongkong Land's four board representatives include Mr David Gawler as finance director. Mr Keswick insisted that the extensive write-downs and provisions did not represent a 'kitchen sink' approach to the accounts. He described them as 'just normal prudent accounting'. The new board's review of the balance sheet led to write-downs and provisions of Pounds 330.7m, including provisions announced at the interim stage of Pounds 100m. Asset write-downs charged to revaluation reserves added Pounds 39.8m. A change in accounting policy on capitalising finance charges added Pounds 30.6m to exceptional items, rationalisation programmes Pounds 65.3m and directors' compensation payments Pounds 1.3m. The charges totalled Pounds 467.7m. Although substantial property and other provisions had been expected, some elements were a surprise - for instance, Pounds 42.1m for its ill-fated Emerald oil rig, Pounds 22.3m for group properties and Pounds 17.5m to cover early repayment of costly debt. Over all these charges swamped the group's Pounds 77.5m of operating profits, down from Pounds 126.8m. Turnover was flat at Pounds 3.88bn. The 47.6p loss per share compares with a 12.2p loss. A final dividend of 2p makes a total of 3.25p, against 6p. However, shareholders were told to expect a total of not more than 1p for the current year.

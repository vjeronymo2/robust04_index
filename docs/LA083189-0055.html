			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEWS;  </P> <P> REFORM COMES TOO LATE FOR ANATOLY MARCHENKO  </P> <P> To Live Like Everyone by Anatoly Marchenko, translated by Paul Goldberg (Henry  Holt: $19.95, 220 pages)  </P> <P> Perestroika came too late for Anatoly Marchenko.  </P> <P> On Dec. 8, 1986, after nearly 30 years in and out of the Gulag, Marchenko died  in Christopol Prison, where he was serving a 15-year term for the crime of  writing a book. Now we can read the book that cost Marchenko his life -- "To  Live Like Everyone" is the anguished cry of a man condemned by his own nature  to tell the truth, and condemned by fate to spend his life in a place where the  truth is a criminal offense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life on the Run  </P> <P> "To Live Like Everyone" is Marchenko's account of life on the run for a man  whose restless conscience and dark vision make him an outcast and a wanderer.  "To this day, I am convinced that suffering only begins after release from the  camps," he writes. "Spending three days in the same place without an internal  residency permit is a violation of passport rules. Three such violations, and  it's back on trial and back to the camps. That's the vicious circle: the law  says, get a residency permit, but the militia refuses to issue it, knowingly  and deliberately making you a criminal."  </P> <P> Born in 1938, Marchenko was a true proletarian, a child of the working poor  that still exist in the the worker's state. His father was one of the mazutniki  ("greasers") who worked on the railroads: "Black industrial fuel literally  dripped off their clothing," Marchenko recalls. "They stewed in it." His  childhood home was one room in a barracks somewhere along the Trans-Siberian  railroad -- and Marchenko, it seems, stewed in it.  </P> <P> Marchenko introduces us to the contemporary underclass of the Soviet Union, the  dead souls who are released from prison only to find themselves a different  kind of servitude on the outside. The scenes of the bleak Soviet provincial  towns where Marchenko grew up, and where he sought to make a life, are faintly  Dickensian, but wholly devoid of charm: a hellish brick factory where former  camp inmates spend half their days hauling bricks and the rest of the time atop  the brick ovens, which is their only home; a bread-baking plant where each man  must hump sacks of flour from grain elevator to bakery, 10 tons per man during  each shift.  </P> <P> He depicts life in the remote villages and outposts of Siberia as an  unrelenting horror story. A 3-year-old girl disappears in the forest, and the  townsfolk blame her death on "the religious fanatics." A man falls down drunk  in the snow and stays there until his arms are frostbitten; now he's a  double-amputee who frightens children with is "black stumps." A plane crashes  near a surveyor's outpost; the residents ignore the cries of an infant who  survived the crash, and loot the corpses: "The infant soon froze to death,"  reports Marchenko. "The crying stopped."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kindred Spirits  </P> <P> When, at last, Marchenko finds his way to Moscow, he discovers kindred spirits  in the intelligentsia, a class that he had been taught to despise. "In all, we  equated the people of intellectual professions with authority, the 'bosses.'  And what's there to love the bosses for? They are the haves who want to pay the  have-nots as little as they can and charge them as much as they can," he writes  of his peasant upbringing.  </P> <P> But it is the intelligentsia of Moscow that gives this angry man a weapon of  enormous and enduring power -- the typewriter and carbon-paper publishing  apparatus of samizdat, the underground self-publishing movement of the Soviet  Union. Soon Marchenko is in trouble with the KGB again, but now he has  comrades, a cause, and -- crucially -- a byline that reaches out of the Gulag  and all the way to the West.  </P> <P> Marchenko does not come across as an especially heroic or likable man; he  possesses the kind of insistent and unforgiving conscience that gets on the  nerves of the complacent and the comfortable, whether in enslaved countries or  free ones. But we begin to see that a man like Marchenko is especially  maddening to those who remember, with a sigh of regret, the days when the great  and small feared the knock on the door at midnight.  </P> <P> "Live like everyone!" a KGB agent rails at Marchenko. "Stop throwing mud at the  good name of the Motherland! . . . All of you scream, 'This is no better than  Stalin!' Let me ask you this. What do you think would be left of you if we were  no better than Stalin?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Years After Death  </P> <P> There's an irony, of course, to the fact that Marchenko died before the advent  of Gorbachev and glasnost. Today, barely three years after Marchenko's death in  prison, a fellow dissident sits in the Soviet parliament and is free to write  the preface to the American edition of "To Live Like Everyone." Marchenko,  observes Andrei Sahkarov, is one of those "people of immaculate honesty who are  prepared to make any sacrifice in the name of moral principles."  </P> <P> Yet I suspect that Marchenko would be wary of the remarkable changes in the  practices of Soviet power. Mindful of what he darkly refers to as "the  peculiarities of the path of our historical development and our 'national  traditions,' " Marchenko warns: "Lawful actions of today could be the criminal  offenses of tomorrow. . . . In this country no one -- and nothing -- is  forgotten."  </P></p>

This decision has paved the way for a Common  Agreement which, at the time of writing, was imminent. Under  the co-decision-making process resulting from the Maastricht  Treaty, the European Parliament must give its agreement to the  Council's decision in order that the Fourth Framework will  become a legal reality.    The Belgian Presidency can be satisfied that it has, by and  large, ensured agreement on the new research programme under its  Presidency. This was its declared aim as far as R&amp;D was  concerned.    The significance of the achievement can be judged by the  budget agreed to which, at 12 billion ECUs, comes close enough  to the Commission's proposed budget of 13.1 billion ECUs. In  addition, the terms of the Council Agreement also provides for  an assessment, by 30 June 1996 at the latest, to determine  whether an extra one billion ECUs can be provided, depending on  prevailing economic and other circumstances at that time. This  formed the basis of the compromise engineered by the Belgians.    The Ministers also agreed on a formula for sharing the  overall budget out among the different activities and specific  programmes. They also agreed to a budget of 875 million ECUs for  the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The Commission's original  proposal called for just over one billion ECUs. The issue of  how much of the JRC's work should be exposed to open competition  was however left undecided.    The Presidency advocated a figure of 16.5 percent while  Antonio Ruberti, the EC Commissioner for Research, favoured  something of the order of 17-20 percent. He thought that  exposing the JRC to the open market was positive, believing that  it would improve the standard of its work and promote  cooperation with other European research laboratories.    The Ministers essentially stood by the agreement taken at  the  Summit meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels  on 10-11 December, which made provision for a budget of 12  billion ECUs which could be raised to 13 billion ECUs by means  of the reserve fund.    In principle then, 5.9 billion ECUs should be available  between 1994-1996, with the remainder, 6.1 billion ECUs set  aside for 1997-1998.    Regarding the sharing out of the Framework's budget,  Ministers have increased the amount for the research programmes  (activity 1) by 0.5 percent. This has been drawn from activity  4 (international cooperation). 0.5 percent has also been added  to the energy research programme, most of this being used to pay  for carrying out inspection work at nuclear power plants in  Central and Eastern Europe.    Information technologies/communications has been increased  from 15.65 percent to 16.10 percent; however, that for  communications technologies has been reduced from 5.70 percent  to 5.25 percent. Life Sciences: The sum for biomedical research  has been cut by 0.10 percent, benefitting agriculture and  fisheries research, which has had its budget increased from 5.6  percent to 5.7 percent.    Energy: The percentage for non-nuclear energy has been  increased from 8 to 8.2 percent as well as the percentage  intended to improve safety conditions for nuclear fission (from  3.15 to 3.45 percent).    The Fourth Framework is divided up into four areas of  activity:    -- First Activity (Research, Technological Development and  Demonstration Programmes);    -- Second Activity (Cooperation with Third Countries and  International Organisations);    -- Third Activity (Dissemination and Application of  Results);    -- Fourth Activity (Stimulation of the Training and Mobility  of Researchers).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 7 (AFP) -- A team of 11 UN  observers and liaison officers arrived in the eastern Bosnian  Moslem enclave of Gorazde Thursday, a United Nations spokesman  said.    UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink  said eight armed UNPROFOR officers and three unarmed military  observers had reached the enclave, where more than 60 people are  reported to have died since a Bosnian Serb offensive began 10  days ago.    The team, which set out from Sarajevo, was stopped by Serb  forces at Rogatica, around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from  Gorazde, the spokesman said.    They were held up for several hours for administrative  formalities despite having received all necessary authorisation,  Annink said.</p>

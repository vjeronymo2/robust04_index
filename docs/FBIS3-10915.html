			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Taynem Hernandez] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Colombian Ambassador to Venezuela Alberto  Casas Santamaria denied relations between the two countries  would change after the Colombian presidential elections or as a  result of President Rafael Caldera's policies. The diplomat, who  participated in a news conference held by the  Colombian-Venezuelan Integration Chamber to announce the  Binational Investors Conference to be held next week in Caracas,  said: "The candidates with the best changes have already said  they will more or less continue the same policies towards  Venezuela."    Colombian presidential elections will be held on 8 May, when  the two leading candidates, Ernesto Samper, candidate of the  ruling Liberal Party, and Andres Pastrana, candidate for the  Conservative Party, will face each other. Meanwhile,  parliamentary elections are scheduled for Sunday.    Casas Santamaria said his government is also confident  President Caldera will not change Venezuelan policy towards his  country, which the president and the finance and foreign  ministers have also confirmed. In fact, the ambassador also  announced the possibility of a binational ministers' meeting to  discuss the border issue, which he called "the most complicated  problem in relations between Venezuela and Colombia."    Concerning increased trade between the two countries, Casas  Santamaria reaffirmed Colombia's pledge to continue the policies  and norms that have encouraged a trade increase, and he appeared  optimistic about the possibility that Colombian investments will  increase significantly this year compared to 1992. In this  regard, members of the Colombian-Venezuelan Integration Chamber  estimated that $2 billion will be negotiated this year, which  would represent a 25 percent increase compared to 1993, when  $1.6 billion were negotiated.    According to business estimates, this increase will be  attributable to an increase in oil services and construction  trade. Regarding oil services, Colombia is planning an  aggressive oil production program which will allow the  possibility of investment by Venezuelan companies. Therefore,  the investment possibilities in Colombia will diversify.  Colombia received $63 million in Venezuelan capital during 1993,  primarily used in financial and insurance areas,  metal-mechanics, marketing, and the distribution of Venezuelan  products in Colombia. Moreover, the Colombian industry injected  almost $6 million in Venezuela's computer, lumber, and  automobile sectors.    The main objective of the Colombian-Venezuelan Investors  Conference will be to evaluate the results of two years of  integration, as of this month, and to study new investment  opportunities in the two countries, particularly joint ventures  in some binational projects.</p>

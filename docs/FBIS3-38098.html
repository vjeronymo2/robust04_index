			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe February 26 TASS -- Lieutenant-General  Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of Russian Border Troops in  Tajikistan, made a statement on Saturday concerning the growing  number of armed provocations from the Afghan territory.    Tajik opposition militants shell both Tajik villages and  Russian border posts, says the document circulated by the  Information Directorate of the Tajik Foreign Ministry.    For instance, the border village of Parvar, Shuroabad  District, which is in the area of operations of the 12th Border  Post, Moskovskiy sector, was shelled with rockets for over 40  minutes on February 21.    The eighth border post, Pyandzh River sector, was shelled  from trench mortars on the night of February 18. As a result,  one Russian guard was killed. There are enough facts indicating  that similar provocations are being hatched at other sections of  the Tajik-Afghan border.    Taking into account the fact that Afghan authorities have no  real possibilities to control and prevent these piratic actions  and mindful of repeated statements made by the Tajik Government  on its right to take resolute retaliatory measures, I must say  that all weapons opening fire across the border will be  immediately destroyed in future with the use of all types of  arms in the possession of border troops.    The statement stresses that field commanders of Afghan  Mujahideen can understand possible consequences of such  artillery duels which will only add privations and sufferings to  the defenceless population of Afghan border regions.    The general expressed hope that the well-being of their  fellow countrymen is worth of bridling the presumptuous  chieftains of Tajik armed opposition who do not give a farthing  for the life of Afghan citizens providing shelter to them.    "I hope for mutual understanding from leaders caring for  their people and am ready to conduct a dialogue within my  competence at all levels," the statement concludes.</p>

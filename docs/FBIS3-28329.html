With regard to a source to finance the proposed tax cuts,  Chairman Murayama indicated that a consultative body should be  set up to make a decision on this issue while watching the  economic trend.    [Begin Murayama recording] A consultative body has to be set  up to decide on a revenue source for implementing tax cuts, and  it is necessary to watch the economic situation after economic  pump priming measures are taken. In line with discussion on  administrative reform, a welfare vision, and other issues, a  decision should be made on how to cover the cost of the proposed  tax cuts. [end recording]    Chairman Murayama said such a view is basically the same as  views of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Democratic Socialist  Party. He indicated that it would be possible to reach an  accord if the ruling parties make no bones about the timing for  making the decision at the proposed consultative body.  Moreover, Chairman Murayama reiterated his criticism of the  idea of introducing the National Welfare Tax. He indicated that  the SDPJ for its part intends to demand that a pension-oriented  tax be introduced to finance basic pensions.</p>

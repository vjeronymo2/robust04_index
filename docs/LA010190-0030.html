			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASSENGERS CHEER, CLAP AS PANAMA AIRPORT REOPENS;  </P> <P> TRAVEL: THE FIRST COMMERCIAL FLIGHT SINCE THE INVASION ARRIVES. THE U.S. ARMY  RETAINS A STRONG PRESENCE.  </P> <P> With tears, clapping and shouts of "Viva Panama!" passengers made an emotional  return to Panama on Sunday morning on the first commercial flight to enter  since U.S. troops invaded and ousted strongman Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> "We made it. Long live Panama!" yelled one woman who joined some 200 passengers  in wild clapping and cheering as Eastern Airlines Flight 4977 touched down.  </P> <P> "Panama is so beautiful, so beautiful," she repeated over and over.  </P> <P> Another woman, unable to contain her emotions, could do nothing but sob.  </P> <P> "I feel great. This is incredible," said one Panamanian businessman who has  lived in self-exile in the United States since March, 1988. He said he will  stay only a week now but plans to move back to Panama with his family by the  end of 1990.  </P> <P> Though all of the passengers interviewed said they were relieved that Noriega  was ousted, many were nervous about criticizing him, and all asked not to  quoted by name.  </P> <P> Omar Torrijos International Airport, named after Panama's previous leader, has  been transformed by the invasion.  </P> <P> The Panama Defense Forces, which under Noriega took over control of the ports  and customs and immigration services, had exercised absolute control over the  facility, lending it a sometimes sinister atmosphere.  </P> <P> Passengers known for their opposition to Noriega were in the past forced off  planes by members of the PDF, harassed as they passed through immigration or  denied re-entry. Journalists were sometimes detained and interrogated by  suspicious PDF officers.  </P> <P> On Sunday, travelers reacted with pleasure as heavily armed U.S. troops offered  New Year's greetings and the country's new civilian director of immigration  welcomed them to "our new Panama."  </P> <P> Jose Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic Party, was  cheered when he introduced himself as the new immigration head and welcomed the  flight.  </P> <P> Chen acknowledged that although immigration is now run by civilians, the  airport remains under U.S. military control.  </P> <P> "This is a military zone," he told passengers. "The U.S. Army is in control  here."  </P> <P> The airport had been a principal target of U.S. forces when their invasion was  launched Dec. 20.  </P> <P> U.S. troops brought the airport under control after heavy fighting, and a  hostage standoff was defused when U.S. forces persuaded Panamanian troops to  release two American women, saying Noriega had been captured.  </P> <P> On Sunday, as the first commercial flight arrived, there was still evidence of  a strong U.S. military presence.  </P> <P> Armed servicemen met passengers at the door of the airplane. Others were  stationed throughout the main terminal. Jeeps full of soldiers were stationed  along the runways, and a U.S. military helicopter hovered nearby while the  Eastern aircraft taxied to the terminal.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVING FRYMAN CANYON  </P> <P> The Sierra Club has suggested that Fryman Canyon be a monument in order to  preserve this unique piece of the Santa Monica Mountains' natural history,  which contributed to the specific cultural history of the area in which this  canyon exists.  </P> <P> The people of our city have a right to access our cultural history in  monuments, as well as books, and the city recognized this almost 20 years ago,  for example, when Stoney Point Outcroppings in north Chatsworth was designated  due to its being "one of the most picturesque areas in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> This site is analogous to a giant redwood grove. Has familiarity blinded us? Is  this one-of-a-kind remnant of our mountains' past natural state not worthy of  our concern and protection? Or shall we guide it to extinction?  </P> <P> SUSAN GENELIN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAD ABOUT THE MOVIES;  </P> <P> PEOPLE IN MANY L.A. NEIGHBORHOODS ARE UP IN ARMS OVER THE INTRUSIONS OF FILM  CREWS. A FEW ARE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO MAKE THE MOGULS PAY.  </P> <P> In the weeks preceding the outbreak of hostilities, the art gallery had gone  through video hell.  </P> <P> The gallery is in Los Angeles' industrial downtown, a neighborhood so favored  by TV and movie makers for its all-purpose gritty-slummy-New Yorky-Philly look  that film companies have been known to arrive there of a morning to find other  film companies setting up at the far end of the same block.  </P> <P> Almost every week had brought another filmmaker to the gallery's doorstep,  another caravan of vans and trailers and equipment trucks. The crew filming  "The Doors." The crew shooting a commercial -- they wouldn't let a staffer  cross the street to open for business until their shot was finished. The Disney  company making "Filofax." In pique, some local slipped Disney its own Mickey: a  sketch on a cinder-block wall of Mickey about to become mousemeat via a bullet  from an automatic pistol.  </P> <P> So it was that when a music video crew from Squeak Productions showed up  unawares one recent morning, sentiment among some at the nonprofit multimedia  gallery had reached critical mass. Hot words ensued over how long this would  take, over whether the crew could film the building, over a car scraped by a  film trolley, over music that could be heard inside the brick-walled offices.  </P> <P> At last, one staffer simply stood in front of the camera: by executive producer  Pam Tarr's account, to demand money; by his account, to stop the filming until  he could get questions answered. By the time filming ended, $300 had changed  hands, for the homeless writers' coalition, the gallery employee said. "The  money isn't the point," the man said. "I'd rather they move elsewhere" and not  impede the life of the neighborhood. If they won't, they "should leave  something behind for the people most affected," like the homeless.  </P> <P> Tarr's small company tries to be "as courteous and cooperative as we can be. .  . . If we had any idea how upset they would be, we would not have shot there."  However laudable the charity, the $300 hurt: "Sometimes we feel like whenever  we shoot, Paramount Pictures has been there the day before with $10,000 petty  cash to throw around."  </P> <P> Lights, camera, action -- reaction.  </P> <P> Something about filmmaking stirs up a cinematic "not in my back yard" syndrome.  In the town that made movies, and was all but made by them, film crews can feel  as unwanted as fill dirt from Chernobyl. Los Angeles cohabits with a beloved  monster of an industry that does not always operate tidily behind factory  walls. Resenting glitzkrieg invasions, town after town and neighborhood after  neighborhood lays down rules and hikes up fees. Long Beach charges $250 for a  film permit, $400 a day to shoot in the city, and $200 an hour for filming on  city property. Beverly Hills, not known for coming cheap on anything, charges  $759 a day, and a $125 business tax. Manhattan Beach, $1,500 a day.  </P> <P> That makes Los Angeles a bargain, and a draw. With a $130 permit, the right  insurance and policing, you can film all day in the mayor's office for $250.  You couldn't film a shoeshine stand for that. So movie makers are at City Hall  at least once a week, passing it off as Congress or the Vatican or San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Yet City Hall, disinclined to so much as ruffle the feathers of the golden  egg-laying movie goose, now wants a bit more order in its own corridors, "to  exert a little more control over the situation," said Charles Weisenberg,  director of the city's motion picture and television affairs office. Garage  worker Eddie Santillan has heard that the mayor, driving out of the garage,  complains that they can't see the traffic for the movie vans nosed along the  street.  </P> <P> * The view from the canvas chair:  </P> <P> Film companies feel blackmailed by scams and greedheads. They're visible, their  shooting schedules leave them vulnerable, and from the weekly take from  "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" some people think anyone with a camera is rich.  </P> <P> LAPD Traffic Officer Tim Wienckowski has worked for years on movie security. At  a filming for Fox-TV's "The Outsiders" at a San Fernando Valley construction  site, a workman ostentatiously revved up a chain saw. The crew objected. I tell  you what, the workman said, all sweet reason. For $300 I will stop. "That right  there," said Wienckowski, "is extortion." But they were losing the light,  losing several thousand dollars every hour that cameras were shut down. And so  a guy Wienckowski was itching to arrest walked away with his chain saw and  $300.  </P> <P> Location manager Cliff Roseman: "You have the horror stories and the  sweethearts just like everything, the nice people who'll bring out coffee and  doughnuts, and then you have the goniffs. L.A. just seems to have more goniffs  than other places."  </P> <P> * The view from the front porch and the office window:  </P> <P> Locals feel bullied by Hollywood arrogance that takes cooperation for granted,  that acts as if the words "We're filming here" ought to command the same  deference as "We're curing cancer here." A City Hall staff member, who asked  not to be named, said that she doesn't mind the snarls of cable so much as  this: "I get resentful because of that sense of importance that dominates the  movie industry -- that a half-hour episode of 'Hooper' could be more important  than anything I could possibly do here."  </P> <P> In the rankings of urban unpleasantness, when movie shoots come in well behind  real shoots -- the semiautomatic kind -- behind crack sales and smog alerts,  life in a "hot spot" neighborhood can still try anyone's endurance. A pediatric  surgeon complained that he was kept awake long past midnight by filming. A  major movie figure importuned a location manager to tell him how to keep away  the movie companies that like to ply his own trade on his street. "Sometimes,"  said another manager, "the worst are the people in the movie business."  </P> <P> Unless you live in it, a movie shoot may amount to a traffic delay, a detour, a  momentary scare when you see the helicopters and ambulances before you spot the  cameras. KNX Radio traffic doyen Bill Keene recalls the evening rush hour in  the Cahuenga Pass, when a video company started to inflate a Spuds Mackenzie  balloon. "The Hollywood Freeway was absolutely locked, people looking at this  dumb dog being blown up."  </P> <P> Such is life in a company town. Weisenberg said, "If we lived in Dodge City,  we'd have cattle drives."  </P> <P> Agriculture, aerospace and tourism are richer, but movies and TV generate $5  billion a year for California, 90% of it for Los Angeles. Three billion more  skips town in productions shot elsewhere, largely, the industry said, because  of costs and more red tape than videotape. The city must meet the competition,  they warn. Or we'll go.  </P> <P> Angelenos have actor sightings enough, in delis, at the dry cleaners, in court.  Who wants them cluttering up your block? Each day, 40 or 50 productions, from  feature films to 15-second commercials, hit L.A. streets. Production  concentrates in a 30-mile zone, most of the L.A. basin, beyond which overtime  and location costs soar. Of the 94 cities in the zone, said California Film  Commission Director Lisa Rawlins, perhaps 16 are constantly filmed, some more  willingly than others. Los Angeles bends over to be accommodating:  </P> <P> Zoning laws prohibit business operations in most neighborhoods, the chief  exception being the one allowing people to rent their homes for movies. Film  crews can get permission to reroute buses and move bus stops. With $5-million  insurance they can fly helicopters. The city's charges are "minimal," said  Weisenberg, "intended to encourage filming here."  </P> <P> The crew of "Diehard" had to wait one day for a Century City scene of tanks and  troops thundering across Avenue of the Stars, guns blasting. President Reagan  was due in that night and his security people "might not understand," said  Weisenberg.  </P> <P> The powers that be said yes when the crew of "Diehard 2" wanted to stage a  predawn riot at the Tom Bradley Terminal. But they said "no" when a crew wanted  to use plastic snow, lest it drift across the runway and be sucked up in jet  engines.  </P> <P> Robert Gay is chief deputy to City Councilman Gil Lindsay. Movies are good fun,  he said, but how far is fair? For another business, the city would insist on  environmental impact reports on noise and traffic and parking. "Movie studios  don't have to do any of that stuff. They get basically carte blanche to do  anything they want to."  </P> <P> Walking down a City Hall corridor now and again, Gay has found himself grabbed  by a crew member who pulled him out of the shot. A crew permitted to film  Lindsay's office wanted the staff to "come through the back door, and shut off  our phones from ringing."  </P> <P> This year's St. Patrick's Day gala -- with Mayor Bradley, Ed McMahon, the  former Lord Mayor of Dublin and two Aer Lingus stewardesses -- ended with a  parade of bagpipers and shamrocked preschoolers.  </P> <P> They marched out of council chambers -- and into a smoky, half-lit hallway  being filmed for a commercial. "OK, everybody back up against the wall!" the  director shouted at his crew, and directed pipers and kids to daylight.  </P> <P> "What I'm saying is, what's the limit?" said Gay. "When you come into City  Hall, the actual seat of government where major policy is happening each day,  the last thing you need when you're trying to get somewhere is to have someone  stop you, yank you into a bathroom, telling you to watch the cables or to shut  up when you're trying to have a business conversation. We've swung the pendulum  so far, we're so anxious to get them here."  </P> <P> With the exception of a sound stage, Hancock Park is probably the most-shot  part of Los Angeles. Its homes are big, architecturally varied, and lush with  the kind of detail that no studio can afford to create. For several thousand  dollars a day, they can rent it.  </P> <P> Producer Ron Gilbert was shooting there a while back, across the street from a  man who "wanted money, even though we weren't shooting (him) or disturbing  him." He drove his car across the street and turned up the radio to "blast."  </P> <P> "I want you to know," said Gilbert, "this guy lived in an estate. And he said  he'll turn it off for $500. It was the principle. I wouldn't pay him." At last,  "his wife came and pulled him away."  </P> <P> Every shoot adds to the anthology: a woman who cranked up her country-Western  station and sat waiting for a payoff, not knowing the crew wasn't shooting  sound film. The man in a window flashing a light into the cameras to get them  to leave. The contractor and homeowner who were paid big money not to start  noisy repair work that they had no intention of doing anyway.  </P> <P> "I think the people who are mad are the people who don't make money for it,"  said Al Drouin, a Van Nuys man who let filmmakers use his house for "Real Men."  </P> <P> "And let's face it, they don't pay everybody."  </P> <P> No neighborhood, even Hancock Park, is uniform in its attitudes. But the  homeowners' association has drawn up regulations requiring advance notice,  parking on only one side of the street, busing in the crew, and trucks arriving  no earlier than the permit allows and leaving no later than it demands.  </P> <P> "People don't care about seeing movie stars or television actors," said its  president, Marguerite Byrne. "It's a question of the peace and quiet of your  own home. It's like whether you can sleep at night, have your family over. . .  . I would say probably three or four times as many people turn down thousands  of dollars to use their home for filming."  </P> <P> In adjacent Windsor Square, a family near Harry Olivar's house bought a house  some years ago intending "to pay their mortgage out of the revenues" of renting  it for movies, Olivar said. Neighbors complained at the ceaseless file of  trucks and crews. The family became "somewhat indignant, that this was their  divine right -- 'How am I going to pay the mortgage without it?' What you have  here is a few individuals benefiting in a monetary way, and a drawback to the  community."  </P> <P> When it does work, as it did for Al Drouin, big disruption is balanced by big  bucks.  </P> <P> Drouin's neighborhood had already starred in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."  MGM-UA came back to blow up the garage across the street for "Real Men," and it  needed Drouin's house to launch the missile.  </P> <P> Seventy-five people out there, shooting past midnight, noise, trucks, lights,  but at $500 a day, "the money is good, let's face it." By the time the crew  left, the Drouins had a new front fence and a nice little nest egg. A neighbor  confined to a wheelchair had a video of the enterprise, recorded by Drouin's  son and paid for by the film crew. And one neighbor had a new color TV, won in  a drawing set up by the film crew.  </P> <P> Good manners and occasional cash flow: location manager Brian Haynes has  offered to kennel dogs during an explosive gunfight, and hired a vet to stand  by when the scene was shot. He hands out studio tour tickets as thank yous. He  replaced a $6,000 wooden floor when a fish tank leaked during a fistfight. Like  his fellow location managers, he sometimes finds that a judiciously placed $50  bill can shut off a lawn mower, or a radio, or a complaint.  </P> <P> Since January, any company wanting to stop traffic on Main Street in the rustic  town of Fillmore must put up $15,000 for the merchants, a figure City  Councilman and Assistant Fire Chief Roger Campbell thinks is too high. Some  merchants must think so, too. Paul Hogan's company spent months there, and were  so courteous some merchants gave the money back. "If all film companies were as  good as (Hogan's)," said Campbell, "we wouldn't need any ordinance."  </P> <P> Their ordinance, two years in the making, was a defense measure for a town  overwhelmed by filmmaking, some of it fine, like "La Bamba," some outrageous:  </P> <P> * The day Campbell and the police chief checked out a car roll-over stunt and  calculated it would smash into the back of a house. "The (stunt) guy said 'You  don't know what you're talking about.' " He took off, and crashed into the  house. Campbell was furious. "That was the pure intention of the stunt."  </P> <P> * The morning an apparently driverless car, steered from under the dashboard,  was to careen down Main Street and crash into a fake barrier. It looked  harmless enough until the fire chief noticed a film crewman standing by with a  five-gallon bucket of gasoline, "to throw it as the car went by and light it."  </P> <P> * Last November, when a music video company "had a guy and a girl doing things  that shouldn't be done except in the privacy of their own home," at an open-air  shoot with kids hanging around. A lewd-conduct regulation was worked into the  ordinance, too.  </P> <P> The ordinance also requires script approval to make sure that what they say  they will do and what they intend to do are one and the same, and a $500 fee,  partly refundable, for the city's paper work. The state film commission "sent  very strong suggestions as to what was wrong with our ordinance," said  Campbell. "We didn't pay attention to them."  </P> <P> As balm to raw feelings, Rawlins' office and movie makers have worked up a code  of conduct that sounds as simple as a high school's. Pick up your trash. Wear  ID badges. Be polite. Arrive when you're supposed to, leave on time. For that's  the rub, when "just one hour" becomes five, when "a few people" become 50.  </P> <P> In the recent movie snafu in the Mojave Desert, filmmakers assured authorities  that markings they wanted to paint in an ancient limestone cavern would wash  off, and then they didn't. That kind of intrusion is what brings 15 or 20  complaints a week to Rawlins' office. Cash blandishment "wears thin after a  while," said Rawlins. "I think the industry had become very accustomed to  throwing money at a problem," and "will have to adopt a much stronger (public  relations) position."  </P> <P> In South Pasadena, film companies already donate to local projects, and "local  attitudes have changed recently simply because of this," said Rawlins.  </P> <P> Local attitudes were taken into account when "Heat Wave" came to South Central,  a place that sees as little of film companies as it does of chain stores.  L.A.-based Avnet/Kerner Production Co. is making the cable feature about the  1965 Watts riots, and it prides itself on its responsible films. They always  intended, they say, to arrange a community benefit tied to a "Heat Wave"  screening, but in part through Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Lindsay deputy  Gay, the neighborhood got more.  </P> <P> When they filmed the Pueblo housing projects, they filmed the Pueblo people  too, as extras, at $40 for eight hours' work. The disgruntled were offered  motel rooms and meals. Twelve hundred dollars went to a local exterminator,  after crews found their working interiors around 33rd and Central aswarm with  rats. Buildings got painted, buildings got cleaned up, all by paid locals, all  of a piece with the agreement to "leave the area as good or better," said lead  producer Jordan Kerner.  </P> <P> For an hourly $15 each, Louis Farrakhan's Fruit of Islam followers were  enlisted as round-the-clock security. Lead producer Jordan Kerner: "They were  just tremendous, very easy to work with."  </P> <P> A socially responsible, expensive shoot. It cost "a lot more" for this "very  important movie," Kerner said -- $100,000 over budget for the Fruit of Islam  alone. Now "it's just a matter of how much we'll lose." Yet there are other  kinds of profit; the newsmagazines and news shows have come knocking.  </P> <P> "The saturation, the volume of films, the amount of filming done on a daily  basis, and the lack of cooperation from people, and the greed" -- it makes for  misery on both sides, said Roseman. But Los Angeles "will say 'damn' when it's  gone."  </P> <P> As far as Campbell is concerned, the upheaval "can be justified if the city  gets the benefit" in something tangible, like recreation projects. "People do  not like having their daily lives disrupted, and just to make a movie is not a  good enough reason to do that."  </P></p>

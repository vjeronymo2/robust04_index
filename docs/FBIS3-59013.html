We did not avoid any of  the difficult issues," said Jacques Delors at the conclusion of  his meeting on Tuesday [11 January] with Turkish Prime Minister  Mrs. Tansu Ciller. The president of the Commission mentioned  the following:     -  Customs union. Mrs. Ciller outlined her  country's efforts to complete union by the deadline that has  been fixed (1995);    -  The EC/Turkey financial protocol, which is  still deadlocked. "I have an idea about how to break the  deadlock," said Mr. Delors;    -  Cyprus. "I think that if we find a  solution for Cyprus, many of the obstacles now in our path will  be removed, to Turkey's advantage," commented Mr. Delors. He  added that the EC observer to the UN negotiations will only have  the task of "keeping us updated on the negotiations";    -  The  Kurdish problem. "The Prime Minister explained her analysis of  the situation and the efforts she is making to make the country  more democratic and decentralize decisions. She hopes to  promote a more active democracy enabling all citizens to  participate in public affairs," said the president;    -  Former USSR.  The southernmost countries of the former USSR were discussed.  Mr. Delors commented: "It was very interesting for us to  benefit from the experience of Turkey, which provides  considerable aid for these countries." Mrs. Ciller then took  part in an enlarged meeting with her minister of foreign  affairs, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, and European Commissioners Sir Leon  Brittan and Hans van den Broek.</p>

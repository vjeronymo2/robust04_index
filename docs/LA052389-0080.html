			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Florida Supreme Court refused to allow enforcement of a new state law  requiring minors to get parental or judicial consent for abortions, but moved  up a hearing on the law's validity. The decision means that single women under  18 throughout Florida will be able to get abortions without consent of parents  or judges, at least until the high court rules following oral arguments June  27, a lawyer for the state said. The justices last week had decided to hear a  case involving a 15-year-old girl in September, but agreed to expedite the case  at the request of Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth's office. The state  repeated a request to allow enforcement of the law until the Supreme Court  rules on its validity, but the justices denied that motion. The state's 5th  District Court of Appeal, ruling in the case of the 15-year-old, struck down  the abortion consent law as unconstitutional. The case last week went from the  Florida high court, which denied a stay of the 5th District ruling, to the U.S.  Supreme Court, which also declined to order enforcement of the law.  </P></p>

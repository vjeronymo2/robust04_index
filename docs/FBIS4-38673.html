			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgiy Kvesitadze, minister of agriculture </F> and the processing industry, by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent  Ketevan Amiredzhibi; place and date not given: "Land and  Reforms"]    [Text] In the current most acute food crisis, many are  ready to blame the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and  the Processing Industry. However, let us look at the issue in a  different way: Does the Ministry possess the rights and powers  enabling it to have a real influence upon the processes taking  place in the branch.    In this regard, Georgiy Kvesitadze, minister of the  agriculture and processing industry, and member of the  republic's Academy of Sciences, answered questions put to him by  a SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent.    [Amiredzhibi] Many people are interested to know: Is a  structural reorganization of the management of the branch  underway?    [Kvesitadze] Yes. However, it is proceeding slowly.  Administrative mechanisms are not functioning in the current  situation as, to all intents and purposes, there is no market  economy in the country. Nevertheless, work is proceeding on the  creation and improvement of the structure of management of the  branch in new economic conditions; first and foremost, within  the framework of the European Union [EU] project. This concerns  the elaboration of an organizational structure for managing the  branch and mechanisms for serving agricultural enterprises,  so-called agro-service. Priorities have already been determined  for developing subbranches of the country's agro-industrial  complex. Incidentally, a strategy for the production of  agricultural products in the Republic is being elaborated  together with a group of EU experts and the Ministry and the  Academy of Agricultural Sciences.    [Amiredzhibi] Can one speak about any proper cadres policy  in the branch today?    [Kvesitadze] Of course. Work is proceeding according to a  specially elaborated program. The heads of agro-industrial  departments and the managers of more than 50 enterprises and  organizations, and so forth have been replaced in more than 20  rayons. In order to train, retrain, and improve the  qualifications of cadres in the agro-industrial complex, there  exists within the Ministry the Higher School for the Management  of the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Institute for Improving  the Qualifications of Cadres in the Food Industry, 16  specialized technical schools, 14 inter-rayon training centers,  and seven permanent training courses with a fairly strong  material and technical training base. New forms of training are  being introduced. The first stage involves the training of  qualified workers; the second -- the training of mid-level  specialists who will receive a bachelor's degree. A third stage  is also being planned, which will involve the training of  higher-level specialists who will be awarded a master's degree.  With this aim, the majority of specialized technical schools  within our system have been reorganized into agricultural  colleges offering various specializations. Instruction in many  new specializations has started.    Life convinces us that the branch badly needs new types of  cadres, particularly in such spheres as the organization and  management of the economy, modernization and automation, the  market economy, the mastering of new conditions for science, and  so forth. In this respect, a system for improving the  qualifications of production managers and other specialists is  being established.    [Amiredzhibi] What is the situation regarding privatization  and joint-stock companies in the branch?    [Kvesitadze] At the moment, these processes are progressing  slowly. Given the sharp reduction in land set aside for  agricultural enterprises, there are very many premises,  vehicles, agricultural equipment, and other assets that are not  being used and standing idle. These are the ones that need to  be privatized first so that agricultural production can get  underway, but this should now be in the hands of peasant  holdings, farms, and other private entrepreneurs. One has to  say that the process has become quite complicated regarding the  privatization of buildings and installations not being used on  state farms, for example, livestock departments and other  facilities. The whole point is that they can be privatized only  by a decree issued by the Cabinet of Ministers. There are  thousands of such facilities. I believe that it is wholly  sufficient to obtain permission from our ministry whereas rayon  bodies dealing with the management of state property can attend  to the proper course of the privatization process.    Let me say a few words about the privatization of  agricultural machinery. We believe that there should be some  delay before tackling this issue. We propose the following  solution: It is expedient to form, on the basis of agricultural  equipment that has been made available following the  reorganization of state and collective farms, subdivisions of  the agro-service that will also serve the small farms and other  holdings that are being created. Of course, this does not  exclude another solution: Individual farms will be given the  opportunity to acquire machinery as private property.    It is possible for a state farm to be privatized and taken  over by its collective as a whole. This is already happening,  for example, in Dushetskiy rayon.    There is a different approach to the privatization of  enterprises in the food and processing industry. Here, it is  expedient to form joint-stock companies. For example, the  "Tbilmargarinprom" production association, the commercial and  industrial firm "Kristall," and enterprises in Tbilisi -- the  "Kartli" tobacco factory and a dairy -- have already been turned  into joint-stock companies. A list of enterprises has been  drawn up, 51 percent of whose shares will belong to the state  once they become joint-stock companies. Preparatory work has  already been completed at many enterprises due to be transformed  into joint-stock companies.    However, there are enterprises whose production is of  strategic importance for the Republic, namely alcoholic drinks,  tea, and tobacco. The issue here is clear cut: It is necessary  for the state to have a temporary monopoly on this production;  this means that the privatization of these type of enterprises,  as yet, does not correspond to the general interests of the  state.    One more thing has to be said. Privatization in this branch  is, in many respects, of a spontaneous nature. Facilities are  being redeemed on the basis of leasing agreements that were  concluded previously, that is to say, assets are not being  revalued taking into account inflation and enterprises are being  bought for a song. Such facts have come to light through the  work of the Commission for the Privatization of State Property  that has been created in the ministry. State property should be  redeemed without fail according to its value at the moment of  the transaction.    [Amiredzhibi] Are there any violations and abuses on the  part of local authorities in the privatization process?    [Kvesitadze] There are very many, particularly when it is a  matter of the privatization of land. Thus, as a result of  incompetent and unscrupulous work by local land-privatization  commissions, there are facts of land being taken that has not  been included in the land reform program. As a result, several  seed farms have ceased to exist. In a number of  livestock-breeding complexes, not even the minimum amount of  land has remained for the production of feed. We are somehow  trying to correct the mistakes made. In this regard, on the  initiative of the Ministry, the Republic's government adopted a  decree in 1992 in accordance with which it is prohibited to  include in the land reform program that land on which scientific  and educational institutions, experimental centers, nurseries,  pedigree stock farms, and also livestock-breeding complexes and  hothouses are located.    [Amiredzhibi] It is well known that the agrarian sector is  receiving greater attention from the criminal world, if only on  account of the fact that goods are nevertheless being produced  there. Are any attempts being made by the Ministry -- of  course, with the help of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and  other corresponding ministries and departments -- to weaken the  pressure being applied by criminal groups and with what effect?    [Kvesitadze] Mismanagement, misappropriation, the unlawful  use of state property, unproductive expenditures, and so forth  -- all these phenomena have always been an integral part, so to  say, of the socialist method of economic management and have  done enormous damage to the state and society. In the current  conditions of economic decline, the intensification of crime,  legal nihilism, the incompetent actions of local authorities,  and the extremely slow pace of the formation of new economic  relations, all these phenomena have acquired a truly universal  character. Numerous economic and financial violations and  criminal actions have been exposed during the second half of  1993 by our departmental control alone. A halt has been put to  many of these. The illegal expenditure and facts of  embezzlement and misappropriation that have been exposed amount  in total to over 730 million rubles. In the course of checks  carried out, more than 120 million rubles have been recovered.  Thirteen cases have been lodged with bodies in the Procurator's  Office. An analysis of these statistics confirms once more the  disorder in the economic mechanism in rural areas and the  irresponsibility of many workers. If, in previous years,  violators used methods of direct embezzlement and illegal  expenditure in their encroachments upon state property, these  have been supplemented recently by violations of existing  leasing rules. Taking advantage of the lack of a firm  legislative base, in particular, regarding questions of  privatization, many have misappropriated state property for next  to nothing. Gross violations of leasing rules in cases of  redemption and incorrect settlements have deprived the state  budget of approximately 600 million rubles.    Countering this anarchy is difficult, but not impossible. We  are strengthening departmental control and establishing close  contacts with the Chamber of Control and the republic's law  enforcement bodies for we realize that, only by uniting our  efforts, will it be possible to bring about some kind of changes  to the situation that has taken shape.</p>

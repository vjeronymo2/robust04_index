			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAAB CONFIRMS IT IS NEGOTIATING WITH FORD, OTHERS  </P> <P> Reporting plunging profits, Sweden's troubled auto maker and aircraft  manufacturer Saab-Scania AB confirmed Monday that it is in negotiations with  Ford Motor Co.  </P> <P> Georg Karnsund, Saab's chief executive, refused to disclose details of the  talks, saying the two companies had signed an agreement of confidentiality.  </P> <P> He said Saab also is talking with other car makers, but he refused to say which  ones. Karnsund said Saab has signed a secrecy agreement only with Ford.  </P> <P> Rumors have circulated for months that Sweden's aviation pioneer was bidding to  sell its ailing car division, where falling sales caused a drop in income per  share of nearly 15%.  </P> <P> Jan-Erik Larsson, head of the car division, has said Saab "will remain a  Swedish auto-making company," indicating that a full buyout is not being  considered.  </P> <P> The profit at Saab's car division plunged 30% in the first six months of the  year to $139 million, partly because of a 15% drop in U.S. sales, the company  said.  </P></p>

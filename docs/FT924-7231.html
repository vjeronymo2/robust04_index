			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Danes confident on treaty The Danish prime minister, Mr Paul Schluter, yesterday said he was optimistic of finding a solution to the country's Maastricht treaty problem at the EC summit in Edinburgh next month despite the cool reaction of its partners, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. He was speaking after meeting the seven political parties which back the so-called 'national compromise' calling for special arrangements for Denmark. An opinion poll published in business newspaper Boersen yesterday indicated that if there were a vote now on the national compromise, 45.2 per cent no, with 16.8 per cent undecided.</p>

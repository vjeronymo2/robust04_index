			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NAS report assigns prostate cancer to a category labeled limited/suggestive evidence of an association, which it defined as meaning there is evidence suggestive of an association between herbicide exposure and a particular health outcome, but that evidence is limited because chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence. Prostate cancer is a very common male genitourinary cancer which shows marked increased prevalence with age. There are statistically significant occupational studies which show no association between prostate cancer and herbicide exposure (e.g., Fingerhut M.A., Halperin W.E., Marlow D.A., Piacitelli L.A., Honchar P.A., Sweeney M.H., Greife A.L., Dill P.A., Steenland K., Suruda A.J. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. New England Journal of Medicine 324:212&hyph;218; Manz A., Berger J., Dwyer J.H., Flesch-Janys D., Nagel S., Waltsgott H. 1991. Cancer mortality among workers in chemical plant contaminated with dioxin. Lancet 338:959&hyph;964; Saracci R., Kogevinas M., Bertazzi P.A., Bueno De Mesquita B.H., Coggon D., Green L.M., Kauppinen T., L'Abbe K.A., Littorin M., Lynge E., Mathews J.D., Neuberger M., Osman J., Pearce N., Winkelman R. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorophenois. Lancet 338:1027&hyph;1032). Some occupational studies have shown a slight elevated risk for prostate cancer among farm and forestry workers (e.g., Burmeister L.F., 1981. Cancer mortality in Iowa farmers: 1971&hyph;1978. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 66:461&hyph;464; Alavanja M.C., Merkle S., Teske J. Eaton B., Reed B. 1989. Mortality among forest and soil conservationists. Archives of Environmental Health 44:94&hyph;101); however, only one study concerning a small sub-set of farmers (Morrison H., Savitz, D., Semenciw R., Hulka B., Mao Y., Morison D., Wigle D. 1993. Farming and prostate cancer mortality. American Journal of Epidemiology 137:270&hyph;280) associated the increased risk of prostate cancer among farmers specifically with herbicide exposure. The Morrison study is so recent that it it too early to determine whether its results will be replicated by other research. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between prostate cancer and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAS report assigns peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung cancer), and nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer to a category labeled inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists, which is defined as meaning that the available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency, or statistical strength to permit a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of an association with herbicide exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peripheral neuropathy can be induced by many common medical and environmental disorders unrelated to herbicide exposure, such as aging, alcoholism, diabetes, and exposure to other toxic chemicals. The last time VA considered this issue, it determined, after receiving the advice of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards, that there was sufficient evidence to meet the requirements for a ``significant statistical association,'' the standard in effect at that time, between exposure to herbicides containing dioxin and the subsequent development of peripheral neuropathy under certain circumstances (See 57 FR 2236&hyph;38). That conclusion, however, relied heavily on case reports, which are anecdotal and have no statistical significant, and occupational studies such as Singer and colleagues (1982) (Singer R., Moses M., Valciukas J., Lilis R., Selikoff I.J., 1982. Nerve conduction velocity studies of workers employed in the manufacture of phenoxy herbicides. Environmental Research 29:297&hyph;311) whose credibility is compromised because they did not apply consistent methods to define a comparison group, determine exposure, evaluate clinical deficits, use standard definitions of peripheral neuropathy, or eliminate confounding variables. The Singer study, for example, excluded individuals with excessive alcohol consumption from the controls but not from the subjects of the study. Other occupational studies, such as Suskind and Herzberg (1984) (Suskind R.R., Hertzberg V.S., 1984. Human health effects of 2,4,5&hyph;T and its toxic contaminants. Journal of the American Medical Association 251:2372&hyph;2380), which did not have those methodological problems, showed no difference in the incidence of peripheral neuropathy for workers exposed to herbicides and workers not so exposed. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between peripheral neuropathy and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

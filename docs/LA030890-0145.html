			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: DEPENDING TOTALLY ON AN 11-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> Out of necessity, most single parents live a pretty structured life, sans much  margin for error.  </P> <P> Only schedules are more important than budgets -- work schedules, school  schedules, baby-sitting schedules, dentist appointments, housecleaning, meals,  all fitted together like a giant jigsaw puzzle.  </P> <P> And, like a puzzle, one missing piece -- such as a kid coming down with the flu  -- and the whole agenda is trashed.  </P> <P> Childhood illness is the bane of every single parent, another of God's little  reminders (like earthquakes) that we're not as much in charge as we've led  ourselves to believe.  </P> <P> But, as I've discovered this past week, there is one thing more disruptive, and  that's when the parent becomes incapacitated.  </P> <P> I had some wrist surgery (scratch the word surgery; the hospitals now insist it  is a "procedure"), and my household has been skewed good and proper.  </P> <P> The experience has left me gazing almost wistfully at the sides of milk  containers, much as I do at the "lost cat" announcements tacked up on  supermarket bulletin boards.  </P> <P> OK, OK, I know it's nothing to joke about, but at this point I really wouldn't  mind if both the cats and the kid were temporarily among the missing (and I  really do want to know how you lose a cat).  </P> <P> First of all, I am right-handed and, of course, the procedure was on my right  wrist, so even the simplest of my daily routines has been destroyed.  </P> <P> I'm relegated to wearing what look to me, anyway, like maternity clothes --  loose garments with no buttons or zippers. I can't shave, and each day I look  more like Walter Huston in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."  </P> <P> The bottom line is that I've temporarily become quite dependent on others. In  my case, that's singular, an 11-year-old with more compassion than skills.  </P> <P> And needs he's unaccustomed to having ignored.  </P> <P> He has become chief cook ("Is this supposed to be smoking like this?"),  dishwasher ("Why can't I leave them until morning?"), laundry-tender ("Why  should I fold the sheets when all I'm going to do is put them on the bed?"),  house-keeper ("The living room looks fine to me") and stenographer ("You're  going too fast!").  </P> <P> In the mornings, he must make his own breakfast and pack a lunch ("What's wrong  with just potato chips and Kudos?") and do the dishes.  </P> <P> When he's finally off to school, I have this overwhelming desire to sit in a  dark room and babble.  </P> <P> Instead, I sit in a light one and try to figure out how to while away the day.  I've found that there's such a thing as reading too much and that after a while  the words start becoming one, as do the titles of the books.  </P> <P> Of course, there's always daytime television, which I've discovered makes  nighttime television seem like Academe.  </P> <P> According to my cable guide, I have 30 channels. Why, then, is there nothing to  watch?  </P> <P> Soap operas, exercise shows, commercials for truck-driving schools, game shows  that my rather thick cats could win, big birds repeating the letter "B" for six  minutes, old series I didn't watch when both they and I were young, and  Congress in living color.  </P> <P> If nothing else, it's given me new insight into the problem of housewives and  infidelity. They are driven to it by Pat Sajak and the shopping channels.  </P> <P> After a few hours of television, I find myself anxiously awaiting my son's  return from school, just for some adult conversation.  </P> <P> I also try to keep in mind my mother's line that "even a mugging is an  educational experience, if you look at it in the proper light."  </P> <P> It was her way of suggesting that we make the best of any situation and learn  from it, no matter how trying. It's a line my son is tired of hearing these  days.  </P> <P> But it might come in handy -- if he ever has to live with a martyr again.  </P></p>

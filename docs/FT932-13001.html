			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Heseltine's plan 'to help Britain win':  He is committed to revitalising the relationship between the government and industry. A year ago the trade and industry secretary promised a new industrial strategy. After being sidetracked by the pit closure debate, this blueprint is largely completed MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, is in search of respect. He runs a department used to being sidelined by its political masters and sneered at by the industries it is supposed to sponsor. Last week, flanked by his six department ministers and his most senior civil servants, he gave the Financial Times a detailed insight into the proposals he is now putting into force 'to help British companies win'. He believes the Department of Trade and Industry and its 12,450 staff have a critical role in building a beefy British economy. But he knows the DTI's reputation is ragged and that low morale has led many bright minds to defect. His task, overshadowed while the government dug itself out of the pit-closure crisis, is to establish the DTI's authority in government and industry; to place it at the hub of a national effort to make Britain fully competitive in a cut-throat world. His message to the FT was a mix of realism and enthusiasm, delivered with a distinct Heseltine flourish, in spite of his insistence that it had not been polished up, party conference-style, for his audience. He stressed that his plans are long-term. They will have to be, given the inertia to overcome, the damage to be undone and the findings of an unpublished DTI report which says Britain's product base is weak and still deteriorating. It, like Mr Heseltine, talks in terms of decades of reconstruction. He dismisses gimmicks and magic solutions and talks only of a mutual partnership with the wealth-creating sector, not of intervening at every meal time. His partnership, however, will not be based on cosy conversations with 'the self-selecting elite' of big business but will embrace as many as possible of Britain's 3m companies. Hence his plans for a national chain of 'one-stop' advice shops for businesses, derided by critics as another, inconsequential player in the bewildering complex of agencies and outlets the government likes to set up. But to Mr Heseltine, his shops are 'an idea whose time has come', a small but important vanguard in what he says is the march towards a cultural revolution in business and government. Manufacturing companies have to innovate, market, get off their behinds and go for it; government has to act as a catalyst for elements of national self-interest and to think more carefully before it legislates in a way which could harm business. He wants to be industry's 'friend at court'. A man with his fair share of political enemies - but who retains a powerful pull in cabinet and the trust of the prime minister - he does not want to enlist any more. His evangelising will be polite but pervasive, in Westminster and Europe. 'We will not adopt a confrontational role. That is the way to lose influence, to close doors.' He is certainly 'not prepared to have a punch-up with the Treasury, although that does not mean they win all the time'. He adds: 'You are not going to hear from me when I win. No doubt you will hear from them when I don't' Mr Heseltine once spoke of investing in the DTI powers to rival those of the Treasury, which dispenses to him a tiny annual budget - little more than Pounds 1bn against Pounds 65bn for social security. It is not planning to give him any more. No problem. 'We do not seek to put large sums of money on the table in order to buy an objective.' Government's role must be limited, he emphasises. While it can climb on board to help promote industrial success, free enterprise is in the driving seat. Government should certainly provide some of the critical ingredients, like sound macro-economic management, high-quality education and good transport infrastructure. None of these is his direct responsibility and all are subject to harsh criticism. His underlying theme, the formula for success, is competitiveness, between companies and between countries. Britain, in spite of some progress in the 1980s, lies 18th in the 24-nation OECD league of competitiveness. Though Mr Heseltine admits people cannot agree on a definition, competitiveness now represents - if such concepts are permitted - his government's industrial policy. With it, he says, will come a critical leg-up for a national exporting effort which is impressive but nowhere near impressive enough. Selling overseas is to be a prime focus for the DTI, with the department's exporting operations about to undergo a fundamental restructuring. Mr Heseltine is happy to resurrect old, corporatist language to talk of 'national champions', though strictly in the context of export drives. 'I would be prepared to decide what is more likely to win in the circumstances and will put all our resources behind it. If I can help to fight on one front then I will.' But the first task, he says, is to establish industry's strengths and weaknesses. On his arrival a year ago, he told his officials to get on aircraft and 'case the world', firstly to see what the competition is up to and then to assess, with British industry, the strategic, longer-term issues it faces. 'Information is critical. Because on the quality of the information we gather, the respect of industry depends. If we are known to understand, to be aware, to have views that are coherent, thought through, well-informed, then industry will take this department seriously'. At the heart of his mission to understand and his plans for partnership are the 15 sectoral divisions set up last July to shadow large chunks of British industry. Though he once also wanted a revitalised National Economic Development Organisation, which ran its own sector working groups, he denies its closure was a personal defeat. He says he supported Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in killing it off. 'My department is now doing what Nedo should have been doing on a scale beyond the wildest dreams of Nedo's architects'. It was always kept at the margins of government, he stresses, while his sector operations will be at the heart of it. Under Mr Heseltine's plan, his own department will, for example, have to be fully abreast of state-of-the-art aerospace technology. 'We are constantly being asked for project launch aid and I would expect people here advising ministers to be experts in leading edge technology, knowing where its going to be in 10 years time'. As you spend money on frontier-type research, he says, it is vital you ask questions as you go. 'Should you just be reactive to one scheme someone puts up or should you have a view about where it's taking you?' Ask some applicants about the spin-off from their activities to other sectors of the economy and they have no idea, he shrugs. But though Mr Heseltine has some officials on board capable of such dialogue, he is going outside to find personnel with 'street cred'. There are now more than 50 private-sector secondees in the DTI and more will follow. The plan is to recruit 100 exporting experts alone. His plans, though presented in modest, worldly-wise tones, are ambitious and his efforts could sink in the sea of good intentions surrounding Britain's industrial decline. He is not prime minister, able to orchestrate from the centre, though the prime minister on Friday publicly backed him to the hilt. Mr Heseltine claims there has already been a sea-change in government language and that it is seeping through the government machinery, though there are ministers happy enough to frustrate him. Industrialists cannot deny that much of what they have recently sought has been granted. He expects and relishes a hard slog. 'I cannot do it faster, unless I want to do it in a dirigiste, proscriptive way. That's disaster. How on earth, the eighth secretary of state for trade and industry in 10 years is asked, are you going to sell this cultural change? 'I'm going to stay here,' he chuckles.</p>

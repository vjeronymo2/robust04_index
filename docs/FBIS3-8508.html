			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The 50th Session of the UN Human Rights Commission  held in Geneva has approved two resolutions on Kosova, initiated  by the United States and Pakistan. These resolutions condemn the  brutality, acts, and violence of the Serbian regime against the  Albanians of Kosova.    Welcoming the approval of these two resolutions, the  government of the republic of Kosova has issued a public  communique stressing that Belgrade has been shown to be  responsible for violating the basic freedoms and rights of the  Albanian people. Thus, the UN resolutions express the will of  the civilized peoples in the world to object to every violation  of human rights in Kosova and undertake actions in this regard.    The government of the republic of Kosova is of the opinion  that the will expressed by its people is the only basis for a  final solution. The communique asks the UN to increase its  efforts to be present in Kosova to help prevent conflict and  guarantee the return of democratic institutions to normality.</p>

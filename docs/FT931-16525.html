			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Volksbank agrees SFr1.64bn takeover: CS Holding's move opens way for Swiss rationalisation CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third-largest bank, is to acquire Swiss Volksbank, the fifth-largest, in an agreed share exchange deal that values Volksbank at SFr1.64bn (Dollars 1.14bn). The two said in a statement last night that the acquisition aimed to 'enhance the earning power and competitiveness' of both Volksbank and Credit Suisse. It would also contribute to further specialisation among the banking subsidiaries within the CS Holding group. The statement said that Credit Suisse would concentrate on international activities, securities underwriting and major corporate and institutional clients. Volksbank would keep its identity, focusing on business with small and medium-sized companies and private clients within Switzerland. 'At the same time, Volksbank and Credit Suisse will assume a leading position in the Swiss retail banking market.' Analysts have observed that there is considerable duplication between the branch networks of the two banks, and the statement said 'both banks will, from the outset, take steps to improve organisational efficiency by rationalising wherever possible'. Under the terms of the deal, CS will offer to exchange three of its registered shares for SFr500 worth of Volksbank equity. The purchase price is a substantial premium on the SFr1.1bn market capitalisation of Volksbank before the shares were suspended on Monday morning. CS said last night that it did not hold any Volksbank shares. The takeover constitutes a big step towards the rationalisation of Switzerland's bloated retail banking sector. The word 'overbanked' is trotted out in many countries these days, as profit-squeezed banks seek to justify their cost-cutting programmes. But few can outdo Switzerland in this regard. According to a recent study by McKinsey &amp; Co, the international consultants, there is one bank branch in the country for every 67 inhabitants. This compares with one for every 102 people in Britain, one per 136 in France and one per 105 in Germany. The McKinsey study also claimed that the return on equity invested in retail banking in Switzerland in 1990 averaged a negative 37 per cent. For a long time, Swiss banks could tolerate subsidising their retail activities. Most of them are universal banks and they were making lush profits in other sectors, especially in securities trading where commissions were fixed. But with the collapse of fixed commissions and other cozy conventions in the past few years, banks have had to seek profits from all their activities. The pressure on the retail sector has intensified even more in the past two years as many mortgage loans have gone sour in the recession. Swiss banking leaders have thus become ever more confident in predicting a big shakeout among the country's 600-odd banks. Mr Robert Studer, chief executive of Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the country's largest, said last March that he could see 100 of them disappearing in the next decade. Other analysts talk of 20,000 of the industry's 115,000 jobs being lost in the next few years. The shakeout is already well under way. Credit Suisse snapped up Bank Leu, the country's fifth-largest bank, after a hostile bid in late 1990. Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), the second-largest, last year consolidated its control of Banca della Svizzera Italiana. Several small regional banks have merged with each other or been absorbed by big banks in the past year. The two cantonal banks in Geneva are set to merge at the end of this year. The Credit Suisse takeover of Volksbank will open the way for the biggest single step yet. This is because the branch networks of both are very large and overlap virtually completely. Most of the 191 Volksbank branches could be eliminated without loss of market coverage. The operation will be long, costly and will generate a lot of political flak, as was shown in the slump of the bearer shares of CS Holding by SFr70 yesterday to SFr2,100 following the group's confirmation that it was interested in Volksbank. But Mr Rainer Gut, the CS Holding chairman, is known for his thick skin. There are other possible reasons for Credit Suisse's interest in Volksbank. In his speech last March, UBS's Mr Studer said, perhaps mischievously, that one of the big three might ultimately decide to withdraw from retail banking. Analysts instantly concluded that he was referring to Credit Suisse, the smallest of the three. Credit Suisse leaders have since been at pains to emphasise their total commitment to retail banking, and Mr Gut has even hinted on occasion that the group might contemplate an acquisition in the retail sector. It will also add legitimacy to the costly decision in 1987 to form a holding structure for the CS group. Last night, the group confirmed that its banking subsidiaries would be more specialised in the future with Volksbank concentrating on small business lending in Switzerland. The takeover will enable Credit Suisse to close substantially the gap in assets between it and its two larger rivals. At the end of June, 1992, UBS had total assets of SFr258.8bn, SBC SFr201bn, Credit Suisse SFr163.7bn and Volksbank SFr48.5bn. Although Volksbank's profits have tumbled in recent years, it is still well capitalised, with a 10.2 per cent capital ratio under the BIS guidelines. Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, estimates that a streamlined Volksbank could make annual profits of up to SFr300m. Analysts have been intrigued for months by a sudden surge in trading in Volksbank shares that took place in the early autumn, when the price bounced back from a low of SFr610 in early September to over SFr770 by the end of October. On October 28, the bank announced it would convert its capital structure from that of a co-operative, with one vote per shareholder regardless of the size of his holding, to a joint stock company. Terms of the conversion, due to be approved by shareholders in April, have not yet been revealed. There are no laws in Switzerland requiring potential bidders to reveal their holdings once they have gone over a certain level.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Call for probe into copiers THE Office of Fair Trading was yesterday asked to investigate into 'copy plan' schemes offered by photocopier suppliers and finance companies. The request, made by a delegation from the Campaign to Clean up Copier Contracts, was accompanied by a request to the OFT to consider revoking the consumer credit licences of three copier finance companies which are all owned by a UK merchant bank. Members of the campaign presented evidence to back up their call for action by the OFT. It has said it will not hesitate to revoke licences from any companies if it confirms malpractice in the selling of 'copy plan' schemes, which merge the capital cost of photocopying equipment with running costs to produce a charge-per-copy agreement.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Partnership and Social </F> Accord"]    [Text] The Partnership for Peace program was thought up in  Washington last year to somehow protect NATO against the East  European countries that were insistently attempting to join the  alliance. The speedy membership of NATO by Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and others could, in the opinion of Western  politicians, have signified an intensification of extreme  nationalist ("pro-empire") sentiments in Moscow. In addition,  pragmatists in the Pentagon fairly assumed that NATO's  accelerated expansion eastward would rapidly have reduced to  nothing the military value of the alliance, having converted it  (considering the principle of unanimity in all decisionmaking)  into a second CSCE.    The quite indefinite and nonbinding conditions of  participation in the Partnership program had to satisfy all. It  was not even considered necessary to consult the former members  of the Warsaw Pact, including Russia, in advance, about a  framework document being offered for signature immediately. As a  result, all NATO's future "partners" were unhappy to this extent  or the other. But, whereas the other East European countries  subscribed to the program, nonetheless, Russia, unexpectedly for  the West, refrained. The Russian military, as perfectly  pragmatic people, saw no specific advantages for the army in the  signing of the framework document.    But, it is not the military that determines foreign policy  in  Moscow. When, in March, the decision to subscribe was adopted,  the Ministry of Defense officially supported it. But, in April,  Kozyrev's promised visit to Brussels for the signing was  postponed indefinitely. Formally, in connection with the  American aircraft's attack on Serb positions near Goradze  without prior consultation with Moscow. But the main thing,  obviously, was to obtain support in the "opposition" ranks for  the Social Accord Treaty.    Western politicians found themselves in an absurd position:  Without Moscow's participation, the none too intelligible  program finally became totally meaningless. In the course of the  session in Brussels during 24-25 May, the NATO defense ministers  did everything possible to keep the Partnership afloat, and the  Russian defense minister helped them as best he could. General  Grachev announced that "Russia will subscribe to the program  without any prior conditions," and Western politicians publicly  welcomed this. True, at the same time Pavel Grachev once again  confirmed that Russia would like to "unconditionally" sign the  framework document only simultaneously with a supplementary  protocol or agreement that sets forth in detail the mutual  obligations of NATO in respect to Russia and of Russia in  respect to NATO in the political and military spheres. He also  proposed a system of permanent consultations. "Now NATO must  decide whether it accepts our partnership or not" (Pavel Grachev  in Brussels, reverse translation from the English).    In any event, Russia's formal affiliation to the program  has,  evidently, been postponed until NATO understands what kind of  protocol, in fact, Russia needs. Meanwhile, nothing is  preventing preservation of the pro-government majority composed  of the former "opposition" that took shape in the course of the  first Duma vote on the budget. The Partnership can wait.  Especially since the framework agreement is open for signing at  any time.</p>

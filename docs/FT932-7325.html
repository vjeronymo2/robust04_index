			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / World Bank plans Dollars 1bn loans to Pretoria THE World Bank has Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) worth of development projects in the pipeline for South Africa. They will be implemented once a non-racial transitional government is in place, Mr Edward Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, said yesterday. Mr Jaycox, who was on a brief stopover in London en route to the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, said the projects aimed to improve health, housing and education for South Africa's poor blacks. The World Bank stopped lending to South Africa when international sanctions were imposed against Pretoria's apartheid regime. But after two years of talks with both the government and the African National Congress, Mr Jaycox said prospects for renewing relations with South Africa were 'excellent'. Mr Jaycox stressed that World Bank loans to South Africa would not be on concessional terms, because of the country's relative wealth. The Bank's pledge follows similar promises of economic support for a democratic South Africa by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. The World Bank official was also keen to dispel the widespread image of the continent as a region of 'victims and losers'. For the first time in a generation, many countries were enjoying growth rates higher than the expansion of their populations. He was confident that tough structural adjustment programmes were beginning to bear fruit, despite an adverse international economic climate and the lukewarm commitment of many African governments to reform.</p>

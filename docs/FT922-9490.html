			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Urban regeneration agency - Main Points An urban regeneration agency will be set up to co-ordinate the regeneration of England's inner cities. It will aim to bring back into use vacant and under-used land, and will have compulsory purchase powers similar to those of existing urban development corporations. The rents-to-mortgages proposals also contained in the bill will offer council tenants a chance to become part-owners of their homes.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Despite relatively small offerings at Australian sales this week prices failed to rise further, and some types sold at prices irregularly a little cheaper. New Zealand wool was more definitely cheaper at this week's sale, and about a third of the offering failed to find buyers. It is now widely felt that the strong price rise which developed in February has been checked. The setback, if it does in fact develop, means a quieter trading spell but this is acceptable after recent improvement, and longer term confidence persists. The AWC Market indicator at 648 cents a kg. is 5 cents higher than a week ago.</p>

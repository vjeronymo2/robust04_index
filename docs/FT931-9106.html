			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Courage Yesterday's interim results from Fosters Brewing reveal what a miserable time its Courage subsidiary has been having. The trend is not as bad as suggested by the 11 per cent decline in operating profits expressed in Australian dollars. But even after adjustment for a pension fund contribution in 1992, sterling profits still dropped Pounds 5m to Pounds 61m in the six months to December compared with the same period of 1991. Volume fell around 5 per cent. Gross margins were under strong pressure, particularly in the on-trade, though this was offset to some degree by lower central costs. Courage faces a bitter struggle to secure its share of the on-trade by 1998 after which it will have no tied pubs left. So far it claims a high rate of business retention in the 1,900 pubs freed from the tie in November. But lower interest rates have reduced the attraction of free trade loans as an incentive. Discounting is likely to remain its main weapon, which is not good news for the competition. Though the evidence from elsewhere in the industry is patchy, Courage also points to margin pressure in the off-trade. Cost-savings generated by the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's brewing interests may thus be insufficient. Consumers have not yet felt much benefit from government attempts to introduce greater competition in the industry, but the extent of brewing overcapacity is becoming increasingly apparent. Last year Courage disposed of Ruddles and its Trowbridge brewery, but it has not yet resorted to closures. At least after last November's ADollars 1bn rights issue, its parent is in a better position to meet the cost of any surgery that proves necessary.</p>

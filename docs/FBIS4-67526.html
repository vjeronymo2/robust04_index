			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government is to pay 31.5  million German marks in development aid to Kazakhstan in 1994 to  help fund the country's transition from a planned to a free  market economy. The Economic Cooperation Ministry in Bonn said  on Friday [6 May] that the major part of the funds will go into  environmental protection, because Kazakhstan has suffered very  badly from nuclear tests and polluted and dried out rivers and  lakes.</p>

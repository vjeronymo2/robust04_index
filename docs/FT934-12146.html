Mr Lubbers is leading a business delegation seeking to expand commerce with India in the wake of the 1991 economic reforms. Their trip follows visits this year by delegations from other countries. He welcomed India's economic liberalisation but warned Delhi against moving too slowly. 'Too much caution in liberalising the economy risks eroding the confidence of foreign investors in India's willingness and capability to carry out reforms,' he said.</p>

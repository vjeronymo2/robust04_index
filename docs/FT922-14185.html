			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: Planning Vanessa Houlder (Property Market, April 3) has fallen into the trap of describing Docklands as laissez-faire. Rates holidays and tax allowances are not laissez-faire, they are dirigiste. For example, there has been no pension fund investment in Docklands - why invest in such a risky location if you do not need to save tax? Regional policy has been a proven failure since the Second World War. Left to the free market and a liberal town and country planning policy, Docklands would have been quite different.

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOTOROLA SETS ITS COMPUTER SIGHTS HIGH  </P> <P> Motorola Inc. today unveiled a line of computers that it says should help it  become a major contender in that industry, where it never has received much  recognition.  </P> <P> The new computers are designed to be operated in a network with machines made  by other companies, such as IBM and Apple.  </P> <P> They are based on the Unix operating system, which is becoming the industry  standard.  </P> <P> Motorola said the computers undercut the price of a similar line of IBM  machines by more than 35%.  </P> <P> Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has made computers for years, but they  have primarily been sold to the federal government or to other computer  companies that resell them under their own name.  </P> <P> The new computers are "file servers," an increasingly popular form of desktop  or side-of-desk machine that serves as the central data repository for a  network of desktop terminals.  </P> <P> Motorola's machines, called the MultiPersonal Computer line, range in price  from $23,985 for the MPC100 to $59,985 for the top-end MPC300. Each comes with  three desktop screens and a side-of-desk processing unit.  </P> <P> Edward Staiano, president of Motorola's general-systems sector, said the  company intends to become one of the major players in the computer business  over the next five years. He says it will build on its expertise in  computer-chip technology and high-quality, low-cost manufacturing.  </P> <P> Some analysts are skeptical of Motorola's goal.  </P> <P> "Motorola is doing so many great things in other parts of the company, you hate  to be negative about their computer effort, but I don't think it has too much  prospect for success," said Richard L. Whittington of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Daniel L. Klesken of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said Motorola is one of  the leading makers of cellular phones and semiconductors and is "trying to  build a third leg" with computers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aldo Ajello, UN secretary general representative in  Mozambique, is still worried about the slowness in confinement  of government and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]  troops. He said only 655 soldiers have been confined this week,  a figure which he described as marginal considering that to  comply with its plan the government should demobilize 1,500  soldiers per day until 1 July. Aldo Ajello said the government  pledged to comply with the timetable, though he believes he  ought to meet the president of the Republic to discuss the issue  and find satisfactory and realistic solutions. The meeting  should take place before Chissano leaves for Lisbon where  Lusophone countries are scheduled to hold a conference.    Aldo Ajello said 2,427 soldiers from both sides were  demobilized this week. It has been estimated that 4,076  soldiers from both sides will be demobilized next week.    He said the 13,776 government soldiers demobilized before  the  signing of the peace accord will receive demobilization  allowances. As of 29 June, they should report to the  Reintegration Commission [Core] to be registered. At a meeting  yesterday, the Supervision and Control Commission ratified the  plan to assist in the reintegration of demobilized soldiers.    The plan provides for a minimum income for demobilized  troops  to encourage the latter to live in areas of their choice,  thereby restricting migration into cities. The plan is also  designed to supplement any other schemes adopted by Core to  assist demobilized troops with means other than financial ones.    The reintegration scheme includes a financial plan that  provides for fixed monthly payments in local currency over a  18-month period. Payments will begin three months after  demobilization and will cover 69,140 government and Renamo  troops.    The overall cost of the scheme has been estimated at  $19,032,580. The governments of Denmark, FRG, Italy, The  Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and of Switzerland  have contributed to that fund.    Ajello said he was pleased with the Mozambican Government's  decision to pay pensions to Renamo troops maimed during the war,  noting that that is a significant sign of national  reconciliation. He said government teams, with UN Operations in  Mozambique logistical assistance, have already begun operating  in centers for war-maimed soldiers.</p>

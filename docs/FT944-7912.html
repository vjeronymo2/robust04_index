			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate worries leave Dow sharply lower Wall Street Program selling left US share prices at their lowest levels since August 22 yesterday amid uncertainty about future interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 45.75 at 3,769.51. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 3.17 to 458.30, while the American SE composite weakened 2.76 to 441.28 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.93 to 757.74. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 293m shares. The market began drifting downwards early in the afternoon, with the effect snowballing towards the end of the day. At one point, just before the close, the Dow was more than 50 points off before it made a slight comeback. One factor pushing prices down was continued uncertainty about economic conditions. In spite of the Federal Reserve's larger than expected increase in interest rates last week, most economists believe that the Fed will boost rates again later this year or early in 1995. Such a move would be expected to hurt equity prices by making borrowing more expensive and ultimately putting pressure on corporate earnings. Shares of several major cyclical companies showed declines yesterday. Allied Signal retreated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 , Caterpillar slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 , DuPont lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 54 3/4 and Dow Chemical was off Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 64 1/2 . Conseco, the insurer, forged ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 40 3/8 after a proposed merger with Kemper fell apart. Kemper, which said it was still for sale, tumbled Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 . Chiron, the biotech company, gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 80 1/4 on news that it had signed an agreement to form a partnership with Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company. Under the proposed alliance, Ciba-Geigy would pay an unexpectedly high Dollars 117 per share for just over 37 per cent. Major high-technology companies were mixed yesterday afternoon: Digital Equipment gained Dollars 1 at Dollars 36 1/8 , Compaq Computer was up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 39 7/8 , IBM shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 72 7/8 , Texas Instruments lost Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 78 3/4 and Microsoft, which trades on the Nasdaq, dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 63 1/2 . Hewlett-Packard lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 99 3/4 and Apple Computer shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 . Canada Initial firmness in Toronto quickly evaporated and stocks drifted easier before dropping sharply late in the session, dragged down by the Wall Street trend. The TSE 300 index finished 40.22 weaker at 4,074.31, while declines outscored rises by 553 to 221 after volume of 40.9m shares valued at CDollars 426.9m. All 14 sub-indices were lower, led by gold, metal, real estate and transportation stocks.

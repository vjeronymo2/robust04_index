The standard became effective on April 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 15, 1993 the United Steelworkers of America, AFL&hyph;CIO/CLC (USWA) petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit for judicial review of the final permit space standard under section 6(f) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In particular, the USWA contended that &sect;1910.146(k)(2), which addresses the rescue of permit space entrants by outside (off-site) rescue services, was vague and ineffective. The USWA also noted that the permit space standard lacks a provision which would provide employees or their designated representative the opportunity to observe any monitoring or testing required by the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language of &sect;1910.146(k)(3)(i), which specifies the point of attachment of a retrieval line to a permit space entrant, may be unnecessarily restrictive. The ADS Environmental Services Company, a contractor which performs work in sewers, has petitioned OSHA for a variance to paragraph (k)(3)(i). ADS has demonstrated that, for their operations, a point of attachment in front of the entrant at about mid-shoulder level is adequate to meet OSHA's objective that an entrant present the smallest possible profile during removal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon these concerns, OSHA is now proposing to revise paragraph (k) of &sect;1910.146, to state more clearly the employer's duty to ensure effective rescue capability for employees who enter permit spaces and to allow more flexibility in the point of attachment of a retrieval line to an entrant. OSHA is also raising the issue of whether to add provisions to &sect;1910.146 to provide affected employees, or their designated representatives, with the opportunity to observe the evaluation of confined spaces, including atmospheric testing or monitoring, and to have access to the results of such evaluations and monitoring. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments and information on this proposed revision must be postmarked by February 27, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for public hearings on this proposal must be postmarked by February 27, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments and information on this proposed rule are to be submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket No. S&hyph;019A, United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Room N2634, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210, telephone (202) 219&hyph;7894.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many employees enter and work in spaces which, because of their configuration, difficulty of entry or other factors, pose increased risk of exposure to serious hazards. In January, 1993, OSHA promulgated a standard (&sect;1910.146, 58 FR 4462, January 14, 1993) that requires employers to protect employees assigned to enter Permit-Required Confined Spaces (permit spaces) from these hazards. On June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34844), OSHA published a notice which corrected typographical errors in the regulatory text and clarified several provisions of the permit space final rule and appendices. On May 19, 1994 (59 FR 26114), OSHA published a technical amendment to &sect;1910.146 which added a metric equivalent to paragraph (k)(3)(ii) and further revised the ``Atmospheric Monitoring'' section of non-mandatory Appendix E, ``Sewer System Entry.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The permit space standard provides a comprehensive regulatory framework within which employers can effectively protect employees who enter permit spaces. The standard provides for the establishment of written permit space programs, authorization of entry through written permits, and the implementation of measures (e.g., testing and monitoring of spaces, control of hazards, stationing of an attendant to monitor entry, employee training, and availability of rescue and emergency medical personnel) necessary for safe entry operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 15, 1993 the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) filed a petition for judicial review of the final PRCS standard in the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. On June 22, 1993, the USWA sent OSHA a letter (Ex. 1), which detailed their objections to the final PRCS standard. The USWA objections dealt, in part, with the provisions of existing &sect;1910.146(k)(2), regarding the use of off-site personnel to perform permit space rescues. These concerns are discussed more fully below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Events and Considerations Leading to This Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Rescue and Emergency Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While compliance with the permit space standard will generally enable authorized entrants to enter and exit permit spaces safely, OSHA recognizes that there may be circumstances where hazards arise so quickly or unexpectedly that entrants need assistance in exiting a permit space. Paragraphs (d)(9) and (k) of the standard set requirements for the rescue and emergency services needed in such circumstances. Also, paragraph (h)(5) of the standard requires authorized entrants to initiate self-rescue where appropriate, and paragraphs (i)(6), (i)(7) and (i)(9) require attendants, where appropriate, to order evacuation of the permit space, to summon rescue and emergency services and to perform non-entry rescue. In promulgating the final rule (58 FR 4524), OSHA anticipated that compliance with these provisions would maximize the likelihood that authorized permit space entrants would be protected from death or serious injury should an emergency arise during entry operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have documented (58 FR 4465) that a majority of permit space fatalities have been would-be rescuers who entered permit spaces without the necessary training or equipment. The Agency believes that this information demonstrates the need for employers to implement rescue measures which protect rescuers from death or serious injury (58 FR 4526). OSHA concluded, based on its review of the rulemaking record of the permit-space standard, that non-entry rescue involves the least danger for rescuers and that a retrieval system (body harness attached to a lifeline extending outside the permit space) will generally be the appropriate form of non-entry rescue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

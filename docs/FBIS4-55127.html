			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 6 (CTK) -- The screening  (lustration) of members of the Slovak Government is being held  up by certain technical shortcomings, Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik said on Slovak radio today. At present no official  body existed in Slovakia with the competence to issue screening  certificates, he added. The cabinet is being screened to  ascertain whether any of its members collaborated with the  communist secret police, since Slovak law bans former  collaborators from holding high public office.    The Slovak Information Service (SIS) was charged by the  former government with issuing screening certificates for a  period of nine months, by which time the problem was to have  been solved, Moravcik said. However, ex-Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar's cabinet did not solve the problem by this date. The  shortcoming would be dealt with at the next parliamentary  session, Moravcik said.    He also pointed to the fact that the previous government had  not proceeded at all in accordance with the valid screening law.  "We have been, and will be, thorough in this respect," he said.    With reference to Economy Minister Peter Magvasi, who is  rumored to be having problems in obtaining a negative  certificate, Moravcik said that Magvasi was "a very capable  minister" who in a short time had managed to gain a good  reputation abroad. "However, we have to wait for the results of  the screening," he said.</p>

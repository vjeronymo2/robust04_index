			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Erno Rozsa, chairman of the Environmental </F> Protection Committee of the Slovak Parliament, by Peter Andor  Balazs; place and date not given: ``Erno Rozsa Interviewed on  the Bos Power Station'']    [Text]    Balazs: You are the chairman of the Environmental  Protection Committee of the Slovak Parliament. What is your  opinion about Mr. Binder's generous declaration, according to  which he would gladly pump water into the Szigetkoz area?    Rozsa: Mr. Binder also made such spectacular  declarations before, as if he could solve the problem. These  proposals would only be a patchwork, because they do not change  the basic problems. The basic problem is that if the two states  recognize the fact that the Danube is a border river, they have  to also jointly bear its blessings, consequences, and threats  alike. It is impossible to divide water up; it is only possible  to do something in this direction if one of the sides gives up  his share by common agreement. When Julius Binder made his  proposals, he did so for the benefit of the common property, but  even if his plan succeeded, it would only be a sham solution.    Balazs: The Bos-Nagymaros issue disturbs  Hungarian-Slovak relations considerably. However, the Hungarian  Green Party is urging the construction of the power stations at  Dunakiliti and Nagymaros. What is your opinion of this, as the  chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee and as a  member of the Coexistence Movement?    Rozsa: The recognition of differences is one of  the major principles of Coexistence. A given country is trying  to make use of this within its legal system for the benefit of  the recognition of national minorities. Therefore, allow me not  to interfere in the party struggles and the party concepts of  another country. We will only get the guarantee of national  minority recognition if we find the proper tone with the  government at the given time and the given moment. If I speak  about any of the political parties in Hungary, I will reopen the  alleged or real wounds that threaten the constitutional  guarantees of recognition of the ethnic Hungarians living here,  because we would again be accused of looking at Hungary and  being led by Hungary. We could achieve results in the current  political situation by not mentioning the facts and events  outside the country. We are now preparing a law according to  which large-scale projects cannot be carried out without the  opinion of the public. The Slovak and Hungarian citizens living  in the proximity of the dams should be the ones to express their  opinions about the construction projects at Dunakiliti and  Nagymaros and, according to these opinions, one could say  whether the project is good or bad. I detect a slight lack of  responsibility in the fact that the Hungarian Green Party made  declarations without being aware of these opinions.    Balazs: What are the harmful environmental effects  of the Bos power station on the Csallokoz area?    Rozsa: Opinions differ on the level of the ground  water at Csallokoz. Some people say that the level has  increased; others say that the level has decreased. It is  impossible to find this out in such a short time.    Balazs: Do you find it unfair that while the  drinking water of 47,000 people in the Szigetkoz area is  endangered, no noticeable damage whatsoever has emerged at the  Csallokoz?    Rozsa:We warned the Hungarians in time that the  Slovaks would carry out the C version of the power station. You  did not believe us at the time. The Slovak leadership made an  issue of prestige out of this, and it mobilized all its power to  carry out this plan. With the construction of the power station  at Dunakiliti, the distribution of water would have been in the  Hungarians' hands. But the Hungarians rejected the idea, and  thus they are now at the mercy of the Slovak side.    Balazs:What chances of a joint solution do you see  in the current situation?    Rozsa:The basic concept of a broad coalition on  this issue is that we must settle the conflict with our  neighbors. We must negotiate. You must understand that our  broad coalition is so diverse that it will be difficult to carry  out this process. It is not easy for the right and the left to  come to a consensus. The solution can only be found in  something similar to what was recently said in Prague, with the  participation of the environmental protection committees of nine  Central-European countries. National parks should be set up in  natural areas divided up by borders, and the affected countries  would share the responsibility for them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hungary and Slovenia signed a free trade zone  agreement. Today, in Ljubljana, the document was signed by Dr.  Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister for international cooperation,  and Dr. Davorin Kracun, minister for economic relations and  development. The ministers presented the contents and the  significance of this agreement at the news conference. Tomaz  Gerden reports:    [Begin recording] [Gerden] Hungary is an important trade  partner of Slovenia. The free trade zone agreement will, as of  1 July, abolish two-thirds of customs duties, while the rest  will be gradually abolished by 1997, that is to say, by 2001 for  the most sensitive articles. In three years' time, the  agreement signed today will be reexamined and supplemented, if  this proves necessary. Kadar was very pleased with the agreement  signed.    The agreement can be assessed from several points of view.  In December 1992, Slovenia and Hungary signed a basic agreement  on mutual relations. This was followed by several other  agreements. Dr. Kadar believes that today's agreement on the  formation of a free trade zone merely confirms good relations  between two neighborly states.    He touched particularly upon the issue of agriculture, as  Hungary exports $20 million worth of agricultural produce and  raw materials to Slovenia, which represents a fifth of all  Hungarian exports to our country. The agreement signed today  will allow a greater competitiveness of this Hungarian produce  on the Slovene market. Slovenia and Hungary will continue to  cooperate at the regional level within the Alpe-Adria community.    Minister Kadar especially emphasized that such an agreement  also means drawing closer to the European integration processes.    Minister Dr. Kracun added here that, regarding integrations,  one should not merely wait for the initiatives of the European  Union. He assessed the agreement as follows:    [Kracun] The agreement that we signed with the neighboring  Hungary today is a very important milestone in the development  of bilateral cooperation with Hungary and in Slovene orientation  toward European integration. Namely, Slovenia has already  signed some free trade zone agreements, however, on this  occasion we have for the first time signed one with a  neighboring country.

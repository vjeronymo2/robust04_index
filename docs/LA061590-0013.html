			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIALS OF RECYCLING NOT TOO MUCH TO BEAR  </P> <P> Re "The Garbage That Ate Our Lives" (June 11): I find it less than cute and  close to irresponsible to publish an article on the trials of making  environmentally sound consumer choices at the market and the difficulties of  separating recyclables.  </P> <P> Bottom Line: If my 2-year-old can separate the tin from the aluminum and my  teen-ager can faithfully recycle the same plastic sandwich bag for days at a  time, then presumably a household of college grads can do their parts as good  citizens without whining about it.  </P> <P> SANDI SIGURDSON and STEVE McGRATH  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

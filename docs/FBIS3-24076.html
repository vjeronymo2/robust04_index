			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova and Vadim Tyagniryadno under </F> the rubric "Elections-94": "Pilgrimage to Power"]    [Text] The first phase of the City Assembly election  campaign is coming to a close. Just a few days remain until the  deadline for registration of candidates for deputies. At  midnight on 18 February the electoral commission will stop  accepting signature lists from coalitions and independent  candidates. The statute on elections envisages two methods of  candidate nomination in majority-based  districts--self-nomination and nomination from a public  association. Self-nomination requires the collection of 2,000  signatures in one of 50 districts. Electoral coalitions' task is  somewhat easier: They need to submit 35,000 signatures, after  which the coalition may field one candidate in each district. It  is worth remembering that 38 coalitions have submitted  registration applications, of which 34 have been cleared by the  city electoral commission to participate in the election  campaign. Not all made use of this right--realistically, 24  coalitions have begun signature collection. Although this does  not mean that the rest have given up on their plan to place  their candidates in the assembly. For instance, the unregistered  "Entrepreneurs Forum" intends to field representatives in 15  districts. They will run in the elections as independents. Many  candidates included in coalition lists also collect signatures  on their own in parallel--as a fallback. And some have managed  to get placed on the lists of several coalitions at the same  time.    We are offering you a brief review of electoral coalitions  that have begun signature collection. It is quite difficult to  determine the political coloration of many coalitions. Of  course, as in Elections-90, both communist and democratic blocs  are represented. But this distinction is not as clear-cut  today--four years ago it would have been impossible to see a  former member of the CPSU oblast committee and a former  Democratic Russia cochairman coexist on the same list.    For a considerable number of candidates this is not the  first  election campaign. Many have experience of working in the city  soviet, and in the Congresses of Russian and USSR People's  Deputies. Many participated in the recent election campaign to  the Federal Assembly.  <H5>  Democratic Unity of Petersburg </H5>   The Democratic Unity of Petersburg [DUP] is the fruit of a  pre-election accord of parties, public movements, and  organizations of a democratic orientation, many of which are  quite well known in the city. The bloc was set up at the  beginning of the year by seven founders: the  Christian-Democratic Union, the regional branch of Democratic  Russia, the Free Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the  Memorial human rights society, the Economic Freedom Party, and  the Society of Russian Solidarists.    The DUP has brought together supporters of proceeding with  socioeconomic reforms, and aligns itself with the  right-of-center coalition in the State Duma, that is, Russia's  Choice, PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], the 12  December Union, and part of Yabloko [Yavlinskiy-Lukin-Boldyrev  bloc]. In their platform statements bloc members emphasize  support of entrepreneurship.    The DUP signature list contains 22 names; altogether, the  coalition submitted 43 candidates to the electoral commission.  The DUP leaders have succeeded in putting together a team that  has an impressive abundance of well-known names of politicians,  figures of science and culture, entrepreneurs, and  industrialists. At the same time, the bloc's list proved quite  diverse. The coalition is headed by A. Belyayev, member of the  Federation Council and a former city soviet chairman. Also on  the DUP list: N. Arzhannikov, former deputy chairman of the  Russian Supreme Soviet human rights commission; M. Chulaki,  writer and democratic movement activist; the famous jeweler A.  Ananov; Baltic Plant Director Oleg Shulyakovskiy; and Igor  Soshnikov, SvDPR [Free Democratic Party] cochairman.  Entrepreneur Ilya Baskin also is running on the DUP slate.    Many DUP candidates have already had the experience of the  pilgrimage to power in the recent past. First and foremost 13  former city soviet deputies. Among them are Nikolay Zhuravskiy,  former chairman of the commission on housing policy; Andrey  Krylov, former chairman of the commission on economic reform;  and Aleksey Reshetov, one of the leaders of the Leningrad Oblast  farmers' movement. Also on the bloc's list are former all-Russia  deputies Nikita and Mikhail Tolstoy. Former high-ranking  mayoralty functionaries also vie to return to the levers of city  administration: Yelena Drapeko, former chairman of the culture  committee, and Vadim Kalinin, chairman of the Port-Bank board of  directors, who came to his current job from the post of deputy  chairman of the Committee for the Administration of State  Property.  <H3>  The Petersburg Branch of the Russian Creative Union of  Cultural Workers </H3>   The Creative Union of Cultural Workers took advantage of its  position as nearly the only creative association that has the  right to participate in the elections and fielded its own list  of candidates.    The Creative Union runs first and foremost under the banners  of protecting culture and defends the interests of people who  work in this sphere. The association sees as one of its main  tasks preservation of the city's system of cultural  establishments--libraries, houses and palaces of culture, cinema  theaters, etc. Most names on the registered list of 11  candidates are heads and functionaries of various cultural,  educational, and science establishments, who are not too well  known to city residents. Among them are the rector of the  Humanities University, Aleksandr Zanesotskiy; the director of  Imeni Rerikha School, Sergey Kirpichev; and the director of  Imeni Lensoveta House of Culture, Lyudmila Trofimova. The most  colorful figure on the list is Aleksandr Ilyin, in the past a  circus performer and now a well-known folk-medicine healer. Also  nominated together with the Creative Union is Aleksey Kovalev,  former deputy of the latest city soviet, who acquired some fame  at the end of the 1980's through his actions in protecting  architectural landmarks, and then actively fought the  mayoralty's comprehensive city planning projects.  <H5>  Independent Association `Business Petersburg' </H5>   In addition to V. Kharchenko, president of the Union of  Associations of Industrial, Construction, Science,  Transportation, and Communications Enterprises, the bloc's list  includes V. Zanin, general director of the NPO  [scientific-industrial association] Signal; I. Konoval, general  director of the Plastpolimer AO [joint-stock company]; V.  Zhimirov, general director of the Almaz AO; Yu. Trusov, general  director of the Ptitseprom AO; and V. Rudenko, director of the  clinical center for advanced medical technologies. In the same  list are film director V. Bortko and V. Orlov, chairman of the  presidium of the Foundation for Aiding Residents of Blockaded  Leningrad. (A total of 11 candidates.) "Business Petersburg"  leaders point out that the bloc unites people who do not need to  be taught--they have a good idea of the mechanism for solving  city and sectoral problems.    "Business Petersburg" intends to bring up a score of draft  laws at the very first session of the City Assembly. The goal is  to make it profitable for goods producers to preserve and create  jobs; support the population's investment in residential housing  construction; increase the role of local taxation; and bring the  city's credit and finance system in line with the interests of  the population. The bloc also intends to propose a program for  setting up enterprises for the production and sale of goods  intended for low-income population groups.  <H5>  The Constitutional Democrat Union of St. Petersburg </H5>   Registered in December 1992. Its ranks are relatively  small--about 100 members. They are mainly research associates of  academic and other institutions. According to the union's  leaders, they try to accept into their organization only those  they trust completely. Neither do cadets [constitutional  democrats] approve of chasing famous names. In addition to their  party leader Aleksandr Kozyrev, the Union nominated Maritime  Technical University Professor Aleksandr Fedorov, Agrobusiness  Academy instructor Boris Gavrilov, Semen Vaykhanskiy, a leading  research associate of the TsNII [central scientific-research  institute] of fuel apparatuses; and other members of the science  and technology intelligentsia.    The Union supports the soonest possible implementation of  reforms, reorganization of the judiciary and law enforcement  organs, and development of self-rule. Cadets see the main task  of the state as ensuring the rights and freedoms of  citizens--everything else the citizens will do for themselves.  Overall, they consider themselves successors to the cause begun  before the October revolution--the cause of building a law-based  state.    In the event all the candidates from the Constitutional  Democrats Unions are elected to the City Assembly, they will  vote for changing the existing statute on the structure of  organs of power in St. Petersburg. Cadets would like to see the  representative body have broader powers and the restoration of  balance of the branches.</p>

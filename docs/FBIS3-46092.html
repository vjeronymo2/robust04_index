The exchange, sponsored by the Ministry of Internal Trade  and  the Sichuan provincial government, will admit domestic and  overseas enterprises, brokerage companies and financial  institutions as members for a fee of 200,000 yuan (about 23,000  U.S. dollars). The transactions will be managed by public  bidding with the aid of computers.    China's biggest wholesale meat market was set up in Chengdu  in October 1991. So far, the volume of business totals 1.368  million tons, worth 6.61 billion yuan.    However, officials in charge of the market said meat futures  need separate handling to stabilize prices and reduce the risks  to pork producers.</p>

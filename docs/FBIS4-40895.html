			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement released by the "Ukrayina" democratic coalition; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] Seeing the indecisiveness of authorities and their  unwillingness to strengthen the foundations of statehood in the  regions, anti-Ukrainian and antistate forces have stepped up  their activities in Kharkov Oblast. They threw off their mask  during the Supreme Council elections in March and April this  year. The Civil Congress of Ukraine, the Labor Party, the  Communist Party of Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, and  the leadership of the United Trade Unions of Kharkov Oblast have  waged a furious propaganda campaign against Ukraine's  independence, the state leadership, and the population of  western oblasts. A great number of Ukrainian-eaters  [Ukrayinozher], with the help of proimperial magnates, have  infiltrated our state's legislative body -- the Supreme Council.  They can be easily recognized by their deeds: In parliament,  they behave in a blatant manner, speak only in Russian, and  voice opinions which can lead to destabilization of political  life and loss of Ukrainian statehood, and can transform Ukraine  into an economic appendage of the Russian empire.    In terms of ideology, these deputies are fed by similar  forces in the regions. In Kharkov Oblast, the proimperial  forces have almost completely captured the media -- they have  established the "Tonis," "Orion," "Symon," "Vympel," and "A/TVK"  television companies and the "Radio 50," "Master-Radio," and  "Onyks" radio companies. VECHERNIY KHARKOV and SOBYTIYE are  published instead of such Ukrainian-language newspapers as  VECHIRNIY KHARKOV and LENINSKA ZMINA. A whole range of new  Russian-language newspapers are published. Newspapers from  Russia are sold for pittance. Russian literature dominates the  city's and oblast's bookstands. At state expense, libraries are  furnished with Russian papers, magazines, and books. Only two  Ukrainian newspapers -- SLOBIDSKYY KRAY (three times per week)  and children's ZHURAVLYK (twice per month) -- are published in  Kharkov. The attack against the Ukrainian language is conducted  by physical methods as well: The stands, on which Ukrainian  newspapers were displayed, have been dismantled.    We, the plenipotentiaries of political parties and public  organizations of democratic orientation, are concerned over the  attack of proimperial forces in Kharkov Oblast.    We Propose:    To the Cabinet of Ministers:    1. To hold a special meeting concerning the implementation  of the "State Program for the Development of the Ukrainian  Language and Other National Languages of Ukraine by the year of  2000" dated 12 November 1991.    2. To provide state assistance to Ukrainian-language media,  to ensure their normal operation.    To the Supreme Council:    1. To revise the issue of using the technical radio and  television equipment on the Ukrainian territory, which is used  to hamper the process of Ukrainian national revival, cultivate  separatism, and sow hostilities among people in different parts  of the state.    2. To ensure the introduction of the state language at  plenary sessions of the parliament and its standing commissions.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Politics comes second to Japanese pinball: Mistrust and apathy over an electoral test In the main street of Toyohashi the former prime minister was having difficulty competing with the rival attractions of the pinball arcade. Mr Tsutomu Hata had arrived in his campaign bus to canvass support for the opposition candidate in Sunday's by-election. But the desolate little gathering of supporters and curious onlookers never looked like outnumbering the men eagerly crowding into the pachinko parlour. It was a typical scene. The election in Aichi prefecture, 150 miles to the west of Tokyo, has attracted more interest from the national politicians and psephologists than it has from the voters. The principal cause of the excitement is the decision of the three parties of the governing coalition and the 10 parties of the opposition bloc to field a single candidate each. It thus represents the first test of popular opinion since the formation of the strange new alliances around which Japanese politics have coalesced in the last few months - a minor referendum on the unlikely coalition between the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and Social Democratic party (SDP). It is also an important test of the government's resolve on the popular issue of political reform The vacancy for the seat in the upper house of the Japanese parliament was caused by the removal of the sitting member following his admission that he falsified his educational record during the last election campaign in 1992. The vast constituency, centred on Japan's fourth largest city, Nagoya, is home to the world headquarters of Toyota Motor Corporation. More than 200,000 among the electorate of 5m work for Toyota and its related companies. In normal circumstances the election would be a close-run thing. Two years ago the multi-member constituency returned candidates from both the LDP and the Democratic Socialist Party, one of the opposition parties. But traditional voter apathy has been compounded by a growing mistrust of politicians. The turnout was just 47 per cent in 1992, and the campaigns for the two main candidates expect it to be less than 40 per cent this time. And to this mix of apathy and disenchantment has been added the volatile ingredient of confusion. The unprecedented fluidity of Japanese politics in the last year seems to have left many voters bewildered. The campaign teams for the two main candidates both expressed concern that the shifting coalitions in Japanese politics have become so bizarre that electors will not know which candidate represents which group. Nonetheless, opinion polls suggest that those who to vote are set to deliver a significant rebuff to the government. The opposition candidate, Mr Yuzuru Tsuzuki, is well-liked locally. More potently, he is mining a rich seam of voter disgust at the cynical opportunism of the SDP and LDP in burying their divisions in the interest of self-preservation. 'I used to vote socialist,' said one man on the streets of Toyohashi, 'but I was never so shocked in my whole life as when I heard of the formation of this coalition.' 'This is a government of men united by just one thing,' said another, 'their desire for power.' The coalition's candidate, the former United Nations diplomat, Mr Jiro Mizuno, had the unmistakeable air of a man expecting a drubbing. 'It is a very hard struggle,' he said, 'but I believe I can win.' His campaign supporters had had even less success in enticing people from the pachinko parlour when they stopped by earlier. 'Please vote for Mr Mizuno, if only to save his face,' appealed one of them. Indeed there is a growing fear in coalition circles that Mr Mizuno might even be beaten into third place by a local television personality running as an independent. Differences within the coalition have meant that policies have been avoided altogether. Instead they have chosen to focus largely on the personality of their undeniably charming candidate. Mr Mizuno's election literature dwells heavily on his tastes in music (he likes Linda Ronstadt) and films (his favourites are, of course, those staples of Japanese cinema-goers, 'Roman Holiday' and 'Casablanca'.) Then, under a beaming picture of the 48-year-old is a litany of his well-known supporters - a list of mostly national and local government figures that includes, unaccountably, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former secretary-general of the United Nations. The opposition seems undaunted by such heavyweight competition. Mr Atsuaki Miwa, the campaign manager, thinks the electorate is ready to deliver a crushing blow to the governing parties and in the process register its support for the reform process hesitantly under way in Japan. 'Though the coalition parties say they support reform, the voters know that they did all they could to oppose it when it was being legislated. A vote for Mr Tsuzuki will be a vote for an end to the old politics represented by the SDP and LDP.' Mr Miwa's optimism is probably justified. But there is little doubt that popular disillusionment is stronger than ever - disillusionment that embraces much of the opposition too. Support for the principles of political reform remains widespread. Confidence that it will actually make any difference is ebbing fast.</p>

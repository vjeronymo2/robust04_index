			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Yeltsin in truce talks with rival: Personal battle abandoned in move to end constitutional crisis RUSSIAN president Boris Yelstin and his main political rival appeared to have temporarily set aside their differences last night as they agreed on a plan to resolve the country's constitutional crisis. After a mere half hour's talks in the Kremlin, Mr Yeltsin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet, agreed to call a special session of the Congress of People's Deputies to ratify a 'constitutional agreement' which will be thrashed out over the next 10 days by teams appointed by the two men. The agreement signifies that both have decided to abandon their personal battle of attrition. Instead, opposing experts will haggle over the form of constitutional government in Russia - the fundamental question between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov. However, the brief statements issued by the presidential press office and the official Itar Tass news agency after the early evening meeting raise more questions than they answer, and leave the result of the increasingly bitter struggle over how Russia is governed still in balance. The presidential statement said that a range of proposals aimed at getting agreement between the executive and legislature on the constitutional system and on alleviating the economic crisis would be published today. These will include Mr Yeltsin's own version of the constitution. Over the next 10 days, a joint commission of experts headed by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the first deputy speaker, will attempt to obtain an agreement on a draft constitution to be presented to the special Congress in early March. However, the statement from the president's press office stressed that until the Congress ratified this putative agreement, the government would continue to prepare for a referendum on the constitution, scheduled for April 11 under a prior agreement between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov made in December. At the same time, Itar Tass said that both men voiced 'anxiety over the possible results' of such a referendum. The newsagency quoted Mr Khasbulatov, during a meeting yesterday with former US president Richard Nixon, as saying that a danger of dictatorship loomed and that 'only a strengthening of the principles of parliamentarism can help us'. Although Mr Yeltsin, according to the statement, 'came forward with the initiative of calling an extraordinary Congress', it is precisely that forum which has been the most bitter critic of his government's actions and of his policies. The December Congress forced him to replace Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister with the more conservative Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, and only grudgingly agreed to a constitutional referendum.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / European High-Yield Bonds: Foreign demand underpins rally EUROPE's high-yielding bond markets may soon no longer deserve their name. This month, 10-year bond yields in Spain, Italy and Portugal all fell below 10 per cent, the most important psychological barrier for investors. It is the first time in their short history that Spanish and Portuguese markets have reached these levels. The strong rally in the last month was achieved despite the fact that the Bundesbank did not cut German interest rates, confounding many traders' expectations. The breaching of the 10 per cent barrier represents a remarkable shift of sentiment within a short space of time - as recently as last October Spanish 10-year yields were above 14 per cent. While there is nothing fundamental to stop further appreciation of the Italian and Spanish markets, analysts are becoming rather edgy about the prospects for a correction. However, the recovery following the lack of action by the Bundesbank on Thursday, despite an initial sell-off by traders, reflects that underlying demand from investors, including the retail end of the market, remains firm. Mr Michael Burke, bond economist at Citibank, favours Italy over Spain. 'Italy has much better inflation prospects,' he argues, with wage growth of 2.6 per cent compared with 7.5 per cent in Spain. 'Spain has some serious structural problems which the minority government is ill-placed to address,' he says. He cites rigidities in the labour market which have allowed wage inflation to advance unimpeded. Spain is also faced with a burgeoning budget deficit, fuelled by regional government spending, which is difficult to curb without offending nationalist parties. The deficit could well be as much as 7 per cent of Spain's GDP by the end of the year, from just 4.4 per cent in 1992, according to analysts. Of course, the size of Spain's debt is dwarfed by Italy's debt mountain. But the market is quite aware of the structural problems facing Italy, and it could be argued that these are well discounted. 'I still don't feel comfortable with the budget situation and the progress on electoral reform,' said Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. Also he argues that the 120 basis point rally in 10-year bond yields in the last month has been overdone considering that three-month rates have fallen only 25 basis points. 'The long bonds have discounted a lot of easing,' he said. Mr Burke at Citibank takes a more positive view of the Italian picture. While Italy's debt burden remains a serious concern, he believes there is room for some improvement, since a large portion of Italy's obligations are in the form of interest payments. However, since more than 80 per cent of Italy's public sector deficit is in the form of short-term bills, 'much of the problem is easily curable with lower short-term interest rates,' Mr Burke argues. Whatever the logic of the rally, it has undoubtedly been fuelled by foreign investors, in search of higher yielding paper, who have rarely been such active buyers of Italy and Spain. According to statistics, foreign investors now hold around a third of the Spanish market. It remains to be seen whether or not they will soon decide that the yields on offer are no longer high enough to justify the extra risk of buying more volatile markets.</p>

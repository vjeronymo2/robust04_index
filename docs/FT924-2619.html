			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: GUS shows 6% improvement GREAT UNIVERSAL Stores, the mail order, retail, financial services and property group, increased interim profits by 6 per cent but said the economic situation remained difficult. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 183.7m to Pounds 194.8m in the six months to September 30, while sales increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 1.25bn (Pounds 1.71bn). The group said the home shopping side lifted sales by 5 per cent to Pounds 780.5m, helped by increased investment in warehouses, distribution and marketing, and operating profits rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 81.5m. Overseas retailing boosted operating profit by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.8m on turnover of Pounds 83.3m, a rise of 6.4 per cent. South Africa produced a good result, but the Canadian performance had been affected by economic problems. Sales of Burberrys products, including royalties, rose 10 per cent to Pounds 71.2m with operating profits were up 6 per cent at Pounds 12.5m. GUS said prudent lending policies enabled the consumer and corporate finance division to contain bad debt and this contributed to a modest 1.5 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 62.1m on sales of Pounds 311.2m, a rise of 8.8 per cent. Reviews of existing leases saw rental income from the property division increase by 11.9 per cent to Pounds 25.3m. GUS said: 'The recent turbulence in the currency markets and rapidly fluctuating interest rates represent a basic malaise in an unsettled economic climate, making forward business planning hazardous and complex.' Earnings increased from 49.2p to 51.4p. The interim dividend is 13.75p (12.75p). COMMENT GUS's A shares closed 35p down at Pounds 16.18, reflecting both that these profits were slightly below some expectations and the cautious tone of the terse accompanying statement. GUS said sales since the half-year had been satisfactory, but the volatile nature of trading made the outlook difficult to predict. Net cash is above the year-end total of Pounds 590m. Falling rates mean lower interest income, but the group contends that should be more than offset by the impact of cheaper money on consumer spending. Overseas earnings, accounting for nearly a fifth of group profits, benefited from the translation being made post-devaluation. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 470m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 12.6. The shares have had a good run from Pounds 12.80 in the past year, and were no doubt overdue for some profit-taking. However, they appear to have little downside at this level, given the group's consistent record of earnings growth.</p>

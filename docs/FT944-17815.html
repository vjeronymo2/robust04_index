			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Electronic Elsevier Reed Elsevier's Dollars 1.5bn purchase of electronic publisher Mead Data Central should have benefits in the short, medium and long terms. The immediate enhancement to earnings per share comes from the tax relief that Reed will enjoy in the US on the amortisation of Dollars 1.27bn of goodwill  -a wheeze Reed also employed when it bought Official Airline Guides last year. The tax relief reduces the historic price-earnings multiple from 36 to 20. If MDC maintains the strong growth in profits shown so far this year, the 1994 multiple will be only 17. The medium-term benefit should come from boosting margins. With a paper company as a parent, MDC's operating margins have been stuck in the 12-15 per cent range. Reed argues that it should be possible to push margins to nearer its 20 per cent norm for professional publishing; costs can be cut, higher-value products can be developed and MDC's services can be marketed more vigorously, notably outside the US. There is, of course, a risk that margins could be depressed through price competition. The most vulnerable part of MDC is Nexis, its business information arm, which is essentially an electronic warehouse for other companies' information. But the Lexis legal information arm - the largest and most profitable part of MDC - looks better protected as most of its data is proprietary. The long-term bet is that MDC's electronic culture can be transferred to the rest of the Reed empire. Plans are so far rather woolly. But it seems likely that scientists and doctors, who currently take Reed's information in hard copy, will eventually want access at touch of a button. MDC could prove the group's ticket to the multimedia superhighway.</p>

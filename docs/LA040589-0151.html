			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY LEGALIZED IN POLISH PACT;  </P> <P> AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY WALESA ALSO CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Lech Walesa and a government minister today concluded a historic pact to  legalize the independent Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban and to  hold Poland's first free elections since World War II.  </P> <P> The Solidarity leader, representing the opposition, and the interior minister,  Gen. Czeszlaw Kiszczak, endorsed hundreds of pages of agreements hammered out  during intensive talks on Poland's political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> They approved the pact as the 57 participants in the 2-month-old negotiations,  known as the round-table talks, gathered for one last time at the Council of  Ministers Palace.  </P> <P> "There is no freedom without Solidarity," Walesa said at the beginning of a  brief speech explaining why the opposition had approved the agreements.  </P> <P> "I think that the round-table talks can become the beginning of the road to  democracy and a free Poland, and hence we look with boldness and hope into the  future," he said.  </P> <P> When Walesa was asked earlier today when he thinks Solidarity will be  legalized, he replied, "I think immediately after signing."  </P> <P> Kiszczak opened the meeting with a speech lauding the talks that brought  together all sides of the nation's splintered political spectrum.  </P> <P> "This documentation is a social contract," he said. "We declare the will to  fulfill honestly the agreement we symbolically conclude today."  </P> <P> He called the debates a "first, extremely significant step" and said the talks  can be "a priceless element in the accomplishment of our work."  </P> <P> The meeting was preceded by separate signings of agreements on economic,  political and trade union reforms by the opposition and government officials.  </P> <P> As early as this morning it had not been clear whether Solidarity intended to  sign the accords, especially after a dispute with the officially backed OPZZ  trade unions over the formula adopted for compensating workers for inflation as  part of the economic agreement.  </P> <P> But Walesa told the National Executive Commission of Solidarity during a  closed-door, three-hour meeting that the union has achieved its main goal in  the talks -- legalization -- and that it can better fight for further economic  and political reforms after it is registered and organized.  </P> <P> The Executive Commission authorized Walesa to sign the agreements, clearing the  final hurdle to the round-table meeting with Kiszcak.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BERNHARDT FIRES BACK AS RECALL BATTLE BEGINS  </P> <P> Backed by about 60 friends and campaign supporters, San Diego Councilwoman  Linda Bernhardt used a well-choreographed meeting at the City Hall concourse  Thursday to launch her defense against a recall effort spearheaded by a group  of neighborhood activists from District 5.  </P> <P> Although billed as a press conference, Bernhardt's afternoon meeting quickly  took on the appearance of a campaign rally, as Bernhardt's staff urged  supporters to stand behind their candidate while she spoke to reporters.  Bernhardt's supporters broke into applause several times during the press  conference when she pledged not to "back down" in the face of the recall  effort.  </P> <P> Bernhardt characterized the recall effort as a "witch hunt" staged by the  city's "Old Guard," which she said includes Councilman Bruce Henderson, Mayor  Maureen O'Connor and former Councilman Ed Struiksma. Bernhardt alleged that the  "Old Guard" was "waging a war against Linda Bernhardt."  </P> <P> Bernhardt acknowledged that some of her strongest supporters in last November's  campaign were disillusioned because she would no longer represent Scripps Ranch  if the council adopts a controversial redistricting plan proposed by Councilman  John Hartley.  </P> <P> But Bernhardt maintained the recall drive was being led by "some political  forces that can't stand a new voice at City Hall." She suggested that those  political forces were trying to win support by "duping" community leaders in  District 5, which she represents.  </P> <P> Bernhardt was surrounded by community leaders from District 5 and  representatives of environmental groups, developers, the business community and  the gay and lesbian communities.  </P> <P> Just minutes after Bernhardt's press conference ended, a second group gathered  just a few yards away to officially announce their recall effort of Bernhardt.  </P> <P> Backed by about a dozen supporters, Kathy Gausted, co-chairwoman of the  recently formed "Recall Bernhardt Committee" began the politically tough task  of ousting a seated council member.  </P> <P> "Linda Bernhardt has violated the public trust and must be removed from  office," said Gausted, who said that Bernhardt treats her constituents with  "apathy, arrogance and, oftentimes, dishonesty."  </P> <P> However, while Gausted blasted Bernhardt's performance during seven months in  office, she gave few concrete examples of why Bernhardt should be recalled.  Gausted also said the current redistricting fight was not the key reason for  the recall effort.  </P> <P> Gausted estimated that her group, which so far has collected less than $300,  will need $20,000 if it is to successfully force Bernhardt from the office that  she has occupied since January.  </P> <P> Ten of the recall group's steering committee members are from Mira Mesa or  Serra Mesa. Just one, Donna Evans, is from Scripps Ranch. One member is from  Rancho Bernardo and the other is from Clairemont.  </P> <P> Gausted denied that her group had any political ties to O'Connor, Henderson or  Struiksma.  </P> <P> She said political consultant Jack Orr has agreed to work for "20% of whatever  we can raise." Gausted denied Orr had organized the anti-Bernhardt movement.  She said the group hired Orr because they need his "professional capabilities"  to succeed in the recall effort.  </P></p>

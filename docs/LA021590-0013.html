			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA  </P> <P> The Otay Mesa border crossing was closed for nearly an hour Wednesday by a  small spill of paint solvent, a county health department official said.  </P> <P> The county's Hazardous Materials Management Team and the Fire Department's  hazardous unit were called to the port of entry at noon.  </P> <P> Fire officials said traces of paint solvent were found but presented no danger.  </P> <P> A truck, carrying 164, 55-gallon drums was parked at the U.S. Customs  checkpoint when inspectors discovered the leak, fire officials said. Three  drums were about one-third full, but only one leaked, said Gary Stephany,  director of environmental health.  </P> <P> He said that an environmental crime task force will meet to determine if  charges should be filed against the company for violating federal and state  laws.  </P> <P> Stephany said the materials were improperly stored, and the truck did not  display a sign identifying the contents.  </P> <P> The driver, who thought the drums were empty, works for a Mexican trucking  company, Stephany said.  </P></p>

The "market" figures gained during 1,000 personal interviews  at the end of February show a 44-percent majority for membership  -- this is 5 percent more than in January and the highest value  in three years. For the first time in a long period, there is  the clearest majority among the supporters of the Austrian  People's Party [OeVP], but also among the Social Democratic  Party of Austria and the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] voters  in favor of the European Union dominate. Being in favor of  membership is in correlation with income and level of education.    However, according to "market" figures, opposition has also  increased slightly (from 34 to 37 percent); the group of  undecided people, on the other hand, has shrunk.    The quick telephone polls by OGM and Integral, which cannot  really be compared with the above-mentioned poll in terms of  method, showed majorities between 42 and 56 percent.    At the moment, a majority seems to be certain, because  parallel to the Sunday question [how would you vote if the  referendum were held next Sunday?], the "market" poll also asked  whether the Austrians currently see more advantages or  disadvantages (for months, the group of optimists has had the  upper hand). In addition, the assessment that the referendum  will have a positive result dominates with 33 percent compared  to 27 percent. However, the referendum campaign is not yet over.    The determining factor will be which group manages to use  the  most convincing arguments. Therefore, DER STANDARD had some  arguments on membership tested in the M36 poll.    By far the strongest argument was taken from a brochure,  published by the OeVP's Political Academy: A total of 44  percent identify themselves with the statement "An effective  environmental policy must comprise all of Europe" -- even among  opponents of membership, 39 percent agree with this argument.    Second and third place are already occupied by critical  statements from the Greens' brochure on Europe: "The transit  avalanche is on its way -- Austria will be steamrolled by the  European Union" appeals to four out of 10 Austrians (and one out  of three EU advocates); one out of three Austrians believe that  the European Union could become a "single market for criminals."    One out of three are convinced by the "decline of prices to  the European level" that is promised by the Austrian  Government's information on Europe; this argument is  particularly attractive to women.    Right at the bottom of the list: The slogan of the Greens  that EU membership means "open borders for junk food" -- this is  not believed either by EU opponents or by EU advocates.</p>

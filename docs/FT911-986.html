			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: Lloyd's establishment and 'the rest' Sir, The reference to the 'family of Lloyd's' by Mr Alan Lord, the Lloyd's chief executive ('Lloyd's launches reforms in bid to reassure Names', May 3) must have caused quite a few sardonic smiles. The trouble is that too few members of Lloyd's are part of that family. Some 10 years ago while I was acting as an arbitrator in a complaint by the Committee of Lloyd's against an underwriter, someone in the position to know made the remark that the attitude of the establishment of Lloyd's towards the rest resembled that of the bullies in some old-fashioned public school towards the juniors. Nothing that I have since observed causes me to think this was too uncharitable a view. It seems unlikely that the announced reforms, which would leave the review of the 'commercial circumstances' of the worst losses to the governing body of Lloyd's while doing nothing at all about investigating the slightly less bad losses, will achieve Mr Lord's aim of persuading the Names to give up the courts to pursue their complaints. A Doll-Steinberg, 18 Holly Walk, NW3</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lowndes Lambert up 24% at Pounds 5m Strong growth in both the UK and the US helped Lowndes Lambert, the insurance broker, increase pre-tax by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.2m for the six months to end-September. The interim dividend is lifted from 4.5p to 5p from fully diluted earnings of 12.2p (10.9p). The shares rose 3p to 417p. Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, expected further steady growth in the second half. 'Conditions in our major markets remain difficult but . . . the advent of new capital into Lloyd's and other sectors of the world market will increase capacity in 1994.' Unlike some of its competitors Lowndes Lambert received no benefit from the strengthening of the dollar, with its conversion rate averaging Dollars 1.58 against sterling in the last two years. Turnover rose from Pounds 24.9m to Pounds 30.2m while administrative expenses increased from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 27.8m leaving broking profit of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1m). Income from the UK rose by 14 per cent and from the group's international division by 9 per cent. Revenue from North American operations rose by 24 per cent. Of these amounts Norex, a UK retail and London market broker acquired last year, contributed Pounds 2.1m in turnover and Pounds 500,000 in broking profits. Two associated undertakings - a 30 per cent stake in Datasure, and a 45 per cent share in a French subsidiary, La Nouvelle Securite - brought in a further Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.3m) in turnover and Pounds 1m in profits. Profits last year included Pounds 500,000 earned from the sale of a 10 per cent stake in a subsidiary of La Nouvelle. Interest receivable was steady at Pounds 1.8m. COMMENT Since its flotation in 1991 Lowndes Lambert has steadily improved productivity recording successive increases in broking profits. With premium rates rising and prospects for the Lloyd's market - in which Lowndes places about 25 per cent of its business - reasonably positive, the group seems on course for full year 1993-94 profits of more than Pounds 13m and earnings per share of some 30p. At yesterday's closing price of 417p that puts the shares on a prospective multiple just under 14. Compared to a sector average for the medium-sized brokers of between 14 and 16 the shares appear to represent good value.</p>

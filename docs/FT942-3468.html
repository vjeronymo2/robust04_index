			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / MetLife and Travelers to combine health sides Metropolitan Life and Travelers are combining their health insurance businesses in a joint venture company. It is a further sign of the consolidation under way among US managed healthcare organisations. Travelers, which has the smaller health insurance business of the two, agreed to pass to MetLife disability, dental care and other insurance businesses with annual premiums of more than Dollars 950m in return for a half share in the new company. It is also selling MetLife its group life insurance business for Dollars 350m. By growing in size, healthcare groups hope to reduce unit costs and force bigger discounts from healthcare providers, such as hospitals and drugs companies. The deal marks the first steps taken by Mr Sanford Weill, whose Primerica financial services group took over Travelers at the end of last year, to sort out some parts of Travelers' underperforming insurance operations. Earlier this year, Mr Weill predicted mergers in the insurance industry as companies sought greater efficiency. The two insurers said their new company, which had yet to be named, would provide health insurance to 13m people. However, only 391,000 of these are in the two companies' health maintenance organisations (HMOs), under which individuals are serviced by a prescribed network of doctors and hospitals. All US insurers are attempting to move people from their traditional fee-for-service plans into HMOs, which have become a more profitable way of providing healthcare cover. HMOs have also become popular among the US companies which pay for their employees' health insurance. Buying coverage for the average person in an HMO cost Dollars 3,520 last year, compared with Dollars 4,370 for traditional health insurance. In addition to the HMOs, MetLife and Travelers cover a further 4.4m people under other, looser managed care arrangements, including PPOs (preferred provider organisations). The joint venture comes at a time when other managed care organisations are growing fast. United Healthcare, which has increased from 2.1m HMO patients at the start of the year to 3m now, said it planned to use the Dollars 2.3bn cash from its sale of a drugs distribution company to SmithKline Beecham last month to expand further through acquisition.</p>

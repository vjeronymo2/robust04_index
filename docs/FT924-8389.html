			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / T&amp;N to acquire Goetze for DM250m T&amp;N, one of the leading UK motor component makers, has reached conditional agreement to acquire Goetze, the German components maker, in a deal valued at DM250m (Pounds 101m). The takeover, which is T&amp;N's first big acquisition in Germany, will increase its worldwide turnover by more than a quarter and will substantially strengthen its position as a leading supplier of engine components. The T&amp;N share price rose yesterday by 7p to close at 142p. Goetze, which is privately owned, is the largest producer in Europe of piston rings, an important engine component, for supply to vehicle makers as original equipment. It also produces gaskets and has an important manufacturing presence in the US. Goetze made a profit before interest and tax last year of DM21m on a turnover of DM887m. At the end of June, it had a workforce of 7,838, including 5,643 in Germany. It has six plants in Germany and five in the US, as well as plants in France and in Turkey. Its profits have fallen sharply in the past three years with net income declining from DM24.6m in 1989 to DM8.5m last year. Profits before interest and tax have fallen from DM75m in 1989 to DM21m in 1991. T&amp;N had a turnover of Pounds 1.36bn last year, which would have increased to Pounds 1.71bn with the inclusion of the German group. The combined group would have had sales in Germany of Pounds 234m last year compared with Pounds 106m for T&amp;N alone. The UK group said yesterday that Goetze had already embarked on radical restructuring to improve profitability, including a reduction in the German workforce of around 700. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N, said that Goetze was now 'trading approximately at break-even', but it was expected to bring 'material earnings benefits' once the restructuring was completed. The DM250m purchase price will be payable in three instalments with DM90m due on completion of the deal, DM90m a year later and DM70m after two years. The acquisition, which needs the approval of T&amp;N shareholders and the competition authorities in the UK, Germany, France and the US, is expected to be completed by April.

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Tories face big defeat at Dudley The Conservatives face abject defeat in the Dudley West by-election on Thursday, if opinions expressed in the latest poll carry through into the voting booths. An NOP poll of 769 electors for the Express &amp; Star newspaper in Wolverhampton and Central Television News, published yesterday, gave 65 per cent of potential votes to Labour, 23 per cent to the Conservatives and 10 per cent to the Liberal Democrats. The division of opinion is a local reflection of the national standing of the parties in The Daily Telegraph's Gallup poll, also published yesterday. This put Labour's support at a record 61 per cent and that of the Conservatives at 21.5 per cent. Dudley West electors were interviewed by NOP between Monday and Thursday against the background of the government's fight with recalcitrant Tory backbenchers over value added tax on fuel, its climbdown after a lost vote in the Commons and Mr Kenneth Clarke's consequent mini-Budget. The poll found that 73 per cent of voters, regardless of voting intentions, think Labour will win. It found disillusion with the government right across the political spectrum, with 81 per cent expressing dissatisfaction with its performance since the last general election. Labour is seeking to win back a seat it lost to the Conservatives in 1979. At the 1992 general election the Tories held Dudley West with a majority of 5,789 votes, or 48.8 per cent of the total.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Deaths mount as S African taxi drivers wage war The killing of five people in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, yesterday during a shoot-out between South African police and warring minibus-taxi operators has added to a taxi-related death toll that has started to claim more lives than political violence. Despite calls for calm from the government and repeated attempts by Mr Mac Maharaj, transport minister, to broker truces between rival groups, fierce competition over lucrative routes around the country has resulted in an upsurge in violent confrontation, with hapless commuters caught in the crossfire. Police say that 200 people have been killed this year and more than 110 injured as a result of clashes between opposing taxi organisations, dubbed locally as 'taxi wars'. In large part this reflects the fact that taxi groupings are increasingly taking on criminal characteristics as shadowy operators hire hitmen to kill their rivals and destroy their vehicles. A report on the issue by the South African Police Services, submitted to parliament earlier this month, concludes that the situation is likely to deteriorate further unless there is an immediate clampdown on lawless elements in the industry. 'Taxi associations have developed a distinctive, Mafia-like character to reach economic objectives and to counter economic threats. They frequently strengthen their power bases by using armed units which have no qualms about using violence and committing murder,' the police report observes. The spark for this year's sudden surge in violence was the financial collapse of the South African Black Taxi Association in September 1993. Up to that point Sabta, which was formed in 1986, had been able to act as a loose umbrella for the industry's many regional associations. It had managed to sort out many conflicts internally. But even if an attempt, currently under way, to revive Sabta is successful, it leaves unresolved the underlying economic causes of the conflict. When the minibus industry started in the early 1980s it was hailed as an example of successful black entrepreneurship and by 1990 had managed to claim 44 per cent of the black commuter transport market. Since then the situation has changed drastically. Although no accurate figures of its size exits, analysts estimate that the industry is worth somewhere between R5bn and R8bn (Pounds 909m-Pounds 1.45bn) and employs more than 70,000 people as drivers and ancillary workers. However, since 1990 the number of taxis has continued to grow while the number of commuters has dropped slightly because of the recession. The result is a classic case of an overcrowded market: there are too many taxis and too few commuters. The obvious solution for the government is to impose strict regulation on the industry, curtailing the number of operators on big routes. However, Mr Maharaj is constrained by the fear of causing further job losses and concern that tighter regulation will merely increase the number of pirate taxis in operation. This would exacerbate the violence rather than help eliminate it.</p>

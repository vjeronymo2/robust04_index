			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Tae-yong] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The Asian sports world is  in a state of shock after North Korea decided not to participate  in team events at the Hiroshima Asian Games this October.    North Korea had been expected to take part in the Asian  sports festival to try to promote sports exchanges with other  countries and solidify its relations with Chochongnyon, a  pro-Pyongyang organization of Korean residents in Japan.    The Hiroshima Asian Games Organizing Committee (HAGOC)  announced Wednesday that North Korea sent a message earlier in  the day conveying its decision not to participate in the team  events of the Asian Games.    The deadline for the team events was May 5, while that for  individual events is July 4.    "It must have been a difficult decision," a government  official here said, "because if Pyongyang does not attend the  Asian Games, it will be further isolated from the rest of the  world."    North Korea is already isolated politically because of its  suspected nuclear ambition and economically because of its  state- controlled socialist system, which has held it from  joining such bodies as the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) or world Trade Organization (WTO).    Compounding the problem, the reclusive state has skipped  several international sports competitions.    North Korea has failed to participate in a recent series of  major international events including last year's summer  universiad in Buffalo, New York, and the winter olympic games  held in Lillehammer, Norway, in February.    If Pyongyang chooses not to attend the Asian Games being  held  in a neighboring country, Japan, then it may be because of  political or economic reasons -- not issues related to sports,  according to the official.    Pyongyang did not specify its reasons in notifying HAGOC in  the name of North Korean Olympic Committee President Pak  Myong-chol, nor did it comment on whether it would participate  in individual events, according to HAGOC.    North Korea did not take part in several international  sports  events in the past for political reasons.    For example, it refused to attend the 1984 Los Angeles  Olympics following the line of Moscow, and it did not compete in  the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics.    Although Pyongyang sent teams to the 1990 Beijing Asian  Games, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and the 1993 Winter  Universiad in Zakopane, Poland, it avoided international sports  competitions again from the 1993 Summer Universiad in Buffalo.    Meanwhile, Pyongyang's likely absence from the Asian Games  is  frustrating Seoul's plans to revive inter-Korean sports  exchanges and thus promote overall North-South relations,  according to officials.    South Korean sports officials originally planned to contact  their North Korean counterparts to revive inter-Korean soccer  and table tennis matches and discuss promoting overall  inter-Korean sports exchanges.    Moreover Seoul, trying to win the right to host the 2002  world cup soccer finals, hoped to meet with senior sports  officials from Pyongyang at the Hiroshima Asian Games to discuss  co-hosting of the world event. Now, Seoul cannot expect such  contacts.</p>

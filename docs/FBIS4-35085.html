			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Torres Hernandez] </F>   [Excerpts] Mexico City, 25 Jun (EFE) -- Ignacio Pichardo  Pagaza, president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party  [PRI], told EFE today that the contenders' respect for the  results of the 21 August presidential election is a fundamental  premise for avoiding violence.    Speaking about the position Mexicans can expect from the PRI  the day following the elections, Pichardo said: "We are  committed to scrupulously respecting the results of the votes,  the people's will as secretly expressed in the polls."    Politicians and experts have spoken about the most diverse  hypothesis as to what will happen after the elections, including  the possibility of violence once the PRI announces victory while  the opposition shouts fraud!    Pichardo said: "I do not know what is going to happen on 22  August." He mentioned two premises, though: the Chiapas factor  as a catalyst of change and a respectful attitude for the votes,  as a means of avoiding violence as an aftermath of the  presidential election.    He said Chiapas, where an Indian rebellion exploded on 1  January, gave speed to electoral changes that were in the  process as a "product of agreements reached by parties in  response to what society was demanding." He said we must "be  strict in ensuring that the votes are clear, legal, and  respected." With these two situations assured, we must work so  that there is no violence as a result of the elections, he said.  "We have an impartial and objective framework," he said.  [passage omitted]    Mentioning the Mexican observers, Pichardo said: "These will  be closely watched elections." He added: "The PRI is satisfied  because it has admitted we must not only win, but we must also  be able to convince everyone we won cleanly and lawfully."    Pichardo said the PRI "plays a fundamental role in the  country's democratic progress." He said the reforms "we have  promoted" are the best evidence the PRI clearly understands that  the path of an ever improving democracy is an irreversible path.    Regarding the political campaign of Ernesto Zedillo, who was  designated the PRI presidential candidate following the  assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, Pichardo said he is  satisfied because confidential PRI polls indicate the margin  between Zedillo and other candidates "is increasingly wider."  On 21 August, Mexicans will elect their president, 500  deputies, 96 senators, and 66 representatives to the Federal  District Assembly in the country's 300 districts, 40 of which  are in the Mexican capital.    Pichardo said that from a political viewpoint, the PRI  cannot  accept the idea it may "lose in any district or admit defeat  beforehand. This is inadmissible. The idea is to win every  single district and win the Presidency of the republic by a  broad margin." He said, however, "I am realistic and admit  there is intense competition, especially in certain urban  districts where the tallies are very close, and we have to  struggle hard to win or recover them, as the case may be."    Regarding the future of Chiapas, Pichardo said the peace  process is the responsibility of the government and the Zapatist  National Liberation Army. He said the PRI has asked the  government to seek political mechanisms to renew the dialogue,  which was officially terminated on 11 June.    Pichardo said his party can contribute to the peace process  "by creating an environment of tolerance, plurality, and calm in  the framework of which we may proclaim ourselves in favor of the  search for political, not military, solutions."</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / French go-ahead for reactor The French government yesterday gave the go-ahead to a consortium of European energy companies to restart the controversial Superphenix fast-breeder nuclear reactor for research purposes. The reactor, near Lyons, in eastern France, was shut in July 1990 because of technical faults in its fuel cooling systems. The plant will be used to study how to get rid of plutonium and other radioactive waste from France's 56 nuclear reactors. Environmental groups have opposed the restart of the reactor, but the French government has said the reactor could be restarted at limited power after safety work. Superphenix is operated by the Nersa consortium, which includes Electricite de France, Enel of Italy and SBK of Germany.</p>

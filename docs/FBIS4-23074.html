These are new materials  that are promising for use in nanoelectronics and molecular  electronic s. A new condensed state is formed in  quasi-one-dimensional conductors: a charge density wave. The  energy spectrum of one-p article and collective excitations in  this state are determined. The properties of the mechanisms of  electric conductivity and dielectric permittivity of  quasi-one-dimensional conductors are studied in a wide range of  temperatures and electric fields. Conducting Langmuir-Blodgett  films are manufactured and studied. The films are made of a  mixture of amphophilous donor and acceptor molecules. The  optimal composition of the mixture is determined from the point  of view of conductivity and film stru cture. The conductivity  activation energy is found, as well as the Hall mobility and  type of current carrier. A sharp reversible change in film  resistance is observed during heating, which is caused by  reversible changes in the structure. Mechanisms of film  conductivity are discussed on the basis of the results. Figures  23; table 1; references 68: 16 Russian, 52 Western.</p>

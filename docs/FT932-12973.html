			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Management: Big changes to take on board - After 10 years fighting the old boy network, Pro Ned now faces questions about its own future When Amstrad, the UK electronics group headed by Alan Sugar, advertised late last year for the appointment of two non-executive directors, Colin St Johnston was entitled to indulge in an ironic smile. As managing director of Pro Ned, the organisation for the promotion of non-executive directors which co-ordinated the recruitment, he was witnessing the remarkable alliance of a vocal advocate for reform of corporate governance with a company criticised for its failure to embrace the topic. A decade after it began producing annual reviews, Pro Ned retains an evangelical slant, calling regularly for an end to the 'old boy network' for appointments, and providing booklets and hosting conferences to promote better boardroom practice. But some are now questioning whether it should continue in its current form. Pro Ned came into being in 1981 with the backing of nine sponsors including the Bank of England, the Confederation of British Industry and the Stock Exchange. Its first, typewritten annual review in 1983 may have since been replaced by rather more glossy production techniques. But its objectives have remained almost unchanged. The first and primary aim was 'to create a climate of opinion in which boards perceive that it is in their own interest to put their house in order'. That meant promoting independent non-executive directors and encouraging the split of roles between chairman and chief executive. The second aim was to create a search service to help companies find these directors. In 1983, Pro Ned estimated that just 5 per cent were selected through search firms while three-quarters came through the personal recommendations of the chairman, company directors or senior management. One senior executive with knowledge of the organisation says: 'It worries me that Pro Ned lacks a clarity of purpose and focus and is not as commercial as it might be.' He cites the dominance of representatives of associations rather than working business executives on the Pro Ned board. Peter Waine, joint chief executive of Hanson Green, a search firm for non-executive directors which claims to place nearly half the estimated 600-700 vacancies a year, has 'a lot of respect' for Pro Ned. 'But I think it has probably lost its purpose as an appointments agency. It should stick to being a professional institute.' Of the 850 people on Pro Ned's register, 60 per cent are 55 or older, and just 10 per cent are women. Many names stay on the register for years without being selected. Waine says the register is too reactive, and offers candidates 'in the twilight of their careers' who are too reliant on non-executive remuneration to act independently. But St Johnston argues that Pro Ned actively canvasses for new names, and does not 'purge' its list too ruthlessly because candidates who have been untouched for years can suddenly be requested. He stresses that companies hunting for non-executives can consult the register without identifying themselves, and in the knowledge that candidates will be available. Less controversy surrounds Pro Ned's primary aim. 'The promotion of non-executives was one area in which there was no division between the City and industry,' says Jonathon Charkham, adviser to the governors of the Bank of England and Pro Ned's first director in 1981-85. Sir Adrian Cadbury, Pro Ned's chairman, says: 'Pro Ned has established itself as the one really independent source of advice and has become an accepted authority. Everyone else has an axe to grind. But we have an enormous job still to do to make directors more independent and more effective.' There is little doubt that there has been tremendous change in the last decade. According to figures from Hemmington Scott, the corporate information company, all FTSE-100 companies now have non-executive directors, as do all but 8 per cent of the 1,533 UK-quoted companies excluding investment trusts. Four-fifths have split the roles of chairman and chief executive. By contrast, a survey by the Bullock Committee showed that one quarter of the Times 1,000 companies had no non-executive directors in 1976. Even in 1982, a Bank of England survey showed 20 per cent without any on the board. How far Pro Ned was responsible for this change is difficult to assess. Other organisations and some regulators in the UK and overseas have influenced changes in corporate governance. Charkham cites at least one instance of a Pro Ned-generated idea: that quoted companies should publish details of the backgrounds of non-executive directors in their annual reports. That was taken up by the Stock Exchange, and is now a listing requirement. A more fundamental question is whether Pro Ned's campaigning zeal has been focused in the right direction. Most evidence on corporate governance is dangerously anecdotal. A recent analysis by Hemmington Scott suggests that there is little correlation between long-term corporate performance and the presence of non-executives or the separation of chairmen and chief executives. Equally, some argue that the organisation has focused on topics on which there is considerable consensus while neglecting more controversial but important issues, such as the scope for two-tier or supervisory boards. Sir Adrian says: 'That is an important question but let's not divert attention from what needs to be done here and now.' He admits that there is a tension between the campaigning and the recruitment roles of the organisation, and says he will be drawing up options for his successor before retiring from the board next year.</p>

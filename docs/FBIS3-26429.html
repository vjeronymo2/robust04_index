Autonomous  regional leaders Abulaidi Amudurexiti, Keyum Bawudun, and Wang  Yousan attended the conference, which reviewed our region's  progress in reforming its economic system last year, and studied  and planned relevant tasks to be undertaken by our region this  year.    In reforming its economic system this year, our region  should  focus on actively but steadily experimenting with the modern  enterprise system as part of its continuing efforts to deepen  enterprise reform. It should change enterprises' operating  mechanisms, vigorously promote enterprise associations, and  expedite readjustment of enterprises' organizational structure.  In small state-owned enterprises, it should actively implement  the systems of management by people under state ownership,  management by the private sector under public ownership, and  cooperation through share holdings. In optimizing and reforming  the commodity circulation system, it should continue to develop  commodity markets and expedite the process of unifying the  prices of production means. In the realm of commodity  circulation, it should shatter regional blockades, trade  monopolies, and compartmentalization. It should earnestly  change governmental functions and reform the government's  leadership system regarding economic work, so as to facilitate  efforts to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, serve  the grass roots, and raise work efficiency. It should continue  to deepen rural reform, speed up the pace of establishing social  service networks in rural areas, further accelerate the  development of village and town enterprises and the invigoration  of county-level industrial enterprises, and lead people of all  nationalities across Xinjiang toward common prosperity.    Speaking at the conference, Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy  secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and acting  chairman of the autonomous regional government, said: It is  hoped that party and government leaders at all levels will show  a strong sense of urgency, responsibility, and crisis about  speeding up reform. They should be determined to accelerate  reform in light of Xinjiang's reality. In shifting to a market  economy, they should pay close attention to properly handling  the relationship between development, reform, and stability.  They should follow the principle of first carrying out  experiments in selected areas and then popularizing the results,  gradually unfolding work on the basis of economic returns.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL AGAIN REQUESTS $3 BILLION IN U.S. AID; ENVOY VOICES OPTIMISM  </P> <P> Israel, for the fourth year in a row, asked the United States today for $3  billion in yearly aid and U.S. Ambassador William Brown said he feels certain  it will be granted without political conditions.  </P> <P> Finance Minister Shimon Peres asked for the aid at a meeting with Brown. Israel  receives the largest amount of U.S. foreign aid.  </P> <P> Brown said he does not think the Bush Administration or Congress will use aid  as a lever to force Israeli concessions in response to the Palestinian uprising  in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> He also said the request will probably be approved despite efforts to cut the  giant U.S. budget deficit.  </P> <P> The grant is apportioned into $1.2 billion in economic support and $1.8 billion  in military assistance.  </P></p>

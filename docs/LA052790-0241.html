			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AMERICANIZATION OF PAUL VERHOEVEN;  </P> <P> THE DUTCH DIRECTOR IS NOW TOTALLY IMMERSED IN HOLLYWOOD WITH THE BIG-BUDGET  ACTION MOVIE 'TOTAL RECALL,' STARRING ARNOLD YOU-KNOW-WHO  </P> <P> When Paul Verhoeven is making a movie, he's definitely a hands-on guy.  </P> <P> Just ask Arnold Schwarzenegger, who stars in "Total Recall," the Dutch  director's futuristic thriller that hits the theaters Friday. Holed up in  Mexico last summer, filming on a huge set of sound stages, Verhoeven left  nothing to chance.  </P> <P> One day Hollywood's reigning super-hero was preparing for a scene where he guns  down a nasty 21st-Century villain, blasting his face to smithereens. "When I  shot him in the forehead, we had the explosions rigged up," Schwarzenegger  recalled the other day. "But Paul wanted to make sure it really looked real. He  said, 'Let me try it. I want to see how it works.'  </P> <P> "So he had our crew strap a load of explosives onto him and blast them off on  his forehead. It was a real blast. Boom! It really knocked him around.  </P> <P> "I looked at Paul, a little bit amazed. But he looked very happy. He said, 'Oh,  I really like it. This is going to be great!' "  </P> <P> Nearly a year later, Verhoeven is just as obsessively involved with his film,  on the phone in an empty theater on the Columbia Pictures lot, anxiously trying  to juggle his hectic schedule. With Tri-Star Pictures moving "Total Recall" up  two weeks to get a jump on its brawny action-adventure rivals (and avoid a June  15 showdown with "Dick Tracy"), Verhoeven has been racing around, mixing his  film in the morning and watching special effects in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Perched behind a 20-foot-long mixing board, the 51-year-old director peers at a  blotchy black-and-white print, bereft of sound effects, music and visual  trickery. In fact, all that's visible on screen is a wild brawl between a pair  of fiery femmes fatales. Outfitted in 2084-style pants suits, they throw right  hooks and flying tackles, all orchestrated with noisy grunts and groans.  </P> <P> Verhoeven may get a kick out of testing explosives on his head, but he knows a  little dynamite goes a long way. "It's so noisy," he says to his sound editors.  "We've got to get rid of some of these grunts and groans."  </P> <P> As they roll the scene again, he keeps up a steady, decisive patter: "The kick  to the face is in. . . . The stomach punch is out. . . . The elbow in the back  is out. . . . There! Where she gets hit in the stomach. That's one ughh! too  many."  </P> <P> His team of editors punched computer keys, relaying his instructions, as  Verhoeven tried to explain the crucial importance of sound mixing.  </P> <P> "You have to select exactly what you want the audience to hear, just as if  you're selecting what camera shot you want," he said with a soft Dutch accent.  "In this film we have futuristic cars, so we had to invent a new sound. It's a  difficult choice, because you can't go too far away from what the audience is  familiar with. So we created a car sound that is a mixture of what people would  recognize -- and something that feels like the future."  </P> <P> Verhoeven merrily nodded his head. "So it shouldn't sound exactly like a  Lamborghini. But like a Lamborghini with something extra!"  </P> <P> It's easy to understand why Verhoeven is excited about having so many effects  at his disposal. In 1985, after 15 years as Holland's most celebrated -- and  controversial -- filmmaker, he abandoned a comfortable art-house career for a  shot at the Hollywood Big Time.  </P> <P> The differences in scale are astounding. Shot in Mexico with four camera units  often going simultaneously, "Total Recall" reportedly cost a whopping $65  million. That's more than all of Verhoeven's previous films combined, even if  you include the $15-million price tag for "RoboCop," his breakthrough 1987  American hit.  </P> <P> A candid, disarmingly modest man with a sly sense of humor, Verhoeven knows  budgets are skyrocketing all over town. "Our movie was expensive," he said with  a grin. "But from what I hear about some of the other movies coming out this  summer, it's not the only one, yes?"  </P> <P> "Total Recall" won't be just another summer special-effects clunker. For years,  critics have raved -- and sometimes fulminated -- about the incandescent images  that populate Verhoeven's movies.  </P> <P> His audacious 1984 film, "The Fourth Man," is as wildly erotic and garishly  goofy as anything Pedro Almodovar ever attempted (if only for the scene where  we see a lovelorn man praying in church, beset by visions of his lover -- in  red bikini underwear -- as the crucified Christ). A scathing indictment of  Dutch bourgeois life, "Spetters" offers the exploits -- with plenty of graphic  sex and violence -- of a trio of rebellious, motorcycle-mad kids.  </P> <P> From his youthful documentaries to "RoboCop," Verhoeven has shown an abiding  fascination with man's precarious grip on life. And no wonder. Verhoeven spent  his childhood in wartime Holland, which was occupied by Nazi Germany and  subjected to daily Allied bombing raids.  </P> <P> His home, in The Hague, was just a mile away from the launching pads of  Germany's deadly V-1 rockets. As a tot, Verhoeven watched the missiles blast  off each night, zooming over the roof of his house, followed later in the  evening by waves of American planes, swooping in to bomb German military  targets.  </P> <P> "I remember sitting with my parents at the dinner table when the bombs  completely destroyed a building 20 yards from our house," said Verhoeven, whose  mop of unkempt gray hair, faded work shirt and piercing gaze give him the air  of a history professor on holiday. "It blew out all our windows and sent the  glass shattering across the dinner table. It was just fate that nothing ever  happened to me or my family."  </P> <P> In a wartime childhood, fate offers strange twists. One day Verhoeven and his  school chums were playing, scrambling on top of a neighborhood wall. Suddenly a  vehicle full of German troops screeched to a halt. The soldiers leaped out,  rifles drawn.  </P> <P> "They came over and made us line up against the wall, as if we were prisoners,"  Verhoeven said softly. "They looked very serious. They cocked their guns and  pretended to shoot us, like a firing squad. Then they just laughed and got into  the jeep and drove away."  </P> <P> Verhoeven views these events as more absurd than traumatic. "I saw horrible  things," he said over lunch at the Columbia commissary. "You would walk out in  the morning and see dead people on the street. I'm sure if I had lost a brother  or had been Jewish, I would have had a different experience.  </P> <P> "But if you're just a child, war is fascinating. When I saw John Boorman's  film, 'Hope and Glory,' I was amazed, because I remembered the same things.  When the bombs hit, we'd say, 'Great! School's out!' It was like that seeing  the V-1. If you didn't know about the death they caused, they were the most  exciting things you'd ever seen. It was like living in an amazing movie. That  was my childhood -- surrounded by these incredible visual effects!"  </P> <P> Verhoeven's barbed Dutch films won critical plaudits here, but in Holland he  often found himself in disfavor. "The critics called me a decadent, perverted  person who was not representative of Dutch culture," he said with a frown. "I  got a really negative response on 'Spetters.' I tried to make a serious study  of behavior, but people were outraged. They even created an anti-'Spetters'  committee, which said the film was anti-feminist, anti-invalid and  anti-homosexual."  </P> <P> Finding it increasingly difficult to raise money for his films, Verhoeven moved  to America. His first English-language film, "Flesh and Blood," was a flop.  Soon afterwards, Verhoeven was offered "RoboCop" -- and turned it down. His  wife finally persuaded him to reconsider.  </P> <P> "She's the brains of the family," he said with a sheepish grin. "I thought  'RoboCop' was horrible when I first read it. I missed all the different levels  in the script. But my wife remembered how much I liked 'Frankenstein' and she  immediately saw that concept in the script -- the robot man seeking his own  life -- so I changed my mind."  </P> <P> The film revived old boyhood memories. "It's true -- I had a poster of Boris  Karloff as Frankenstein's monster over my bed as a child," he recalled. "I also  loved Edgar Rice Burroughs. I read all his Mars stories. I even got a telescope  so I could look for Mars at night. And when I decided I wanted to be a  comic-book illustrator, the first thing I did -- when I was still very little  -- was write a book about Mars and space travel."  </P> <P> "Total Recall" gives Verhoeven a chance to elaborate on these childhood  reveries. Set a century into the future, it stars Schwarzenegger as a rugged  construction worker haunted by dreams of a former life on Mars.  </P> <P> Having grown up in a nightmarish, war-torn world, Verhoeven identifies with  "Total Recall's" disorienting odyssey of self-discovery. "It's not Dostoevsky,"  he said. "It's a thriller that's based on our childhood dreams and pleasures."  </P> <P> The "Total Recall" script had been bouncing around Hollywood for years, but  when Schwarzenegger convinced Carolco Pictures to acquire the rights for him,  the project finally kicked into gear. As soon as Schwarzenegger saw "RoboCop,"  he knew he'd found his director.  </P> <P> "I immediately called up (Carolco chief and "Total Recall" executive producer)  Mario Kassar and said, 'This guy is really good,' " Schwarzenegger said. "I'd  seen 'Soldier of Orange' and 'Turkish Delight,' but 'RoboCop' was the deciding  factor.  </P> <P> "Paul has a very provocative directing style. His movies have a lot of style  and humor. And he knows exactly where to give scenes a light flavor to loosen  up the intensity of the violence. I just showed a rough cut of 'Total Recall'  to my mother, who doesn't even understand much English. But she loved it. She  was laughing at all the right parts!"  </P> <P> Schwarzenegger also stuck up for Verhoeven during production, making sure his  director could operate without interference from nervous producers (who often  worried about the film's abundance of violence). Verhoeven had nothing but  kudos for his star.  </P> <P> "Arnold has no ego," he said. "You can say anything to him. In fact, he sat me  down at the very start and told me, 'I won't be offended if you talk to me in a  direct way. Say what you feel.' I didn't have to be diplomatic and say,  'Arnold, perhaps you could move over here and give me a different angle.' I  could just go, 'Arnold, this is bad. You look stupid!' "  </P> <P> Verhoeven acknowledged he sometimes lost his cool trying to keep the mammoth  film on schedule. "I would get so frustrated that I would get upset and angry  and I'm find myself yelling and screaming at people. I didn't feel I was losing  control. But I was close to it. The movie was so complicated that I sometimes  felt things were beyond my grasp."  </P> <P> Verhoeven shrugged. "I got more input than the computer in my head could  grasp."  </P> <P> When Verhoeven would boil over, Schwarzenegger would step in. "I tried to  remind him that problems happen on every picture -- that you can't get angry  all the time. You have to laugh about it and move on."  </P> <P> When crew members complained, Schwarzenegger played peacemaker. "I'd invite  them into my trailer, give them a tumbler of schnapps and play them some  Austrian music," he said. "That always got them to relax."  </P> <P> Like "RoboCop," "Total Recall" is laced with gory, graphic and -- yes --  crowd-pleasing violence. "People always criticize violence, but as human beings  we have genetically evolved from savage apes," said Verhoeven, calmly nibbling  at a plate of pasta. "So we're in a quandary. Morally we realize it's wrong.  But biologically we're still very close to it.  </P> <P> "You don't promote violence by showing it. Human beings have done terrible  cruel things to each other long before there were movies. The Germans didn't  see any movies promoting genocide in the 1930s. But I understand why people get  excited -- no one wants to accept that there are shadows inside all of us.  People just prefer to say, 'The violence is in you, not in me.' "  </P> <P> Verhoeven is one of the few movie directors who would see a theological link in  this debate. "You have to remember that Christianity is a religion based on one  of the most violent acts of murder -- the crucifixion. In fact, without the  crucifixion I'd say the religion wouldn't have had so much impact."  </P> <P> He nods his head. "In the end, drama is written for violence. It's built on  what goes wrong. Give the human mind 50 minutes of quiet in the dark and  everybody would be put to sleep. We need conflict and tension and violence. Or  we want to take a nap!"  </P> <P> It's no wonder that Verhoeven shows little interest in returning to his native  land. "I'm only nostalgic about Holland when I'm back there," he said, hurrying  across the studio lot, eager to return to work. "Everything was in shades of  gray. There was never something that was out of order, nothing to be angry  about.  </P> <P> "Here life seems more vital. There's so much more antagonism and excitement, so  many possibilities. It makes me feel more alive. I feel more a part of the  world here."  </P> <P> Verhoeven stopped at the door to his mixing theater. "There's no better place  for a filmmaker. Every day something happens here that makes you curious or  outraged or fascinated. In Holland, I could only read the paper for five  minutes before I'd be bored."  </P> <P> Verhoeven spread his arms wide. "Here I can read the paper for hours!"  </P></p>

A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species owing to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl is threatened by past, present, and potential future destruction and modification of its habitat, throughout a significant portion of its range in the U.S., and, to a less well-known extent, in portions of its range in Mexico (Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964, Oberholser 1974, Johnson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1979, Monson and Phillips 1981, Johnson and Haight 1985a, Hunter 1988, Millsap and Johnson 1988, Tewes 1992). The severity of habitat loss and threats varies across the pygmy-owl's range. It has been virtually extirpated from Arizona, which once constituted its major U.S. range (see Figure 1). In Texas, the pygmy-owl has been virtually extirpated from the lower Rio Grande valley, but persists in oak associations on the coastal plain north of the Rio Grande valley. The majority of these losses are because of destruction and modification of riparian and thornscrub habitats. Wide-scale loss and modification of up to 90 percent of riparian habitats in the southwestern U.S. have occurred (e.g. Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964, Carothers 1977, Kusler 1985, General Accounting Office 1988, Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988, Szaro 1989, Dahl 1990, State of Arizona 1990, Bahre 1991). These losses are attributed to urban and agricultural encroachment, woodcutting, water diversion, channelization, livestock overgrazing, groundwater pumping, and hydrological changes resulting from various land-use practices. Status information for Mexico is very limited, but some observations suggest that although habitat loss and reduced numbers are likely to have occurred in northern portions of the two populations in Mexico, the pygmy-owl persists as a locally common bird in southern portions. Habitat loss and population status are summarized below for the four populations of the pygmy-owl. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Western Populations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several habitat types are used by the pygmy-owl in the western portion of its range. These include riparian woodlands and bosques dominated by mesquite and cottonwood, Sonoran Desertscrub (usually with relatively dense saguaro cactus forests), Sinaloan Thornscrub, and Sinaloan Deciduous Forest (van Rossem 1945, Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964, Karalus and Eckert 1974, Millsap and Johnson 1988, Monson and Russell  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in prep <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Arizona <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The northernmost record for the pygmy-owl is from New River, Arizona, approximately 55 kilometers (km) (35 mi) north of Phoenix, where Fisher (1893) found it to be ``quite common'' in thickets of intermixed mesquite and saguaro cactus. Prior to the mid-1900's, the pygmy-owl was also described as a ``common,'' ``abundant,'' ``not uncommon,'' and ``fairly numerous'' resident of lowland central and southern Arizona, in cottonwood forests, mesquite-cottonwood woodlands, and mesquite bosques along the Gila, Salt, Verde, San Pedro, and Santa Cruz Rivers, and various tributaries (Coues 1872, Bendire 1888, Breninger 1898  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bent 1938, Gilman 1909, Swarth 1914, Friedmann  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1950, Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964, Johnson and Simpson 1971, Millsap and Johnson 1988). The pygmy-owl also occurs in Sonoran Desertscrub associations in southern and southwestern Arizona, comprised of paloverde, ironwood, mesquite, acacia, bursage, and columnar cacti like the saguaro and organpipe (Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964, Davis and Russell 1984 and 1990, Monson and Phillips 1981, Johnson and Haight 1985a). the pygmy-owl's occurrence in Sonoran Desertscrub has apparently always been uncommon and unpredictable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it seems to be more predictably found in xeroriparian habitats (very dense desertscrub thickets bordering dry desert washes) than more open desert uplands (Monson and Phillips 1981, Johnson and Haight 1985a, Johnson-Duncan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1988, Millsap and Johnson 1988, Davis and Russell 1990). The pygmy-owl may also occur at isolated desert oases which support small pockets of riparian or xeroriparian vegetation (Howell 1916, Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above habitats are likely to provide several requirements of pygmy-owl ecology. Trees and large cacti provide cavities for nesting and roosting. Also, these habitats along watercourses are known for their high density and diversity of animal species that constitute the pygmy-owl's prey base (Carothers 1977, Johnson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1977, Johnson and Haight 1985b, Stromberg 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pygmy-owl has declined throughout Arizona to the degree that it is now virtually extirpated from the State [Johnson <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1979, Monson and Phillips 1981, Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) 1988, Johnson-Duncan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1988, and Millsap and Johnson 1988]. Riverbottom forests and bosques, which supported the greatest abundance of pygmy-owls, have been extensively modified and destroyed by clearing, urbanization, water management, and hydrological changes (Willard 1912, Brown  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1977, Rea 1983, Szaro 1989, Bahre 1991, Stromberg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992, Stromberg 1993). Cutting for domestic and industrial fuelwood was so extensive throughout southern Arizona that, by the late 19th century, riparian forests within tens of miles of towns and mines had been decimated (Bahre 1991). Mesquite was a favored species, because of its excellent fuel qualities. The famous, vast forests of ``giant mesquites'' along the Santa Cruz River in the Tucson area described by Swarth (1905) and Willard (1912) fell to this threat, as did the ``heavy mesquite thickets'' where Bendire (1888) collected pygmy-owl specimens along Rillito Creek, a Santa Cruz River tributary, also in what is now Tucson. Only remnant fragments of these bosques remain. Cottonwoods were also felled for fuelwood, fenceposts, and for the bark, which was used as cattle feed (Bahre 1991). In recent decades, the pygmy-owl's riparian habitat has continued to be modified and destroyed by agricultural development, woodcutting, urban expansion, and general watershed degradation (Brown  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1977, Phillips  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1964, State of Arizona 1990, Bahre 1991, Stromberg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992, Stromberg 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trend of Sonoran Desertscrub habitats and pygmy-owl occupancy is not as clear. Historical records from this habitat in Arizona are few. This may be due to disproportionate collecting along rivers where humans were concentrated, while the upland deserts were less intensively surveyed. Johnson and Haight (1985a) suggested that the pygmy-owl adapted to upland cactus associations and xeroriparian habitats in response to the demise of Arizona's riverbottom woodlands. However, conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis is not available. It may be that desertscrub habitats simply are of lesser quality, and have always been occupied by pygmy-owls at lower frequency and density (Johnson and Haight 1985b, Taylor 1986). The few pygmy-owls located in recent years have been fairly evenly distributed between remaining riverbottom woodlands, desertscrub, and xeroriparian habitats. Sonoran Desertscrub has been affected to varying degrees by urban and agricultural development, woodcutting, and livestock grazing (Bahre 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hunter (1988) found fewer than 20 verified records of pygmy-owls in Arizona for the period of 1971 to 1988. In 1992, surveys located three single pygmy-owls in Arizona (Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, unpubl. data, SWCA, Inc. 1993). In 1993, more extensive surveys again located three single pygmy-owls in Arizona (Felley and Corman 1993, AGFD and Service, unpubl. data). Although  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. b. cactorum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is diurnal and frequently vocalizes in the morning, the species was not recorded or reported in breeding bird survey data (Robbins  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

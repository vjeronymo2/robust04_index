			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defense Institute for Fire Research in New  Delhi has developed a fire fighting system that can detect and  put out fires in less than one-fourth of a second. The director  of the institute, Major General B.S. Kataria, said the automatic  fire and explosion suppression system, as it is called, has been  fitted on the MBT [Main Battle Tank]-Arjun tank and is to be  fitted also on the T-72 tanks. He said this fire fighting  system has been integrated with another system to alert the tank  crew in the event of a nuclear, biological, and chemical attack.  The fire protection system can also be fitted in ships and  armored personnel carriers.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikio Furuyama, chief of Gifu Bureau] </F>   [Text] Gifu Prefecture's Kakamigahara City is planning to  establish an R&amp;D base for virtual reality technology. The  deindustrialization of the existing automobile parts and apparel  industries, which have been hit hard by the high exchange rate  of the yen, the city has decided to entice the R&amp;D divisions  of  VR-related companies to fill the industrial void. However, the  fact that the local businesses have had little exposure to  VR-related industries, combined with the fact that the  accumulation of VR technology by the prefecture itself is  neglibile, left the local companies in bewilderment. How is the  city going to pursuade companies located both outside and within  the prefecture to set up their R&amp;D bases in Kakamigahara? The  issues are numerous.    Kakamigahara City is proceeding with this plan after it had  been approved by the country under the provision of its  Intelligent Construction Site Law (the law governing the  promotion of the aggregate of specified enterprises designed to  contribute to the advancement of regional industries). A total  of 38 organizations and businesses, including Gifu Prefecture,  Kakamigahara City, the Regional Development and Maintenance  Public Corporation, and local businesses, invested in an R&amp;D  organization, V.R. Techno Center, Kakamigahara City (Governor of  Gifu Prefecture, Hiroshi Kajihara, serving as the center's  director), which will serve as a parent body of this  undertaking. Thus, the techno-center officially began its  operations in April, 1993, with a total capital of &yen;2.3  billion. Among the investors are Kawasaki Heavy Industries,  Mitsubishi Electric, Sony, Sanyo Electric, Kansai Electric  Power, Shimizu Corporation, and Sega Enterprise, an impressive  lineup of major companies from outside the prefecture.    A site planned for construction of the center is located in  the Suei District of Kakamigahara City, with a total development  area of 17 hectares. Of these, an area of 1 hectare will be used  as a building lot, with a surrounding lot of approximately 8  hectares to be used in creation and maintenance of the "VR  Techno Japan," a business development designed to attract  private industries to construct their R&amp;D facilities. By this  fall, the purchase of the building lot will be completed, with  construction and creation of facilities starting in 1994/95. The  sale of parceled land is expected to begin in 1996. In addition  to VR-related companies, the city plans to invite participation  of information processing, software development, mechanical  design, and design companies as well.    The center which will be constructed at the investment of  &yen;2.2 billion will have the floor space of approximately  3,340 square meters. It will be equipped with a VR research  laboratory, a shared research laboratory, a computer graphics  and CAD/CAM (computer-assisted design and manufacturing)  practice room, and a rental research laboratory. A large-scale  supercomputer capability will also be introduced to the center  on an hourly rental basis.    "Today, when even the automobile industry is facing  deindustrialization as a result of moving its manufacturing base  to overseas sites, we must make the first move by constructing a  VR technology base." Governor Kajihara, who directs the project  as the center's top executive, has high hopes for VR as one of  the most promising industries to emerge in the post-automobile  industrial era. The fact that Kawasaki Heavy Industries'  aerospace division, equipped with a test flight simulation  center, is located in Kakamigahara is an advantage to the city.  The Prefecture's corporate enterprise section views this as an  advantage since "the accumulation of aerospace-related  businesses such as this will be helpful in the development of VR  technology."    However, many local businesses have reservations as  indicated  by their reactions, "since the future is unknown, we don't know  how we can participate in this project." Even among the  corporate investors, there are some who are saying, "our  investment basically is no more than what we felt was our  obligation to the business community. The project itself does  not interest us that much." In order to uncover companies'  needs, the center established a research forum, calling mainly  for participation of local businesses. Because of the  recessionary economy, however, response has been slow. Akira  Takeuchi, chief of the corporate construction site section, also  [says], "VR technology is rapidly advancing. Of all the local  self-government bodies in the country, we were the first to come  up with this idea of using VR technology to revitalize our local  economy. It simply doesn't make sense if we are to slow down  now."</p>

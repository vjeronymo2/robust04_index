			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Tough at the top TEMPTING though it may be to attack the governor-elect of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, for accepting what amounts to a significant pay increase in these dark times, this reaction would be misplaced. Since Mr George wants his pay to be frozen over his five-year term, nobody can be quite sure what his real pay will be. True, the starting point is higher than at any other job in the public sector. It is also substantially higher than that of Mr George's opposite number in the Treasury, Sir Terence Burns. But then Sir Terence can console himself with the thought that as long as the Bank is denied independent status, it is he who has the power, if not the pay. If Mr George's judgment is to be questioned, it might well be on the grounds that he has been prepared to take a bet, in his personal financial arrangements, on the future course of a monetary policy over which he has only limited influence. Inflation is now almost certainly close to its low point in the present economic cycle. If the gap between the yield on fixed interest and index-linked gilts is any guide, the market is assuming a long run rate of inflation of around 5 per cent. In short, by the time Mr George retires, inflation will have reduced the purchasing power of the pound in his pocket by more than 20 per cent. There is thus every possibility that both the chancellor and his permanent secretary will be catching up in real terms with Mr George over the next five years. Only when they freeze their pay - or declare the Bank independent - will the government's inflation target of 0-4 per cent begin to carry much credibility.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, May 19 (AFP) -- The European court of  justice dismissed a suit by Air France on Thursday [19 May]  seeking to stop British Airways from buying out 49.9 percent of  the French air company TAT.    The case dates back to November 1992 when the European  Commission gave the go-ahead for the purchase. Air France  lodged an appeal three months later, arguing that commission  officials handling antitrust and competition regulations had  refused to apply them to British Airways though they had  enforced them in other comparable circumstances.</p>

Raja Mohan: "U.S. Harps on Human Rights </F> Violation"]    [Text] Washington, Jan. 25--The Indian Ambassador to the  United States, Mr. Siddharth Shankar Ray, has conveyed to the  Clinton Administration, New Delhi's concern over the series of  negative pronouncements on Kashmir, Punjab and human rights that  have emanated from the highest political level in Washington.  The Ambassador yesterday told the Assistant Secretary of State  for South Asian Affairs, Ms. Robin Raphel, of the larger  negative impact of these statements on the bilateral relations.    India had instructed Mr. Ray to convey its unhappiness with  the turn of events in Washington, in particular the recent  letters of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to supporters  of secessionist movement in Kashmir and Punjab.    U.S. deeply troubled: In a separate development,  the Clinton Administration has informed the U.S. Congress that  it is pressing India "to strengthen the recently formed Human  Rights Commission, prosecute human rights violators, and allow  access to Kashmir by human rights monitoring groups,  particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross."  Responding to concerns expressed in the U.S. Congress about  human rights violations in Kashmir, the U.S. State Department  has said that it is "deeply troubled" by the reports of human  rights abuses in Kashmir, "both by Indian security forces and by  militant groups."    In a letter to Mr. Tom Lantos, the chairman of the  Congressional Human Rights Caucus, the Assistant Secretary of  State for Legislative Affairs, Ms. Wendy R. Sherman, said the  Clinton Administration had regularly raised human rights  concerns with the Indian officials "as part of an intensified  dialogue on human rights, urging them to bring an end to such  abuses." The letter sent in late December was made available  today to correspondents here.    Patronising tone: The formulations in the letter  reflect attempts in the recent weeks by the State Department to  make the administration's articulation of Kashmir policy less  offensive. But it is well short of amounting to a fair position  on the Kashmir issue. The positive reference to Indian  democratic tradition is marred by the patronising tone of the  letter: "India is a democratic State with the capacity to reform  itself, and we will continue to encourage this process at every  opportunity."    For once, the administration acknowledges, in the letter to  Mr. Lantos, the linkage between the insurgency and the human  rights situation in Kashmir and it notes that Washington has  "urged all parties involved to resolve their differences  peacefully and abstain from violence." But by equating the  responsibility of the Indian State to restore law and order and  protect innocent citizens from the ravages of militancy in  Kashmir with the terrorist violence sponsored by Pakistan, the  formulation slips into the by now familiar diplomatic sleight of  hand.    Standard formulation: The letter from the State  Department also reiterates the now standard American formulation  on resolving the Kashmir problem: "We believe the resolution of  the Kashmir problem can be best achieved through negotiations  between India and Pakistan, taking into account the wishes of  the people of Kashmir." The State Department has clarified in  the recent past that the reference to the wishes of the people  of Kashmir, does not imply a support to the notion of the  self-determination, it is only a recognition of the practical  necessity of making any Indo-Pakistan agreement on Kashmir  acceptable to the people of Kashmir.    The administration also indicated that it does not favour  the  plebiscite or any other particular procedure for ascertaining  the wishes of the Kashmiri people. It suggested that the  procedure could be decided within the framework of Indo-Pakistan  negotiations. These verbal gymnastics, however, do not obfuscate  the fact that the Clinton administration has gone far beyond the  fair position outlined by the Bush administration in 1990  favouring the Simla agreement as the means of resolving the  Indo-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir. Nor does it hide the  ill-advised posture of activism and intervention in Kashmir  adopted by the Clinton administration.    Washington is also yet to recognise that its activism has  complicated the Indian efforts to initiate a political process  in Jammu and Kashmir. The American rhetoric on human rights and  Kashmir along with signals of White House support for  secessionist groups has generated strong illusions among the  militants in Kashmir and the political establishment in Pakistan  that Washington will be able to deliver through international  diplomatic action, what they have not been able to achieve on  the battlefield.    Kashmiri Pandits' plea: The lack of balance in the  Clinton Administration's position on Kashmir was the main theme  that a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits based in the United States  sought to present Ms. Robin Raphel, who saw them yesterday. The  group from the Indo-American Kashmir Forum [IAKF] drew the  attention of the State Department to the plight of their  community, and called on the United States to take a more  even-handed approach to the Kashmir problem. They also told Ms.  Raphel that "any tilt or even the perception of a tilt towards  one party or the other will effectively erode the role the  United States can play and should play in resolving the Kashmir  problem."    The group of Kashmiri Pandits, who support the creation of a  Union territory within the Kashmir valley for their community,  have called on the United States "to publicly identify Kashmir  Pandits as a party to the dispute and settlement in Kashmir." In  a press conference yesterday, the IAKF said Ms. Raphel assured  them that the U.S. is fully aware of the complexity of the  Kashmir issue, and has no intention of being one-sided in its  approach. The IAKF is also intensifying the efforts of the  Kashmiri Pandits in the United States to present their case to  the Congressmen and familiarise them with the dimensions of the  Kashmir problem that have been barely noticed, let alone  understood in the United States.    To the extent that the complexity of the Kashmir problem can  be brought before the American public such lobbying effort may  have some value. But it will be tragic if different sections of  the people of Jammu and Kashmir begin to believe in the illusion  that the road to peace in Kashmir runs through Washington.  Neither the letter writing by Mr. Clinton, nor the human rights  cacophony from the U.S. Congress can bring peace to Kashmir. It  has not so far in Bosnia. Only a democratic political process  within the framework of the Indian Union can restore peace and  tranquillity to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  <H5>  Congressmen's assurance </H5>   UNI, PTI report:    Meanwhile, the Republican Party Congressmen--Mr. Jim Ramstad  and Mr. Rodney Grams--have agreed to take up the Pandits' case  and promised to help arrange a special Congressional hearing to  highlight their plight.</p>

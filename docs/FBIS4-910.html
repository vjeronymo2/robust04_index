			<p>BFN     [Text] Libreville, 15 Apr (AFP) -- The Gabonese opposition  "will not allow anyone to annihilate it and will continue to act  democratically," its leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, assured a  news conference in Libreville today.    Speaking one day after his return from a visit to Paris,  which lasted more than one month, the chairman of the  opposition's High Council of Resistance [HCR] said that "if we  must resort to demonstrations to express our point of view, we  will do so." "Demonstrations and rallies are part of the HCR's  program, and no one can ask us to halt them. We will not allow  anyone to annihilate us and we will continue to act  democratically. We avoid violence and we will not take up  arms," Father Abessole added.    The opposition leader also made "an urgent appeal to the  government for the immediate release of those arrested in  February" during unrest in Libreville. According to Father  Abessole, "at least 80" supporters of his party, the National  Lumberjacks Rally [RNB], were arrested.    The government has blamed the opposition leader and his  party  for the violence which resulted in nine deaths, according to  official figures, which also reported that 77 people were  arrested, although some were released immediately.    Meanwhile, HCR Deputy Chairman Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe  stated that the negotiations with the government to defuse the  crisis that emerged after President Omar Bongo's reelection in  December 1993, which was rejected by the opposition, "have not  started yet." According to the HCR, the negotiations depend on  the revision of the electoral code, because "if a true  law-abiding state is not established, we will no longer  participate in elections," Agondjo- Okawe added. He rejected  the government's scheduling of local elections for August  because the date "was not negotiated."</p>

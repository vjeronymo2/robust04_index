As of 1 January 1994 and for a period of five years, he will be  the Center's director general. The 51-year-old British  professor succeeds Italian Carlo Rubbia as the head of the  European particle physics laboratory. Smith, who is chief of  Oxford University's Physics Department, has always been closely  involved with developments in particle accelerator physics, a  science which investigates the smallest elements of matter. He  was one of the advocates of the Hamburg-based HERA  electron-proton collider and contributed to the definition of  research priorities through the CERN's Scientific Directions  Committee.</p>

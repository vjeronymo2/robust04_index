			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed E. In.: "Fight Against International Drug </F> Traffic: France and Morocco Adopt a Drug Cooperation Program"]    [Text] The fourth leading exporter of cannabis resin  worldwide, Morocco remains the main supplier of hashish imported  into France. Faced with this unpleasant economic fact  (unpleasant for King Hassan II's allies), late last week Paris  and Rabat adopted a cooperation program to fight drugs.    The joint action plan, which reflects the Moroccan  authorities' change of attitude since the fall of 1992, aims to  reduce the Moroccan production of cannabis resin, which the Drug  Geopolitical Observation Council estimated at more than 1,500  tons in 1992, for about 30,000 hectares [ha] under  cultivation.[.sup]1[/] The Moroccan king corrected that  figure, mentioning 50,000 ha under cultivation.    In traditional cannabis-growing areas, i.e., the Rif and the  northern provinces, French-Moroccan cooperation will involve  projects to develop tourism and mountain economy and create  small- and mid-size businesses, as well as agronomic research  and drinking-water supply projects.    On the repressive side, the plan of action mentions the  organization of seminars on police and customs methods, the  exchange of information on trafficker networks, and improved  judicial cooperation. Seventy years after the French state  authorized cannabis growing in northern Morocco, under the  control of the Moroccan Bureau of Kif and Tobacco,  French-Moroccan cooperation comes up to the expectations of the  European Council which, in December, adopted a specific program  to fight drug in Morocco, and invited member states to sign  bilateral agreements.

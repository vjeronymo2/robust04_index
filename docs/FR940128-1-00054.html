			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;123.28(b)(2) and (b)(3), the shellstock tag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a licensed harvester or certified processor, or the bill of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lading accompanying bulk shipments, will contain the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under proposed &sect;1240.60(b) and thus document whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shellfish are from an acceptable source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed requirement &sect;123.28(b) that only shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drawn from such acceptable sources can be processed will place a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premium on properly tagged products from shellfish dealers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States or nations that participate in NSSP have certified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is further proposing to require in &sect;123.28(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that shucked products be subject to the same requirements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to shellstock. FDA is doing so because the safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shucked shellfish products, like shellstock, depends on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of the water where they are grown. Therefore, the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is further proposing to require in &sect;123.28(d) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor maintain records that document that each lot of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish meets the tagging or labeling requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.28 (b) or (c) (see Refs. 104 and 108). The information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require to be maintained in records simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects these requirements. Permanent records are needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that processors are controlling the origin of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish they process. In addition, permanent records will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate epidemiological investigations by allowing complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product traceability to the source of origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The protection of shellfish consumers also requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domestic and imported products be treated equally. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported raw molluscan shellfish are subject to the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards as domestic shellfish with regard to adulteration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misbranding, Federal law does not require that imported shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come from waters that were classified by a public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. This double standard is unfair to domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors, and both ISSC and industry representatives have urged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Government to address this problem (Refs. 111 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 112). While virtually all States have chosen to reject imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish that are not tagged as coming from classified waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 113), it is known that such shellfish nonetheless enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate commerce (Ref. 107). Untagged imports originating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from uncertified producers compromise the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood safety programs (Ref. 7, p. 73) and product traceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA is proposing that all raw shellfish products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either from domestic or foreign origin must comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in part 123 and &sect;1240.60.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, if &sect;123.28(b), for example, is adopted, it will mean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that only those molluscan shellfish that are harvested in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign country that has a program that incorporates the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures set out in the NSSP for approving growing waters will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for processing. Such a program will need to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures that provide for water classification, monitoring, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other related activities if it is to ensure that the growing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters that it approves are safe, and thus that the shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are drawn from such waters are not adulterated. FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found that the best way to establish that a foreign country's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program meets this standard is through the development of an MOU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the agency and that country. Currently, such agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist with Australia, Canada, Chile, England, Iceland, Japan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Republic of Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, FDA anticipates that these proposed requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will improve the safety of raw molluscan shellfish by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing uniform requirements for domestic and imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and prohibiting interstate movement of shellfish that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not properly tagged to demonstrate that it came from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate harvesting area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effectiveness of State shellfish sanitation programs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NSSP will be strengthened by the proposed mandatory tagging,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling, and recordkeeping requirements, which will allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete product traceability to its source of origin. Should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses occur, product traceability will facilitate a rapid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of when a problem occurred and allow immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedial actions to restore public health controls. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring proper tagging or labeling will place a premium on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and foreign shellfish sanitation and processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

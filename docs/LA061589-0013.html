			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: WHAT PRICE FOR A GLIMPSE OF ELVIS' GRANDDAUGHTER?  </P> <P> Elvis Presley's genes are the next best thing to the King himself, judging by  this week's People magazine and the tabloid National Enquirer. Both  publications feature cover photos -- apparently obtained by checkbook and by  stealth and heralded with large headline type -- of the late rock 'n' roll  legend's first grandchild, born May 29 in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Outweighing the turmoil in China at 7 pounds, 2 ounces, Danielle Riley Keough,  born to Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, is an earth-shaking event in  celebrity-oriented journals, where Elvis remains a staple nearly 12 years after  his death. Both People and the Enquirer clearly expected to score exclusives  with the first photos of the infant. And both believe they did -- despite the  duplication.  </P> <P> A source at the National Enquirer said that the tabloid declined to bid the  $450,000 being asked for Los Angeles photographer Cesare Bonazza's photos of  the baby with her parents -- partly because the Enquirer had obtained its own  photos by secret methods and partly because the price was too high given the  subject. The Enquirer photos show the infant alone, swaddled and in a bassinet,  leading to the suspicion that the photos are an 'inside' job -- by a member of  the hospital staff or of the Presley retinue.  </P> <P> Enquirer Assistant Executive Editor John Cathcart declined to discuss  specifics, including how much his paper paid for its photos. "We would not have  paid that much," said Cathcart, referring to the price allegedly paid by  People. "To us it wasn't worth it. . . . Elvis Presley in his coffin was  probably a more significant picture than this."  </P> <P> Cathcart clearly implied that the Enquirer's photos were the result of months  of preparation. "We were planning for this long before the baby was born," he  said, refusing to give details.  </P> <P> People is thought to have paid a still staggering $300,000 for Bonazza's  photos, snapped in a 10-minute session the day after birth. They include the  color cover photo of mother and child and an inside black and white double-page  spread of mother and father -- musician Danny Keough -- with the baby.  </P> <P> In both cases the baby girl has a pacifier in her mouth and her eyes are  closed, a source of glee to Enquirer Articles Editor David Perel who crowed, "I  think we have the better baby picture by far." (In a third photo in People the  baby isn't using a pacifier but her eyes are closed. The baby's eyes are  half-open in the Enquirer cover photo and half-open in its inside picture,  which by Perel's computations apparently add up to a wide-eyed portrait.)  </P> <P> Cathcart said that "three, or four at the most" publications were approached to  make offers on the Bonazza photos, with the bidding handled by L.A. attorney  Stephen Spataro. Neither Bonazza nor Spataro returned calls. People spokeswoman  Elizabeth Wagner declined to confirm or deny how the magazine got the photos,  or how much it paid, saying, "We never discuss the nature of how information is  obtained."  </P> <P> Articles accompanying the ballyhooed photographs in both publications report  that Elvis' grandchild was the object of extremely tight security and that the  family went to great lengths to maintain privacy at the hospital, which had  been staked out by photographers.  </P> <P> To flesh out its story, People fell back on quotes from a December, 1988,  interview in Life magazine with Lisa Marie and her mother, Priscilla. The  Enquirer extensively quotes "a source close to the couple" and reiterates its  revelation of last week that "a weird group" had threatened to kidnap the  newborn. Meanwhile, People hinted that the secrecy surrounding the child may be  at the insistence of the Church of Scientology, which claims both parents and  grandmother Priscilla as members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Radiating Warmth  </P> <P> The second installment of The New Yorker's three-part series on radiation may  send a chill through people who are used to sleeping warm. In this week's  issue, writer Paul Brodeur cites research by a Denver scientist that seems to  indicate a greater rate of miscarriage among women who use electric blankets  and electrically heated water beds than those who don't. The research conducted  in 1983 and 1984 by Nancy Wertheimer is one of many investigations reported by  Brodeur in his examination of the effects of electromagnetic radiation -- from  high-current power lines and some radar systems as well as electric blankets --  on human beings.  </P> <P> These and other radiation sources that have been linked to increased rates of  cancer are likely to become the source of major liability battles in the near  future, Brodeur asserts. One large potential source of liability may well be  the nation's computer industry, he concludes. " . . . What will be the  liability of the nation's vast computer industry for claims arising from  illnesses that may be caused by exposure to the low-level electric and magnetic  fileds that are known to be produced by video display terminals, of which there  are now some thirty million in use in the United States alone?" he asks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victorian Victory  </P> <P> One alternative to reality is a make-believe, romantic past where the weather,  economics, politics, skin blemishes and dirty dishes are conspicuous by their  absence.  </P> <P> That's exactly where Victoria magazine can be found -- in a pristine time where  career tracks become country lanes.  </P> <P> By creating an updated, spic-and-span version (no whalebone corsets, no soot,  no grime) of the Victorian Age, the 2-year-old magazine has tapped a rich vein  of yearning and nostalgia in the harried denizens of 1989. One indication of  this retro mother lode is that the magazine -- which began as Good  Housekeeping's Victoria in March, 1987, and evolved from a quarterly to  bimonthly by early last year -- will become a monthly in September.  </P> <P> The stepped-up publication schedule reflects a strong reader response to the  magazine's editorial blend of soft-focus fashion, home decorating and  architecture, cooking and entertaining, personal care, gardens and lush  landscapes, says editor Nancy Lindemeyer who grew up in a Victorian House.  Circulation is 750,000, up from a newsstand-only distribution of 400,000 copies  for the first issue.  </P> <P> The magazine has been such a hit with some of its readers that they've formed a  club, the Victorian Tea and Garden Society, to share their passion for the  lace, crystal and ribbon world of long ago, Lindemeyer says, noting that the  group stays in touch via newsletter.  </P> <P> While the magazine has attracted a few male readers, the majority of its  circulation is among women interested in "reviving those sensibilities" of an  era "when a lot of things were handmade, when you did ride a bicycle through  the countryside with a picnic hamper," Lindemeyer says. "People needed a place  to relax," Lindemeyer added, explaining that readers spend an average of two  hours poring over each issue.  </P> <P> In the June issue, that two hours was devoted to articles on makeup that  reproduces "the delicate tints of old-fashioned photographs," wisteria's purple  blooms, party dresses, a variety of gardens and houses and a calendar of  "Events, Occasions, Celebrations."  </P> <P> One of these latter items advised that "an enchanting array of teapots is  turning a small southern city into a mecca for tea lovers and art aficionados  alike. Trenton, Tenn., is home to more than 500 veilleuses-theieres, lavishly  decorated teapots that doubled as night lights in the 18th and 19th centuries."  Victoria advised that a festival celebrating the collection begins "with a  breathtaking lighting-of-the-teapots ceremony and is highlighted by a tour of  the treasures, parades, concerts, and, appropriately enough, lots of tea  parties."  </P> <P> Let the good times roll.  </P></p>

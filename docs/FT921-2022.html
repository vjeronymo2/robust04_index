			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries gain as trade data attracts attention US Treasury prices posted gains along the length of the yield curve in thin trading yesterday as the market ignored an unexpected sharp drop in jobless claims and turned its attention, instead, to favourable trade data. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell through the psychologically-important 8 per cent mark in the morning. The long bond was unable to hold on to its highs for the day, and was quoted  7/16 higher at 100 9/32 to yield 7.97 per cent in late trading. Movement was less pronounced among shorter-dated maturities, with the three-year note firming  3/32 to yield 6.25 per cent. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange Dollars 2bn customer repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 4 1/16 per cent. The operation, which adds reserves to the banking system, had no implications for official policy. The market took a 27,000 decline in jobless claims for the week ended March 7 in its stride, although the drop was larger than expected. Instead, there was some buying on the back of merchandise trade figures for January, which showed a decline in exports for a third consecutive month. UK GOVERNMENT bonds slipped back again on political uncertainty, with the fall in the other European government bond markets contributing to the weak sentiment. With the latest round of opinion polls showing that neither the Labour party nor the Conservative party has a clear lead in the general election campaign, the market is likely to focus on fresh polls this weekend, traders said. In addition, yesterday's unemployment figures were seen as 'politically negative' and unlikely to provide much comfort for the gilt market, according to dealers. The figures showed a seasonally adjusted rise of 40,200 in the number of unemployed in February, taking the total number of jobless to 2.64m, the highest level since October 1987. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt fell from Wednesday's close of 112 to 112 7/32 by late afternoon, yielding 9.875 per cent. Shorter-dated stocks held up better as traders point out that disappointment over the diminished prospects of a base rate cut has already been discounted by the market. The 10 per cent gilt due 1996 slipped from 100 1/8 to 100 1/32 , yielding 9.97 per cent. FRENCH government bonds fell nearly a quarter of a percentage point, reflecting concern over the outcome of the regional elections this Sunday. The June futures contract on the Paris Matif fell from Wednesday's close of 107.98, opening at 107.88 yesterday and dropping to 107.68 by late afternoon. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds weakened during the afternoon as worries about wage talks continued to unsettle the market. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.96 and traded in a range of 87.76 to 88.00 before ending the day at around 87.86. Volume was average with about 48,000 contracts traded. SPECULATION that the Bank of Japan will cut the official discount rate by between 50 and 75 basis points during the next few days pushed up Japanese government bond prices. The market opened on a firm note, and the futures contract climbed from 102.76 to close at 102.88. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue started at 5.35 per cent and ended at 5.345 per cent, trading in a range of 5.335 to 5.385 per cent. Some Japanese newspapers carried reports yesterday predicting a cut in interest rates next week, from 4.5 per cent to either 3.75 per cent or 4.0 per cent. The Bank of Japan took the money market by surprise when it injected Y800bn in funds shortly before the close of trading, pushing the overnight unsecured call rate down to 4.5 per cent from 5 5/8 per cent.</p>

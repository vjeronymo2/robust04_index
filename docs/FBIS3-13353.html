Kozyrev, arriving from Israel, told reporters he was  bringing  "certain ideas" and an important message from Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, but did not give details. He would stay in Tunis  for several hours.    "I have come to express our support and determination to  prevent the enemies of peace from undermining the efforts" to  keep the peace talks going, Kozyrev said, before meeting 'Arafat.    "It is a question now of focusing efforts to save the peace  process," he added.    Kozyrev was also expected to meet Tunisian Foreign Minister  Habib Ben Yahia.    Officials said 'Arafat earlier discussed the peace process  with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.    The PLO leader deplored the UN Security Council's failure to  adopt a resolution condemning the Hebron massacre and calling  for the deployment of an international force in the occupied  territories.    The delay was having "a very serious negative impact on the  whole situation" in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank,  'Arafat said after the meeting.    Kozyrev held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  in Jerusalem Friday, during which Rabin called on the  co-sponsors of the Middle East peace talks, Russia and the  United States, to work together to revive the peace process.    However, Israeli state radio said a Russian proposal to  stage  a new Middle East peace conference was not discussed during  Kozyrev's talks with Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    The proposal was announced by Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister  Igor Ivanov Wednesday, after a Middle East tour during which he  met twice with 'Arafat, as well as with Rabin and Peres.    Moscow has argued that the February 25 massacre of 30 Arab  worshipers by a Jewish settler in Hebron has derailed the  negotiating process and that another international conference is  needed, along the lines of the 1991 Madrid conference which  launched the peace process.</p>

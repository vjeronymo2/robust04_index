			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad It is hard to know whether to be more astonished by Amstrad's proneness to accident or its talent for survival. Yesterday's statement suggests that pre-tax losses this year will total at least Pounds 65m on sales not much over Pounds 300m. But the liquidation of stock which has largely produced this result means that net cash now stands at over Pounds 100m compared with Pounds 40m in February. Aside from the general awfulness of the world market for personal computers, the question is whether Amstrad has finally exhausted the potential for designing and commissioning consumer electronic products in a market dominated by vastly bigger rivals. If so, Mr Sugar will doubtless think of something else to turn his hand to. How far he deserves backing from portfolio investors is another matter. More immediately, the shares at yesterday's 29p are on a yield of 6.4 per cent, assuming a maintained dividend. On an earnings basis, the company should not be paying a dividend at all. But a held payment would cost only a tenth of the cash pile. As shareholders might reflect, Amstrad's recent history suggests the money is a good deal safer with them than re-invested in Amstrad inventory.</p>

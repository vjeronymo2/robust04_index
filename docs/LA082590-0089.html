			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH UNION OK, 27 SCHOOLS GET SET FOR AUTONOMOUS OPERATION  </P> <P> The leaders of United Teachers-Los Angeles voted 7 to 0 Friday to approve the  proposals of 27 schools seeking to operate autonomously, giving them the  go-ahead to become the first to restructure under the Los Angeles Unified  School District's school-based management program.  </P> <P> The teachers union's decision follows a 6-1 school board vote of approval on  Monday, and gives the schools two weeks to change schedules, set up additional  classes and introduce new programs by the start of school on Sept. 11.  </P> <P> "We've got our planning done and we're ready to go," said Debbie Leidner,  principal at Marshall High, one of the 27 schools. "We'll send home letters to  parents about a week before school starts letting them know exactly what's  going on, but we've been planning for this all summer. We expect the opening to  be smooth."  </P> <P> In granting approval, the union leaders and school board agreed to waive  contract requirements and district policies governing the schools, allowing  them to operate free from traditional restrictions.  </P> <P> In response to concerns that the plans failed to adequately address student  achievement -- which is at the heart of the concept of local school control --  the school board also added a requirement that the schools set specific student  achievement goals and submit plans to measure student performance.  </P> <P> Some schools still need waivers from the state to implement portions of their  plans -- such as changes in curriculum, attendance and graduation requirements  -- and decisions on those waiver requests could take several months.  </P> <P> But they are now free to begin making other changes. Some will set up "peer  review" programs, taking the task of evaluating teachers out of the hands of  principals. Others will let parents help interview and hire new teachers.  Others will add programs, such as tutoring and study skills classes, and  lengthen or shorten their school days.  </P> <P> Most administrators agree that their schools will not be radically different  when school starts next month. Many will spend the coming semester ironing out  details in their proposals and spreading the word in the community before  putting the plans into place next spring.  </P> <P> "We're trying to do about 40 things before school starts, and I know we won't  have all of our program ready to go," said Jefferson High Principal Frank  Saldivia.  </P> <P> "One thing we want to do is begin school at a later time and allow students to  attend later in the day, but it wouldn't be fair to the teachers or the  students to introduce that so quickly, without giving people time to make  arrangements with their families and all. That's something we'll have to hold  off on until the spring semester," Saldivia said.  </P> <P> At 4th Street Elementary, a year-round school, Principal May Arakaki plans to  introduce a new schedule when the next group of new students enters school at  the end of September. Children will then start class 15 minutes earlier each  day, and leave school early one day a week, giving teachers time to hold  meetings or prepare lesson plans.  </P> <P> "The parents have known about this for a while, but we know it will take some  adjustments," Arakaki said. "There will be some baby-sitting problems and that  kind of thing, but we're working with our parents and trying to straighten  those out. People are pretty excited about the plan and that helps."  </P> <P> Since parents, teachers and school staffs participated in drawing the plans,  most school principals say they expect to encounter little community opposition  to the changes this fall.  </P> <P> The 27 schools were among 70 that volunteered last spring to be the first in  the district to embark on the school-based management experiment, which aims to  raise student achievement by allowing local schools more flexibility.  </P> <P> The remaining schools are expected to submit their restructuring plans in  October and begin making changes next spring.  </P> <P> Ultimately, all 600 of the district's schools will be run by locally elected  councils, including teachers, parents, principals and community residents. The  power-sharing plan began last year, a product of the settlement of the nine-day  teachers strike.  </P> <P> Currently, elected councils at all the district's schools have limited  decision-making power. Now, schools will be able to implement their own  programs.  </P> <P> The 27 schools with approved restructuring plans are: 32nd Street  Elementary/USC Magnet, Los Angeles; Aggeler High, Chatsworth; Allesandro  Elementary, Silver Lake; Anatola Avenue Elementary, Van Nuys; Chatsworth High,  Chatsworth; Emelita Street Elementary, Encino; James A.

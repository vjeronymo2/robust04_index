He told journalists at the Green Point sports  stadium on Sunday [20 March] that he believed Mr Justice  Goldstone had produced prima face evidence of a very serious  nature. "Close to 20,000 people have been killed and a  comparatively small number of people have been arrested and very  few convicted. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that this  prima face evidence forms the basis of an investigation by an  international team. Until then I will not make any firm  statement," he said. "We are investigating here the crimes  committed by experts who know how to cover up," he said.  "International experts with equal ability to uncover these  crimes are needed to investigate the allegations. It is a pity  (State) President de Klerk has been so dismissive of the  findings of a judge of the appeal court, which has shown that we  were right in calling for an international investigation."    Mr Mandela started a one day rally tour of the Cape  Peninsula  by addressing children at a Lions Club of Camps Bay children's  day at the stadium.</p>

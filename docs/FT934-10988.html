			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: US hopeful on Uruguay Round talks US TRADE officials yesterday praised the revised offers to liberalise both goods and services trade recently tabled in the Uruguay Round, and expressed optimism about the likelihood of getting a Uruguay Round deal finished by the December 15 deadline. 'The Uruguay Round will not fail,' said Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy trade representative. 'The US feels upbeat about the range and level of commitments that countries will take at the end of the day.' Speaking separately yesterday, Mr John Schmidt, the Uruguay Round co-ordinator, said thorny relations between the US and EC were 'mostly a passing phenomenon'. However, he said the EC's offer to reduce semiconductor tariffs from 14 per cent to 7 was insufficient and its market access offer on agriculture would actually reduce access. Mr Schmidt said the US would continue to resist an EC 'fixation' that the US reduce all of its textile tariff peaks - those over 15 per cent  - although it would reduce many. The US must have changes in the negotiating text in the areas of anti-dumping, investment, and health and food rules. This procedure will begin on November 15, when the Trade Negotiating Committee begins meeting virtually in continuous session. He also urged negotiation of a larger market access package than the 'minimal' deal agreed at the Tokyo economic summit. Australia needs a zero tariff pact in non-ferrous metals; the Asean countries, in electronics; and Sweden and Switzerland, in scientific instruments.</p>

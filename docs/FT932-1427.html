			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kmart warns of sharp fall in profits SHARES in Kmart slumped to a new 52-week low yesterday after the US discount store and specialty chain retailer warned that second-quarter earnings would be 'significantly' below the 37 cents a share earned a year ago. And Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said it was now 'probable' that earnings for the full year, to the end of January 1994, would fall below last time's Dollars 2.06 a share. He blamed the late arrival of summer weather in the US, plus cautious consumer spending, for disappointing clothing sales in the second quarter. With a greater share of Kmart's sales coming from lower margin 'hardline' goods, and further losses at the PACE warehouse club division, he said second-quarter profits would fall year-on-year. Thereafter, he predicted a pick-up in profits, topping the results seen in the second half of 1992-93. However, the improvement in the second six months would be unlikely to compensate for the profits shortfall suffered during the first half of the year. This is the second successive quarter Kmart has fallen short of analysts' expectations and been obliged to warn the stock market ahead of its results. It warned of a shortfall in first-quarter results in April, again blaming the weather, and eventually reported earnings per share of 11 cents (before extraordinary and accounting-related items). This compared with 26 cents in the first quarter of 1992-93. Analysts had been hoping for about 40 cents a share in the second quarter, a modest increase on last time. Kmart is engaged in a costly revamp of its core discount store chain. The company maintains the results from overhauled stores have been good, but Wall Street is waiting to see concrete evidence of the benefits. Kmart shares, meanwhile, have gone nowhere for the past 18 months. At the close in New York yesterday they were Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 20 1/8.</p>

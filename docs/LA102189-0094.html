			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO-CONTEST PLEAS ENTERED IN RACIAL INCIDENT AT SCHOOL  </P> <P> Three former football players from St. Genevieve High School in Panorama City  pleaded no contest Friday to charges of painting racial slurs on the office  door of a black coach and causing $10,000 in other damage at the school.  </P> <P> Jesus Renteria, Paul Zamora and Carlos Gonzalez each pleaded no contest to one  count of felony vandalism and one count of misdemeanor terrorism. They entered  the pleas as a preliminary hearing was about to begin in Van Nuys Municipal  Court.  </P> <P> In exchange for their pleas, prosecutors promised to seek no more than one-year  prison sentences against the three 18-year-olds who graduated from the school  this year, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver.  </P> <P> Dver told the three that Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael J. Farrell, who  will sentence them, has agreed to terms of three years probation, $3,500  restitution and 90 days working on a Caltrans highway crew.  </P> <P> The charges carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $5,000  fine. However, prosecutors agreed to lesser terms because the three had good  backgrounds, expressed remorse and entered pleas before their preliminary  hearing, saving the time and expense of a trial, Dver said.  </P> <P> Two other students, both juveniles, are facing proceedings in Juvenile Court,  he said.  </P> <P> The five students surrendered to police June 14 in connection with the June 12  incident in which racial slurs were painted on the door of Jimmy Chambers, an  assistant football coach. Authorities also found smashed drinking fountains,  broken glass and other damage.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb scheduled sentencing Dec. 1.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today condemned those  calling on IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to disobey their  commanders' legal orders. This could herald the destruction of  the IDF and the undermining of Israel's security, Rabin said.  The prime minister noted that he had never accepted any refusal  by soldiers to carry out orders because of political  differences, neither during the Lebanon war nor by refusing to  serve in the territories. The prime minister said that the  individual's duty to obey legal orders constituted the backbone  of democracy and of the IDF, which was the army of the Israeli  people. Yitzhaq Rabin was speaking during a briefing to  military correspondents. His remarks were reported by Army  affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe.    Israeli officials, from both sides of the political spectrum  have expressed reservations with the ruling issued by the three  rabbis calling on soldiers to disobey orders in Hebron.    Likud Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Weinstein called on his  party to express reservations with the halakic ruling. He told  our correspondent Hayim Hecht that Israeli citizens could oppose  the evacuation of the settlers within the confines of the law  but soldiers must carry out any order which does not clearly  violate the law.    Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan vehemently protested the halakic  injunction. He said that the rabbis had no right to make  rulings on IDF orders. Eytan said that the IDF and its  commanders must comply with all authoritative orders issued by  the political echelon, even if it did not correspond with their  personal viewpoint. Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent  Shmu'el Tal that he was sure that the political echelon would  not issue IDF commands that would divide the Israeli people.    Labor Party Secretary Nisim Zvili said that the edict issued  by the three rabbis proves that they have strayed from their  spiritual path and are guilty of attempted insurrection. Such  fanatical rabbis, Zvili said, who either lead or are led by the  lunatic and dangerous fringes of society, may spark off a civil  war. Zvili hoped that the national religious Zionist camp would  eradicate all manifestations of messianic zealotry.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 30 March  reports that "Zvulun Hammer, the leader of the National  Religious Party, said that if responsible and loyal rabbis like  Shapira, Yisre'eli, and Neriya issued such a harsh and dangerous  halakic ruling which implies that soldiers should disobey  orders, then this proves that the government and the Left have  pushed the most moderate members of the religious camp up  against the wall. Hammer suggested that Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin invite the rabbis to a meeting. MK Hammer told our  correspondent Shmu'el Tal that the leadership of his party would  meet with the three rabbis in order to hear exactly what they  said and to be apprised of their position. Hammer also accused  Minister Yosi Sarid of incitement and claimed that Sarid's  reaction to the halakic edict would only cause more  radicalization. Likud MK Mikha'el Eytan also blamed Minister  Sarid for making slanderous remarks and fomenting divisiveness."]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] What ways to alleviate the Yugoslav  crisis does Ukraine believe to be the most promising and  realistic?    [Zlenko] As is known, the world community has drawn a number  of variants of peaceful regulation of the armed conflict on the  territory of former Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, attempts to  resolve this problem on the basis of the well-known Owen-Vance  plan fell short of the aim. Disregarding consent of the leaders  of all the three ethnic minorities [as heard], their parliaments  failed to ratify the achieved agreements and the status quo was  preserved. The new French-German initiative suggested by Foreign  Ministers Kinkel and Juppe is currently being discussed by the  conflicting parties at the Geneva peace talks. The plan  stipulates the creation of three ethnic formations on the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and establishing borders along  ethnic lines or boundaries. In our opinion, this peaceful  regulation plan is promising with regard to putting an end to  armed opposition. Whether the plan will be implemented depends  on the goodwill of the parties in the conflict. There are  different approaches, even absolutely opposing ones on the part  of the groups involved in the conflict. However, I believe that  this plan corresponds more with the realities that have  developed recently on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Reporter] [passage omitted] Can the economic sanctions  imposed by the United Nations help to resolve the Yugoslav  conflict any quicker?    [Zlenko] When did the world community suggest these  sanctions? It was toward the end of 1991, when Serbian troops  were waging a war against newly independent states. By now, the  situation has significantly changed and I discussed this issue  with the Hungarian foreign minister, who had returned from talks  with the Belgrade leadership. We touched upon Belgrade's  viewpoint on this issue as well as the issue of suspending  sanctions. I want to say that the Hungarian foreign minister  informed me in detail on the dramatic situation in which the  people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia found themselves  after the sanctions were imposed. In the first place, sanctions  afflicted children and the elderly, causing shortages of food  and medicine. I think that the situation currently developing  in Serbia and Montenegro is terrible, and that the sanctions  must not be preserved. They not only inflict heavy damage on  the people of that state, but also on other states which found  themselves within the range of these sanctions. I want to point  out that from the military point of view the situation has  changed. The suspension of sanctions imposed by the United  Nations is currently being discussed. I would not like anybody  to get the impression from what I have just said that Ukraine is  ready to abolish the sanctions or abstain from using them. Of  course, we are ready to do the world community's will, but at  the same time we cannot disregard Ukraine's current situation.  We know very well that we have been suffering heavy economic  losses. We have almost lost our Danube commercial routes; our  financial losses have exceeded $4 billion, according to  preliminary calculations. I think that this urges us to resolve  this problem. I would like to point out that at the same time,  Ukraine is raising the issue of UN compensation for these  financial losses, in accordance with Article 50 of the UN  Charter. It was at our initiative that a UN session adopted an  appropriate resolution in 1993, envisioning compensation for  those losses. Thus, I want to underline that we must look  realistically at the way the sanctions are observed and proceed  from the postulate that further use of such harsh sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may bring about  unforeseen or even tragic consequences. We would like to avoid  this. Thus, I believe that we must think seriously about the  way the sanctions afflict children and elderly people. We may  be considering some gradual, stage-by-stage alleviation of the  sanctions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Sunday [3 April], after he laid wreaths to a  makeshift monument to the victims of the October uprising,  Russia's former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy said that  instead of being seen as a tragedy of the dissolved Supreme  Soviet, the uprising was to be seen as a national tragedy.  According to government counts, 142 human lives were lost in  the October developments.    The leader of Russia's National Salvation Front Iliya  Konstantinov, a member of the Constitutional Court Valeriy  Zorkin, the chairman of the Popular party off Free Russia  Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a member of the State Duma Stanislav  Govorukhin, members of the dissolved Supreme Soviet Oleg  Rumiantsev and Gennadiy Sayenko as well as other opposition  leaders who defended the building of the Russian House of  Soviets on October 3 and 4, took part in the memorial ceremony  in front of that building.    In Rutskoy's view, more people failed to come to their aid  in  October because truthful reports on what was happening were not  available. Rutskoy said those who defended the national  parliament were no communo-fascists. Instead, those who opened  fire on the parliament were fascists. Rutskoy dubbed as  shameless what Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said in a  Saturday's appearance on national television. According to  Grachev, the armed forces were sent in last October to cut a way  through political debris.    The ex-vice-president stood for a long time with a bowed  head  and in silence at the monument which was designed as a wooden  cross with hanging funeral bands and loops of barbed wire.  Barbed wire entanglements surrounded the building of the  Russian parliament in October. Asked by journalists what he  felt at the moment, Rutskoy said "Ask Yeltsin".    National Salvation Front leader Iliya Konstantinov told a  reporter for Interfax he intended to concentrate on  organizational and analytical efforts. As well as Rutskoy,  Konstantinov was arrested in the wake of the October uprising  and released from the Lefortovo investigation cells on the  Duma's amnesty decision.    He said that today the opposition must concentrate on  preparations for the next elections to the Federal Assembly and,  especially, presidential elections. He refused to name the  opposition's choices by saying time would show that. President  Yeltsin banned both the National Salvation Front and the Working  Russia movement led by Viktor Anpilov from taking part in the  parliamentary elections of last December owing to their role in  the October developments.</p>

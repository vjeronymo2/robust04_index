			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Peter Boross has visited  Szekesfehervar. According to our correspondent, the prime  minister said NATO AWACS planes have been and do remain in  Hungarian airspace; they were here during the NATO air strike on  Gorazde, too. However, he said, Hungary had received assurances  that the planes are here without target guiding tasks  [tuezvezerlesi feladatok] and that they carry out only airspace  patrolling duties.

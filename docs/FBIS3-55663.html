The gross domestic product diminished by 12 percent, and,  compared to 1991, by 29 percent.    Experts of the independent research center Macroecon-Link  note in this connection that in October 1992 the Economics  Ministry predicted a 5-8 percent decrease. The rate of the  reduction of Russia's gross domestic product has outstripped the  same index in the U.S. during the great depression (38 percent  compared to 30 percent in the U.S. from 1930 to 1933).    In 1993, the volume of industrial production dropped by 16  percent, which is slightly down from the 1992 index of 18  percent.    The aggregate price index grew 10 times (in 1992 - 26  times),  while the average salary increased 8 times.    Last year, Russia manufactured 6 percent less electric  energy  than in 1992, 12 percent less oil, 4 percent less gas and 10  percent less coal.    The production of steel dropped by 13 percent, tractors - 35  percent, harvesters - 43 percent, cement - 18 percent, fabrics -  26 percent, meat - 14 percent, milk - 17 percent and sugar - 5  percent. The crop of grain amounted to 99 Mn tons compared to  107 Mn tons in 1992.    Manufacture of refrigerators increased by 10 percent, TV  sets  by 9 percent and vegetable oil by 14 percent.    Russia's foreign trade turnover amounted to $76 Bn. The  exports grew by 13 percent to $ 45.9 Bn, including the export of  oil by 21 percent, gas - 3 percent and timber - 3 percent.    The value of Russia's imports was over $30 Bn, which is 15  percent less than in 1992. Grain imports did not exceed 11 Mn  tons, which is 62 percent less than in 1992.</p>

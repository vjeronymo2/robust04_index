On 22 February, the Army commander in chief, General Raoul  Cedras, did not answer the invitation of the alternative office  of the chamber led by Senator Bernard Sansaricq. This  invitation was reported; the session has been postponed to 23  February at 1100. Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton says that all the  country's authorities are concerned about the Haitian situation  and must look for a solution to the crisis. Sen. Dupiton asked  Gen. Raoul Cedras to guarantee the safety of the legislators.  We should say that this session was punctuated with nationalist  speeches.    For her part, Sen. Margareth Martin asked the  parliamentarians to fill the vacuum of the executive power --  the vacuum created by the resignation of Prime Minister Robert  Malval.</p>

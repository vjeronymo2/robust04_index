			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Xerox Wins Round in Court: U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater overturned a  $9-million judgment a jury awarded to a San Antonio woman in an  age-discrimination suit against Xerox Corp. Fitzwater, who presided over the  civil trial in Dallas, indicated that he believed that the evidence failed to  show that Xerox had demoted Elizabeth Layman, 48, because of her age, or that  she had been lured to California with a false promise of a comparable job. "I  think the judge is wrong," said Layman's attorney, Larry Macon, "and I am  hopeful that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans will restore a  very clear jury decision."  </P></p>

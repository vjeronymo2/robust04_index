			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Write-down hurts Canadian Pacific CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and property group, yesterday reported disappointing second-quarter results, but remained firmly in the black for the first half. Its second quarter was hurt by its share of a USDollars 120m write-down by Laidlaw, the waste management affiliate, and by slow recovery in the rail, road and sea transport units. These factors were largely offset by 87 per cent-owned PanCanadian Petroleum, the oil and natural gas producer, which doubled its profit in the first half with gains in output. Its first-half contribution to CP was CDollars 160m (USDollars 125m), or twice that of the transport units, compared with Dollars 98.3m in the first half of 1992. CP's second-quarter profit was CDollars 12m, or 3 cents a share, after a 5 cents write-down for Laidlaw, while total operating income before interest, taxes and minority interests was CDollars 191m, against CDollars 151.6m. This excludes the Laidlaw rightdown. Net income was CDollars 21m, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Six months' net profit was CDollars 33.7m, or 10 cents, against a loss of CDollars 18.7m, or 6 cents, on total revenue of CDollars 4bn, down from CDollars 4.8bn, due to de-consolidation of CP's interests in Unitel, the telecommunications group, and United Dominion, a US industrial products group. Excluding this factor, revenues were up CDollars 213m. Operating income was CDollars 285.2m against CDollars 213m. CP Rail's contribution declined because of lower coal and grain shipments in the first quarter. However, grain recovered sharply in the second quarter, as did coal and potash. CP Ships gained from stronger container traffic and better rates and CP Trucks reduced its losses. Pan Canadian benefited from two years of heavy investment. It expects higher shipment of oil and gas in the second half, offsetting lower oil prices. Fording Coal gained from higher shipments and selling prices and a lower dollar. CP Forest reduced its losses with stronger markets for wood products and newsprint. Marathon Realty was sharply lower because of lower land sales and higher vacancy rates in office buildings and shopping centres. CP Hotels improved with better occupancy and room rates.</p>

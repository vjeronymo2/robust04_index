			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Enticing investors to troubled waters - Disputes about Russia's Sakhalin island fields THE RUSSIAN government is planning new tenders to exploit remaining oil and gas fields off the island of Sakhalin in a bid to cool political passions over natural resources in the far east of the republic. A first feasibility study for just two offshore fields was awarded in March to a consortium made up of Marathon Oil and McDermott, both of the US, and Japan's Mitsui, amid a major dispute between Moscow and the local authorities over which competing group of western oil companies should get the contract. Competition between the various consortia for the contract was so fierce that local buses were drawn into the fray - carrying advertisements saying 'Mobil - a reliable partner for Russia' and '3M Consortium - working for the benefit of Sakhalin People'. Despite the cancellation of President Boris Yeltsin's trip to Japan yesterday, politics is unlikely to come between Russian energy resources and the Japanese companies that have been competing among each other for a piece of the action. Plans for an as yet unspecified number of new tenders - there are eight fields off Sakhalin but it has not yet been decided how they will be divided up - are designed to ease political tensions over Sakhalin's resources, as well as to give other oil companies a share of a large but so far neglected pie. These include the Adoptinskoye and Chaivo oil and gas fields, on which Japan's Sodeco has priority rights entrenched in a Russo-Japanese government accord dating from 1975; and the Arkutinsky and Daginskoye fields, for which Amoco has already offered to conduct a feasibility study. Sodeco was set up specially for the purposes of exploiting Sakhalin oil as part of a diplomatic effort in the 1970s to resolve the territorial quarrel over the South Kurile islands off Sakhalin. But having completed a feasibility study for Chaivo and Adoptinskoye in 1983, Sodeco has been waiting to begin work ever since, while the Russians continue to sit on Dollars 277bn owed to Sodeco for its efforts so far. 'The question of (attracting) foreign capital has suffered from inertia,' says Mr Andrei Konoplyannik, the deputy oil minister responsible for foreign investment affairs. 'We have been talking about it for five years but now we are trying not to talk but do something which goes beyond joint ventures.' The idea is to award feasibility studies this year, and begin developing resources in 1993. Estimated resources in the Sea of Okhotsk, the bulk of which are off Sakhalin, include 15.8bn barrels of oil, 1bn barrels of gas condensate, and 190 trillion (million million) cubic feet of natural gas. While promising a start to the exploitation of these resources, the first Sakhalin tender is also seen as a model for what not to do if the country really wants to can build a smooth tendering mechanism. The 3M consortium is now working to meet a December 31 deadline to complete the feasibility study for developing the Lunskoye gas and Altun-Pistovskoye oil fields. But until it won the feasibility study, and even afterwards, the Sakhalin administration and parliament challenged the choice made by a government commission as accusations flew that corruption provided the motivation for backing one or other consortium. Mr Viktor Sirenko, the Sakhalin deputy governor for economic affairs, voices two main objections to the 3M consortium: doubts that it has the resources to carry out the work and a fear that it will drag its feet in developing gas supplies, which the Russian far east needs for its own energy security. Mr Sirenko carries around with him detailed figures of corporate results of the three companies plus western agency ratings to argue that Exxon would have been a 'more solid' partner than Marathon or McDermott. He claims that Exxon, which had teamed up with Sodeco in the competition for the feasibility study, has the most experience operating in a Sakhalin-type environment. He also claims that the consortium is unlikely to produce the gas by 1995 as the Russian side wants because Japan does not need any new supplies before the year 2000. These criticisms are roundly rejected by Mr Konoplyannik, who says the government opted for a 'comprehensive approach taking into account a number of factors'. But the tender also became an opportunity for local authorities to present rival oil companies with an unofficial shopping list for new infrastructure, which the central government has so far been unable to provide. This opened up a fierce competition among oil companies to outbid each other in generosity. Apart from the usual conflicts between central and local authorities wherever natural wealth is at issue, a driving force behind the Sakhalin squabble is local politicians' fears for their own future as they find themselves trapped by election promises made two years ago of a Singapore-style economic miracle on the island. 'People now blame us because things are getting worse as a result of the government's economic policies,' said one senior Sakhalin official, who declined to be identified. 'But we have no power to improve things because of the dictatorship of the centre'. Although the reserves have been known about for decades, another reason nothing has been done until now is the enormous complexity of an offshore drilling project fraught with great risks for the environment. Mr Anatoly Torchinov, managing-director of Far East Offshore Exploration Company, a state-owned company that is a subcontractor in the 3M feasibility work, says the main challenge is ensuring that moving blocks of ice cannot damage offshore installations and spill oil into the rich fishing grounds around the island.</p>

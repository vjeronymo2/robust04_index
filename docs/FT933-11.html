			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (35): A trickle-down economy - Lack of water is the Achilles Heel of Madras's heavy industry THE ENTREPRENEURS of Tamil Nadu know how to take advantage of a crisis, writes SARA WEBB. While the city of Madras suffers one of its worst water shortages in years, private truck owners clog the roads into Madras, bringing in tanks of water which they then sell on the street. Scuffles break out as people rush to buy water, while in some parts of town, the poorer inhabitants stay awake at night waiting for the tell-tale trickle from the tap which signals that the water supply has been switched on for an hour or so. The more affluent keep their own water tanks while some of the state's big industrial concerns have been forced to develop water recycling systems to avoid running dry. Madras, the capital of the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, suffers from an acute water shortage. The problem tops the list of priorities for Mr TV Venkataraman, the state's chief secretary, especially since Tamil Nadu is keen to encourage further investment in the state's industrial development, which centres predominantly around light engineering, textiles and leather. 'The liberalisation of economic policy in the last year has been quite helpful - there has been a lot of interest in setting up new industries, both from affluent people in India and from abroad,' claims Mr Venkataraman. However, industrialists argue that until something is done to rectify the state's poor infrastructure, particularly water supply, it will be difficult to encourage substantial new investments. 'The water situation is thoroughly mismanaged, there's absolutely no hope of any water-intensive industries such as chemicals or paper wanting to come here,' complains one industrialist. Mr D. Srinivasan, southern regional director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, points out: 'Water is a major constraint in the industrial development of the state, and there is an urgent need to concentrate on new technologies and innovative schemes like desalination and water recycling, and to adopt water-saving concepts such as waste water treatment, recycling and conservation wherever possible.' Poor monsoons in the last two years have exacerbated Tamil Nadu's water problems. In addition, the state has had a long-running dispute with neighbouring Karnataka over the right to use water from the river Cauvery, an issue which is heavily politicised. However, Mr Venkataraman says the state hopes to improve the water situation in Madras through a resolution of the Cauvery dispute, as well as by obtaining water from the Krishna river, nearby lakes and from desalination projects. Desalination of brackish water or sea water was once seen as too expensive an option to pursue: now the state hopes to encourage foreign investors to come in on a 'build-operate-transfer' basis. Power is the other main area which needs to be developed. Tamil Nadu, in common with other Indian states, needs to boost its power capacity as it already suffers a shortfall of 1,500MW and this is expected to increase. The Indian government announced in 1991 that private sector investors would be encouraged to participate in new power projects given that the public sector cannot afford to meet energy requirements. Some headway has already been made in this respect in Tamil Nadu. The state has large lignite deposits and has signed an agreement to set up the 1,500MW Jayamkondan lignite project. The project, which is the largest in Asia, is an integrated mining and power generation project which is a joint venture between Siemens of Germany, the Khaita-Birla companies of McNally Bharat, and Williamson &amp; Magor, and the state government-owned Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation. Ms J. Jayalalitha, the state's autocratic chief minister whose career as a Tamil film actress preceded her move into politics, has pinpointed the need to develop the state's industrial sectors. Tamil Nadu's industrial growth has lagged the national average in recent years, and unemployment, particularly among young qualified people, is high. However, critics claim that since leading her party - the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) - to power in 1991, Ms Jayalalitha has achieved little in terms of promoting Tamil Nadu's industry. 'There's a lot of talk but not much action - she's just another publicity-seeking politician,' complains one businessman of Ms Jayalalitha, a woman whose chubby features adorn many of the city billboards. Yet according to the Confederation of Indian Industry, Tamil Nadu is the third most industrially developed state in India, after Maharashtra and Gujarat. That ranking is largely thanks to the automotive and auto-components industries which have developed over many years in Tamil Nadu. Ashok Leyland, the bus and truck manufacturer, has a substantial part of its manufacturing in Tamil Nadu in the area around Madras and Hosur (an industrial centre close to the border with Karnataka). Hinduja (the international trading group) and Iveco (a subsidiary of Fiat of Italy) together hold a controlling stake in Ashok Leyland, with Iveco contributing industrial expertise to help improve the quality of truck production. A new range of trucks is being developed for production next year. 'Gradually we will be replacing our range of trucks with these new designs made available by Iveco. The new range will have engines and transmission which are the same as those used by Iveco in Europe and which meet EC standards,' says Mr RJ Shahaney, managing director of Ashok Leyland. He is optimistic that Iveco will use India as a base for exporting the new range of trucks, for example to the Far East, Australia, and Middle East, particularly in view of India's low labour costs and overheads. The presence of Ashok Leyland in Tamil Nadu has encouraged a flourishing auto components industry in the region. Now, the industry is keen to exploit the advantage of liberalisation and a favourable exchange rate to export more components. Mr S. Viji, president of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India, and managing director of Brakes India, a Madras-based manufacturer of brake systems, says the components sector is concentrating on boosting exports to the US, EC, Australia, New Zealand and south-east Asia. Brakes India exports 11-12 per cent at present, but hopes to boost its exports to 20-25 per cent of sales in five years. However, some components manufacturers are already exporting as much as 60 per cent of their production, Mr Viji says.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICO RIVERA DIAL-A-RIDE VANS HAUL 7,500 PEOPLE IN 3 MONTHS  </P> <P> It isn't Metro Rail, but a free form of public transportation in Pico Rivera is  getting a proportion of ridership that might prompt envy among county transit  officials. Although Pico Rivera has but 60,000 residents, more than 7,500  passengers used the city's dial-a-ride system in the second quarter of this  year alone.  </P> <P> That is a 50% increase over two years ago.  </P> <P> People 55 or older and people with handicaps can use the van service for any  trip within city limits. Rides outside the city are limited to medical,  education or social-service appointments. Eligible city residents, about a  sixth of the population, can use the service by telephoning 721-5666 a day or  two in advance.  </P> <P> Pico Rivera started the program in 1984, charging 75 cents per ride. The city  dropped the fare to 25 cents before finally removing the fee entirely.  Dial-a-ride costs the city about $25,000 a month and runs seven days a week,  although the hours of service are reduced on weekends. Numerous other cities  have their own versions of dial-a-ride.  </P></p>

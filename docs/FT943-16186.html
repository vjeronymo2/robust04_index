			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Injury fears for key Swedish players Swedish mid-fielder and captain Jonas Thern will miss at least four days of practice because of a sore knee, but is expected to play in Sunday's quarter-final against Romania. 'I've played so much and I don't need more practice,' said Thern, who left Sunday's second-round game against Saudi Arabia in the 69th minute with a sore right knee. Sweden defeated the Saudis 3-1 and have yet to lose a game. Except for a weak first half in their June 19 opener against Cameroon (2-2), Thern has been the key mid-field player for Sweden. Central defender Joachim Bjorklund, who left Sunday's game early in the second half complaining about pain in his thighs, is also likely to miss the next few days' training in Oakland, California. The Swedes are studying videos of the Romanians. They are impressed by the Romanians' defensive play, and by Hagi, whom they rate the player of the tournament so far.</p>

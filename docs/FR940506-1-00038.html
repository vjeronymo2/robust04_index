			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Permit and Recordkeeping Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the first year of the Research Plan, most of the burden of recordkeeping would rest with processors, who would be responsible for collecting and paying the bimonthly Research Plan fee assessment when billed by NMFS. During the first year of the Research Plan, additional reporting requirements would be implemented for observer contractors to support the rebate program for direct observer costs. The rebate program and associated recordkeeping requirements are described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All processors of Research Plan fisheries would need a Federal Processing Permit. A Federal Processing Permit Application (Form FPP&hyph;1) would be required to obtain a processing permit, and would serve to gather information about the processor and its owner. Fishermen who sell their catch directly to the public at a dock, roadside, or elsewhere would be considered processors under the Research Plan. Each processing vessel or shoreside facility would be required to submit a separate permit application, even if several vessels or facilities are owned by the same company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits would be issued for each of the two 6-month periods_January 1 through June 30, and July 1 through December 31. No permit would be issued until the permit application is complete and all fee assessments paid. Processors that have paid their accounts and submitted complete permit applications would be issued a permit within 30 days. Permits would not be issued to those processors not submitting complete applications or to those whose accounts are past due, until their applications are complete and their accounts are paid. Processing fish from Research Plan fisheries without a valid permit, or delivering fish from Research Plan fisheries to a processor not possessing a valid permit, would be prohibited. NMFS would make available to the public a list of those processors holding valid permits to process fish from Research Plan fisheries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Observer Coverage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), observer coverage levels in the groundfish fishery would be as currently required by the Federal Observer Plan. All king and Tanner crab catcher/processors and mothership processors in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area would continue to carry observers under the State Shellfish Onboard Observer Program. Observer coverage would not be required for the halibut fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Starting with the second year of the Research Plan (1996), NMFS would annually determine the level of observer coverage necessary to achieve the objectives of the Research Plan. NMFS would consider the amount of available funds, as well as the objectives of the program, in determining the appropriate observer coverage levels. NMFS would annually present an analysis of observer coverage, including criteria for selection of vessels to carry observers if coverage is less than 100 percent, to the Council, and to the State in the case of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries. NMFS would then publish the proposed levels of coverage in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and invite comments. State costs for observer coverage in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries allowable under the Magnuson Act would be paid from fees collected from all Research Plan fisheries. After considering comments received and again consulting with the Council, and with the State in the case of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, NMFS would publish the final levels of observer coverage for the upcoming year in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Inseason Changes in Observer Coverage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regional Director may increase or decrease the observer coverage requirements for the groundfish, halibut, and crab observer programs at any time during the effective period of the Research Plan to improve the accuracy, reliability, and availability of observer data, and to ensure solvency of the observer program, so long as the conditions set forth in section 313 of the Magnuson Act are met, and based on one or more of the following findings: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant change in fishing methods, times, or areas for a specific fishery or fleet component has occurred, or is likely to occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A significant change in catch or bycatch composition for a specific fishery or fleet component has occurred, or is likely to occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Unanticipated shortfalls in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund require decreased observer coverage to maintain solvency of the observer programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

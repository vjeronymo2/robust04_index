			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Men on the supermarket shelf - Advertisers neglect the reality of home life The reality is a nation with the highest divorce rate in the EU, 31 per cent of births outside marriage and a fifth of children raised by single parents. Yet despite the fact that men are forced to run their domestic affairs as never before, images of smiling, 30-something British housewives still dominate advertising for grocery products. Men living alone represent 11 per cent of UK households, and even within the family the conventional role of woman as housewife is being eroded. While women continue to do most of the household tasks, men no longer escape the chores as they used to, according to a survey carried out by the Henley Centre for the supermarket group Asda. Men shop for an average of two and a half hours a week, against an average of four for women. The Henley survey suggests that 38 per cent of men claim to have personally selected more than half of the items they had bought from supermarkets. Twenty six per cent of men claim actually to enjoy shopping and a stereotype-defying 46 per cent say that cooking is a real pleasure. When men shop they are more likely to buy brands and spend on average 5 per cent more than their female counterparts - on the face of it a manufacturer's dream. Donald Kerr, planning director at the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, believes that an opportunity is being missed because 'conventional thinking views women as the housewife. Many companies still see women in their pre-new man role'. He attributes this partly to attitudes created by the recession, which have left a culture of caution among Britain's marketing community. But his main contention is that 'many marketers and advertising executives don't take their home to work'. If they remembered the reality of their own homes while wearing their suits, many of Britain's brands could have a very different orientation. Such suggestions are dismissed by Jerry Wright, marketing director at Lever Brothers, a company with a large portfolio of grocery brands. 'The bulk of our brands are targeted at women, who still do the bulk of shopping,' he says, 'but we do pick up a lot of men with our advertising.' Wright concedes, however, that men represent a valuable franchise for grocery manufacturers. 'I think there is a feeling that men are more likely to buy brands, because they have less knowledge and feel less sure of themselves than women.' Wright believes men can be victims of a kind of commercial Oedipus complex. 'They are often tempted to buy the brands their mother used to use,' he says. Even so Lever Brothers has not tried to develop a niche, male-oriented grocery brand and the company has not even carried out any specific research into this opportunity. 'The needs of men as consumers of washing powder, for instance, are not distinct enough,' says Wright, 'although you might argue that young men would be interested in a heavy soiling product, because they play more sport.' Wright believes most grocery brands are sufficiently accessible to men. 'Most brands in this category don't say too much about you as a person, so buying one with a feminine image would not give the majority of men a problem.' Lever Brothers' rival Procter and Gamble is currently screening an advertisement showing a man cleaning the kitchen floor for his wife. A sign perhaps that advertisers must increasingly reflect life as it is, rather than recreating the kind of scenes that were looking dated even in the 1950s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] said on Thursday [31 March] it was angered and outraged at  the declaration of a state of emergency in Natal and kwaZulu  which it said was aimed at eliminating all political opposition  to the interim constitution. "The declaration is a  party-political act taken in close co-operation with the African  National Congress and the SA Communist Party [SACP], both of  which have for years nurtured a desire to overthrow the kwaZulu  government and destroy the IFP," said an Inkatha statement.    The IFP charged State President F W de Klerk had colluded  with the ANC and SACP to eliminate all political opposition to  the interim constitution.    "He (Mr de Klerk) has succumbed to pressure from the  Transitional Executive Council to send troops into kwaZulu.  (SACP leader) Joe Slovo of 'two down, one to go' fame must be  especially pleased," said the statement.    The IFP said it was "especially cynical" to declare a state  of emergency in the midst of a general election campaign.    The party repeated calls for the postponement of the April  poll and for a resumption of "genuine" multiparty negotiations.</p>

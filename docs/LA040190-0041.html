			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: THE LOTTERY WAS THE PUSH I NEEDED  </P> <P> Richard Law, 35, of Pacific Beach won $100,000 from the California Lottery just  two months after he moved to the state in 1986. Before that, Law, a British  expatriate, picked cotton on an Israeli kibbutz, sold cranes for a Saudi  Arabian sheik, sipped tea with a king and launched a successful moving company  in Singapore. In 1986, he parlayed his lottery winnings into his own firm, a  bike rental company for hotel guests. Law was interviewed by Times staff writer  G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by David McNew.  </P> <P>  I've always been very lucky. I've won just about every raffle you can think  of. I won the lottery on April 16, 1986, the day after tax day.  </P> <P> In those days, it was a scratch-off, and if you had three numbers the same, you  won. So I bought one ticket and I won $5. I went back to the shop where I  bought the ticket and asked the guy for cash. He counted out four ones and then  said he didn't have $5, so I said just give me five tickets.  </P> <P> I left one of the tickets on the table in front of our little girl, who was 3.  She had been scratching it and playing with it, and it was on the table for a  half an hour before I walked past the table to find there were some zeroes on  it. The numbers hadn't been rubbed off properly so I took the ticket and  finished off the rubbing and it said $100,000, $100,000, $100,000.  </P> <P> I spent about $300 on phone calls that night, talking to old friends in Saudi  Arabia and Singapore and wherever I used to live, telling everyone. After  taxes, I had a net gain of $65,000, so I decided to go self-employed from that  moment on. I had already decided, but I hadn't decided quite how. The lottery  was the push I needed.  </P> <P> But the first thing I did was take my father and two sisters to Jerusalem.  Though I'm not Jewish, I had lived on a kibbutz for a year when I was a young  lad, working in the cotton fields and picking pears.  </P> <P> We also hired this magnificent villa in southern Spain, and I took my father,  my sisters, their husbands, their children and my aunts. But that was really my  only extravagance.  </P> <P> My relatives normally come out every year anyway to see me wherever I live,  because I haven't lived in England since 1974. When I was 19, I went over to  Israel to work on a kibbutz. Then I spent about a year in England with Xerox,  doing my sales training and selling word processors. But I was still very  interested in the Middle East, so I decided to go work for an Arab sheik in the  eastern province of Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> I sold cranes for about six months, got a commission and everything was  wonderful. Then, all of a sudden, the Arab owner found out that this English  chap was stealing money, and he dismissed every single Englishman and American  in the company. I wanted to tell the sheik it wasn't me, so I went back and he  embraced me because I had honestly made the effort to go back.  </P> <P> I was 22 then. While I was there, I found an advertisement in the Bahrain Times  for this English company selling shelving. Bahrain is a little island country  off Saudi Arabia. Because it's a Muslim country, women cannot wear a bikini on  the beach, but the king had a private beach where the expatriate wives could  wear bikinis.  </P> <P> He gave away free Pepsi and orange juice, but no alcohol, all day long to  anybody who was on the beach. The king himself would come down in a huge  Rolls-Royce about 3 p.m., wearing flowing robes and a gold headdress. I used to  go down to the beach to swim. What's more bizarre than finishing work at 2 or 3  o'clock, sitting on the beach, having a free Pepsi and saying "Hi" to the king?  </P> <P> I left Bahrain to open the shelving business in Singapore and Hong Kong,  because I couldn't go any bigger. We had done all the supermarkets. We opened  up a small office in Singapore, and we totally died. The Japanese could make my  product for one-third of the cost.  </P> <P> I left the company and decided that I had done the Far East, and the only thing  I really had left to do was America. But it's very difficult being here legally  for an Englishman. So I joined an international moving company in 1981, based  in La Jolla. They asked me to take over a sales managership in Singapore, and  we agreed, if I did a good job, they'd move me back to the United States.  </P> <P> We built the company up, and they lived up to their word and promoted me back  -- to Houston. I really liked Texas, but I fell out with the company in  Houston, and the company has since gone bankrupt. I knew I wasn't going to live  in Houston, so in 1986 I moved to La Jolla, where I had vacationed before. Two  months later I won the California Lottery.  </P> <P> I decided to start a bicycle rental company because I had built a service  company in Singapore, and I knew I could build one up from scratch. So now we  have contracts with nearly all the major hotels, and we run a bicycle delivery  business with nearly 400 bikes.  </P> <P> I do occasionally play the lottery. For me, winning the lottery meant that a  man who has always wanted to be his own boss could be his own boss.  </P></p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Cadbury proposals adopted by many MOST of the UK's largest companies already comply with the main recommendations of the Cadbury Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, a study shows, Norma Cohen writes. Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises pension funds on corporate governance, found that three-quarters of companies listed in the FTSE-100 index have separated the offices of chairman and chief executive as recommended. The study also found that 75 per cent of companies already have a separate audit committee of directors with a majority of non-executives. The Cadbury report recommends that audit committees be composed entirely of non-executives within two years.</p>

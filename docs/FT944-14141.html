			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Report on social justice avoids specifics on costs Labour's social justice commission has ranged far beyond the future of Britain's welfare state. Subtitled 'strategies for national renewal', its report addresses a 'wider malaise' of seemingly 'inexorable' national decline. Its recommendations are similarly wide in scope, ranging from detailed changes to the benefits system to a call for a wholesale 'political revolution'. In the style of Lord Beveridge's 1942 report, which the present report seeks to update, Sir Gordon Borrie and his fellow commissioners start with a statement of aims and values. None of them is new. Some - such as the elimination of poverty - go back to Beveridge. Others - 'we must radically improve access to education and training' - are now platitudes. The rest repeat catchy but vague slogans popularised by the campaign to elect President Bill Clinton in the US - 'We must transform the welfare state from a safety net in times of trouble to a springboard for economic opportunity'. The impact of the Borrie report will rest on its specific proposals, and how they are to be carried through. These are divided into three broad policy fields, education and training, employment, and the tax and benefits system. Although there are some significant and controversial proposals in the first two areas - notably a minimum wage, a voluntary community service scheme and graduate contributions to university tuition costs - it is the future of state benefits which is most critical for the Labour party. In terms of both public spending implications and numbers of voters affected, it is an electoral minefield, and the necessity for detached, strategic thinking on the benefits question was the most important reason why the late John Smith, Labour leader, set up the commission two years ago. But a striking feature of the report is the hesitant nature of key recommendations, and the reluctance to specify how they will be funded. Universal nursery education is held to be 'one of the highest priorities for government investment over the next decade'. To raise the Pounds 1bn extra a year to pay for it the commission notes two ideas, using funds from student contributions to fees, or devoting some of the saving made from phasing out the married couple's tax allowance. The report says, however, that the student income 'may be needed to expand the higher education system', while it transpires later in the report that the commissioners could not agree on the use of the Pounds 2.5bn gained from the married couple's allowance. Some wanted half of it to go to nursery education. Others wanted it all to be spent on an increase in child benefit. If the latter course were adopted the funding would have to come from taxation - a 'tax and spend' policy of the kind Sir Gordon Borrie went out of his way to disown yesterday. In the pensions and benefits arena the commission claims to steer a middle way between those seeking a radical shift to means-testing on the one hand, and the advocates of wholesale integration of the tax and benefits systems on the other. In reality, however, the report goes a long way towards the means testing of state payments to pensioners. The main proposal is for a 'pension guarantee'. This would, in effect, underwrite the government's decision to increase the basic state pension in line with prices, while offering a more generous top-up for poor pensioners than is currently provided by income support. The report attacks means-tested benefits for pensioners, yet the top-up would also be means tested, although on a different basis to income support. Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the 'pension guarantee' was the most important proposal. 'If accepted by the Labour party, it marks an enormous shift from previous commitments to a large increase in the universal state pension,' he said. The other key pension recommendation is for a 'universal second pension' for future pensioners. All employees would have to belong to a regulated second pension scheme, in addition to the national insurance scheme, to which contributions would be paid by the state for the unemployed and for those caring for people at home. There is no equivalent shift with regard to the other universal state benefit - child benefit. The commission supports an increase in the level of child benefit, with the possibility of only a modest clawback from taxing high-rate tax payers for the sum received.</p>

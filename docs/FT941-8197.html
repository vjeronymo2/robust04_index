			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Big sell-off in bonds casts a shadow - London The UK stock market kicks off the second leg of the two-week trading account this morning under considerable threat from the big sell-off across international bond markets late last Friday. Share prices look almost certain to be marked down sharply at the outset of dealings, in what could be a re-run of the pattern of trading over the past two Mondays. The volatility was prompted by the US Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy. Two weeks ago, a fall in the the Dow Jones Average was matched almost point-for-point when London opened the following Monday, before recouping around half its opening fall. The immediate focus of attention will be the gilts market and European bonds to see if there is any substantial follow-through selling. The closure of Wall Street for a US holiday could provide an element of stability in London. Another crucial pointer for international markets, with the obvious implications for London, comes tomorrow when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, addresses the US Congress. The 3,350 level on the FT-SE is viewed by market-makers and some chartists as a strong rallying point and any decisive move below that level could be the trigger for more big selling of leading stocks. In spite of the wild swings in the equity market there is still no shortage of optimists. In a reference to the recent spate of UK economic data NatWest Securities says: 'The prospect of a further cut in UK base-rates is back on the agenda.' NatWest remains happy with its year-end FT-SE 100 forecast of 3,900. Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, is even more bullish, forecasting a year-end FT-SE 100 number of 3,950. Salomon makes the point that since 1980 the UK stock market has rallied in every year after the first Fed tightening, by between 14 per cent and 38 per cent. The broker says that in spite of rising US rates (it expects the Fed to tighten to 3 3/4 - 4 per cent by mid-year), it expects further rate cuts in Europe, underpinning equities. However, the equity market does face another searching examination of the currently popular theory of strong earnings recovery, as no less than 10 of the FT-SE 100 constituents unveil preliminary figures this week. If the reporting season to date is anything to go by, the market could be pleasantly surprised, although some broking houses, such as Nikko Securities, believe the risk is on the downside. Nikko says: 'Further downgradings of earnings estimates are likely as adjustments are made for growth prospects in a low inflation environment'. Three of the UK's big composite insurance groups, Guardian Royal Exchange, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, and the UK's biggest insurance broker, Sedgwick, report during the week. While analysts will obviously focus on the expected strong recovery in profitability, the good numbers may also revive takeover speculation in the sector, which has underperformed the wider market in recent months.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Slimline Baird improves to Pounds 19.6m William Baird, the textile group, reported virtually static operating profits of Pounds 24.7m for the year to end December. At the pre-tax level they rose from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 19.6m, reflecting lower interest charges of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.3m) and a smaller exceptional charge of Pounds 2.9m on the disposal of the group's Darchem Engineering businesses, compared with Pounds 7m of exceptionals in 1992. Mr Donald Parr, chairman, described trading conditions during the year as erratic, with markets continuing to be extremely competitive. But he was confident that the group's strategy of focusing on the core clothing and textiles business would show increasing returns. Turnover from the textiles businesses rose from Pounds 439.8m to Pounds 472.2m, including a contribution of Pounds 20m from Richard I Racke, a maker of women's wear and casual clothing acquired last August. Operating profits were flat at Pounds 21.1m, including Pounds 2.3m from acquisitions. Operating profits from the engineering side of the group were Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1m). The division's turnover fell from Pounds 101.7m to Pounds 50.4m, leaving total turnover at Pounds 522.6m, down from Pounds 541.5m. Last July the main Darchem Engineering businesses were sold to the Weir Group for Pounds 16m. The acquisition of Racke, which turned Baird into the third largest supplier to Marks and Spencer, helped Baird's contract clothing division to lift turnover by 17.6 per cent to Pounds 230m. Like for like turnover grew by 7 per cent, and margins improved from 3.7 per cent to 4.1 per cent. Mr Parr said the integration of Racke into Bairdwear Racke under a single management team was almost complete, with the consequent operating economies coming on stream. The branded clothing division, which includes Windsmoor and Dannimac, increased turnover by just 1.9 per cent to Pounds 213m. Operating profits were down from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 11.3m as margins were squeezed to 5.3 per cent (5.8 per cent). Basic earnings per share rose from 8.4p to 10.9p. An unchanged final dividend of 5.35p is proposed, giving an unchanged total of 8.9p. COMMENT The disposal of the engineering side has absorbed a lot of management time that could have been devoted to making the textile assets sweat. The virtual completion of the disposal programme and management changes in the textile divisions suggest that the company is ready to do just that - the question is how long will it take to turn round. Margins on textiles were around 4.5 per cent last year, well down on the company's past achievements. Profits this year are likely to be around Pounds 27m, giving a prospective multiple of around 15. The shares have been supported by the yield of 4.6 per cent, but otherwise look dull.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Asylum appeals plan to be diluted THE GOVERNMENT last night bowed to pressure from Tory backbenchers by agreeing to water down proposals which would remove the current right of appeal for relatives of British residents refused entry into Britain for short visits, David Owen writes. Under the revised plan - to be set out in the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill in standing committee - those refused a visa to visit Britain for up to six months are to receive a detailed notice explaining why entry papers have been refused. Applicants would then have the option of submitting a fresh application containing new information designed to address the initial problems. A refusal would not prejudice any subsequent application which would be considered 'whenever possible' by a different entry clearance official. Reasserting the government's commitment to the removal of appeal rights for short-term visitors and students, Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office minister, said he recognised that measures were needed to 'ensure that the small proportion of would be visitors who at present succeed in their appeals are not disadvantaged.' Mr Graham Allen, a Labour frontbench spokesman, dismissed the change as 'totally bogus' and 'a cosmetic exercise'.</p>

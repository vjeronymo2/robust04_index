They were booked on  allegations ranging from possession of cocaine to sales of cocaine.  </P> <P> Deputies also seized a small amount of rock cocaine.  </P> <P> The men were booked at the Carson sheriff's station with bail ranging from  $2,500 to $20,000. One of the men was also booked for assault on a peace  officer.  </P> <P> The two juveniles were held at the Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey.  </P> <P> On Friday night, deputies from four stations conducted a similar operation at  26 locations in Lynwood, Estrada said.  </P> <P> Deputies arrested 16 people during the Lynwood operation, including 10 men,  five male juveniles and one female juvenile, he said.  </P> <P> "The action was prompted by citizen complaints and follow-up investigation by  Lynwood narcotics investigators that led to the targeting of these locations,"  Estrada said.  </P> <P> The 10 men were booked at the Lynwood sheriff's station and held on bail  ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.  </P> <P> One male juvenile was booked at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall.

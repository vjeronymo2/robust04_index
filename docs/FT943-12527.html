			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Mail order route to French house design - Living Space Back in 1901, the Ladies Home Journal offered its readers the chance to buy a house - or rather the architectural plans for a house, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, then a rising star of American architecture - for a Dollars 5 fee. Trois Suisses, the French mail order catalogue, is now following suit by marketing a mail order house of its own, designed by Philippe Starck, the superstar French architect, for a slightly more substantial fee of FFr4,900 (Dollars 932). Starck is the man who sold half a million lobster-shaped lemon squeezers for Alessi and whose design flair turned the Royalton and the Century Paramount into the hippest hotels in Manhattan. His mail order house has only been on the market since June but, judging by the first flurry of orders, seems set to be another success. The house, says Starck, is the 'type of place I wanted to live in as a child, but didn't' It is a simple wooden construction on two floor with windows and a verandah all around, that looks like a modernist mixture of a Chinese pagoda and a Russian dacha. Starck has built his own version of the house in a forest on the outskirts of Paris. His 'leettle 'ut in the woods' appears in the Trois Suisses catalogue. It looks stunning. His original Charles Eames chairs and fin de siecle Venetian mirrors help: but even without them it is easy to see the appeal of the artisanal wooden facade and of the clear, bright rooms with light streaming through the windows. Trois Suisses reckons that it would cost FFr1.1m to build the house with the verandah and FFr850,000 without. The only hitch is that, so far, it has only cleared the design with the French planning authorities. Anyone who fancies recreating Chez Starck in another country will have to begin by battling with the bureaucrats.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombian coffee thrives in free market - Growers are losing enthusiasm for a return to export quotas ALTHOUGH Colombia remains strongly committed to uniting coffee producers and negotiating a new price-stabilisation pact, the country has done unexpectedly well in the free market. Last year it gathered a record harvest and achieved unprecedented exports, earning more from worldwide green coffee sales than any other producer. That very success - achieved at the expense of the National Coffee Fund's resources - has stimulated a growing anti-pact lobby that is arguing for fundamental changes in national policy. The adjustment to the free market may have been less traumatic for Colombian coffee growers, but the real price paid to farmers is the lowest in 10 years and the external price is the lowest in the history of the republic. The savings that made it possible to keep the domestic price from slipping further have been exhausted - the minister of finance warned recently that there could be no discussion of any increase until after the International Coffee Organisation meeting in London next week. 'Since the pact broke up world prices have been three times as unstable,' says Mr Diego Pizano, international adviser to the Federation of Coffee Growers. 'During the pact, prices went up and down by 12 per cent, but in the free market they have fluctuated by 35 to 36 per cent. This also affects the industry and the consumers. Some of the big companies would prefer to pay a decent price for coffee now, rather than see quality fall, which would affect consumption.' There are still many points of dissension between producing and consuming countries with little negotiating time left. Producers have found it particularly difficult to assess the US position and feel they are making all the concessions - hence the reference in a document agreed at producer meeting in Mexico City this month to 'the lack of flexibility' of consumers. The March 31 deadline set by the ICO council could be extended by a few days if next week's talks are going well, but Brazil and some of the central American countries are clearly growing impatient with the process. Although producers have accepted that there should be a universal quota (covering all exports, not just those to ICO consumer members) and 'selectivity' as to the proportions of different coffee types within the quota system, they want provision for a review after the first coffee year under the new pact to allow fine tuning. They also support four groups of coffee - with Colombian milds, which commands a 7 to 8 per cent premium, separated from 'other milds' - while the US argues for three groups. Other problems include the definition of the voting majority for council decisions and, above all, the duration of the agreement. 'In the short term, the pact won't change the situation. It will start to operate positively for stability in the longer term - is it worth signing a pact for three years as the US wants? There's no point, it would be a big mistake,' says Mr Gabriel Rosas, director of the Association of Private Coffee Exporters. The producing countries are aiming for an agreement lasting five to six years. If the pact is to be structured so that it reflects market conditions, reasons Mr Rosas, there is not an enormous difference from Colombia's point of view - policies must anyway be market-oriented and the agreement should be a means, not an objective in itself. Others criticise Colombia's pursuit of the pact more energetically, arguing that it is better to sell as much coffee as possible than to accumulate stock and benefit from slightly higher prices. Colombia exported 16.5m bags in 1992 with earnings of USDollars 1.3bn. This year's exports are expected to be nearer average at 13.5m bags, and Colombia's quota in a new coffee pact would be about 18 per cent - several points higher than it was in the last pact. This year's production will be affected by the spread of the coffee berry borer, known as broca. The release of bees to attack the tiny beetle and a fungus to suffocate it form part of the massive anti-broca campaign. This extra drain on funds comes at a time when growers are striving to reduce spending on inputs and disease control. Meanwhile the coffee federation's efforts to take up to a tenth of the area planted with coffee out of production are making slow headway. 'We can probably reduce by 30,000 hectares but the plan for 100,000 hectares looks difficult,' says Mr Pizano. 'The alternatives for growers are not attractive  -for example, the price paid for passion fruit has dropped. Coffee gives a guaranteed income and a small farmer can't risk losing that.' Coffee now contributes about a fifth of Colombia's foreign earnings, compared with 50 to 60 per cent during the 1970s. 'In macro-economic terms coffee is less important - but it is still very important from the social and employment points of view. And the coffee sector weighs heavily in terms of domestic demand,' said Mr Rosas. 'Colombia needs a solid long term policy. Producers cannot go on thinking of the pact as the answer to their problems.'</p>

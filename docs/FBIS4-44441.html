			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shen Wen (3947 2429): "Kampuchea--the Next </F> Investment Hot Spot?"]    [Text] In 1993 there was an historical change in the  Kampuchean situation. The establishment of a united government  implies that Kampuchea entered a new era of peaceful  reconstruction.    In more than two decades of war chaos, Kampuchea's numerous  industries withered and the masses live in dire poverty. The  economic base is entirely weak and it will still take a  relatively long time to recover pre-war levels. Although this is  the case, many people still harbor full confidence that  Kampuchea's economy will recover as soon as possible. Some Asian  businessmen and investors are sending troops to the Kampuchean  market. Singapore had a rather early start in investment in  Kampuchea. As early as 1987, with government auth ority  Singaporean businessmen began business with some private  companies which had special permission from the former Phnom  Penh government. By the first half of 1991, Singapore had  replaced the former Soviet Union to become Kampuchea's largest  trade partner; bilateral Singaporean-Kampuchean trade reached  S$330 million, up 38.5 percent over 1990. Singapore exports to  Kampuchea petroleum, automobiles, beverages, machinery and  electrical products. Kampuchea sells to Singapore rubber, wood,  dried fish and rattan products. At present the most luxurious  four-star hotel in Phnom Penh, the Jin Baodian Hotel, is a joint  venture of a private Singaporean company and the Kampuchean  government tourism bureau. It officially opened in 1991 with an  investment of S$40 million [Singapore dollars]. Thailand is  Kampuchea's greatest investor. Thai businessmen were among the  earliest to send troops to Kampuchean markets under the Thai  government's strategic policy of encouraging "transformation of  Indochina's battlefields into commercial markets."  Kampuchean-Thai border trade began as early as the early 1980s,  and by the end of the decade the area became Kampuchea's most  open and free border trade area. In 1988 Thai-Kampuchean  bilateral trade was only $600,000. In 1991 it was $16 million.  In 1992 it leapt to $160 million, a nine-fold increase. In the  first quarter of 1993, bilateral trade was $183 million. Among  Kampuchea's foreign investors, Thai businessmen head the list.  Through the end of 1993, Thai enterprises invested in Kampuchea  10 billion baht (approximately $400 million). According to  official Kampuchean statistics, between 1989 and April 1992,  when the former Phnom Penh government promulgated foreign  investment laws, 79 of 300 approved foreign investment projects  were from Thailand, or 26.3 percent. At present there are  approximately 43 Thai companies investing in plants in  Kampuchea. Japan is another of Kampuchea's most important  investors. Japanese businessmen are very interested in  Kampuchea's abundant forests. At present Kampuchea's largest  wood product processing plant was jointly built by Japan and  Kampuchea's ministry of agriculture at an investment of $5.5  million; annual wood output is 100,000 cubic meters. In recent  years, Japanese-Kampuchean bilateral trade has rapidly  increased, of which, Japanese exports to Kampuchea have  increased particularly fast. In 1990, Japan's total commodity  exports to Kampuchea were $5 million; increasing to $7 million  in 1991, and jumped to $230 million in 1992, a more than 31-fold  increase. Hong Kong businessmen are relatively keen to set up  hotels and restuarants in Kampuchea. Hong Kong trade with  Kampuchea is primarily en trepot; motorcycles and industrial  machinery are the main export commodities. In 1992, Hong Kong's  gross exports were at HK $170 million, a more than triple  increase over 1991; imports from Kampuchea totalled HK$4.42  million, up 1.8 times over 1991. Through April 1992, there were  59 projects in Kampuchea using Hong Kong investment capital, or  20 percent of all of Kampuchea's foreign investment. In  addition, France is striving to return to Kampuchea. French  businessmen deal mainly in food products, tobacco, alcohol and  clothing. In 1991, French-Kampuchean bilateral trade was at $7  million; by 1992, it increased to $16 million. French companies  anticipated the return of King Sihanouk at the end of 1991, and  contracted to repair the palace. They also undertook printing  new Kampuchean currency. Through April 1992, French capital was  invested in 61 Kampuchean projects, or 20.3 percent of all  foreign investment projects. One businessmen after another from  other western and eastern alliance countries and regions and  Taiwan have gone to Kampuchea to study investment and trade  there, although very few have succeeded. Studying the reasons,  besides a still unstable political situation and overly backward  infrastructure, the Kampuchean government has too many and too  strict constraints on foreign investment. For example, it  stipulates foreign investors shall not engage in independent  trade. Foreigners are not permitted to engage independently in  real estate or most construction projects. The government also  stipulates a 15 percent mandatory tax on repatriated surplus  profits on foreign investments in Kampuchea. According to  official Kampuchean information, more than 30 foreign investment  banks have been allowed to be established, although only 18  really have gone into operation since there now is no clear  economic recovery. Furthermore, the banking industry only  transfers accounts, has cash accounts or opens letters of  credit. Temporarily, permission has not been given for credit  financing.    In sum, Kampuchea is an attractive market, but people are  still waiting to see whether it can become a new Southeast Asian  investment hot spot.</p>

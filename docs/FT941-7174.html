			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Another sharp sell-off staged in hectic trading European government bonds staged another sharp sell-off in hectic trading as traders reported panic selling, mainly in the futures markets. UK gilts took the worst beating, falling by as much as three points in the afternoon, while most European markets slid by between one and two points at the long end. 'This sell-off is completely unwarranted on fundamental grounds,' said Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'What we're dealing with has very little to do with economic fundamentals - it's about the preservation of capital.' Bond markets worldwide have been weakening for the last few weeks in a sell-off that began after the US Federal Reserve's small monetary tightening in early February. Gilts bore the brunt of the selling and under-performed most continental European bond markets. The March long gilt futures contract dropped by 2 23/32 points to 111 13/16 and the yield spread on the 10-year benchmark gilt over its German counterpart widened to 113 basis points, from 88 basis points on Wednesday. An overnight slide in US Treasuries and a bearish UK interest-rate forecast from Nomura equities strategist, Mr Nick Knight, sent gilts sharply lower at the open. Mr Knight said he expects UK base rates to rise to between 6 and 7 per cent by the year-end from 5.25 per cent now. Traders reported some switching into gilts out of French and German government bonds, but said that was more than offset by continued sales from leveraged trading accounts in the US. Buying is unlikely to emerge before the sell-off has run its course. 'There's too much speculative money about and buyers are on strike,' said Mr Bob Tyley, senior strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. He recommends taking a reactive stance. 'Don't try to pick the bottom - keep out and wait for things to calm down before re-entering these markets.' German government bonds also fell sharply, with traders citing nervousness over potential turmoil in Russia and fears of inflated money supply data for January. In late London trading the March Bund future was down 1.31 point at 96.65. French bonds fell steeply after the Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 6.10 per cent. Dealers were disappointed by the size of the cut. Many had expected the central bank to leave rates steady until the Bundesbank's next easing, while others had bet on a 20 basis point cut in a move asserting the Bank of France's new independence. The March French bond future dropped by 1.04 points to 126.94. Belgium plans to launch a 30-year bond by the summer, finance minister Mr Philippe Maystadt said yesterday. The government also plans to issue a new nine-year bond, known as the '3-6-9', targeted primarily at domestic and retail investors. The bond will be issued between March 8 and 14, and will carry a fixed coupon of 6 per cent between 1994 and 1995. The rate will then be variable, with a minimum level of 6.25 per cent between 1997 and 2000, and then 6.5 per cent for the last three years. Longer-dated US Treasury bonds attempted to rally yesterday afternoon after a successful five-year note auction, but the brief upturn fizzled amid persisent concerns over monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 3/32 lower at 93 3/4 , with the yield rising to 6.735 per cent. It was the first time since July that the long bond's rate of return has exceeded 6.7 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 4.724 per cent. The session's direction was established at the opening. Bonds fell on news of a 3.7 per cent rise in January durable goods orders, against forecasts of a 1 per cent increase. But traders soon realised that most of the jump was attributable to a sharp upturn in aircraft orders, and the market retraced some of its losses. Nevertheless, traders were approaching the afternoon sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes with caution, causing prices to fall again mid-morning. Early on, there seemed to be little enthusiasm for buying the new issue, with the widespread view that the Federal Reserve would soon raise short-term rates for a second time. In the event, the auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year paper drew more demand than expected, and follow-through buying briefly revived the market. But the underlying anxiety over interest rates resurfaced, and sentiment soon shifted once again. In late activity, prices were near the lowest levels of the session.</p>

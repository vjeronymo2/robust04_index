(``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC``) the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On June 1, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of its original filing, to revise certain language used therein and to request approval to amend its Minor Rule Violation Enforcement and Reporting Plan (``Plan''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Gerald D.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx proposes to adopt Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A&hyph;2, Stopping Orders, which would require that any order on the book that is stopped by the specialist be displayed at its price or better if not executed immediately after being stopped. Moreover, the proposed advice would prohibit the specialist from trading for the specialist's own account with any order that specialist stopped, while the specialist is in possession of an order at that price or better. In this regard, the specialist must exercise due diligence to match the stopped order with the other order pursuant to Phlx Rules 119 and 120. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Advice A&hyph;2(E) is followed by the designator ``(E)'' to identify it as an equity floor advice, applicable only to the Exchange's equity floor. In this regard, the Exchange's Plan would be amended to include this Advice. Accordingly, violations of proposed Advice A&hyph;2(E) would be subject to a fine schedule, which results in a $250 fine for the first occurrence, a $500 fine for the second occurrence and a sanction discretionary with the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee for any violations thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx proposed to adopt Advice A&hyph;2(E) to govern stopping orders on the equity trading floor. The purpose of the proposal is to codify stopping policies into an advice as a ready reminder to the equity floor and also to establish that minor violations may result in the issuance of pre-established fines. The advice is also intended to contribute to the standardization of trading floor rules among the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') participant exchanges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to stopped orders on the book, the proposed text is consistent with the specialist's requirements to engage in a course of dealings to assist in the maintenance of a fair and orderly market, pursuant to Phlx Rule 203. Specifically, the first requirement is that a stopped order on the book must be displayed at its price or better if not executed immediately after being stopped. The second requirement of this Advice prohibits a specialist from trading with a stopped order for his own account, while in possession of another order at an equal or better price. Instead, the specialist would be required to exercise due diligence to ``match'' the stopped order with the other order, consistent with Phlx Rule 218. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, by furthering the purposes of Rule 203, which in turn, should foster a fair and orderly market in Exchange traded securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were either solicited or received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Azerbaijan's military forces fired on the Armenian  defense positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon on the night of 15 May.  The incident took place after a two-day lull in the fighting.  As reported earlier, the Armenian side refrained from returning  fire.    Although an agreement has been reached in Moscow to end the  fighting, the situation in the confrontation areas between the  Nagrono-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and Azerbaijan continues to be  unstable. Azerbaijan National Army subunits have violated the  cease-fire agreement from time to time. The NKR Defense Army  Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's  military units fired on the Armenian positions in the northern  part of Mardakertskiy Rayon and the central areas in Agdamskiy  Rayon last night and this morning. One NKR military man was  wounded. However, the defense units continued to heed the NKR  Defense Army Headquarters' order not to return the enemy fire.  The same source also disclosed that the situation on the other  parts of the NKR front line has been relatively peaceful.    The situation in the border region between Armenia and  Azerbaijan was peaceful last night and this morning, that is, as  of noon today.    Peace and security must prevail on the border between the  two  republics. Regardless of the tension between the two sides, the  relations between the two republics must be restored. Our  people lived as neighbors in the past; they will continue to  live as neighbors in the future. It is common knowledge that  close neighbors are [words indistinct] than distant countries.  Therefore, it is time to end the hostile activities between the  two sides.</p>

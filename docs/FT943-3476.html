			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Cask ales draw a wider clientele Traditional cask ales are taking a rising share of the declining UK beer market by attracting a wider range of drinkers, particularly among young consumers and women, says a report. The annual report on the sector by Carlsberg-Tetley, the UK brewing joint venture of Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons, says the sales volume of cask ales rose 9 per cent in the year to January while total beer sales fell 2 per cent. Cask beers, which derive some of their qualities from secondary fermentation in the casks, have been taking market share from pasteurised keg beers. The cask share of draught beer sales has risen from 35 per cent in 1987 to 47 per cent in February. The keg share has fallen from 65 per cent to 53 per cent. Several factors have contributed to the growth of cask beers. The British are drinking smaller volumes of beer but are increasingly willing to buy premium products such as cask ales. Wider availability of beers has also contributed. Publicans have stocked a broader range since the government required breweries to reduce the number of pubs they owned. Pubs are also attracting a broader clientele by offering better food and facilities. A growing number of families go to pubs for meals and special occasions. The report says women account for about 16 per cent of cask ale drinkers.</p>

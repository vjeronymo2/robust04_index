			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEDGECOCK ON LONG LIST OF WITNESSES IN HUNTER FRAUD TRIAL  </P> <P> Former Mayor Roger Hedgecock is one of 529 potential defense witnesses in the  fraud and tax evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, according to a list  submitted Wednesday to federal court by Hunter's attorneys.  </P> <P> Although the document, which is not yet part of the official court record,  lists potential witnesses, Hunter's attorneys have stated several times that  Hedgecock's testimony is essential to prove that Hunter made a legitimate  investment when she gave money to the company managing Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral  campaign.  </P> <P> U. S. District Court Judge Earl B. Gilliam temporarily released the list to  reporters Thursday, but the list was recalled after a few moments when defense  attorney Richard Marmaro saw it in the audience. The list is expected to be  made public when defense attorneys officially submit the list with all  supporting paper work, possibly today.  </P> <P> Also included on the witness list are a number of Hunter's relatives, including  her son, George, who was excluded from the courtroom Thursday, and many figures  associated with J. David &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The potentially large number of witnesses will be used by Hunter's attorneys to  defend her against prosecutors' allegations that she participated in the J.  David Ponzi scheme.  </P></p>

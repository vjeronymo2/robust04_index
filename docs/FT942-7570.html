			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Rules on health and safety tidied Six sets of health and safety regulations will replace 100 old ones in line with proposals made by the Health and Safety Commission yesterday, Richard Donkin writes. The proposals, however, appear to be more of a tidying-up exercise than the removal of red tape heralded by the government. Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, welcomed the proposals which, he said, would 'in no way reduce our health and safety standards'. The government contention that business was being tethered by too many regulations, however, did not appear to be supported by the HSC report. It quoted a survey which showed that most companies thought the existing law was reasonable and more than 80 per cent of them had no suggestions to make about changes. The commission said there was confusion about regulations, and that some businesses had been advised by consultants or suppliers that there were requirements to be met where none existed.</p>

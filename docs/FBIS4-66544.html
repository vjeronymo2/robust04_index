Commission on Human Rights today,  called on the world community to wake up to the dangers posed by  terrorism, and asked for its understanding of the problems that  India faced from terrorism.    At a press conference later, Dr. Singh, renewed the  Government's call to Pakistan for a dialogue on Kashmir, stating  that this was the "only course open" to restore peace.    At the Commission's conference, he declared: "As we see it,  our struggle against terrorism is part of a worldwide struggle  to promote the rule of law as against the rule of the gun." He  appealed to the world for "sympathy, understanding and support  in our struggle against terrorism," and warned that the "world  community must wake up before it is too late.    Speaking two days after the Pakistani Prime Minister, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto's attack on the Indian policy on Kashmir, Dr.  Singh focussed on the impact that Pakistani aid to Kashmiri  separatism was having on India. "It is terrorism of unparalleled  ferocity that we have been seeing in some parts of India. The  sponsorship of terrorist violence from abroad, in blatant  pursuit of territorial gains, seeks to destroy our secular,  democratic, pluralistic civil order. The goal has been pursued  with ruthlessness at the cost of thousands of lives...the misery  inflicted by terrorists on peaceful citizens should be obvious  from the fact that nearly 30,000 Indian citizens, both Hindu and  Muslim, have had to flee their homes to other parts of India and  have become refugees in their own homeland."    Admits losses of security forces: Significantly,  Dr. Singh acknowledged lapses on the part of the security  forces. "It is not the claim of the Government of India, indeed  no country and no Government can make such a claim, that no  human rights violations ever occur in our territory. We are  conscious that some abberations on the part of the law-enforcing  authorities can and do take place particularly in confronting  terrorism. We have no desire to put these aberrations under the  carpet. We do, however, claim that we have an unswerving  commitment to human rights and that we have in our legal system  an effective remedial framework, as well as a strong tradition  of punishing human rights violations wherever they are found to  occur."    Red Cross may be allowed: He also announced a  further relaxation of the Government's earlier position of not  letting foreign observers and human rights organisations into  Jammu and Kashmir. The International Commission of Jurists has  been the first international organisation to receive permission  to go to Kashmir, and the International Committee of the Red  Cross might be the next allowed in. Modalities of visits by the  Red Cross were being discussed.    Dr. Singh only made a brief reference to Ms. Bhutto's  speech,  when he said, "It is most unfortunate that the distinguished  Prime Minister of Pakistan, for whom we have great respect and  regard, has used this forum to convey a wholly erroneous view of  the state of affairs in the Indian State of Jammu and  Kashmir...it is our sincere hope that this forum will not be  used to politicise the human rights issues."    At the press conference, Dr. Singh, firmly ruled out the  Pakistani suggestion for an independent team of outside  investigators to look into whether Pakistan was sponsoring  terrorism. "This is not something that requires proof. There are  any number of reports, including from the U.S. Congress that  documents this," he said.</p>

The Academy's refusal was  determined. Based on the decisions of the Extraordinary Serbian  Assembly, the Serbian authority takes the Kosova Academy  building and its property.    Many personalities of the state, politics, and science who  have protested against the Serbian warnings to abolishing the  Kosova Academy, are expecting the international support for  protecting the highest Albanian science institution in Kosova.</p>

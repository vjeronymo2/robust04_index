			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Management: An equal balance - Richard Donkin asks whether the First Direct telephone banking service can maintain the high standards it has set itself Kevin Newman, looking far too young to be the head of one of Britain's most unusual banking operations, lets his composure drop slightly as he reflects on the hierarchical structure of British business. 'The challenge for UK industry is to tear down the boardrooms. We have to ask fundamental questions about why we need offices,' he says. Shedding the trappings of office is part of the management philosophy at First Direct, Midland's telephone banking business. Newman, the 36-year-old chief executive, sits among the telephone sales staff in First Direct's single-storey headquarters on the outskirts of Leeds. He believes the egalitarian approach which characterises the operation is the stuff of business future. His style of people management, encapsulated perhaps in the New Testament idea of doing as you would be done by, relies heavily on leadership by example. It is a sobering ethos for managers who wallow in the trappings of status. Newman recalls disapprovingly a rival building society preparing to move into new purpose-built offices. The architect's plans had a space earmarked for a workplace creche but this was soon turned into an executive dining room. First Direct has a creche for 70 children at its headquarters, and will increase its intake when the bank expands. Currently it employs 1,700 staff but this figure may have moved closer to 2,000 by the end of the year. While Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds and Midland have all been busy shedding administrative jobs in a bid to become more competitive, First Direct has been recruiting staff. Later this year it is to expand into additional offices on the other side of Leeds that will run in tandem with the existing offices. The bank's employment policies are linked unusually closely with its business strategy. This is a result of customer requirements identified by early market research which asked people what they wanted from their bank. The thing customers craved most of all, says Newman, was an equal relationship with their bank manager. 'The only people who can deliver this kind of relationship is our staff, and we can't ask people to deliver something that does not reflect the way they are treated themselves as employees in the workplace,' he says. First Direct is among the new remote businesses that most closely resemble what has been called the 'virtual organisation'. The true virtual organisation is one that appears, serves a purpose and disappears, such as a unit that gathers together for the making of a film and then dissipates after it is made. First Direct presents itself to staff as a gateway through which customers pass to access their money, obtain advice and control their financial affairs. Conventional banks, staff are told, are a brick wall  - resolute but restrictive, secure but unresponsive. The freshness of its staff is in line with this thinking. Only 5 per cent have worked previously in banks. First Direct does not look for former bank training in candidates for its posts of banking representative, equivalent to bank clerk. The onus is on personality. 'We recruit from behavioural skills rather than banking skills because you can acquire banking skills through training,' says Newman. His own background was in information technology. He was head of management information systems at Woolworths, the retail chain, before he joined Midland in 1988 to work on the First Direct project as its IT director. He was promoted to chief executive in 1991. Staff who did transfer from banks in the company's early days often found the new expectations about the approach to their job difficult to handle. They were not used to either dealing with problems themselves or examining how they could do their jobs better. One of the roots of First Direct's employment philosophy appears to be an underlying fairness about how work is shared. Newman is almost fanatical about single status. The only perk provided exclusively for higher management is company cars, and he has mixed feelings about that. Other benefits are spread across the staff. The 24-hour banking service is run on flexible shift patterns. In theory staff choose their own working hours, although in practice these tend to be moulded around the peaks and troughs of demand. A quarter of the staff work fewer than 30 hours a week and two-thirds do not work the typical Monday to Friday nine-to-five week. Janet Chaplin, who joined the bank two and a half years ago, works a 32-hour week consisting of four shifts of 8.30 am to 4pm with Wednesdays off. People can choose anything between 16 and 32 hours a week in order to vary their shifts. Outlining an example of workplace democracy, Chaplin says: 'We decided ourselves how we should dress at work. We opted for quite smart dress: ties for men and blouses and skirts for women because we thought that how we dressed influenced the way we carried out our jobs. Personally I would like a uniform, but others think that's going a bit too far.' Basic pay is related to an employee's skills. While these can be heavily behavioural (communicating, decision making, judgment, influencing, using information and handling stress), some are technical. Employees are required to match certain standards, covering call duration and time 'signed on' at the workstation. Voice quality is monitored by a team that tracks 5 to 10 per cent of all the calls the bank receives. Monitors are trained to listen to the pitch and tone of the voice, and continuous appraisal is passed on in team feedback sessions. Appraisal ratings determine levels of performance bonus awarded on top of base pay. The rating reflects measures of hard and soft criteria. While hard measures such as average call duration and income targets are listed, rapport building and the ability to spot opportunities are also rewarded. How effectively First Direct's management approach translates to the bottom line is perhaps too early to judge. Much of the industry has by now adopted some form of telephone banking, but competitors seem hesitant about imitating the management strategies at the core of the First Direct operation, or unclear about how they work. The real challenge for the organisation will be maintaining the high standards it has set itself.</p>

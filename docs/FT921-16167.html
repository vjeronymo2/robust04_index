			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Port sell-off plan faces challenge THE government's port privatisation programme will face a crucial test this week when the management team which failed in its bid to buy the Tees and Hartlepool port challenges the decision. Mr John Hackney, who led the management-employee team, is seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, in a last-ditch attempt to persuade him to reverse the decision. If he does not, Mr Hackney said his team would seek a judicial review of the decision taken by the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority. Mr Rifkind has to approve the authority's decision. Mr Hackney said: 'We have taken legal advice and the view is that there are certainly grounds for a judicial review.' The management's challenge to the decision to sell the port to a consortium led by Powell Duffryn, the engineering group, will be closely watched by executives at other ports planning privatisation. Three other ports - Clyde, Medway and Tilbury - have put themselves up for sale under the 1991 Ports Act which allows the privatisation of the 114 trust ports. The challenge to the outcome of the Tees and Hartlepool sale comes at a critical time for the three other privatisations. Potential buyers have until the end of this week to indicate their interest in the Clyde port. The winner of the Medway bid is expected to be announced in early February, while the successful bidder for Tilbury is due to be decided by late next month. The government has already responded to criticism of the Tees and Hartlepool decision by allowing Forth Port Authority to consider a stock market flotation rather than a sale through competitive tendering. The Tees and Hartlepool sale was conducted by the port authority, subject to government approval. The authority announced just before Christmas that Teesside Holdings, a consortium made up of Powell Duffryn, the venture capital concern 3i and Humberside Holdings, a private company, had won with a bid of Pounds 180m. There were three unsuccessful bidders: Maritime Transport Services with a Pounds 210m offer; Ocean Group with Pounds 155m; and the management-employee team with Pounds 148m. Mr Rifkind has said he is 'minded' to accept the authority's recommendation and is expected to give his verdict on January 14. Mr Hackney, chief executive of the port authority, said yesterday that the authority contravened the sale procedure agreed with the Department of Transport. Sales objectives outlined in the initial bid documents were not applied at the final bid, he said. In particular, it was a stated objective that 'all or a substantial proportion' of the privatised company should be held by employees and management. 'We took this at face value and it reduced the size of our bid because we had to use mainly loan finance rather than equity,' Mr Hackney said. He said Teesside Holdings would allocate only 5 per cent to employees and management. 'There is no way this can be described as substantial.'</p>

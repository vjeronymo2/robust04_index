			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Manila leader calls for more foreign investment PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos of the Philippines has made a strong appeal for more foreign investment in his country, saying his government's openness to investors is 'wholehearted and unequivocal'. Mr Ramos, who is on a four-day state visit to Malaysia, said the Philippines was determined to create a favourable climate for investors and was already tackling some of the country's problems, such as power shortages and crime. Urging Malaysian business to pay more attention to the Philippines, the president said investment and two-way trade between the two countries was still very small. Malaysian investments represent less than 1 per cent of total foreign investment in the Philippines. Malaysia's trade with the Philippines is also under 1 per cent of its total trade. Mr Ramos is making the first state visit to Malaysia by a Philippines president for 25 years, though both countries are in the Association of South-east Asian Nations. The Malaysian state of Sabah is 2 1/2 hours by air from Kuala Lumpur, but not far from the south of the Philippines, and hundreds of thousands of Filipinos work there. Mr Ramos and Dr Mahathir agreed to set up a joint commission to review the position of these migrants. It was also agreed to investigate setting up an economic zone encompassing Sabah, the Philippines island of Mindanao and the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>

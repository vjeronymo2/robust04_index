			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- In addition to the Alliance  90/Greens and the refugee relief organization Pro Asylum, the  Hesse Office for the Protection of the Constitution has also  warned against deporting Kurds to Turkey. [passage omitted]    Greens politicians Angelika Beer and Claudia Roth said that  a  possible agreement between the FRG and Turkey on the deportation  of violent Kurdish demonstrators is "fatal": Such an agreement  is "inconceivable" for constitutional reasons and because of  German commitments from the Geneva Refugee Convention and the  European Human Rights Convention. Pro Asylum spokesman Herbert  Leuninger stated that negotiations on the "return" of Kurds are  the "official admission that human rights are being disregarded  at the Bosporus."    On Wednesday [30 March] the Bonn Interior Ministry rejected  a  report of FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU that, within the framework of an  agreement with Ankara, it is planning to establish "special  prisons" for violent Kurdish criminals to be deported. Minister  Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) neither proposed  this nor has such plans, a spokesman stressed. Moreover, the  "formation of opinion" on opportunities for the speedy  deportation of Kurds has not yet been concluded within the  Federal Government, it was stated.    Hesse Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic  Party of Germany) and Ferse, director of the Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, called on the Kurds living in  Germany not to leave the public definition of the image of the  Kurdish people to the extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan  (PKK). In the past few months, PKK adherents have proved  themselves to be a group with "extraordinary aggressiveness."  However, Ferse also accused the Turkish intelligence service of  illegal activities on German soil in connection with  investigations into the surroundings of the PKK. "Therefore, we  have to be careful that our employees are not working for the  Turks at the same time," Ferse said. [passage omitted]</p>

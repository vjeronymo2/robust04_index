			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Injunctions sought over Lloyd's cash calls CONFRONTATION at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, moved closer yesterday as solicitors took legal action on behalf of hundreds of Names facing financial ruin. A court hearing may take place as early as next week. Mr Michael Freeman, a solicitor, issued motions for a number of injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down from the funds that Names - individuals whose personal assets back underwriting - must deposit with agents when they join the insurance market. More than 600 Names are backing the action and the injunctions applied for are designed to serve as test cases. Lloyd's has pledged to 'strongly resist' them. The Names are members of syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young, Feltrim and Devonshire that participated in 'spiral' reinsurance business, in which syndicates reinsure each others' reinsurance exposures. The injunctions are being sought on the grounds that cash calls by syndicate managers are legally 'improper'. Separately, more than 175 Names who were members of the syndicate 384 formerly managed by the Aragorn agency, met to press for compensation for insurance losses. The syndicate's losses from reinsurance business were nearly Pounds 11m. Names want compensation for Pounds 6m of the losses which they allege were brought about by the mistaken decision of Mr Graham Potter, 384's underwriter, to underwrite 30.5 per cent of a risk when he had intended to underwrite only 2.7 per cent. In 1990 a Lloyd's disciplinary committee ordered Mr Potter to cease underwriting at Lloyd's.</p>

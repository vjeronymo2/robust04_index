			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / EU backs plan to restore land to Bosnian Moslems The European Union yesterday backed a Franco-German plan to offer Serbia a gradual suspension of UN sanctions in exchange for more land for Bosnia's embattled Moslems. It was the Union's first joint action under the Maastricht treaty. Foreign ministers of the 12, meeting in Luxembourg alongside the Western European Union, the EU's embryonic defence arm, also threatened to use force to get aid convoys through Bosnia. Aid deliveries were suspended four weeks ago after attacks on convoys, and Bosnia's huge refugee population faces catastrophe as winter takes hold. The 12 foreign ministers, along with Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, and commanders of the UN peace force, have invited military and political leaders of the warring parties to Geneva on Monday to discuss humanitarian aid and the steps towards a peace settlement. The EU plan has been discussed with Washington, and the US and Russia are being invited to Geneva next Monday. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said 'we are very anxious not to get into any tangles, as we did earlier in the year with the Americans', when the US and Europe clashed over Washington's plan to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia and to bomb Serb positions. Ministers made it clear yesterday that they were offering only a progressive phasing out of sanctions on Serbia and its ally Montenegro. This will be conditional on Serb, and possibly Croat, surrender of some of the land seized from Bosnian Moslems, a ceasefire, and untramelled passage for aid convoys and airlifts into Tuzla, Mostar and Sarajevo. The total suspension of sanctions, in line with UN Security Council resolution 871, would be contingent on an agreement being reached over the Serb enclave of Krajina in south Croatia, and over Belgrade's domination of the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo. The presence of Bosnia's contending militia commanders at the Geneva meeting was seen yesterday as vital to the plan's prospects. Last Thursday, Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN high commissioner for refugees, gained agreement from the Bosnian parties' political leaders to reopen main aid supply routes this week, but they are still blocked. The EU now wants local military commanders to sign up to last week's agreement, and for UN forces to be able to take military action - including from the air - against 'uncontrolled elements' who flout it. Of the three main contributors of troops to UN forces in Bosnia, France emphasised that using force was not excluded, while Spain said militia units breaking any accords reached in Geneva would be treated as 'irregulars'. Mr Hurd said 'there might be action' against those breaking agreements but 'that was a matter for judgment'. He said General Jean Cot, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, who briefed ministers yesterday, had made clear 'the impossibility of forcing aid through against sustained opposition'.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHIEF DEFENDS POLICEMAN WHO SHOT YOUTH 11 TIMES  </P> <P> Seventeen-year-old Robert Scriven took at least 11 gunshots in his body in his  fatal struggle with an Escondido police officer, Police Chief Vince Jimno said  Thursday.  </P> <P> But Jimno said he found no fault with Officer Martin Hewlett's handling of the  situation, especially given that Hewlett had lost the upper hand in the  struggle, was pinned to the ground and was fighting to retain control of his  handgun.  </P> <P> Hewlett had chased Scriven into a brush-and-bamboo thicket just before midnight  Monday after Scriven was seen running a stop sign in a stolen sports car,  police said. They said Scriven was fleeing Hewlett and another officer in a  chase on the north side of Escondido before he lost control of his vehicle,  jumped out and took off on foot into the darkness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officer Taller and Heavier  </P> <P> Hewlett caught up with the Escondido teen-ager in the dense vegetation, and the  two began struggling, according to official police reports. Although Hewlett is  taller and heavier than the boy, he found himself pinned on his back and  "feared for his life," Jimno said Thursday, elaborating on the incident after  having talked to Hewlett.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old officer, a four-year veteran of the Escondido Police  Department, is on routine administrative leave pending an investigation.  </P> <P> "In my mind I don't feel anxious about it at all," Jimno said of the pending  investigation, which will be conducted by both his department and the San Diego  County Sheriff's Department before being turned over to the district attorney's  office for evaluation. Jimno's department will then conduct an internal review  of the shooting, as is customary whenever an officer fires his weapon.  </P> <P> "This forces us to think about our procedures and practices, whether we are  doing it the right way," Jimno said. "Each time we have (a shooting), we review  it in detail to see if there's anything we can do differently so this won't  occur again."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incidents Create Tension  </P> <P> Such incidents create tension for the entire department, he said. "The officers  watch very closely to see how the department responds to the innuendo, the  allegations or whatever else occurs in the media, to see if the department will  be supportive of them and stand by them," he said.  </P> <P> Jimno said officers are especially concerned about public reaction to the  shooting of the teen-ager, who was unarmed.  </P> <P> "They're not rooting," he said. "They're saying, 'Thank God Hewlett is OK.'  They're quiet. They're not real excited about this. The concern they have now  is, what will people think of us again?"  </P> <P> Department morale plummeted in 1983 when an officer mistakenly shot and killed  Leslie Landersman, an office secretary who had been taken hostage by a bank  robber. The gunman kidnaped her after escaping in a shoot-out with police and  forced her to be his getaway driver in her own vehicle. Landersman was slain by  police fire when she lunged to free herself from her captor after they found  themselves trapped on a cul-de-sac and surrounded by officers. The robber was  also shot and killed.  </P> <P> The department also suffered from the fallout publicity on the way officers  handled the situation. During a 13-minute stretch, 10 officers fired their  shotguns 12 times and their handguns 35 times. Five officers were disciplined  for actions contrary to department policies; the most severely punished was a  lieutenant whose own gunfire hit the door of another police car, behind which  another officer had taken cover.  </P> <P> But Jimno and others say no parallels should be drawn between the 1983  shoot-out and what occurred Monday night. In the more recent incident, Jimno  said, an officer's own life was on the line because of a criminal suspect who  not only resisted arrest but also tried to wrest the officer's gun from him.  </P> <P> "It's a shame it was a 17-year-old, but a 17-year-old can kill you as easily as  a 27-year-old," Jimno said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Sense in Second-Guessing  </P> <P> Nothing will be gained by trying to second-guess why Hewlett fired off as many  shots as he did, Jimno said.  </P> <P> "People will question that, but they haven't been through something like this,"  the chief said. "Hewlett really thought he was going to die. He was fighting  for his life."  </P> <P> Jimno said Hewlett and Scriven had been struggling for nearly two minutes, and  the officer was having little success against the teen. Scriven had recently  been released from the California Youth Authority for stealing a car, and had  done body building while in custody. Scriven was 5 feet, 10 inches tall and  weighed 170 pounds; Hewlett is described by police as taller than 6 feet and  husky.  </P> <P> Jimno said this was the situation Monday night as he understood it:  </P> <P> "It's extremely dark, the guy (Hewlett) isn't getting any help (because other  officers hadn't arrived yet), he's getting whipped now, the guy's right on top  of him, he's very tired and the other guy is getting the upper hand.  </P> <P> "The officer reaches for his gun, the other guy tries to grab it out of his  hand, so the officer shoots while the guy is on top of him, and when the guy  gets off of him, he (Hewlett) doesn't know if he'll come back after him again.  He shoots some more. It's human nature to shoot until the attacker stops,  whether it's one shot or 15."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Keeping Track  </P> <P> Jimno said it was unlikely that Hewlett tracked in his mind how many shots he  fired.  </P> <P> "Most people in these kinds of life-and-death struggles have no idea how many  shots they've fired," he said. "An officer will swear he only shot his revolver  once, yet all six shots of his revolver have been fired."  </P> <P> Jimno said his department received word from the county coroner's office  Thursday that 11 bullets had been taken from Scriven's body. It was unclear,  however, whether Scriven had also been struck by bullets that passed through  his body.  </P> <P> The department uses soft-nose, hollow-pointed bullets designed to mushroom on  impact and remain in the body, to reduce the risk of striking someone in the  background.  </P> <P> "We don't have a philosophy of shoot to wound," Jimno said. "You shoot to stop  completely."  </P> <P> Deputy Coroner Max Murphy said Thursday that Scriven died of "multiple gunshot  wounds," but said other details, including how many times Scriven had been  shot, will not be disclosed until the final autopsy report is released in about  a month.  </P> <P> That report will include toxicology findings that will show whether Scriven's  body contained any drugs.  </P></p>

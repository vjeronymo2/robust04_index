			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: Hard to pay - costly to borrow Sir, I wonder just how long banks will survive, but I am not an accountant. The present system seems quite mad. I saw my 'new' bank manager the other day, he's a delightful chap and shares my doubts] The very lowest interest rate they offer to private people nowadays is a rate of 1.2 per cent a month which works out at an APR of 15.39 per cent. Apparently you need to be a teenager to get this, as a mature student of the banking system I wouldn't qualify. Instead, the bank wants me to have its super dooper 'Classic Account' for which it charges Pounds 7 per month, pays me interest when in credit at an unpublicised rate which on enquiry turns out to be, I think, 2 per cent a year and charges interest on any overdraft at 1.9 per cent a month (an APR of 25.34 per cent, or 13.34 per cent over the current base rate). As an inducement I think it would give me a different plastic card with which to impress waiters. Ten years ago the same bank was perfectly happy, and presumably making a profit, to lend to me at 2 per cent over base on only a fraction of the collateral available now. Nowadays most of banks seem to make a loss. CJ Fell, Crown House, Newport, Essex</p>

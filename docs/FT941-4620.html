			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Jessups falls back in last four months Warnings of losses at Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, were borne out with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 599,000 on sales of Pounds 123m in the 16 months to December 31 1993. Problems experienced in the final four months of the period transformed the result. At the 12 months' stage, to August 31 1993, the group was showing a Pounds 707,000 profit on sales of Pounds 92m. In the 12 months to end-August 1992 Jessups made profits of Pounds 506,000 profit on sales of Pounds 76m. The motor dealership division suffered a Pounds 473,000 loss in the period under review. The company said that in certain new locations refurbishment and management integration had proved difficult and expensive to achieve. Interest charges rose to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 518,000) and losses per share emerged at 11.68p (earnings 105p). In view of the loss the final dividend is being omitted leaving shareholders with 3p for the 16 months - 4.5p was paid for the preceding 12 months.</p>

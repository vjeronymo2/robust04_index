			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (9): Pig war makes a point - Problems of the agricultural sector THE PORTUGUESE are not by nature a bellicose people, but there was no doubting the anger of local farmers earlier this autumn as they attacked Spanish trucks laden with pork from across the border. The attack followed the Portuguese government's ban on the import of all EC pork, in retaliation against the decision by the Commission's veterinary committee to temporarily block all exports of Portuguese pork on health grounds. Portugal's pig war proved nowhere as dramatic or violent as other sectorial wars within the Community, such as the clashes involving French farmers. Nonetheless, it did bring into sharp relief the wider tensions facing the Portuguese farming community as it is forced to knuckle down to the demands of EC membership. Traditionally protected from external competition, and operating in a small market, Portuguese agriculture is facing competition from its European partners at a time when it still has a long way to resolve its own deep structural problems. Portugal's agricultural minister, Arlindo Marques da Cunha, one of the youngest members of the cabinet, nonetheless looks and speaks like a man burdened by the demands of office. Portuguese agriculture represent 6 per cent of GDP and 12 per cent of employment, and yet yields per hectare are less than a third of the European average. Five years ago, Mr Marques da Cunha interrupted his doctoral thesis on the impact of the common agricultural policy (CAP) on Portugal at Reading University, in the UK, in order to take up his cabinet post. But there is clearly more work than a thesis still undone, as he is the first to admit. 'We are finding it very difficult to explain to our farmers that protectionism was never a solution, that it brought us nothing but backwardness. They don't want to hear it,' he says. In the transition period following Portuguese entry into the Community in 1986, EC aid has been used to improve irrigation and communications and to train some of the younger farmers in alternative production methods. From January 1, this year, a final transition period has been under way, which involves phased reductions in beef and cereal prices, together with cuts in subsidies and the dismantlement of import restrictions. Mr Marques da Cunha believes the two-stage transition period had made things worse rather than better. 'In the first period, the idea was created in the minds of our farmers that the EC was good just for funds. They were less aware of the need to become competitive,' he says. Over at the the Portuguese Farmers Confederation, the president, Mr Raul Rosado Fernandes, a classics professor by profession but a landowner by inheritance, does not strike one as a man in a hurry. 'The average age of farmers is over 50. It's going to be very difficult to change their habits and their education. An economist told me you need to get rid of thousands of farmers. I asked him: what do you do with the corpses?' The minister Mr Marques da Cunha, is, however, aiming to bring about a gradual phased reduction in employment in his sector - to 7 per cent of the population within the next 10 years, hoping that the farms that remain will be larger and more efficiently run. As for the CAP, he takes comfort in the fact that its reform 'is not yet ended'. 'We need to bring more help to farmers in remoter areas. We need to strengthen the regional dimension of CAP,' he says. Portugal clearly still has some fighting to do.</p>

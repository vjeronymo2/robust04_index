			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Israel lifts prime rate half a point Israel raised its prime interest rate 0.5 percentage points yesterday as the central bank continued to try to damp prices to meet this year's 8 per cent annual inflation target. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, sought to allay fears among Israeli manufacturers and Finance Ministry officials worried about the impact on sales and economic growth from interest rate rises. 'This is a moderate change,' Mr Frenkel said. Yesterday's increase, the second this year, raises the Bank of Israel lending rate to commercial banks from 10.5 to 11 per cent. Mr Frenkel said the adjustment was necessary to tighten monetary policy after the bank assessed that inflation was 10 per cent on an annualised basis Mr Frenkel blamed housing prices, increasing at 20 per cent a year, for the government's problems with inflation. 'Privatisation of government land and changing the designation of land to allow more residential building will help. But the policy is not yet fully implemented and the fight against inflation cannot wait.' He would 'not hesitate' to increase interest rates further if necessary, despite opposition from the Manufacturers' Association and Finance Ministry.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'I LOVE LUCY' PILOT TO SEE LIGHT  </P> <P> CBS has announced that a previously unseen, 40-year-old, 34-minute pilot for  the "I Love Lucy" series will air Monday, April 30.  </P> <P> The one-hour special, hosted by Lucie Arnaz, daughter of the late comedian and  her late husband, Desi Arnaz, will also include interviews and clips from some  of the most popular shows in the all-time favorite series.  </P> <P> A copy of the pilot was recently discovered under the bed of Joanne Perez,  where it had been stored for the past 39 years -- a forgotten gift from Lucy  and Desi to Perez's husband, the famous vaudeville performer Pepito the Spanish  Clown. Pepito, who was a guest star in the pilot, helped Lucy with her cello  act and her "seal" act in vaudeville days.  </P> <P> The pilot, written by "I Love Lucy" creators Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh  Davis and Bob Carroll Jr., includes a small portion of the Lucy-Desi nightclub  act, which the special producers, Grant-Tribune Productions, call "an unusual  blend of situation comedy and classic vaudeville."  </P> <P> Davis and Carroll will both appear on the special.  </P></p>

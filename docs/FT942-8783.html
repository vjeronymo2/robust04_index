			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: JAL, Air France in accord Japan Airlines and Air France have agreed to share each other's aircraft and staff in flights between Paris and Osaka, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. The agreement between two large international carriers highlights pressures in the industry to reduce costs. JAL said joint flights with Air France would allow it to save on costs and it was considering similar arrangements with other airlines. In particular, flying into Kansai International Airport, which will have the world's most expensive landing fees when it opens this autumn, will be extremely costly. And given the level of demand expected on the Paris-Osaka route, joint flights with Air France were better suited to the needs of both airlines. The deal allows both JAL and Air France to offer flights between Paris and Osaka seven days a week. They also plan to co-operate on code-sharing arrangements for flights beyond Paris and Osaka.</p>

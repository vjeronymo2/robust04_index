			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (14): Legacy of Minamata - Responsible care in Japan WHEN THE engagement of the Crown Prince to Ms Masako Owada was announced earlier this year, most Japanese media coverage did not fail to mention Ms Owada's family links to a historic pollution disaster in Japan. Ms Owada's grandfather was once chairman of Chisso, a company which was responsible for the death and physical disability of thousands of victims of mercury poisoning in the late 1950s. The references to Chisso are a reminder of the powerful impact that the mercury poisoning disaster continues to have on the Japanese public consciousness. The mercury poisoning first surfaced in Minamata, a fishing village in southern Japan. That and other serious pollution problems traced to chemicals manufacturers in the ensuing years have left a deep-rooted suspicion of the chemicals industry among the Japanese public. But it has also meant that Japan's chemicals industry is obliged to comply with stringent environmental regulations. 'In terms of dealing with pollution, Japan is a developed nation,' asserts Mr Koichi Nishikawa, managing director of technical matters at the Japan Chemical Industry Association. 'We have the strictest regulations in the world on pollution and very strict social monitoring.' This confidence in the industry's handling of environmental issues, under the guidance of government regulation, led Japan initially to question the necessity of introducing Responsible Care. At Japanese chemical factories, checks on safety measures are made by regional authorities even in the middle of the night. Japan has also developed some of the most sophisticated environment protection equipment for desulphurisation and water purification. The chemical industry has been educating its workers on environmental protection for over 20 years, ever since the severe pollution problems of the 1970s caused a public outcry and severely damaged the industry's image. As a result of these measures, there are very few chemical accidents or labour injuries among Japanese companies, Mr Nishikawa claims. The frequency rate last year of lay-off injuries for over one year was on average 0.5 per million working hours. 'This is a superb performance and indicates the high level of training among Japanese plant managers,' Mr Nishikawa says. The point is echoed by Mr Yoshita Sakami, general manager of the environment and safety department at Sumitomo Chemical who says that 'Sumitomo has emphasised co-existence and co-prosperity with society from the time of our establishment so the concept of responsible care is nothing new to us.' Nevertheless, the Responsible Care programme was launched by the association with the participation of 168 companies and 49 industry associations. The association felt that 'there was a need for continuous reform, for example, where there are no government reforms yet,' Mr Nishikawa says. The Responsible Care programme concentrates on areas where there are no regulations, such as on making effective use of waste and waste minimisation. Another feature of Japan's programme is that it includes energy, which is not included in the US or EC guidelines, Mr Nishikawa points out. 'In Japan, energy is also an environmental issue.' In addition to protecting the environment from chemical wastes and ensuring safety measures are in place, 'we also have a responsibility to supply products that take into consideration the environment, such as those that can be recycled,' says Mr Sakami at Sumitomo Chemical. The efforts that the industry has put into dealing with environmental issues have helped to improve its image in recent years. The industry has suffered from an image problem which began with the pollution of the 1960s and 1970s and continued through the two oil shocks when the Japanese chemical industry entered a structural recession. There is some evidence that that image has changed for the better. A recent survey for the JCIA found that respondents felt that of all the industries listed the chemicals industry had made the most efforts to deal with pollution. That compares with a survey in 1978 when 66 per cent of respondents felt that the chemicals industry was the biggest producer of pollution. The industry has also launched a campaign to further public understanding of the industry and its important role in society. It uses the catchphrase: 'Chemistry makes our dreams come true,' and is backed by the ministries of education and of international trade and industry. But the chemicals industry still has a long way to go to counter the public's lingering suspicion of its commitment to environmental protection. 'There are many incidents that show chemicals companies are still breaking the rules on pollution,' says the Consumers' Union of Japan. It points to reports of dead fish surfacing in rivers and of pollution, for which a chemicals company is usually found to be responsible. Japanese chemical companies are widely suspected of polluting in countries where environmental regulations are not as strict as in Japan, indicating that the public still distrusts the chemicals companies' intentions. Even Mr Nishikawa at the industry association admits that 'since Japan is a country traditionally ruled by government regulation, there is a feeling that what is not a regulation is not necessary.' Japan's chemical industry still has a long way to go to overcome the legacy of Minamata.</p>

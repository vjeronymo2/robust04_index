			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Banks recover on intraday rises in Dollars and bonds The absence of action on the interest rate front, with the Bundesbank and the Bank of France leaving key interest rates unchanged and no decision yet in the US, was accompanied by an intraday recovery in the dollar and in bond markets, writes Our Markets Staff. However, neither recovery was sustained in the late afternoon and accompanying equity gains, particularly in German and French banking stocks, remain to be tested today. FRANKFURT saw a rise of 25 basis points in mid-afternoon in the September bund future and the Dax index, up 8.15 to 2,043.85 on the session, increased to an Ibis-indicated 2,049.10 at the end of the day. In banks, Deutsche rose DM8 to DM708 and Dresdner by DM5.50 to DM378. Dealers said that the sector had looked very oversold by the end of June and that Deutsche, in particular, seemed finally to have dealt with the repercussions of the Schneider property affair. Turnover stayed thin, unchanged at DM4.6bn. On that basis, dealers were inclined to question a couple of gains in the engineering and metals sector, where Klockner-Werke advanced DM8.80, or 6.1 per cent, to DM153.90 and Metallgesellschaft put on DM5.70 at DM203.50. K-W, upgraded in the spring by Flemings and Bank Julius Bar on its move from steel into the engineering sector, was apparently the subject of a skirmish between an obstinate seller, and a buyer who wanted to test the market. Metallgesellschaft, said the dealers, was moving slowly compared with the acceleration which took it, temporarily, to a year's high of DM286 in May. PARIS saw a strong banking performance, particularly from Credit Local, up FFr24, or 6.6 per cent, to FFr387, and Credit Lyonnais, FFr31, or 6.8 per cent, better at FFr489, as the CAC-40 index rose 31.76, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,920.75. BNP, CCF and Paribas were all around 2 per cent better. Mr Keith Baird of Kleinwort Benson looked for a recovery in the sector at the beginning of this month, saying that French banks are heavily geared to falling bad debts as the economy begins to grow again, while efficiency is improving. Credit Local, he said, was regarded as a low risk business as a municipal lending agency, and in that context the 22 per cent rise in lending reported for the first half of the current year looked 'quite impressive'. Credit Lyonnais, he added, said on Wednesday that it would cut 10 per cent from its domestic staff numbers over the next three years. Turnover stayed low at FFr2.8bn. Valeo lifted the automotive components sector with a 9.4 per cent rise in first-half sales, and its own shares by FFr10, or 3.9 per cent, to FFr270. Michelin tagged along, up FFr9.20, or 4.1 per cent, at FFr235.20. ZURICH was edgy after James Capel in London downgraded Roche to a hold, taking it off the buy list for the first time in five years. The SMI index dipped 8.4 to 2,590.5. Roche certificates fell SFr200, or 3.2 per cent, to SFr6,080 after Mr Andrew Tivenan at Capel said the downgrade was the result of the company's valuation relative to the Swiss market and other pharmaceuticals worldwide, its exposure to the weak dollar and an expected decline in financial earnings due to weak markets. Banks and insurers edged higher on the view that they would be less affected than industrials in the short term by a weak dollar. UBS and SBC each rose SFr4 to SFr1,175 and SFr401 respectively. Nestle dipped SFr2 to SFr1,111. In his latest monthly review, Mr Simon Marshall-Lockyer at Kleinwort Benson commented that the out-of-favour financials and Nestle seemed to have reached a valuation floor following massive underperformance in recent months. He expected the stocks to outperform short term and recommended buying Nestle and SBC, both of which were at the bottom of their trading and valuation ranges. MILAN was disappointed by the lack of further details on budget proposals and the Comit index slipped 4.27 to 691.32 in thin trade. Plans for preliminary details of the budget to be announced after a cabinet meeting were scrapped when Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was absent as he prepared for the G7 summit in Naples. Telecoms provided a bright spot after reports that the cellular business of Sip, the national telephone operator, could be split off and receive financial autonomy. Sip ended L105 higher at L4,150, while Stet, the holding company, added L85 at L5,105. Ina, the newly privatised insurer, gave up L30 on its second day of trading to return to the placing price of L2,400. Volume fell sharply from 37.4m to 10.7m shares. MADRID tried to stage a technical rally, lifted by the initial recovery in global bond markets, but it proved more sensitive than most to their subsequent decline and the uneven opening of equities on Wall Street. Turnover stayed low at Pta26.7bn as the general index closed only 0.22 higher on the day at 291.65. In utilities, the downgrading of Endesa continued, with the shares losing Pta110, or 2 per cent, at Pta5,390; however, this was balanced by a gain of Pta100, or 2.7 per cent, in the oil company Repsol to Pta3,755. AMSTERDAM edged higher in thin trade ahead of the G7 meeting, and the AEX index rose 0.86 to 386.22. KLM gave back some of its recent gains, losing 70 cents to Fl 52.10 after its June traffic figures failed to match some expectations. Pakhoed rebounded after recent weakness, picking up Fl 1.10 to Fl 47.90. STOCKHOLM saw rebounds in the debt market and in the Swedish crown, and the Affarsvarlden General index rose 15.0 to 1,349.70, with banks and insurance stocks up some 3.5 per cent, and construction and real estate shares almost 2.5 per cent better. HELSINKI, an early closing market, reflected the better part of the day's sentiment in bonds, and the Hex index rose 37.8, or 2.2 per cent, to 1,743.3 with banks up 2.4 per cent and Nokia FM14 better at FM468.

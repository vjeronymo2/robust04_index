			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cuba was elected today to chair the Outer Space  Committee [Comite del Espacio Ultraterrestre], one of the  organizations sponsoring the UN Disarmament Conference, and  representing the so-called Group of 21 neutral and nonaligned  countries.    The decision was made in Geneva during a plenary session  when  the Group of 21 submitted Cuba's candidacy, which was approved  by all members of the conference. Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez  Novoa will head the committee which last year was chaired by the  German representative to the Disarmament Conference.    The developing nations have traditionally paid special  attention to this organization, which will now be chaired by our  country, taking into consideration the impact the prevention of  the arms race and the outer space program will have on the Third  World.</p>

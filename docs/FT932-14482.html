			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Union leader says end of recession is near THE president of Britain's largest manufacturing union said yesterday that the country is at last emerging from recession. 'The green shoots have arrived,' said Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU engineering union. 'The worst is over. We are approaching the end of the recession as the heartland of Europe goes into one.' Mr Jordan, speaking on the eve of the union's national committee conference in Llandudno, was responding to the union's first quarterly report on employment trends in manufacturing, published today. His comments are the first acknowledgment from a senior union leader that the economy is improving. Mr Jordan said: 'The corner has been turned against a bleak background of massive cuts in jobs and production capacity.' He pointed out that British manufacturing industry was starting to benefit from the 'hefty devaluation' of the pound last autumn and the restructuring of many companies. The AEEU president also suggested there were signs of a revival in industrial investment. The union's survey - compiled from area reports filed by local AEEU offices  -found that only 17.5 per cent of companies in the report had 'poor' order books for the first three months of the year compared with 30 per cent which described their order books as 'good' and a further 52.5 per cent which described their order books as 'average'. It also reports that 17.5 per cent of companies surveyed had negotiated multi-skilling and flexibility agreements in the first quarter of this year, a further sign of recovery. Job prospects do not look so healthy, however. Only 5 per cent of companies reported any vacancies while 20 per cent had made redundancies in the first quarter. Union leaders acknowledged yesterday that the survey, the first of its kind, was by no means a perfect barometer of industrial performance. Only 40 companies were included in the first sample and none from Scotland and the London area, while 11 of the sample were from Tyneside. Mr Jordan said the union hoped to improve the quality of the survey in as it would become a regular source of information on manufacturing employment trends. Mr Jordan warned that the improvement 'had not yet been translated into the creation of additional jobs'. Unless the right measures were taken - including greater priority for training - 'the green shoots are in danger of withering away'. He added: 'Within the next six months we could see serious skill shortages in manufacturing.'</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UN attacks 'terror' in Cambodia MR YASUSHI Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), yesterday accused Khmer Rouge guerrillas of terrorising Cambodians and roundly condemned it for flouting a UN peace plan. His public criticism of the Khmer Rouge, one of four Cambodian factions which signed a peace accord in Paris last October, came two days after the UN Security Council demanded Khmer Rouge compliance and decided to allow foreign aid to go only to factions co-operating with Untac. Speaking at a meeting of the Supreme National Council in Phnom Penh, Mr Akashi said ceasefire violations had increased, especially in Khmer Rouge controlled areas in northern Cambodia. In the strongest language used by the UN so far, he accused the guerrillas of laying new land mines and launching artillery bombardments. 'The nature of these activities points to a deliberate policy of terror against ordinary Cambodians,' he told the SNC, which includes the four factions and is supposed to run the country together with the UN until elections next year.</p>

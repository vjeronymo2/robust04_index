			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Cairo buildings collapse into street TWO four-storey buildings collapsed into the streets of central Cairo yesterday, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Cairo. It was not immediately clear how many people were hurt. Scores of young men struggled to move the rubble with their hands, the witnesses added. Women wailed and screamed at the site as ambulances and rescue teams fought their way through heaps of rubble and choking dust to evacuate casualties. Witnesses said an old building had collapsed into a new one and they both fell onto the streets. 'At least one badly injured person was taken away on a stretcher,' a Reuter reporter said from the scene. It was impossible to determine whether the buildings collapsed because of the earthquake which hit Egypt on October 12, killing 552 people and injuring some 10,000.</p>

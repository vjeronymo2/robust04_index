Chairman of the VKE, Dr. Albrecht Eckell, says, "By  1998, capacities of 700,000 metric tons per annum and more will  be ready."    In the case of returnable packages, plastics are already on  the offensive in the Federal German packaging market, according  to Dr. Bernd Hallier. He is the director of the  Euro-Handelsinstitut in Cologne. In the case of non-returnable  packages on the other hand, he says that plastics are still on  the defensive. The reason for this is the recycling crisis into  which the plastic branch has slid since the Packaging Ordinance  became law. This is because the increase in capacity for  material utilization of plastics has not yet been able to keep  up with the rapidly growing amounts collected by the Dual System  Deutschland (DSD) in Bonn. However, this situation will change  soon. Dr. Albrecht Eckell predicted on 30 November at the  "Plastics + Environment" symposium in Cologne that, "Just using  raw-material recycling, the plastic utilization problem will be  solved by 1998." He is the chairman of the Association of  Plastics Producing Industries (VKE) in Frankfurt. Starting by  the end of 1997, he claims that in Germany, recycling capacities  on the order of magnitude of 700,000 metric tons per year and  more will be available.    In spite of this, Dr. Albrecht Eckell welcomes the current  political consideration being given to the Packaging Ordinance  and the acceptance of raw-material recycling (in the form of  chemical preparation methods) as material reuse provided in the  draft amendment. This is because a fifty-fifty division of the  discussed new utilization quota (60% instead of the  previous  64%) between processed-material recycling (plastic remains  plastic) and raw-material recycling (plastic becomes  petrochemical raw material) is still not sufficient in the  opinion of Dr. Johannes Brandrup, the director responsible in  his association for environmental interests. For reasons of  quality, only 10% to 20% of the recycled processed  material  may be accessible over the long term. Reutilization on a large  scale, on the other hand, is provided by the raw material method.    Prof. Dr. Klaus Topfer is the Federal Minister for the  Environment. In an amendment to the Packaging Ordinance, he  wants to see the pressure maintained on the industry by means of  a specific quota for processed-material recycling. Corresponding  technologies that are just starting in the small-business arena  should not be allowed to wither because of a lack of critical  mass. "Where we set bottlenecks in a market economy, the  reaction is not resignation but rather technical progress."  Virtually no packaging has remained unchanged for example as a  result of the Ordinance -- with a corresponding reduction in the  packaging volume. Even the DSD has struck a resounding chord  with the people. The bottleneck in utilizing sales packages is  not demonstrated in collecting nor in sorting but in material  utilization. However, it could scarcely be expected that  appropriate capacities for reutilization would be built before  the corresponding quantities of material were available.    According to Topfer, "For me, the question in amending the  Packaging Ordinance is, what is utilization? For this reason, in  the future, we will not only observe and make possible  processed-material recycling but also raw-material recycling in  all possible facets. We are assuming that both sub-areas will  achieve a recycling quota of 60% by 1998 and want to  specify  this quota in the amended Ordinance."    In the words of the Federal Minister for the Environment,  everything exceeding these figures not only can be sent to a  thermal utilization process but must be sent there. Says Topfer,  "No one can explain to me why it is that we mine brown coal from  the earth using open-pit mining, burn this coal for power and  heat and then fill the holes we have made by mining with  domestic trash when the domestic trash has a higher heating  value than the brown coal."</p>

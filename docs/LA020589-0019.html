			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIORS: GRAND ILLUSIONS;  </P> <P> ROSE TARLOW REWRITES THE HISTORY OF FURNITURE DESIGN FOR HER ADAPTED 'ANTIQUES'  </P> <P> THERE'S NOTHING AUTHENTIC about Rose Tarlow's furniture designs, and she's  proud of that. What began five years ago as an experiment in producing  reproduction-cum-adaptation fur nishings has developed into a successful  business. "I don't reproduce furniture," says Tarlow, who once paled at the  thought that she might become known for furniture reproductions. "I simply  adapt designs until I find them pleasing."  </P> <P> A Los Angeles antique dealer since 1975, Tarlow frequented European antique  auctions each year to buy furniture for her store. By the early '80s, she  discovered that the most appealing pieces at these auctions were no longer  authentic period works, but what she terms "decorative" pieces. At about the  same time, the Los Angeles market for truly costly antiques hit bottom. Few  collectors were willing to pay $50,000 to $100,000 for a piece of furniture  that in the mid-1970s would have sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Tarlow recognized  that fine antiques had become far too expensive and that decorative pieces,  while having less intrinsic value, possessed visual appeal. She then began to  capitalize on her insight, producing "new" decorative traditional furniture in  custom sizes, styles, finishes, fabrics -- providing interior designers with  high quality at lower prices (from about $1,000 to $15,000) than those  commanded by true decorative antiques.  </P> <P> Interior designer Jarret Hedborg, who recently decorated the home of Bette  Midler, describes Tarlow's furniture as being "in the best tradition of the  English eccentric. It's personal, stylish, often whimsical, and, unlike the  competition, her chairs are comfortable. Although it's very high style  furniture, I usually downplay it and use it in a country home sort of way."  </P> <P> One of Tarlow's trade secrets is that she can take any piece of her furniture  and change its appearance simply by using a different base, arm or leg, then  give it additional individuality by varying the finish -- wood, gold or silver  leaf, paint or veneer. It isn't unusual to find a Tarlow piece that contains a  blend of traditional elements -- Chippendale styling, neoclassical motifs,  maybe some rococo influences, and a finish of an unexpected patina. "I take  bits and pieces from basic period designs -- an arm, a leg, a decorative motif,  a certain type of hardware -- and mix the components," Tarlow says. "These  designs are my own fantasies of what antique furniture should have looked like  when first made."  </P> <P> Take, for instance, a dark-finished game table with distinct flavors of  18th-Century French designs, Oriental overtones and graceful cabriole-style  legs with wide knees that taper gradually to a claw foot. "This table looks  old, but it isn't," she says. "What makes this one nice is that if you were  looking for an antique, you could never find a game table as large as this one  or in such good shape."  </P> <P> Indeed, many of the designs seem grand in scale compared to their antique  predecessors. "California and Texas designers like to use furnishings with  larger proportions. They often make design statements with size," Tarlow  explains. "For the most part, I scale things differently for various parts of  the country. Take New York, for example. It's just not practical to try to fit  overscaled everything into a classic New York brownstone or other tight  apartment-sized space."  </P> <P> The Rose Tarlow-Melrose House line is now sold in showrooms in 12 metropolitan  areas, including Randolph &amp; Hein at the Pacific Design Center in Los  Angeles and Tarlow's Melrose Place showroom, Melrose House. Tarlow runs Melrose  House much like a private boutique ("an atelier," she calls it). Here, she  controls the exclusivity of the furniture and can sell only a limited number of  a particular piece if she feels so inclined.  </P> <P> Next, Tarlow has decided to try her hand at designing contemporary furniture.  "I've got some prototypes in the works," she says, "but nothing is completed  yet. But soon."  </P> <P> It's unusual that such an inveterate classicist would be interested in  contemporary furniture. Today's ubiquitous concrete, Formica and chrome aren't  part of her new, modernist vernacular; her basic media will be stone, steel and  wood. Will she rely on her background in classic design to produce her new  pieces? "No," Tarlow insists. "My contemporary work will have no resemblance to  anything living or dead."  </P></p>

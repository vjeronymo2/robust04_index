			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH PAYS TRIBUTE TO COL. HIGGINS;  </P> <P> TELLS WAR DEPT. SALUTE HE WAS 'A SYMBOL OF COURAGE'  </P> <P> President Bush, his voice choked by emotion, paid tribute today to Marine Lt.  Col. William R. Higgins, slain by his Lebanese captors, as "the symbol of the  courage" of American servicemen.  </P> <P> Bush coupled his praise for Higgins and for others in uniform with an appeal  for Congress to restore cuts it made in nuclear weapons programs.  </P> <P> "Today, it is not a shortage of rifles that threatens to undermine America's  ability to keep the peace," Bush said. "To preserve the peace today we must be  strong in other ways. This means that we must rely on advanced technology, not  the strategic equivalent of the horse cavalry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> War Department Anniversary  </P> <P> Bush spoke at a ceremony at Ft. Myer marking the 200th anniversary of the  founding of the War Department, the forerunner of the Department of Defense.  </P> <P> Later, Bush flew to Fort A. P. Hill in Bowling Green, Va., where he urged about  30,000 youths at the 12th National Boy Scout Jamboree to steer their friends  away from crack cocaine and other drugs.  </P> <P> He took with him three members of his Administration who were Eagle Scouts:  Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner; Andrew Card, the deputy to Chief of  Staff John H. Sununu, and Robert M. Gates, deputy national security adviser.  </P> <P> At Ft. Myer, just across the Potomac River from Washington, Bush said in a  halting voice:  </P> <P> "We cannot leave here today without pausing to salute one who stands as the  symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of every American in uniform,  one Marine who has been very much in our thoughts, Lt. Col. Higgins, William  Richard Higgins."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retaliatory Hanging  </P> <P> Higgins, head of a 75-member U.N. peacekeeping team, was kidnaped in south  Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1987. His captors said last Monday that he had been hanged  in retaliation for the Israeli kidnaping of a Muslim cleric.  </P> <P> Putting in a plug for nuclear modernization, Bush said, "The United States  today requires a closely integrated strategic program designed to enhance our  strength, bolster deterrence and facilitate arms control."  </P> <P> He said the United States must redeploy the 10-warhead MX missile from fixed  silos and put them onto rail cars, and at the same time develop and deploy a  smaller, single-warhead Midgetman missiles.  </P> <P> He also pushed for more money for the radar-evading B-2 Stealth bomber and the  Star Wars missile-defense system.  </P></p>

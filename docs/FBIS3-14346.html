			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Lamis K. Andoni] </F>   [Text] Israel has agreed to the deployment of a lightly  armed 50-man Norwegian observer unit and an equal number of a  Palestinian police force in the city of Hebron but the Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) is seeking to expand the unit to  two multi-national battalions including senior Egyptian officers.    Israel will respond to the Palestinian proposals when the  talks, which were adjourned in Cairo yesterday, resume after the  two delegations deliberate with their two respective leaderships.    The PLO is also awaiting a response to the deployment of a  8,000-9,000 Palestinian police force in Jericho and the Gaza  Strip.    PLO officials in Tunis expected the Palestinian force to  cross from Jordan and Egypt by April 13, the agreed upon date  for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    Israel has suggested speeding up the withdrawal in return  for  resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, but the PLO  wanted to get security guarantees that will end the curfew in  Hebron before going back to the negotiating table.    "The way things are moving the actual beginning of the  implementation will be delayed for two or three weeks, but we  cannot resume negotiations without seeing real change in the  situation on the ground especially in Hebron," a PLO official  said.    According to Tunis-based PLO officials, Israel has not  officially conceded to demands to evict 450 Israeli settlers  from the centre of Hebron.    "The Israelis could not give a word or any promises  regarding  the settlers," said one PLO official.    The Israelis have implied, however, that the government was  considering specific measures. PLO officials said that the  Israeli negotiators refused to elaborate.    Israel, the officials said, will be studying a suggestion,  initially put forward by Norway, that it take unilateral  measures without prior public announcements, but the PLO prefers  that a third party, most probably Norway, will act as a  guarantor to ensure follow-up of whatever process the Israeli  government decides to start regarding the settlers.    Meanwhile, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, who has personally  insisted on the participation of senior Egyptian officers in the  foreign observing force, is satisfied with Israel's acceptance  of the principle of foreign observers but he wanted to make sure  that it will be a prelude to international protection for  Palestinians across the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.    The officials said that Israel had stipulated that light  arms  will be confined to pistols only--something that seems to  satisfy the PLO leadership's demands at this point.    But what PLO leaders seem to fear the most is for Israel to  use the siege on Hebron as bargaining chip to pressure  Hebronites and the Palestinians to drop other demands concerning  the settlers and the settlements.    Critics of Mr. 'Arafat argue that he has not held out long  enough to make Israel budge, and that if he does not take a firm  stand, lifting the curfew on Hebron will be used by Israel to  extract Palestinian concessions.    Furthermore, the 20-hour siege of Hebron last week, when the  Israeli army blasted a hideout for Hamas members and destroyed  or damaged neighbouring houses in the process, has presented the  PLO with a challenge of how secure protection of Palestinians  against Israel army clampdowns.    A United Nations Security Council resolution passed two  weeks  ago, reaffirmed the applicability of the Forth Geneva  Convention, that practically bans an occupying power from  conducting such clampdowns on people under occupation, on the  West Bank and Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem.    It was unclear so far, based on contacts with PLO officials  in Tunis, whether that tentatively agreed upon deployment of  foreign observers will be authorised to prevent Israeli  violations of the Geneva convention.</p>

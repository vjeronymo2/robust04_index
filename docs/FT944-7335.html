			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Move on Scottish bank holidays Scottish banks are to bring their bank holidays into line with those of other UK banks from 1996. The move will end a discrepancy whereby on four days of the year Scottish banks have different holidays to English banks and to the rest of the Scottish financial community. The change was agreed by the Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks. Scottish cities will still have public holidays on different days from each other rather than on bank holidays.</p>

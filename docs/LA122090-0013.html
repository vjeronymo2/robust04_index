			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BATES' ABSENTEE BALLOT INQUIRY MAY BROADEN  </P> <P> Accusing San Diego election officials of "covering up" their inability to  properly verify absentee ballots, lawyer Mike Aguirre said Wednesday that he  might ask a congressional committee to challenge Republican Randall (Duke)  Cunningham's victory over Rep. Jim Bates.  </P> <P> In the latest twist in his long-shot legal battle to help Bates overturn his  narrow November loss to Cunningham, Aguirre, citing what he characterized as  "sloppy or non-existent checking" of absentee ballots, threatened for the first  time to carry his fight for the San Diego County Democrat beyond the courtroom  to the House Administration Committee.  </P> <P> "We're going to take every step possible to make sure there wasn't fraud in  this election," Aguirre said. Similarly, Bates said that asking the  congressional panel, which has jurisdiction over contested elections, to  investigate is "something we probably ought to do as a backstop" to a court  hearing on the matter scheduled for later this month.  </P> <P> Both Cunningham's attorney, Steve Kane, and San Diego Registrar of Voters Conny  McCormack, however, defended the handling of the absentee ballots as proper,  dismissing the accusations of improprieties as grandstanding and political sour  grapes.  </P> <P> "I don't really know what Mr. Aguirre is after other than getting his name in  the paper, and Mr. Bates won't accept that he lost," Kane said. "There was  nothing at all wrong with this election."  </P> <P> In his Superior Court lawsuit, Aguirre charges that the registrar's office  violated state law by failing to compare signatures on absentee ballot  applications with voters' original registration records. McCormack, however,  emphasizes that guidelines used by 37 California counties permit election  officials to verify only the signature on the absentee ballot itself, not on  the application.  </P> <P> Aguirre also has questioned the thoroughness of the signature verification on  the 188,000 absentee ballots cast countywide in last month's election.  Contending that most of those names received a "cursory at best" examination  from temporary workers, Aguirre has expressed doubt that many absentee ballots  were checked at all for their authenticity.  </P> <P> Hoping to bolster his case, Aguirre, using a handwriting expert equipped with a  stopwatch, conducted experiments at the registrar's office Wednesday that he  contends showed that the signatures could not be verified via computer nearly  as quickly as election officials previously claimed.  </P></p>

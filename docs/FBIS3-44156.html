			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Colette Braeckman: "Zaire: One Year of </F> Maneuvering for a Parliament"]    [Text] The new Zairian Parliament, known as the High  Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament, met in  Kinshasa. It was presided over by Monsignor Monsengwo,  president of the former High Council of the Republic [HCR], who  declared his pleasure at the "happy result" obtained by  negotiators. The agreements concluded between the presidential  sphere and the so-called "radical" opposition provide in  particular for the unification of the two legislative  assemblies, the adoption of a Single Act aimed at managing the  transition, and a schedule for the forthcoming elections. The  new Parliament will also have to appoint a prime minister.    The appearance of this elephantine structure (780 members)  in  reality represents the end of a year of subtle maneuvering,  intimidation, and obstructions aimed at dismantling what was  established by the Sovereign National Conference [CNS],  weakening the legitimacy of Tshisekedi and isolating him within  the opposition, and, eventually, restoring the authority of the  head of state. With the passing of time, the operation would  appear to have been organized with a master's touch: Initially,  Mr. Tshisekedi was prevented from governing and was then  dismissed after he tried to take control of the Bank of Zaire.  Later, exactly a year ago, pillaging devastated Kinshasa and  gave the authorities the opportunity to impose a merciless  regime of repression. A few weeks later, members of the HCR  were literally sequestered by the military.    It was then, against a background of mutiny, ethic  confrontation in the Shaba and Kivu regions, intimidation, and  misery that the political phase was activated: the "political  forces of the conclave," with the blessing of Monsignor  Monsengwo, formed a united front and issued counter-proposals to  the conclusions of the CNS. The doubling of the institutions  culminated with the appointment of another prime minister,  Faustin Birindua, who was installed by a veritable show of  strength, while Tshisekedi proved less than brilliant in his  maneuvering ability.    It thus became necessary to negotiate and harmonize the  declarations of both sides, as if the CNS, 30 percent of whose  members were supporters of President Mobutu, had only been a  partisan faction and not an assembly representing all sides.    The composition of the new Parliament affirmed this  watering-down of the CNS into a much larger group encompassing  the members of the former Parliament and the 160 negotiators who  accepted the agreements, marginalizing the hardliners of  Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS]  party.    This represents a fine victory for President Mobutu who had  always refused to get involved in CNS affairs. This time, with  a new majority in place, he will doubtless agree to recognize  the new Parliament: All the more easily since, unless there is  an upset, he has assured himself of its control.</p>

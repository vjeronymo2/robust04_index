			<p>BFN     [Text] The management and personnel of the Belarusian KGB  held a conference connected with the decision to alter the KGB's  structure and the size of its staff. As KGB Chairman Henadz  Lavitski pointed out in a speech, the goal of the reform is to  bring the KGB structure in line with the main purpose of the  special service and its current demands, as well as to avoid any  improper functions. The main trends of Belarusian KGB  activities will be conducting intelligence and  counterintelligence operations, as well as providing the  authorities with information necessary for adopting resolutions  at the state level. The KGB will also participate in  implementing a state program for combating crime, coordinating  its activities with other law enforcement bodies and strictly  adhering to its responsibilities and existing legislation.</p>

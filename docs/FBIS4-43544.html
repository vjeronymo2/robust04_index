			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["afk" report: "Laender Finance Ministers Determined To </F> Save Money"]    [Text] Dresden, 17 Jun -- At their annual conference in  Dresden on Friday [17 June] the finance ministers of the laender  stated that they are willing to save money. At the same time  they called on the Federal Government to stay "lastingly and  clearly" below the growth rate of 3 percent in the coming years,  which was recently recommended by the Financial Planning  Council. The laender are willing to stick to the limitation of  3 percent.    As Brandenburg Finance Minister Kuehbacher (Social  Democratic  Party of Germany) said, when new laws that are linked with  expenditures are adopted, the Federal Government must also  consider where the money needed can be saved. Kuehbacher cited  as an example the new insolvency law for the benefit of  consumers, which entails considerable costs for the judiciary.  The figure of 3 percent is also to be understood as a guideline  for the wage negotiations. Despite the will for saving, the  ministers estimate that the deficit of the old laender --  because of the new regulation for the redistribution of  financial means and the predicted losses in tax revenues -- will  amount to about 30 billion German marks [DM] in 1995, thus being  higher than ever. Next year almost one out of five marks from  tax revenues will be spent on paying interests. Therefore, it is  necessary to reduce the state's tasks, to reduce the number of  personnel, and to conclude wage contracts, which are oriented  toward the growth rates. The communities cannot expect any  further help or easing of their burdens. Because of the  recession, tax revenues will remain lower for years longer than  it was expected last year. Saxony's Finance Minister Milbradt  said that this and next year the losses in tax revenues will  amount to about DM10 billion. The ministers rejected a tax  increase beyond what has already been decided. A decision about  proposals for a profound tax reform in 1996 has been postponed  to November.    The ministers called on the Federal Government to make sure  in the European Union [EU] "that the German net contribution is  again reduced to a level appropriate in relationship with the  net contributions by the other member states." Doubling the  German net contribution between 1990 and 1992 to about DM22  billion is in gross contradiction to the reduced capacity of the  united Germany and poses an additional burden on the public  budgets. The Federal Government must urge strict budget  discipline in the EU, reject the desires for loans by the EU  Commission, which are aimed at "circumventing budget  discipline," and channel more structural subsidy funds to  Germany. The ministers advocated the view that a revision of  the EU's system of contributions, "including the question of  discounts on contributions," should be initiated "as soon as  possible," if these efforts do not bring about a sufficient  reduction of Germany's net contributions.</p>

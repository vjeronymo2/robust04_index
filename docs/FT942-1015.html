			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Peking to speed up HK port dealings China has told Britain that it will give urgent attention to proposals made at last week's Sino-British talks for a HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 857m) extension to Hong Kong's container port. The colony possesses one of the world's busiest container ports, but the construction of the ninth terminal (CT9) has been delayed because of the poor atmosphere surrounding Sino-British relations. The consortium building CT9 has also been engaged in negotiations with the Hong Kong government over the price and terms of land acquisition. The consortium, which includes the trading houses Jardine Matheson and Hutchison Whampoa, was locked in dispute with the government over who would be responsible for access roads and bridges to CT9. Both sides were trying to get the other to shoulder the cost. However, company executives said that signs of improvement in Sino-British ties, which have been evident since the spring, encouraged the consortium to reach agreement with the government so that an agreed position could be presented to China for approval. Details of this agreement are not available but one company executive said details of the land grant had 'substantially been agreed'. China's undertaking to deal expeditiously with CT9 might emerge as the only real progress made during the 29th meeting of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). Its meeting was dramatically suspended on Thursday until today to allow the two sides to reach an agreement on the transfer of military land. However, it is unclear whether a marathon session of talks at the weekend narrowed the differences between the two sufficiently. Officials said talks would continue this morning. A failure to agree will inevitably raise doubts about China's recent overture to Britain to improve relations. But whatever the result of the JLG talks there remains a general expectation that Sino-British ties will improve after the Legislative Council (LegCo) votes this Wednesday on Governor Chris Patten's democracy proposals for the conduct of the colony's 1995 elections. The vote by members of the 60-strong assembly is expected to be very close. Over the weekend an aide to Mr Patten said the government was certain of 26 votes and was confident of three or four others. But the governor is taking no chances. He has been actively lobbying LegCo members for support and will do so right up to the vote. Senior members of the Liberal party, a conservative group which wants to water down his proposals, have also been trying to win support. Mr Patten attacked the Liberals' proposed amendments, suggesting they would lead to elections which could be rigged. Anglo-Chinese pragmatism, Page 22</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "An Unregulated Market and Unregulated </F> in Kharkov: Ukraine's First Real-Estate Market Has Been Set Up  in Kharkov"]    [Text] To set up a real-estate market and put it into good  working order turned out to be not such an easy matter, even  though Ukraine's exchange structures worked on the plan of  "attack" for nearly three months. Born in travail like the very  noisy land auction, the market was attended by only a few  buyers, and this despite the fact that the commodity being  offered was fast-moving and even had pretensions to high  quality. If someone had the desire and--of course--the money, he  could buy a building here, or a dacha, apartment, or garage in  various parts of Ukraine and the near abroad. The organizers  exhibited for sale everything that they could, even their own  intellect and a material-technical center--offering various  consulting services, transportation, and electronic equipment. A  sense of orderliness and respectability, a minimum of risk and  burdensome paperwork--one could not say that this was a legally  unregulated market.    Nevertheless, it is the latter that potential buyers seem to  prefer. For a market that was well advertised, three lots  constitute just a drop in the ocean--not calculated to created  any changes in the weather. The reason is well known. For a long  time now well-to-do citizens have been buying up everything that  they need; they have gotten around the existing laws, and for  these covert trades they neither want nor need the help of any  "glittering" advertisement. For all other citizens--whether the  commodities in question are offered at a wide-open bazaar or a  civilized market--they are beyond their pocketbooks. The result  is lamentable. For the first time in half a century offerings  exceeded demand in the Kharkov real-estate market, and this  despite the fact that the housing problem remains one of the  most acute in this city.    But we have not yet become accustomed to the paradoxes  involved here. One of these is the position assumed by the  Kharkov Procurator's Office, which has continued to "bombard"  the local Executive Committee with paper-type protests. The  motif is impressive in its banality. Existing laws do not permit  land and real estate to be offered on a lease-type basis.  But--when all is said and done--such a practice is not  prohibited. This argument is persistently used to cover and  protect themselves by the local authorities, while proceeding to  prepare new trading places at the same time. Who will prevail?  This is not just a rhetorical question, inasmuch as the Kharkov  Commodity Exchange is not limited by prices, and sheds a glaring  light on the long-existing opposition between common sense and  narrowly bureaucratic interests. The old system has already  taken everything possible from life, but it continues to keep  the society in a state of deep unconsciousness. The real-estate  market--like the first land auction--has not lived up to its  promise of assistance; nevertheless, it has introduced a vital  stream of hope into a seemingly hopeless situation. From now on  trades on the KhTB [Kharkov Commodity Exchange] will be  conducted with at least something to trade.</p>

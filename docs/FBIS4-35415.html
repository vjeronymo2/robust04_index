			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received  at his office in the Prime Ministry today Lebanese Foreign  Minister Faris Buwayz, who is participating in the 17th session  of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA,  which is currently convening in Amman. The talks dealt with  ways to strengthen bilateral relations in all fields,  particularly in the economic, trade, and customs fields. They  also reviewed the latest developments in the peace process.    In a statement to PETRA after the meeting, Buwayz said he  felt full readiness on the part of the prime minister to reach a  new concept for Jordanian-Lebanese relations with the aim of  developing cooperation and coordination between the two sisterly  countries. He said: We, in Lebanon, greatly appreciate the  fraternal Jordanian people. We have great interests with Jordan  that need to be organized for the benefit of both countries and  people. He stressed that the coming stage requires further  coordination and cohesion toward the various issues.    Regarding the current Lebanese stand vis-a-vis the peace  process, Buwayz said: Now that approximately three and a half  years have passed since the Madrid conference, we cannot say  that these talks have reached the sought level or achieved the  sought results. We cannot also say that the Israeli side deals  with these talks in the required way. New problems and  challenges surfaced during this period.    Buwayz said: Despite all circumstances, we believe that this  peace should be given a chance. We also believe that the  Israeli side should prove it is still committed to the  principles of peace in terms of its fairness and the  implementation of the international resolutions and the  principle of land for peace.    Regarding the most prominent developments in the trial of  those accused of involvement in the assassination of Jordanian  diplomat, martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, which began recently, the  Lebanese foreign minister said: It is known that the competent  Lebanese departments arrested the suspects moments after the  crime was committed. We can say that Lebanese judiciary, which  is known for its fairness and independence, will deal with this  subject with all seriousness and it has issued the indictment.  We have no doubt that the court will issue a fair decision.    The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam,  minister of state and acting minister of state for foreign  affairs, and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman.</p>

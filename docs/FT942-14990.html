			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Who wants another channel? Sir, I have read with interest the recent letters concerning Channel 5 (April 13 and 14). Each of the writers has laudably stated their vested interest and then proceeded to defend their position. It has been stated that viewers will not wish to buy a new TV set to gain a new channel (or channels). This is quite true in many cases, but it seems to be overlooking the fundamental attitudes and requirements of the viewers - do we actually want another channel? Production standards in television seem to be lagging behind viewers' expanding requirements; we now have Eastenders and Coronation Street three times a week but that is 'safe' television and is hardly intellectually stimulating. Even the so-called 'hard-hitting' documentaries have resorted to sensationalism and mediocrity. If Channel 5 is going to provide more of the same, irrespective of whether it is digital or analogue, is it worth having? Mr Miles (April 14) argues that advertisers need another channel; but do we the consumers need one? Geoff Westcott, Ruxilo, Main Road, Yapton, Arundel, W Sussex BN18 0FT</p>

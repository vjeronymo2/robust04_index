			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Scalfaro Urges eAnti-Fascist Values </F> in Florence Visit"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Florence, April 17 -- Italian President  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro urged Italians to remember the values  expressed in the War of Liberation to free the country of Nazism  and Fascism, when he visited this Tuscan capital today to open  celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of victory against the  Fascist regime.    After visiting the buildings gutted by a bomb on May 27 last  year with the death of five, Scalfaro attended a rally this  afternoon in Piazza della Signoria, the city's main square since  its birth and rise to celebrity as the capital of the  Renaissance, telling a crowd of thousands that historical truth  must not be tampered with. "In this case, the truth is history,  and we can't make history as we would have liked it to be," he  said. "We must learn our lesson from history, which cannot be  changed, from sacrifice for the Liberation...."    His remarks fell at a time of great debate about the  continued significance of the struggle against the Fascist  regime as the source of the values on which the Italian republic  is founded and proposals from the new conservative majority in  parliament for reforming the republic's foundations.    "We therefore appeal to history and our memories in order  not  to forget since the testimony of those who died for liberty must  also be the commitment of each of us," Scalfaro added.    According to some analysts, foremost in his mind may have  been on the documentary footage of Italy's Liberation during  World War II shown recently on RAI's [Italian State-Owned  Broadcasting Company] flagship First Channel.    The screenings of mostly new material shot by U.S. film  crews  was accompanied by a commentary and debate in the studio in  which many people saw a neofascist spokesman as being allowed to  whitewash the historical truth of dictator Benito Mussolini's  regime. The footage was aired just as the conservative  coalition of the federalist Northern League and Silvio  Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia with the neofascist  National Alliance took a parliamentary majority in the March  27-28 election. At the same time, National Alliance leader  Gianfranco Fini claimed in an interview that Mussolini was the  "greatest statesman of the century."    According to some analysts, Scalfaro may decide to delay  naming a premier-designate, presumably Berlusconi, until after  the annual celebrations for the Liberation on April 25, to avoid  what promises, this year, to be a massive and highly committed  turnout becoming a demonstration against the media  mogul-turned-politician's nomination to lead the new government.    "Unity, harmony, and concord must be achieved," urged  Scalfaro, "because a people can only move if it is capable of  drawing from history lessons of peace and justice, not lessons  of hate and revenge."    Opening his speech, Scalfaro also said he had nothing to add  to what had already been said by Florence Mayor Giorgio Morales,  who asserted that no question-marks could be raised over values  such as "Italian unity, liberty, and democracy, asserted by the  struggle for Liberation from Nazi-Fascism."

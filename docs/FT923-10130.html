			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Improvement at Noranda THE recent drop in the Canadian dollar and improved commodity prices helped Noranda, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, almost to double second-quarter earnings, writes Bernard Simon. Net income rose to CDollars 32m (USDollars 27.1m), or nine cents a share, from CDollars 18m, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dipped slightly to CDollars 2.21bn from CDollars 2.28bn. Metals and minerals advanced to CDollars 55m from CDollars 16m.</p>

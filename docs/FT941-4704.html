			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Open minister suffers brush with the truth: A look at the aftermath of a verbal slip-up In Mr William Waldegrave's judgment the turning point came early yesterday morning. Emerging, still blinking with sleep, from the front door of his London home he was met by a barrage of questions from waiting journalists. 'Are you going to resign, Mr Waldegrave?' shouted one. 'Why?' responded the minister for public services and science. 'For telling the truth,' the journalist yelled back. Mr Waldegrave decided he could relax. The row about his public comments on when governments might or might not consciously mislead parliament was revealing itself as a media storm in a Westminster teacup. Speaking a few hours later to the Social Market Foundation Mr Waldegrave was careful not to blame the media. Instead he quoted Enoch Powell's dictum that a politician who complains about the media is like a sailor who complains about the sea: 'We amateur sailors often complain about the sea, but it does us little good.' An honest politician in a government which has not won many prizes for giving straight answers, Mr Waldegrave spent the rest of the day in television and radio studios explaining what he had originally said to a Commons committee. No, he had not suggested that it was proper for ministers to mislead parliament. Instead, he had pointed to two occasions in the distant past on which ministers had been economical with the truth about impending devaluations of the pound. The row rumbled on. Lord Callaghan protested that he had evaded parliamentary questions but had never told a lie. Opposition politicians saw another opportunity to pin the 'sleaze' label on an ever-embattled government. Mr Waldegrave's enemies on the right wing of the Tory party saw another opportunity to cast him as an inevitable victim of the next cabinet reshuffle. After all, he might well face considerable criticism in the report of the Scott inquiry into arms-related exports to Iraq. Mr Major could offer him as a convenient scapegoat. But thoughtful colleagues believe sacking Mr Waldegrave in the summer would be a mistake. He may not be the most guileful of politicians but he is an intelligent one. His donnish approach to politics is in refreshing contrast to the instinctively combative approaches of Mr Michael Howard or Mr Kenneth Clarke. And if he has never courted a constituency among backbench Tory MPs, he does have the powerful support of Mr Douglas Hurd. During regular appearances before select committees he conducts a genuine dialogue with backbenchers, acknowledging the force of criticisms and enjoying reasoned argument with those of contrary views. His handling of the government's science policy has won him plaudits. His oversight of the Citizen's Charter has made the best of a bad job. This week he made a mistake. His desire to answer MPs' questions led him to acknowledge a practice that every politician knows to be true but which few ever admit. In more tranquil times no one would have noticed. But the media pounces now on every slip - even, it seems, when the minister responsible for open government tells the truth.</p>

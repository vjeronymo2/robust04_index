			<p>BFN     [Text] Dortmund-based VEW [United Westphalian Electricity  Works] AG will work with Siemens AG of Berlin and Munich in the  future on thermal waste disposal, and an agreement to this  effect has recently been signed. As the two corporations  announced on 16 March, the purpose of working together is to  make greater use of the low-temperature carbonization process  developed by Siemens-KWU [Power Generation Division], an  environment-compatible technology for disposing of domestic  waste residue, domestic-type industrial waste, and sewage sludge  that cannot otherwise be avoided or recycled. In the view of  both parties, it represents the best method of meeting the  strict requirements of ecological and economical waste residue  reprocessing. Low-temperature carbonization makes for a  particularly high recycling quota and an exceptional energy  output.    Siemens and VEW stated that working together would primarily  enable them to offer the local authorities responsible for waste  disposal, principally in the catchment area served by VEW and  its east German subsidiary, Halle-based MEAG [expansion  unknown], not just partial solutions but a complete package  comprising everything from planning, building work, and  financing to the operation of thermal disposal plants.    In low-temperature carbonization, residual waste is  converted  into commercial substances and electricity, virtually without  residue and effluent problems, by a combination of  low-temperature carbonization and, subsequently,  high-temperature incineration. Organic pollutants, such as  dioxins and furans, are safely destroyed, and inorganic  pollutants are securely bound in a hot-melt granulate. The  leach-resistant granulate can then be used as a substitute for  sand or gravel in, for example, road building.    A low-temperature carbonization plant with an annual  throughput of 150,000 tonnes of waste residue salvages an annual  average of 6,750 tonnes of iron and over 700 tonnes of aluminum,  which can be smelted without further processing and recycled as  high-grade steel and aluminum products. The same plant also  generates up to 75 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. For  every tonne of domestic waste, no more than 3 kilograms of  reaction products from the flue gas dust collector has to end up  on the hazardous waste dump, the equivalent of only 0.3 percent  of the original quantity at the very most.</p>

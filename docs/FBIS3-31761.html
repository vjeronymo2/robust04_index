			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, </F> from the "Strictly Public" military program; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] We are planning on a number of strictly  military measures, the magnitude of which -- it is true -- will  not be very large, but there is a rational reason for that: We  will accumulate the indispensable experiences at the level of a  platoon or a company, and then the conclusions that will be  drawn from those experiences will bring positive results in the  course of preparing subsequent training which would then be  broadened, including participation by larger types of units or  even tactical units. At the same time of course -- that is less  expensive -- command and staff exercises will be taking place,  and also joint training, and computer-simulated war and  political games. I hope these measures, which are very  significant -- I hope we will manage to implement these measures  since they do not require as huge expenditures as in the case,  for instance, of an exchange or participation in maneuvers  abroad by an entire brigade or division -- that is out of the  question for this year.    The most urgent need for Europe -- and not just Europe -- is  the issue of establishing efficient peacekeeping forces. Poland  has had considerable experience in that regard; it has a  well-prepared center for training troops for peacekeeping  missions. Quite an intensive exchange is already going on in  that area, and I think that direction should definitely be  maintained, while taking advantage of experiences of, for  instance, the Dutch, Great Britain, or other countries that are  involved in such peacekeeping missions. But that is not the  whole of the offer, and the path of getting closer to European  structures and to NATO should also consist of many other types  of measures. The biggest problem is introducing NATO's  technical standards into our Army, with particular emphasis paid  to communications as the Army's nerve -- that problem should be  resolved as a priority. A few other problems should also be  resolved immediately after that. There exists such a plan in  the Army -- it has been prepared. But what we do not quite  know, is how to finance these investments which -- there is no  getting away from that -- are very expensive. [passage omitted]    As for right now, I can see no alternative whatsoever.  Simply put, the Partnership for Peace initiative constitutes a  realistic way to build continental or even Euro-Atlantic  security structures -- after all, NATO also includes the United  States. Right now, there is the problem of to what extent and  how willingly the other European countries will decide to get  involved in the initiative, I mean in particular those countries  not included in the Visegrad Group.</p>

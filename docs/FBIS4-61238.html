The conference was  attended by a delegation which arrived in Makhachkala from  Moscow, led by Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service. ITAR-TASS reports that the  conference discussed proposals related to the problem of the  Lezghi people divided by the border. Specifically, proposals  were voiced to make it more open by increasing the number of  checkpoints.    At the same time, Sergey Stepashin stressed, the border  should be strong and reliably protected against weapons, drugs,  and criminals getting into Russia, as well as against economic  damage being done to Russia.</p>

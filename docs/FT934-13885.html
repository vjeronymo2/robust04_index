			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Hungary targets 1956 crimes Hungary is to try again to bring officials of the former communist regime to justice after parliament yesterday opened the way for war crimes trials, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Prosecutions will centre on torture, mass shootings and other 'inhuman' means used to suppress the 1956 revolution. That uprising against Soviet occupation and communist rule left 2,500 dead and many more injured. Few cases are likely to go before the courts and legal experts expect sentences to be light, even suspended. Some veterans of 1956 even argue for an amnesty, after justice is done.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIMMIE AWARDS MARK DISPELLING OF RACE STEREOTYPES  </P> <P> The Assn. of Asian-Pacific American Artists handed out its fifth annual Media  Awards at the Beverly Hilton on Monday night, honoring film and television  producers, playwrights and a veteran talent agent for working to dispel racial  stereotypes.  </P> <P> The Jimmie awards, as they are called, are named for the late Academy  Award-winning cinematographer James Wong Howe.  </P> <P> Yue-Sai Kan, Chinese-born producer and host of two magazine-style television  series, "One World" and "Looking East," seen on UHF and cable stations in this  country and on Chinese television, won the group's Lifetime Achievement Award.  </P> <P> Other winners included the film "The Moderns" for its casting of an  Asian-American, John Lone, in a starring role "neither conceived as nor written  for a person of color."  </P> <P> "Coming Into Passion -- Song for a Sansei," written by Jude Narita, took the  best-play honor.  </P> <P> "I learned a lot from this play," Narita said. "I learned that people respond  to what comes from your heart and I learned that the time for accepting  identities that are demeaning and dismissible caricatures of whole  nationalities . . . that that time is over."  </P> <P> David Henry Hwang won a playwright award for his body of work. Last year, he  won a Tony award for his Broadway play "M Butterfly," becoming the first  Asian-American to win a Tony.  </P> <P> Playwright Kan Gotanda also was honored for his body of work, which includes  "The Wash" and "Yankee Dawg You Die."  </P> <P> "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" -- co-produced by Christine Choy and Renee Tajima --  was judged the best documentary. It chronicled the events surrounding the  baseball-bat bludgeoning of a young Chinese-American in Detroit by auto factory  workers who mistook him for a Japanese.  </P> <P> "Murphy's Law" was honored as best television series and was cited as the first  network series to co-star an Asian-American, Maggie Han, and "utilize the  performer in a non-stereotypical manner."  </P> <P> Talent agent Bessie Loo won the Pioneer Award for starting a talent agency that  specializes in Asian-American artists.  </P> <P> The two-hour awards show, hosted by television commentator Mario Machado, will  be televised in Mandarin on KSCI, Channel 18, on April 23 at 7:30 p.m., and  then in English on KLCS, Channel 58, on May 2 at 9 p.m. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Russians confident of rapid privatisation Proponents of privatisation have dismissed the possibility of interference from Russia's parliament, which is due to be elected next week, and are pressing ahead with plans to sell off major companies. The intention is to place 80 per cent of Russia's industrial capacity in private hands by next July. Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy privatisation minister, has said that large enterprises being prepared for partial flotation include Gasprom, the state gas-producing monopoly. Although the state would retain control of the enterprise, 20 per cent of shares would be offered to the public through vouchers. Mr Vasiliev was confident that the State Property Committee, responsible for the world's biggest and fastest privatisation campaign, would reach its 80 per cent target by July 1, the deadline for the use of privatisation vouchers. After that, state property would be sold for money only. 'The next three months will be crucial,' he said in a recent interview. 'Parliament won't be up to speed on privatisation in the first few months of its existence. We have to use this time to sell as much as we can and work as hard as we can.' One area the property committee would enter for the first time is banking, with plans to sell the state's remaining stakes in large banks, such as Promstroibank, which used to finance the whole of Soviet industry, and Rosselkhozbank, which still finances much of Russian agriculture. It also planned to give commercial banks the opportunity to buy premises they have leased from the central bank. Parties competing in the election next Sundayhave attacked privatisation as insensitive to the needs of individual sectors and companies. In the next few months, the property committee expects progress in two crucial areas: building a secondary market for share-trading, and helping managers of privatised enterprises behave in a more market-oriented way. A newly-created Securities and Exchange Commission, on which Mr Vasiliev sits, is working on a system for independent share registries, which would make it possible, say, for a worker in Vladivostok to sell shares to an entrepreneur in Moscow. At present, the only way to validate a share transaction is to go directly to the privatised company for a change in its register, which it may refuse if it does not like the new owner. A year from now, said Mr Vasiliev, Russia would be ready for secondary trading on stock exchanges. To help privatised companies, the state would provide business instruction for factory directors. Mr Vasiliev said this would include organising 'schools' on a sectoral basis. Business experts would be invited, for instance, to a major chemical plant to work directly with its managers, while directors of other chemical plants attend. Directors would then have to devise business plans of their own, and the best investment strategies would qualify for financial support, including funds from a Dollars 3bn package promised by the Group of Seven industrial nations. Although Mr Vasiliev said that foreign investment had been sluggish, increasing numbers of foreign buyers had emerged after share purchases by workers and staff. 'Privatisation has provided concrete owners with whom investors can negotiate,' he said. Mr Vasiliev added that 10 per cent of shares, or about Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m worth, which had been made available since January 1993 when the privatisation of large-scale enterprises was launched, had since been acquired by foreigners. 'This is less than, say, Hungary,' he said, acknowledging the difficulties of Russia's business environment. But he said promises of further investment were greater, amounting to Dollars 2bn in the St Petersburg region alone.</p>

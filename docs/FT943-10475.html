			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Togolese cocoa growers get big price increase Togo has increased its producer price for top grade cocoa to CFA Fr550 (Dollars 1.02) a kilogram from CFR Fr300, an 83 per cent rise, according to a government decree published in the official daily Togo-Presse, reports Reuter from Lome. Lower grade cocoa would be bought at a substantial discount, Tuesday's edition of the paper added. Farmers would be paid only CFA Fr175 a kilogram for grade one cocoa and CFA Fr150 for grade two, it said. The farmer price was raised to CFA Fr300 a kilogram from CFA Fr225 soon after last January's 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc. The latest rise for superior grade cocoa was in response to the sharp increase in the cost of living since then, the paper said. Analysts said Togo's annual (apparent) cocoa output had fallen to about 4,000 tonnes from over 10,000 tonnes in the late 1980s, mainly because less was being smuggled in from Ghana. The decree said the 1993-94 Togolese cocoa marketing season would close on September 30. At the London Commodity Exchange yesterday the second position cocoa futures price closed at Pounds 1,072 a tonne, equivalent to about Dollars 1.64 a kilogram, up about Pounds 140 since the beginning of this year and Pounds 300 from 12 months ago.</p>

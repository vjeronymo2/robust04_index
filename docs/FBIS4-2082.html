			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa said today Japan wants to strengthen its  cooperation with China and to make the bilateral relationship  21st century-oriented that will contribute to the international  community.    Hosokawa proposed more exchanges in such sectors as youth,  students, culture and local cities so as to deepen mutual  understanding.    The Japanese Government leader was talking to Guo Chaoren,  director-general of China's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, at his official  residence.    Recalling his visit to China in March, he said, "Japan's  relations with China have entered a new stage." He added that  during that trip, he obtained first-hand information about the  steady and smooth development of China's reform.    "When I met with business leaders after I returned home, I  repeatedly urged them to pay more attention to China," he told  Guo.    Hosokawa expressed confidence in the future of bilateral  trade and economic ties and suggested the two countries become  "partners that will hold themselves responsible for the  international economy."    Guo arrived in Japan yesterday for an eight-day visit at the  invitation of KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS.</p>

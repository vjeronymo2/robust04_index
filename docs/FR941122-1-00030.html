This proposal would require replacement of the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. This proposal is prompted by reports of a binding condition in the clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. The actions specified by the proposed AD are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane due to binding of a clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by January 19, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;198&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Investigation revealed that the clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator may have caused the clutch to bind intermittently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, when the switches for the stabilizer trim are operated, the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator turns and engages either the ``nose up'' or the ``nose down'' clutch, which causes the stabilizer to move. When the switches for the stabilizer trim are released, the clutch disengages, and the actuator continues to turn until it stops (coasts)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through deceleration. Under normal operating conditions, the stabilizer movement stops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately after the clutch disengages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a binding clutch may cause the stabilizer to continue to move while the electric actuator coasts. The stabilizer may move in the direction it was last commanded or it may reverse and move in the opposite direction. The direction depends on which clutch disk is binding. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 737&hyph;27A1191, Revision 1, dated November 3, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuators, having part number (P/N) 10&hyph;62033&hyph;3, with a different model (P/N 10&hyph;62033&hyph;4) that eliminates the problems associated with binding of the clutch disk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the electric actuator of the stabilizer trim with a different model. The actions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 1,448 Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 590 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be approximately $600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $495,600, or $840 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

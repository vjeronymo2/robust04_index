			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further the 1990 proposal specifically focused on whether work within walk-in enclosures was the optimum method to protect asbestos workers. It is widely accepted that employees who disturb asbestos, and who contact deteriorated asbestos during their work are most at risk (see e.g., Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 1&hyph;12). In its earlier response to the Court's remand, OSHA noted that the ``record of the 1986 standard contains no data concerning whether employees working within the negative pressure enclosures also benefit from reduced exposure, whether working inside enclosures may introduce other potential work hazards such as heat stress. Further rulemaking is necessary to develop this information.'' (54 FR 52026, Dec. 20, 1989). In the proposal, OSHA reiterated this statement and again raised this issue (55 FR 29715).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rulemaking record reflected this two-part inquiry. Data and comment were submitted concerning the effectiveness of NPEs in protecting employees within the enclosure, and their effectiveness in protecting ``bystander'' employees and adjacent areas from asbestos contamination. The record presents a mixed case on both issues. First, very limited data were submitted showing that employees working within the enclosures experienced reduced asbestos levels because of the enclosures themselves, or the ventilation provided by negative air machines, in spite of claims that the enclosures and ventilation produce such results. In fact claims were made that in comparing work within enclosures to work without enclosures, ``enclosures consistently came out higher in terms of what the person inside the enclosure is exposed to'' (Exxon, Tr. 2678). However, the record contains some data which show that properly designed and installed NPEs may limit the spread of asbestos contamination to adjacent areas and employees. However, the record also demonstrates that other systems, properly installed and performed by trained employees will also limit the spread of asbestos contamination. These are discussed in depth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this record and on the Agency's experience and expertise, OSHA has concluded that although negative pressure enclosure systems are effective in many circumstances in protecting workers both within and outside the enclosure, other systems are equally effective in designated circumstances. Additionally, the demonstration in this rulemaking that other systems can be effective, supports regulatory provisions which do not stifle continued development and refinement of control strategies for asbestos work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Effectiveness of NPEs in Protecting Employees Working Within the Enclosure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, little data were submitted showing that employees working within the enclosure have reduced exposures because of the enclosure itself, or other components of the NPE system. Although much data was alluded to during the hearing, e.g., ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;10 years of real, real projects with rooms full of data, *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;we have some nice summaries that I can give you *&blank;*&blank;*.''(Tr. 3133). However, none of these data was submitted to the record. Also, NIOSH testified during the rulemaking hearing, ``we are not aware of any studies evaluating their (negative pressure enclosures) effectiveness or delineating important parameters such as minimum pressure differential, minimum air flow, or maximum volumes feasible for various barrier materials.'' (Tr. 228). BCTD noted a study in which ``two MIT researchers estimated ``that total exposures using the HEPA negative pressure system might be about four-fold less than they would be without the system'' (Ex. 143 at 90). OSHA notes that this estimate was derived from ``assumptions'' of the study team, and was unsupported by exposure data. Further, the baseline exposure model was based on a much earlier study of activities cleaning up contamination in a building. During this rulemaking hearing, the author of that study described it as ``extremely unique,&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;not representative of buildings in the United States'' (Tr. 2157). OSHA therefore regards the MIT exposure reduction estimate as unsupported and too speculative to serve as a basis for regulatory decision making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exposure data submitted to this rulemaking record which reflected personal samples within negative pressure enclosures do not support the view that working within such enclosures by itself will ensure reduced employee exposure. In fact, data were submitted which showed that employees working within negative pressure enclosures under some circumstances were exposed to excessive levels of asbestos (see below). OSHA recognizes that a showing of elevated levels from any one project or series of projects does not indict the control method as the cause of such elevations. However, numerous submissions from various sources which show elevated exposure levels with no indication of improper system installation indicates that in operation, the use of negative pressure enclosure systems does not assure effective exposure reduction to the employees performing the work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, Union Carbide submitted 1,000 exposure measurements ``generally obtained from jobs where insulation was removed from piping of 1 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; -14 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; diameter and from other miscellaneous jobs removing asbestos from vessels'' (Ex. 7&hyph;108). More than one half of the samples were over the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc, and most of those were over the previous PEL of 0.2 f/cc. Additional data showing high exposures within negative pressure enclosures compared to relatively low exposure levels for glove bag use were submitted by Arco Products, Inc. (Ex. 7&hyph;139) and Grayling (7&hyph;144). The Arco submission contained monitoring results from 9 personal samples taken within the enclosure. These ranged from 0.01 to 0.44 f/cc with a mean on 0.28 f/cc. Lower exposure levels for work within NPEs was shown by data submitted by the Asbestos Abatement Council, presenting data incorporating air monitoring results for over 200 projects, collected from four different contractors over an eight year time period. These data showed area samples ranging from 0.12 to 0.15 f/cc, while personal samples ranged from 0.03 to 0.07 f/cc (Ex. 1&hyph;142).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

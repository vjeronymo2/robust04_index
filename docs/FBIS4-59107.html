			<p>BFN     [Text] The speaker of the Libyan Parliament described  Iran's policy of defending the rights of Muslims and Islamic  values as independent and a source of pride for the world of  Islam.    At a meeting in Tripoli with our country's ambassador, which  was for the purpose of handing over a written message from  Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri, the Libyan parliamentary speaker  said: The free will and resistance of Islamic Iran in dealing  with the problems of the world of Islam, and her defense of  Islamic values, raise the morale of Muslim peoples in tackling  problems.    At the meeting, our country's ambassador outlined the common  viewpoints of Iran and Libya on important global issues. He  called for more activity by the two countries' parliamentary  friendship groups.    Also a written message from Nateq-Nuri about the painful and  dangerous conditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina was handed to Nabih  Birri, the speaker of the Lebanese National Assembly.    According to a Central News Unit report from Beirut, our  country's ambassador in Beirut told reporters on Monday, after  delivering the message, that he had discussed ways of  cooperation and coordination between parliaments of Islamic  countries in the defense of the innocent and oppressed people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and to bring to an end to the massacre of  that Muslim nation.    Our country's ambassador added: The Gaza-Jericho agreement  is, in fact, a security agreement, which is aimed at 'Arafat's  police crushing the Intifadah and fighting the Palestinian  nation.</p>

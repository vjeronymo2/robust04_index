			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks are set to  resume, but Japan is already facing more problems because the  United States wants to add five additional areas, including  "banking services" to the list of priority issues to be  addressed at the talks.    Japan faced a tough enough time at the talks settling the  question of objective criteria in the existing agreed three  priority, including automobiles and auto parts. The additions  mean Japan faces difficult negotiations over more areas.    If the "deregulation and competitive policy" is included, it  will probably have an impact on the outline of exterior economic  policy reform, which the government planned to finish by the end  of June.    Japan says it will discuss the issue of expanding the  priority list with the United States, but it is expected to  basically accept the U.S. request. "Banking services" and  "deregulation and competitive policy" had been the subject of  bilateral negotiations up until February, when the whole  framework talks broke down. But because so little progress was  made, the Japanese Government feels "this is a new start."    The "deregulation and competitive policy" area is expected  to  command a lot of attention and the Japanese Government is at  present working on details to be included in the outline of the  exterior economic policy reform. If Japan-U.S. negotiations on  this area begin, it is possible that the U.S. demands on  deregulation will be clearly visible in the outline.    Japan is very concerned about the fact that sheet glass and  forestry products have been raised as areas for negotiation.  Each is an area in which certain U.S. companies and pressure  groups have been putting pressure on the U.S. Government. If  Japan is slow to act, the United States may take sanctions under  Section 301 of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act.    In the informal negotiations on resuming the framework  talks,  the United States may appear to have made a concession by  retracting its demand for numerical targets. However, its  demand that additional trade areas be discussed can be seen as a  new way of shaking up Japan.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Lottery bidders plan Pounds 3m spending AT LEAST two potential applicants to run the UK's National Lottery plan to spend Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m on preparations before their bids go in. Both the Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada, Carlton Communications and Associated Newspapers; and Camelot, whose investors include Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue and Racal Electronics, have each hired about 100 people. The evidence of considerable detailed planning comes as the National Lottery Bill was receiving royal assent. Details on further progress for the lottery, which could have an annual turnover of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn, will be spelled out by the National Heritage department today. Mr Gerry Robinson, chairman of the Great British Lottery Company and chief executive of the Granada Group, said: 'We believe we have put more time, money and effort into it than anyone else.' The consortium, which also includes the Vodafone Group and Hambros, the merchant bank, is testing systems and modelling lottery games. 'We have invested the money before we know the details. It's a calculated risk,' said Mr Robinson, who believes that television will be a key ingredient in marketing the idea of a lottery as fun. Mr David Rigg of Camelot, whose other shareholders are GTECH, the US company that supplies and runs equipment to more than 60 lotteries around the world, and ICL, the computer company, said yesterday his consortium had been working on its lottery plans for three years. It is clear that Camelot is already spending considerable sums of money. Other bids are expected from the Rank Organisation, the Ladbroke group, the Tote and a consortium linking NM Rothschild and Tattersalls, operators of the Australian state lottery in Victoria.</p>

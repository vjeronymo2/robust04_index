			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Vintan: "It Is Increasingly Difficult </F> With Oliviu Gherman"]    [Text] About this time last year, the ruling party [Social  Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] was waving the banner of the  coalition government, which should have united all political  forces in a brotherly embrace. Now the same tune is being sung  again, but this time in a little more pragmatic manner,  allegedly to break the current parliamentary bottleneck, which  is becoming increasingly unpleasant for the PDSR leaders.    Nothing is being done now, just as nothing was done then,  for  the simple reason that there is no desire for any action. A  member of the ruling party leadership told us a few days ago  that under the current circumstances it is impossible to  establish a PDSR-opposition government. The strongest  explanation for this is the danger that the PDSR might split as  a result of such a government. "There are too many of those who  oppose such an alliance to allow us to disregard their wishes.  The main promoter of this opinion is none other than Adrian  Nastase, the executive president of the party. He is afraid of  an alliance with the opposition not because he is a member of  the conservative wing of the party but because he is a very  cautious man, even excessively cautious. However, in politics,  one also needs courage to assume certain risks." Adrian Nastase  does not want to take any risks. He believes that it is too  dangerous to break off with former allies merely for the sake of  the opposition. Even though on diplomatic channels he is  constantly receiving signals that confirm the wish of the West  that the opposition should participate in the government.    Because of his obstinacy, Adrian Nastase's relations with  the  honorary president of the PDSR, Oliviu Gherman, have  considerably deteriorated of late. He would be ready to take  risks and has already succeeded in convincing even Ion Iliescu  about the importance of showing greater courage in politics.    Gherman's latest disappointment is that it is that same  Adrian Nastase who has recently saved a well-known extremist  leader. Afraid that sacrificing this extremist leader would  bring about isolation and the loss of certain faithful allies,  PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase made every possible  effort and definitively eliminated the danger that seemed  inevitable for the leader.</p>

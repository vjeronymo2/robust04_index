			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 'RUSH HOUR' COMES TO LAND OF THE SIOUX  </P> <P> Almost 125 years after Chief Red Cloud refused to sign a treaty with the  federal government to allow a road to pass through Oglala Sioux territory, the  Pine Ridge Reservation will get its first traffic signal.  </P> <P> "The Pine Ridge reservation will remain the land of Chief Red Cloud, but it  will have a stoplight," Mayor G. Wayne Tapio said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The light will be placed in the center of Pine Ridge at Highways 407 and 18.  The village, in the southwestern part of the state, has a population of 5,000.  Tapio said that traffic passing through from outlying communities "makes rush  hour risky."  </P></p>

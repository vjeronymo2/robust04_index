			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN HONOR OF LIFE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS GATHER AT CITY OF HOPE TO MARK THEIR  SUCCESSFUL FIGHT AGAINST ILLNESS. THEY ALSO REMEMBER THOSE WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT.  </P> <P> Tears welled up in Alma Andrade's eyes as she watched her favorite celebration  take shape underneath a large party tent at the City of Hope National Medical  Center in Duarte.  </P> <P> "This is what I wait for every year," said the 21-year-old Los Angeles  resident, her voice cracking as children and adults all around her laughed and  hugged each other. "To me it's more special than birthdays, Christmas or  anything else. It's another year that I live."  </P> <P> Andrade is a bone marrow transplant recipient, one of about 200 who gathered at  an emotional reunion last week to celebrate their recovery from leukemia, blood  disorders and other life-threatening diseases. Many, including Andrade, came  with the sibling who had donated the marrow to save their lives.  </P> <P> The Hughes family flew out from Mesa, Ariz., to mark 9-year-old John Hughes'  third anniversary since his transplant. While John romped around on the lawn  with his brother and bone marrow donor, Matthew, now 11, their parents recalled  the traumatic years that began when John was diagnosed as having acute  lymphoblastic leukemia.  </P> <P> "It was a really upsetting time for the whole family," said John's mother,  Petey. "I had to get a nanny to take care of the (other) kids. I'd come (to  City of Hope) and stay for a week. Mike (her husband) was able to leave Fridays  and stay during the weekend. Sometimes we'd meet each other in the airport and  switch keys right there."  </P> <P> At the reunion Friday, television cameras and reporters surrounded City of  Hope's second-longest transplant survivor, Marilyn Gaffney, who came with three  of the four children she has adopted since her transplant 13 years ago. Because  of the massive doses of chemotherapy and radiation she received in preparation  for her transplant, Gaffney could not bear children.  </P> <P> These were the lucky ones, said Dr. Stephen Forman, director of City of Hope's  department of hematology and bone marrow transplantation. There is only a  one-in-four chance siblings will have matching bone marrow types.  </P> <P> Forman asked for a moment of silence in memory of those who weren't so  fortunate.  </P> <P> "Remember the people not with us today," Forman told the crowd of about 500 as  they munched on sandwiches, rolled video cameras, and snapped photographs with  doctors and nurses.  </P> <P> Forman recalled the first transplant survivor's party 14 years ago, when a  handful of nurses and doctors gathered in the patient's room and celebrated  with a birthday cake. In succeeding years, the hospital cafeteria served as the  party room, and nurses would make spaghetti and hang a pinata, he said.  </P> <P> It is still largely a family affair, but that may change soon because of recent  advances in matching unrelated donors and patients.  </P> <P> Until recently, finding an unrelated bone marrow donor -- a one-in-20,000  chance -- was virtually impossible. Now, there are computerized registries to  match unrelated patients and donors across the nation and internationally.  </P> <P> "I hope next year we'll have patients and donors here who are strangers,"  Forman said.  </P> <P> Patients took turns at the microphone to talk about the diseases that almost  took their lives. Some thanked their doctors and nurses. Others wept openly.  </P> <P> "You try to forget the bad part, and remember the good part," one former  patient said. "Thank God we're all here."  </P></p>

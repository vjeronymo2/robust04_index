			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / London 'likely to add 50,000 office jobs' Central London is likely to see a growth in office employment of between 50,000 and 65,000 jobs by the year 2000, says a report published yesterday. The growth could generate demand for 10m sq ft of extra office space, St Quintin, the chartered surveyors, say. However, the growth in jobs is likely to be less important in generating demand for offices than the need for City occupiers to change and upgrade their accommodation. A quarter of City tenants are housed in unrefurbished buildings built before 1970. The projections are based on the assumption that London retains its position as Europe's leading financial centre. However, it highlights a number of threats to that position, including increased teleworking and competition from other centres such as Frankfurt. Mr Peter Damesick, head of research at St Quintin, emphasised the uncertainties involved in making long-term projections. 'Even the modest increase in occupied floor space in our projections is not guaranteed,' he said. Prospects for Office Demand. St Quintin Research Department, 33 Cavendish Square, London W1M 9HF.

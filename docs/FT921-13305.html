			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Major favours April 9 poll: Prime minister sees Budget tax cuts as launch pad for election MR JOHN MAJOR has told colleagues he wants to call the general election for April 9 after a tax-cutting Budget early in March. Senior ministers said last night that the prime minister hoped to use a planned speech to a conference of Conservative party activists in Torquay on March 14 to launch the election campaign. As Mr Major clashed with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, during another heated Commons exchange over the economy, there was clear evidence the Civil Service machine was clearing the decks for an early election. The Conservatives stepped up their attack on Labour's tax and spending plans, claiming that figures showed the opposition's public spending pledges would eventually cost Pounds 37bn a year. The ministers cautioned that an unexpected reversal of Conservative fortunes in the opinion polls could yet force Mr Major to delay calling the election until May 7. He could hold out until late June. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is said to favour May 7 to give more time for the promised economic recovery to materialise. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, has also suggested that there are advantages in going to the country on the same day as the local elections. It is understood, however, that the prime minister's sights are now firmly set on an earlier poll, with tax reductions in the Budget designed to form a central plank of the Conservative manifesto. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, are among cabinet ministers backing that strategy. The growing consensus among ministers is that Mr Major can no longer rely on a consistent run of opinion polls before calling the election nor on anything more than a promise of economic recovery. In such circumstances, they see little advantage in delay. After some wrangling between the Treasury and the prime minister's office, Mr Lamont will announce the date of the Budget today. Treasury officials had wanted to delay it until March 17, but the expectation at Westminster is that Mr Major has insisted on March 10 or, possibly, March 3. Either of these two dates would allow time for an April 9 election, though March 10 would mean an extremely tight schedule. The atmosphere of electioneering engulfing Whitehall and Westminster was further reinforced by reports that civil servants have stepped up their analysis of Labour's policy proposals in case Mr Kinnock becomes prime minister. Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, is updating long-standing guidelines which define the role of civil servants during an election campaign. Treasury officials have drawn up a detailed plan to rush through the Commons a short post-Budget finance bill which would extend the government's powers to raise taxes into the new financial year.

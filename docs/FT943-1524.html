			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: EW Fact shares fall on warning Shares in EW Fact fell 31p to 103p yesterday after the professional tuition company reported lower than anticipated interim results and warned that the second half would also be below expectations. The company said that student enrolments had been disappointing as a result of changes in an accountancy syllabus and the recession causing low recruitment of trainees and restricted training budgets. The first half had also included full provision for litigation relating to Vatax Advisory Services, a dormant subsidiary. Turnover for the first half of 1994 advanced to Pounds 5.04m (Pounds 2.44m) including Pounds 2.66m from acquisitions. The figures included almost a full contribution from Accountancy Tutors, acquired in January. Pre-tax profits doubled to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 602,000) but the placing and open offer to fund the purchase left earnings per share lower at 4.37p against 5.36p. However, the group remains confident of prospects and the interim dividend is raised to 1.94p (1.76p).</p>

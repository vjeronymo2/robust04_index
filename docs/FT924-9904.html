			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaks crucial barrier THE DOLLAR broke through the crucial barrier of DM1.56 against the D-Mark yesterday, the highest it has reached since plummeting to a historic low against the German currency two months ago, writes James Blitz. A dollar rally was expected in the aftermath of today's US presidential election. Many dealers believe that Mr Bill Clinton's likely victory as President will lift US interest rates because of his commitment to increased fiscal spending. But the fact that the US currency rallied on the eve of the election was interpreted yesterday as another indication that the dollar is on the verge of a long term move upwards. A leading UK-based fund manager said technical analysts were particularly excited that the dollar had broken through DM1.56, a key chart point which marks the average close of the dollar in the last 200 days. He added that this was the sort of technical breakthrough which tends to encourage longer term investors, who change their positions every six months or so, to buy the currency. 'We ourselves have shifted our portfolios to reflect a long term upturn in the dollar,' he said. Two specific factors helped to push the currency to a high of DM1.5695 in Europe and a close of DM1.5690 (in New York the dollar subsequently eased back to end at DM1.5645). First was the release of September's industrial production figures in Germany, showing a 2 per cent fall, and increasing speculation that the Bundesbank will cut market rates more quickly than anticipated. Compounding the bullishness was the October report of the National Association of Purchasing Managers in the US, which rose to 50.6 per cent from the previous month's level of 49 per cent. A reading above 50 per cent tends to indicate that the manufacturing sector is expanding. Some dissonant voices still believe that the dollar will falter after the election. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, believes that most of the operators who want to buy dollars in anticipation of a Clinton victory have already bought them  - and that there will not necessarily be a follow-through if he is elected. Providing additional uplift for the dollar was sterling's intrinsic weakness, the product of the political uncertainty engulfing the UK. Dealers are nervous that Mr John Major's government will lose a crucial debate on the Maastricht ratification bill in parliament on Wednesday night. The pound yesterday fell to a three-year low against the dollar of Dollars 1.5300 before closing at Dollars 1.5320. Against the D-Mark it finished nearly a pfennig down at DM2.4030. A vote against the Maastricht treaty tomorrow would probably push sterling lower. Mr O'Neill says that, in this event, DM2.30 would be a likely short term target.</p>

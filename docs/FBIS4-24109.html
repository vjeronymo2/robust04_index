			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as received] </F>   [Excerpts] Kampala, 23 Jun (PANA) -- The global Pan-African  Movement (PAM) has reacted angrily to Wednesday [22nd June]'s  endorsement, by the United Nations Security Council, of France's  initiative to lead a humanitarian force into Rwanda. "It is with  horror and shocked disbelief that we heard that the UN secretary  general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has recommended to the UN  Security Council to accept the French offer of military  intervention in Rwanda supposedly to stop the continuing  massacre of civilians," said a statement issued by PAM  secretariat Thursday in Kampala.    The statement dated 22nd June and signed by Dr Taj al-Din  'Abd- al-Rahim, the PAM general secretary, said the organization  is horrified because it could not believe that Ghali [as  received] could recommend the intervention against the  background of "similar unilateralist military intervention by  the United States in Somalia and the tragic consequences of that  misadventure."    "It will seem to us that both Dr. Ghali and the United  Nations cannot learn from one mistake. Maybe the UN secretary  general thinks two tragic mistakes are better than one. But at  what cost?" The statement asks.    The release says PAM is shocked because the secretary  general  is an African with decades of political experience both as  foreign minister and prime minister of Egypt. "With that  experience one would have thought he would be better informed in  advising the United Nations and the Security Council to be  cautious and sensitive to the needs and concerns of Africans."  [passage omitted]    PAM accused the UN secretary general of taking decisions on  Africa saying "his stewardship at the United Nations so far, has  witnessed the most insensitive and outrageous decisions on  matters concerning Africa, of which his current endorsement of  French military intervention in Rwanda is a tragic example."    The statement says there are many Africans who think Ghali  has been exercising his powers, without any sense of  responsibility." The ease with which he seems to accede to any  Western unilateral designs on Africa makes it very difficult to  refute such critics. He seems unable to ask why each time the  United States and her Western allies order him to jump, his only  query seems to be: How high?"    PAM believes that the historical link between France and  Rwanda would compromise "any moral or political concern that  France may now be feigning". It blamed France and Belgium for  "perpetration of brutal rule and systematic genocide in Rwanda."    In the three-page statement, the Kampala-based organization  said it believes that France has a hidden agenda to repossess  the Central African state as a French colony, prevent the rebels  of Rwandan Patriotic Front from military victory and create  another Liberia type of stalemate in that country.

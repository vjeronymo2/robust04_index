The Assembly looked into a  number of briefing requests addressed to Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa on the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    Minister 'Amr Musa then addressed the Assembly, saying that  the Hebron massacre has shocked the Egyptian president,  Government, and people. Musa pointed out that Egypt was the  first country to denounce the massacre, its perpetrators, and  the policies that led to it. Egypt, he added, voiced the need  to curb Israeli extremism and provide measures for protecting  the Palestinians.    The foreign minister said that President Husni Mubarak  instructed Egyptian officials to support the Palestinian demand  for a UN Security Council session to discuss the massacre.  President Mubarak also got in touch with Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat several times, stressing his and Egypt's support  for the Palestinians at this critical juncture. The two  Presidents reviewed the measures that should be taken to  guarantee the safety of Palestinians and prevent the settlers  from terrorizing them.    Minister Musa said that Egypt's reaction to the massacre was  guided by a number of basic principles. Egypt has firmly  condemned the massacre. Egypt has stated that responsibility  for the massacre is not confined to the perpetrator; that Israel  has a clear and specific responsibility for it. Egypt has made  it clear that Israeli settlements are illegitimate and that they  hamper the peace efforts and undermine tranquility and stability  in the occupied territories. The settlements, Egypt believes,  conflict with the rights of the Palestinian people in their land  as well as with International law. Egypt has called on Israel  to take measures to disarm the settlers.    Minister Musa said that the massacre should fortify our  resolve to seek a peace settlement that is based on the exchange  of land for peace and guarantees the restoration of Palestinian  rights.    The foreign minister said that negotiations should continue  because Israel must not be left in control of Arab land. He  pointed to the unanimous world condemnation of the massacre.    The People's Assembly issued a statement strongly denouncing  the barbaric crime, saying that it violates all ethical  principles and norms of international law. The statement says  that the Israeli Government, being the occupation authority, is  responsible for the massacre. It condemns Israel's failure to  offer protection to civilians living in the occupied territories  in the face of repeated acts of repression and terror. This  failure, the statement adds, fuels the spirit of fanaticism and  hatred and invites the recurrence of atrocities.    The Assembly referred Foreign Minister Musa's speech and the  deputies' comments to an ad hoc parliamentary committee to  follow up this matter with the government and keep the Assembly  fully briefed on the subject.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Minister says sorry for faculty scandal Ms Ryoko Akamatsu, Japan's education minister, was forced to apologise to the public yesterday for a ministry official's alleged involvement in a bribery scandal. Police arrested Mr Toshio Yamamura, chief of the ministry's university division, for allegedly receiving more than Y500,000 (Pounds 3,000) from officials at Sugiyama Jogakuen University, a women's university in central Japan, in return for approval to change faculty names. The disclosure has caused embarrassment to the ministry, which was involved in the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal in 1988. 'If the allegations are true, it is regrettable,' said Ms Akamatsu, who had warned ministry officials about ethical conduct after the construction scandals last year. The case reflects the myriad regulations an institution has to clear before setting up new departments or faculties. An increasing number of Japanese schools face a sharp fall in the number of students due to demographic changes, and are forced to try to improve their images in order to attract applicants. Mr Yamamura, who was in charge of handling applications from private universities to set up new departments, approved Sugiyama Jogakuen's plan to remodel its domestic science department to the department of life sciences in 1990. Setting up new faculties or changing the names of departments can take up to two years. The three university officials who allegedly handed over the money were also arrested.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "At the Belarusian Defense Ministry"] </F>   [Text] On 11 April, Colonel General Pavel Kazlowski, the  Belarusian defense minister, chaired a meeting of Collegium  members and chiefs of administration and services at the Defense  Ministry Central Administration.    At the beginning of the meeting, the defense minister  introduced Major Ye. Nikulin and Colonel S. Kuznetsov, appointed  to the posts of chief of the control and inspection agency and  chief of the education and training department, respectively.    After the introductions, Col. Gen. Kazlowski informed those  present about a grave accident in the town of Kobryn in which  several children were killed, as well as some other cases,  bordering on emergencies, which displayed negligence and a lack  of responsibility on the part of ranking officials.    It was noted that certain commanders have sometimes adopted  irresponsible attitudes toward the performance of their duties,  are too lenient with their subordinates, and fail to bring to  account those who do not work hard. This kind of attitude makes  people lazy and provides a suitable environment for violations  of combat discipline.    The defense minister demanded a strengthening of personnel  education and heightened personal responsibility from all  commanders and chiefs, which should eliminate even minor  violations of manuals, orders, and daily routines. Every case  of violations of combat discipline and manuals must be put under  scrutiny, the perpetrators punished, and a consequent analysis  and conclusion made. A specific individual should answer for  his misdemeanor. One just cannot keep working and serving this  way any longer. Officers and generals, without exception, must  revise their attitudes toward service and their military duty,  and do their best to elevate combat readiness, discipline, and  self-organization to an appropriate level.    The colonel general continued by suggesting that the Cabinet  of Ministers should step up examination of draft army  regulations and submit them to the Belarusian Supreme Soviet  Presidium for approval. He ordered a comprehensive audit of the  "Transaviaeksport" company, the findings of which will then have  to be passed on to the Defense Ministry, requested normalization  of material and technical supplies to the Military Academy, and  focused on the situation surrounding the garrison "Zvyozdochka"  [Little Star] department store.    The defense minister brought up the issue of the upcoming  CIS  summit in Moscow and the scheduled negotiations between  Belarusian and Russian Defense Ministry delegations.    Reports were also delivered by Lieutenant General N.  Churkin,  chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and first deputy  defense minister, and Major General M. Stankevich, deputy  defense minister for armaments.    At the end of the meeting, Col. Gen. P. Kazlowski set  specific objectives for the immediate future.</p>

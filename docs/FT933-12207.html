			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Rao to face confidence vote The Bharatiya Janata Party, India's largest opposition party, will move a no-confidence motion against Mr Narasimha Rao's government in parliament today, the first day of the monsoon session. The motion is supported by other opposition parties, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. The opposition is seeking to remove the prime minister on grounds of corruption and the Congress (I) party's possible involvement in the Bombay financial scandal, the 'failure of economic policy', and the failure to heal ethnic divisions.</p>

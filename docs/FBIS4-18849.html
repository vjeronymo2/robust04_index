			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["mue" report: "Finance Ministers Prohibit EU Greater </F> Access to Capital Markets"]    [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission is meeting with  determined resistance from the finance and economics ministers  from Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, and France with its  financing projects, which it gives at 800 billion German marks  [DM] for the next 15 years. At a weekend [9-10 April] meeting  in Athens the economics and financial politicians of the  European Union [EU], who are oriented toward stability, even  ignored the inclination of the summit to permit the Commission  to go to the capital markets and to drastically increase the  financing of the European Investment Bank [EIB], which is  already rising rapidly.    In the British delegation the catchword of a "new realism"  in  the EU was spreading, even though London Finance Secretary  Kenneth Clarke did not claim to have coined this expression.  Nevertheless, if Clarke and his Bonn counterpart Theo Waigel,  as well as the central bank heads of the hard currency countries  have their say, the time of great visions and, above all, of  costly projects is over in the EU.    In Athens the Commission wanted to ensure that the EIB is  permitted to expand substantially the financing of cross-border  transportation routes via the capital market, going even beyond  the current, already considerable amount. The officials from  Brussels spoke of about DM400 billion by the end of the decade.  Apart from that, the Commission hoped to get authorization to  raise loans in its own name, for the time being for DM16 billion  per year.    In December the summit ordered the finance ministers to  benevolently examine whether the EU has need for additional  financing. Waigel, however, noted categorically in Athens that  such a need does not exist. The economics and financial  politicians from Bonn are determined to prevent the Commission  from going to the capital markets, because then, they are  afraid, Brussels would open a second large-scale subsidy economy  in excess of the already quite considerable EU budget. Waigel  also questioned the connection between the investments in the  "trans-European networks," which were outlined by the  Commission, and economic growth. This connection had been  established by Commission President Jacques Delors in the "White  Paper on Growth, Employment, and Competitiveness."    In Athens it also became clear that a vision like the  monetary union cannot be designed on the drawing board and  carried out like a construction project, as was attempted in the  Maastricht Treaty. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer stressed  that the majority of the member states are meanwhile pursuing a  policy of stability outside the rules of the European Monetary  System (EMS), since the EMS is practically no longer in force as  a result of the 30-percent expansion of the exchange rate  fluctuation ranges. However, it is still considered to be the  business foundation of the monetary union in line with the  Maastricht Treaty.  <H5>  No Central Bank Function </H5>   Furthermore, Tietmeyer stresses that no member state has so  far entrusted currency reserves to the European Monetary  Institute (EMI). He once again made it clear that the  institute, which was founded in Frankfurt at the beginning of  the year, must not interpret the Maastricht Treaty expansively,  which means it should not exercise any function that is similar  to that of a central bank. It has to limit itself to the  technical preparation of the future European central bank.  Tietmeyer indicated that the EMI is not really the germinating  cell of a future European central bank, but will remain a "think  tank." In Athens it became clear that, in the end, it is those  countries that unite for the monetary union which, independent  of the Maastricht Treaty, have developed a strong currency on  their own and come together in the common interest.</p>

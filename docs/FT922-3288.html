			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Management: When friendship proves to be all one way - How to get more out of alliances with Japanese companies For virtually a decade, western companies have been hell-bent on making 'strategic alliances' with Japanese companies, often with ones which are their rivals. For almost as long, they have been warned repeatedly by consultants and academics that they are putting themselves at a potentially lethal competitive disadvantage by allowing the Japanese to extract more value from the relationship than they do themselves. A few companies have paid heed. In the US, electronics manufacturers have taken various steps to learn more from their Japanese partners; Motorola did an unusually well-constructed deal with Toshiba in 1987 which benefited its semiconductor memory business. At the same time, these companies have protected their own core competences  -such as Motorola's skill in microprocessor technology - more effectively than in the past from being annexed by their Japanese partners. In Europe there are signs that Philips has learned the same lesson. But far too many western companies still see alliances in defensive terms - merely as a way of filling short-term gaps in their product range. Far too few emulate the Japanese in seeing them as an opportunity to extract technology, marketing skills, or other kinds of learning from their partner. The continuing gulf between attitudes to alliances among Japanese and most western companies was all too evident from several papers presented this week at an international academic conference on the globalisation of Japanese enterprises. Held at the Manchester Business School and organised by the North West Centre for Japanese Studies, the conference was attended by a large audience of leading Japanese, American and European academics, as well as business executives. There were few issues on which there was a consensus. But they did agree that one of the west's fundamental problems is that learning from outsiders is far less deeply rooted in western society and business than in Japan. Hence the importance of the concept of 'organisational learning' which is now sweeping American and European industry. The point was put most forcefully by a professor from Auburn University, Alabama. He declared that American companies quite simply fail to perceive alliances as a form of learning. 'We don't understand the importance of the technology we give up. Hence the generally one-way flow of it to the Japanese.' His comments were reinforced by a controversial study of electronics industry alliances undertaken by a Manchester School of Management academic, Fred Burton, together with a colleague from the University of Boston. They looked at 208 alliances forged between 1978 and 1987 by seven top Japanese companies, and concluded that the relationships were not working to the advantage of western companies. Not only was there very little east-west transfer of technology (as distinct from components or products), but the Japanese companies were reluctant to encourage such a flow. As a result, complained Burton, western companies were becoming increasingly dependent on the Japanese. The latter, on the other hand, were reducing their dependence on western partners, either by absorbing their skills, or by concluding temporary alliances with several of them at once. Given the emotive nature of the subject matter, it was fortunate that a paper by a team of Japanese, rather than western, researchers gave the conference the most searching exposition of the way Japanese companies use alliances for what the academics called 'inter-organisational learning'. They also redressed the balance somewhat by pointing to a handful of alliances, especially in the semiconductor industry, where the benefits do seem to be reciprocal. In particular, technology transfer is flowing at least partly in the reverse direction, from Japan to the west. In information technology, and especially in semiconductors, Japanese companies see alliances as a way not only to make up for a company's lack of technology, but also to help accelerate the development of whole new industries, the researchers reported. Outlining various levels of inter-organisational learning, they christened one type 'strategic'. But one researcher said revealingly that this could also be termed 'value appropriation' from the alliance to its parent partners (or, presumably, to just one of them). Even more important, the researchers added, is the experience of 'learning how to learn' which companies can gain through alliances. The daunting nature of their message for the west was pretty clear from their brief verbal presentation at the conference. But anyone still in doubt needed only to look at the penultimate paragraph of their written paper. It read thus. 'The following words in (an) interview with an NEC director . . . pointed out a new direction of alliances as inter-organisational learning: 'Alliances with AT&amp;T have led to large technological effects through co-development with Bell Laboratories. Overlying the technological effects, however, the most important effect that we could learn was how Bell implements its research'.' Quite so. It may already be too late to be worth saying this, but far more western companies need to go out and do likewise.</p>

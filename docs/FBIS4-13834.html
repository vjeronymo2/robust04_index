			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations Hq. (New York), April 22, IRNA --  Iran's permanent representative of Iran to the U.N. Kamal  Kharrazi, last night said if the Security Council had reacted  "promptly and vigorously" when its first resolution had been  violated by the Serbs, the Bosnian people would have been spared  the present catastrophe.    Condemning the world body's attitude towards the savage  attacks on Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Serbs, Kharrazi said at the  open session of the Security Council that the U.N. failure to  shoulder its responsibility in the face of continued Serbian  aggression could not be ignored. "The fact the Council has tied  the hands of the victims so that they cannot exercise their  inherent rights of self-defense cannot be be overlooked," he  said.    The Iranian added that in fact the "Serbs have been given  the  green light to continue to slaughter the defenseless people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina." Referring to the worsening situation  particularlly in the besieged city of Gorazde, he said that  under such circumstances, the Council has only "one option that  is lift and strike," as all other mechanisms designed to defend  civilians have failed.    "Those who oppose lifting the arms embargo against B-H, are  certainly responsible, at least partially, for all innocent  lives perished in the Serbian atrocities," Kharrazi made it  clear.    He said "there is no justification whatsoever, on legal or  moral grounds, for the continuation of the unjust arms embargo  against Bosnia."    The inaction and indecisiveness of the UN in countering  aggression coupled with the persistence of certain Council  members in denying the inherent right of self-defense to the  Bosnians, has made the Islamic world indignant, and brought  under serious question the world body's credibility, he said.    "Public opinion in the Muslim, and in fact in the world at  large, has seriously taken the credibility of the U.N. system  into question and is urging the governments to take practical  steps in defending their brethren in Bosnia-Herzegovina," added  Kharrazi. "The Security Council is obliged to proclaim that the  arms embargo is inapplicable to the republic of Bosnia and  Herzegovina," he stated.    Criticizing the Council's Thursday draft resolution, which  had called for an immediate cease-fire agreement in B-H and  Gorazde as well as withdrawal of Serbian forces and their  weapons from the city, Kharrazi said the document "lacks a clear  threat" to the Serbs in the event of probable violation of the  undertakings under the present draft.    The resolution has fallen short of addressing the critical  situation of other declared safe areas as well as other parts of  B-H, added the Iranian representative noting that paragraph four  of the resolution was formulated in a such a way that it  "equates the victim and the aggressor." He said such practice of  the Council would only encourage the aggressors to continue  their genocide throughout B-H. Kharrazi referred to the draft's  call for the intensification of efforts to achieve peaceful  settlement by the U.N., European Union, the United States and  the Russian Federation and said that nothing would diminish the  responsibility of the U.N. and particularly the Security Council  in reversing the aggression committed by the Serbs.</p>

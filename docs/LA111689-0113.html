			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK AIRPORT NEIGHBORS RETAIN NOISE-SUIT RIGHTS  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council has agreed that residents living near the Burbank  Airport should be exempt from an ordinance that would have required them to  give up their rights to sue the airport over excessive noise if they received  public funds to soundproof their homes.  </P> <P> About 20 people from the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League staged a  demonstration outside Burbank City Hall before the City Council's regular  meeting Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "The city and airport have their tongues hanging out trying to take our rights  away because they're scared to death of being sued when they double the flights  at the airport," said Wally Berns, president of the neighborhood group.  </P> <P> The council later voted 4 to 1 to exempt the homeowners from the ordinance,  which will require developers of new motel, hotel and apartment buildings near  the airport to install sound insulation. Those developers also will be required  to give up their right to sue the airport for creating excessive noise before  being issued a building permit from the city.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert R. Bowne opposed the homeowner exemption, saying he feared that  the city was opening itself up to legal action by the airport.  </P> <P> Burbank Airport spokesman Victor Gill said the council's decision to exempt  homeowners might make it more difficult for the airport to obtain federal funds  to soundproof nearby homes and schools.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration recently awarded a $2.5-million grant to  the airport to soundproof Luther Burbank Junior High. The school insulation  project is part of the airport's long-range noise-relief program for the  surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> Gill said the FAA does not require that homeowners, who receive public funds to  insulate their homes, must give up their right to sue airports over excessive  noise. But he said because Burbank Airport is competing with 185 airports  across the country for federal funds, the FAA might look more favorably upon a  city that imposes some requirements on homeowners.  </P></p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Baker - not spooked by French films William Baker, just appointed as president of the Motion Picture Export Association of America, is more used to busting international crime syndicates than breaking down trade barriers, writes Jeremy Kahn. But the 54-year-old former FBI agent is confident his law enforcement experience will serve him well as the second-in-command of the US motion picture industry's vocal and powerful export lobby. Baker held increasingly important posts during his 26 years at the FBI, at one time overseeing a Dollars 750m budget and directing all of the agency's criminal investigations with the exception of counter- espionage. He also spent two years attempting to overhaul the public image of the CIA, oversaw the FBI's counter-terrorism operations during the Gulf War and received numerous distinguished service awards. Retiring from the FBI in 1991, Baker was hired by Jack Valenti, the president of the US Motion Picture Association - whose colourful antics earned him the nickname 'Happy Jack' - to head the anti-piracy division of its export lobby. Valenti, in his turn had checked him out: 'William Webster (former FBI and CIA chief) told me he was probably the finest executive he ever encountered.' Valenti credits Baker with 'totally reorganising' the anti-piracy division in the past three years and was therefore his 'first choice' when looking for a replacement for Myron Karlin, who steps down as president of the export association after nine years. Baker says his first goal will be 'addressing the post-Gatt environment in the EU' and obtaining 'a level playing field' for US films. At last year's Uruguay Round, members of the Gatt rejected US attempts to open French markets to more US films. 'I don't think (the Uruguay Round) closed any doors; it just failed to open the door solidly,' Baker says. 'We will work with every government within the EU to convince them to open their markets.' After Europe, Baker plans to turn to Asia, where video piracy and abuse of intellectual property rights are reported to be rampant.</p>

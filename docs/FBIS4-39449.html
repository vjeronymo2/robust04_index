			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev report: "Bill Clinton: Russia Is a Great </F> Power"]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton, in Europe to celebrate  the 50th anniversary of the landing of allied troops in  Normandy, is being subjected to a concentrated assault by  representatives of the mass media. They are taking the  opportunity to interview the head of the White House, to  ascertain his views on particular topical issues, and to make  them known to the public.    In one such interview which Clinton granted to French  television, he specially dwelt on relations with Russia and  declared that he was "very satisfied" with their development.  In this connection the President emphasized that Russia "really  is a great power." At the upcoming G-7 meeting in Italy, he  pointed out, Russia will take part at a "higher level than ever"  and will participate fully in the discussion of political  questions.    Touching on the problem of the Russian Federation Armed  Forces' participation in settling conflicts in the former Soviet  republics, Bill Clinton pointed out that "Russia can play a  leading role in resolving certain problems in that region." But  on condition, he remarked, that "the UN and other multilateral  forces participate" in this process. "Thus it is not a question  of restoring the empire. Great power -- yes; empire -- no," the  head of the White House concluded.</p>

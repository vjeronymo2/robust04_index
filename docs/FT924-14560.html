			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Indian brewer set to enter UK via Wiltshire takeover MR VIJAY Mallya, one of India's largest distillers and brewers, is set to attempt an assault on the UK drinks distribution market via a takeover of Wiltshire Brewery, the UK quoted drinks company. Shares in the ailing west of England brewery, which has struggled to make a profit from its Old Grumble, Stonehenge and Old Devil beers, were suspended yesterday on the London Stock Exchange. The takeover of Wiltshire will involve fresh equity via a share placing. There will also be a subscription of new shares from a 'major overseas brewing and spirits group' - believed to be Mr Mallya's family-controlled UB Group - and possibly an injection of pubs from what Wiltshire calls a 'major UK brewer'. Wiltshire said yesterday that details of the deal will be announced before October 16. The deal would bring together one of the UK's smallest brewers, chaired by Mr Graham Axford, a former managing director of corporate finance at James Capel, and Mr Mallya, the subcontinent's biggest force in the drinks market. UB imports and distributes Kingfisher beer to off-licences and Indian restaurants throughout the country. It also has a joint venture with Kent-based Shepherd Neame. In India, however, UB - formally United Breweries of India - has expanded beyond its brewing roots into a multinational conglomerate with interests in distilling, petrochemical and engineering. Mr Mallya is interested in using the Wiltshire vehicle to sell large volumes of white spirits such as rum, gin and vodka to UK pubs. In spite of winning a number of good beer awards, Wiltshire has been loss-making for most of the seven years since it was bought out of receivership in 1985. Shareholders have yet to see their company's annual report for the 14 months to November 1991, ostensibly the reason why the shares were suspended yesterday. Wiltshire went back to shareholders in 1991 - a year after joining the Unlisted Securities Market - to finance the acquisition of pubs from Bass soon after the government's beer orders triggered a sequence of pub swaps by the large brewers. Mr Mallya is likely to use the Wiltshire vehicle to develop a pub estate and further develop his distribution company for importing products from the group.</p>

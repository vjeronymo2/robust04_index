			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: MIM to shed Granges holding MIM, the Queensland-based metals group, has told Granges, the Vancouver-based gold and base metals mining group, that it plans to sell its 37 per cent holding for not less than CDollars 4 a share, writes Nikki Tait. At that price the sale would raise around CDollars 50m (USDollars 38m) for MIM which, the Australian company indicated yesterday, would mean a small capital loss. The Granges stake is currently carried on MIM's balance sheet at ADollars 61.8m. MIM shares eased 5 cents to ADollars 2.74 on the news.</p>

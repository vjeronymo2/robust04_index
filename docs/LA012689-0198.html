			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING GLORIOUS' DERBY CHANCES UNCERTAIN  </P> <P> The veterinarian for undefeated King Glorious said the 3-year-old colt will not  be ready to run in the Kentucky Derby, but the horse's trainer is not ruling  out the possibility.  </P> <P> After examining King Glorious at Golden Gate Fields Wednesday and looking at  his X-rays, veterinarian Jack Robbins said there is much improvement in the  colt's strained right knee, which he probably injured while winning the  Hollywood Futurity last December. However, Robbins said King Glorious should  not run in the Derby May 6.  </P> <P> "His knee is super and the progress is very encouraging," Robbins said. "But  the horse should have at least 30 more days of light training, and the Derby  will come up too quick to get him ready for a mile and a quarter. Go easy with  him now and he'll be ready for those midsummer races for 3-year- olds."  </P> <P> Jerry Hollendorfer, who trains King Glorious, would like to re-evaluate the  horse's condition after a month of walking and jogging, before deciding the  horse's chances. Hollendorfer is even hopeful of running King Glorious at the  Golden Gate Fields meeting, which is highlighted by the California Derby April  22.  </P> <P> "The X-rays showed a noticeable improvement in the problem area," Hollendorfer  said. "The horse has been doing great. There's no filling (swelling) in the  knee and it's been cold every day. Another month of the same thing he's been  doing should tell us more. We're taking the conservative approach. If he needs  extra time, we'll give it to him."  </P> <P> King Glorious won all 5 of his races as a 2-year-old and finished second to  Easy Goer in the voting for the country's top juvenile colt.  </P> <P> King Glorious ran erratically despite winning the Hollywood Futurity, then had  swelling in the knee after a workout Dec. 24. A fever last summer prevented him  from running in the Del Mar Futurity, and he didn't return to action until  mid-November, a week after the Breeders' Cup.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic People's Party, by Eszter Radai; place and not given:  "Service to the Nation -- Which Is the Real KDNP?"]    [Excerpts] With the approach of the elections, naturally  all the parties are trying to show off their virtues to their  prospective supporters. The Christian Democratic People's  [KDNP] Party, often described as having a minor role in the  coalition, is doing just this. Others call the Christian  Democrat leaders grey and public opinion polls predict  relatively few votes for the party. What are the views of  Chairman Laszlo Surjan, who has recently been more prominent in  public affairs, about all this and what are his actual plans?  Eszter Radai interviewed him.    [Radai] The KDNP has been a dark horse for political  analysts and the public for a long time. In the past, many  people thought that the party would have multiplied its  supporters by the end of the electoral cycle. However, this  prediction does not seem to be coming true. According to  opinion polls, the KDNP occupies one of the last two places  among the parliamentary parties just as it did before.    [Surjan] The KDNP treats the results of opinion polls with  care and caution. It does not ignore apparently unpleasant data  but we do not start to celebrate even when the results are good;  instead, we analyze them. In political speeches -- when one is  a little bit more outspoken -- I usually say that in 1990, 2  percent was predicted for us and we received 6.5 percent. If we  again triple the predicted amount then I will be satisfied.  [passage omitted]    [Radai] Of all the coalition parties, the KDNP has appeared  to be the "most suitable for coalition" up to now, it was an  acceptable partner for all the parties without exception, and it  was included in all coalition speculations. Now, it seems to be  you who are narrowing your options by saying that, in addition  to the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], you cannot imagine a  coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], either.    [Surjan] This formulation fits into the general tactics  whereby party leaders do not make final and irrevocable  statements; they only indicate their willingness for cooperation  or the lack of it. The KDNP indeed does not have any desire to  cooperate with the MSZP, and this is not being outlined with the  SZDSZ, either. Many people are saying that a forced coalition  might have to be formed in 1994. When the election results are  known, all the parties will have to examine their consciences  and they certainly must not forget about the governability of  the country. Therefore, we will have to ponder about what  consequences our participation or absence will have for the  country. Can we follow or accept the former Italian model with  governments changing every month? Is our economy already  operating so well that it can run the country without politics  mattering too much? Or is our situation quite different? In  the meantime, the electors have the right to know what I will  "bring upon them," what kind of government they are voting for  when voting for me. The party leaders are not in the position  to give clear answers to this. Therefore, they usually only  express their willingness for collaboration and, naturally,  rejections are expressed at various levels of leadership.  However, it has to be seen that the issue will not be decided  by them but, in the case of the KDNP, for example, a 50-member  body will decide when the election results are known with whom  and how we will negotiate.  <H5>  Coalition -- With Whom? </H5>   [Radai] Does this mean that you would not like to enter into  coalition with the SZDSZ but would not reject it either?    [Surjan] When talking about the KDNP's center party position  -- which is of course misunderstood by many people -- I usually  refer to the fact that human dignity and the freedom of personal  decision occupy a central place in the intellectual world of  Christian democrats. Therefore, these parties can also come to  an understanding with liberal parties; Germany is the best  example for this where a successful coalition on this basis has  been operating for years. However, the deep social commitment  of this line is also well known, so a Christian democratic type  party is also acceptable to social democrats, of which Austria  is a good example. Therefore, our party is open in principle.  On the other hand, we must not forget, either, that while all  the parties are having sharp debates before the elections, these  are actually artificial in terms of economic policy because  almost everyone wants the same. [passage omitted]    [Radai] In your view, which is the KDNP's real face? The  one represented by you, one of the leaders of European Christian  democracy, or the one shown by the Mikloses [Gaspar, Hasznos,  and Palos], those relentless justice makers and radicals, who  sometimes even flirt with the Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP]? And you also have so-called pragmatic people, who,  being local government politicians, have not yet acquired  national fame. A political analyst said that "the party  chairman has been able to hold together people attracted to the  radical right wing, followers of modern European Christian  democracy, and the socially deeply committed Christian  socialists." Which is the real KDNP?    [Surjan] I do not think that you mean this offensively but I  have to reject it. It actually contradicts the statements that  our opponents have been making for years, namely that this is a  grey party. The point is that here, as in all normal parties,  there is a constant movement, new colors are appearing, and if  this party still manages to present a united front then this  harmony is composed of diversity, rather than greyness.  [passage omitted]    [Radai] Can you see any tendencies in the fact that the  so-called radicals occupy prominent places on the KDNP's  national list while the pragmatic young people are pushed low  down, and only a few of the old and eminent politicians who are  attracted to modern European Christian democracy are on it, and  only then after a debate?    [Surjan] Nevertheless, of the older generation that you  mention, we have Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga in a prominent  position on the list, and Sandor Keresztes, too, so this  criticism is not justified. It is true that my idea and goal  was that the members of a potential Christian Democratic  government should be at the top of the list. However, the  majority of the National Committee did not agree with this and I  was in a minority at the voting.  <H5>  Tactics -- How? </H5>   [Radai] I have also heard views from certain Christian  Democratic politicians that the prominent position of the  radicals on the list is part of your election tactics. Through  them -- they hope -- many votes can be gained from the extreme  right in the second round of the elections.    [Surjan] I am not sure if election tactics can be the  subject of interviews. A party that is able to gain voters from  the extreme parties, therefore, is able to draw an uncertain  section of society from the extreme to the center, and, I  believe, is doing a service to the nation.</p>

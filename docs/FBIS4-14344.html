			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- The leader's  representative for Afghan affairs, Hojjat ol-Eslam Ebrahimi,  here Tuesday called on Afghan ulema to strive for ending the  civil war in their country.    Ebrahimi, who made the plea in a meeting with head of  coordination council for northern Afghanistan and General  Abdul-Rashid Dostam's special envoy Sirat Taleqani, said Afghan  ulema can play an important role in improving current situation  in Afghanistan and bringing unity to the feuding Afghan groups.    "If they (Afghan ulema) fulfil their mission, clashes will  end," reiterated the Iranian official.    He said the clashes in Afghanistan have no result except the  massacre of civilians. Unity and cohesion among all groups to  elect just one leader or leadership council can put an end to  the ongoing animosities, he added.    Ebrahimi voiced the Iranian nation and leadership's sympathy  with the situation of world Muslim, especially the Afghan people.    Taleqani, who carried Dostam's written message to leader of  the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, thanked  Iran for its humanitarian relief supplies to the Afghan people.    The message expressed gratitude for Ayatollah Khamene'i's  sympathies for the Afghan people, and called for continuation of  Iran's assistance to the Afghan Muslims.</p>

Information from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) showed  that the retail sales of consumer goods last year was 1,223.7  billion yuan, up 26.1 percent (or a real growth of 11.6 percent  if increase in price is excluded).    Of this total, sales in urban markets were 717.6 billion  yuan, up 31.2 percent, while sales in rural areas were 506.1  billion yuan, up 19.5 percent.    Analyzing by categories of consumer goods, it was found that  there were ups and downs among different food items. Among  clothing items, the sales of cotton cloth remained unchanged  from the previous year, the sales of garments went up 16.1  percent, while sales of woolen piecegoods and silk and satin  textiles went down.    Growth by various margins was scored in the sale of all  durable consumer goods, except for electric fans,  black-and-white TV sets and bicycles.    The total purchase of means of production by materials  supply  and marketing departments at and above the county level was  742.3 billion yuan in 1993, up 34.6 percent, while their sales  were 779.6 billion yuan, up 32.3 percent.    However, the sales of means of agricultural production  suffered a fall of 7.8 percent if change in price is excluded.    In 1993, the government strengthened price reform through a  series of policies, including freeing the producer's prices for  most rolled steel products, cement and coal of state-owned coal  mines, raising the prices of crude oil, electricity and railway  freight transportation, and further freeing the purchasing and  selling prices of grain.    The SSB said that these policies played an important role in  adjusting the relatively low prices of basic products and  infrastructural facilities and in promoting the establishment of  the market mechanism.    However, the overall increase in market prices was rather  high, particularly in large and medium cities, and the momentum  of increase in the prices of services remained strong.</p>

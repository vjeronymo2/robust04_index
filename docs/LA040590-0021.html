			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DISTRICT DECLARES WAR ON WATER WASTE  </P> <P> The board of Ventura County's largest water district declared war on the waste  of the precious liquid Wednesday as the area enters its fourth year of drought.  </P> <P> "We must save, save, save," said James A. Hubert, engineer-manager of the  Calleguas Municipal Water District.  </P> <P> Although current supplies will meet this year's needs, Hubert said, a  continuing drought could cause a shortage of 3,000 to 4,000 acre-feet of water.  </P> <P> Hubert said most home water waste comes from toilets, showers, watering lawns  and washing cars.  </P> <P> Calleguas directors voted to declare May "Water Awareness Month" and two weeks  ago endorsed a call by the district's supplier, the Metropolitan Water  District, for increased conservation efforts.  </P> <P> Information on saving water is available from the Ventura County Water  Conservation Office, (805) 654-2471 or 654-2440.

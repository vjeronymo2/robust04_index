			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Pace of NHS reforms to stay THE PACE of change in the National Health Service will be maintained, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, told nurses yesterday. Mrs Bottomley, making her first speech as secretary of state, was addressing the annual congress of the Royal College of Nursing. She said she shared the view of many NHS staff that what the service needed was a period of continuity and stability. However, dispelling nurses' hopes that there might be a slowdown in the pace of reforms, she said: 'My job is to see that the momentum of the reforms which my predecessors Ken Clarke and William Waldegrave have set in place is maintained.' In a wide-ranging speech Mrs Bottomley urged everyone in the NHS to work together for the best health service possible. She said: 'We may differ in approach or political views, but we share at least two unequivocal commitments: commitment to the best health care possible for our people and commitment to the NHS.' Mrs Bottomley announced a review of mental health nursing, which will examine the way psychiatric care is delivered. She also announced a review of community nursing services and claimed that nursing and midwifery research would be given a higher profile. A report launched at the congress showed that more than 100 nurses had complained about standards of patient care to a confidential 'whistle blower' service.</p>

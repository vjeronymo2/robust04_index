			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Pirelli raises interest in Continental PIRELLI, the financially-strapped Italian tyres and cables group, now holds shares and options for around 39 per cent of the capital of Continental, the German tyres concern it tried to buy last year. In a letter to shareholders sent ahead of a meeting to be held on January 20 to approve a L518.6bn rights issue, the company reveals it has spent over L127bn (Dollars 106m) to buy options on 32 per cent of Continental's shares. The shares, pulled together by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank which is Pirelli's main adviser, stem from the holdings owned by Pirelli's allies in the attempted takeover. Pirelli has also negotiated an option to buy the 2 per cent Continental stake held by Fiat, which was not believed to have been directly involved in the takeover attempt. A further 5 per cent of Continental's stock is owned by Pirelli Tyre Holdings (PTH), the group's Netherlands-based subsidiary. Pirelli's poor financial health makes any resumption of the Continental bid highly unlikely in the short term. However, the options will give Pirelli much greater flexibility over the timing of any sale of its Continental stock, or even of a renewed bid. Under the terms arranged with Mediobanca, Pirelli has paid a premium of DM60 (Dollars 37.90) a share for the option to acquire, in whole or in fractions, the Continental shares at any time over the next five years. Together, capital losses on PTH's own Continental shares, legal costs and acquisition of the options account for around L340bn of Pirelli's estimated L590bn loss for 1991. A further L240bn stems from restructuring costs in the tyres and cables divisions, while operating losses account for L110bn. Pirelli is taking a number of initiatives to shore up its finances, which have suffered from over-ambitious expansion as well as the Continental bid. Apart from the rights issue, L1,500bn will be raised from loans arranged by Mediobanca and Credito Italiano. A further L1,000bn should accrue from the sale of Pirelli's diversified products division. Diversified products is the third of Pirelli's operating divisions, with 1991 sales of around L1,700bn. It includes activities in industrial and automotive components, shoes and clothing. Pirelli expects the disposals, which will be of the seven independent business units forming the division, rather than individual companies, should be completed within the next 19 months. Ironically, Continental, which, like Pirelli, is active in industrial and vehicle components, has already expressed interest in some of the businesses for sale. Shares in Pirelli SpA, the most widely traded of the group's quoted operations, fell slightly to L1,045 in Milan yesterday. With new shares in Pirelli's one-for-two rights issue being priced at L1,000 each, some analysts doubt the issue will be well received by private investors. However, Societe Internationale Pirelli, the Swiss-based company which owns a majority of the shares, will be taking up its full quota, while the rest will be underwritten by a Mediobanca-led consortium.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Take the trade deal on the table Sir, Your leader, 'Trade talks' (November 25), rightly underlines the urgency of resolving the outstanding issues in the Uruguay Round before the December 15 deadline and goes on to deplore the new problems which the US is introducing at this late stage. But, characteristically, you left out one area which is of great importance for the European services sector. Throughout the Round, the UK has pressed for an outcome which would advance the interests of service providers in the UK and the rest of Europe. We would not pretend that this aim has yet been fully met. The commitments of many of our trading partners could certainly be bettered. But the Uruguay Round is more a staging post than a final destination. A worthwhile initial package of commitments certainly is now within reach and there is a framework of clear, internationally-accepted rules as a basis for more liberalisation in the future. Some of our partners fail to recognise this, and still seek a perfect outcome in their particular sector, at the risk of losing the benefits of the whole. This is short-sighted and illusory. Surely the world's economic leaders must now secure the gains already within sight by pushing the Round to a successful conclusion. What is on the table is worth having and we must not lose it. The alternative is a return to the protectionist tit-for-tat of the 1930s which, even without the world's present state of instability, would not bear contemplation. To argue the services case in terms of a glass half full or half empty is to miss the point. The point for services is that for the first time there is now a glass on the table that will hold water for the future. Let's for goodness sake pick it up.

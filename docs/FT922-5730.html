			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Easter Term cases DENNEY v JOHN HUDSON &amp; CO LTD (FT, May 8) In the instant case, the creditor made deliveries of diesel oil to the company both before and after the petition for compulsory winding up. The liquidator sought a declaration that payments for the deliveries were void under section 552 of the Companies Act 1985 and section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1985 which provided that '. . . any disposition of the company's property . . . made after the commencement of the winding-up, unless the court otherwise orders, is void'. Dismissing the liquidator's appeal from a decision that the payments made after presentation of the petition were valid, the Court of Appeal stated that the parties were acting in accordance with their normal and established course of business. Under its standing arrangement, the company received a benefit in that it could order a supply of fuel oil for which payment was deferred until the next supply was required. The supplies enabled the business to be carried on and earn revenue and the court could reasonably assume that what was for the benefit of the company would be for the benefit of the general body of creditors. Thus it was not a situation in which one pre-liquidation creditor was being preferred to the others. FREEDMAN &amp; OTHERS v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER; CHURCH COMMISSIONERS FOR ENGLAND v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER (FT, May 13) Some 125 acres of derelict land north of King's Cross Station, which were to form the terminus of the Channel tunnel rail link and a large commercial development, had been compulsorily acquired pursuant to the Great Northern Railway Act 1846. The act empowered the company of that name to build the railway between London and York and the land had since passed into ownership of the defendants, British Railways Board and National Carriers Ltd. On a preliminary issue, it was held that the successors from whom the land had been compulsorily acquired could buy back some of it at the original acquisition prices and that acts passed in 1923, 1935 and 1949 had not repealed the relevant sections of the 1846 act. Allowing the defendants' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that section 59 of the British Transport Commission Act 1949 expressly had repealed those sections. A 'code' of provisions had been incorporated into the 1846 act and the purpose of section 59(1) was to cancel the effect of the code and other provisions to the same effect. BACHCHAN v INDIA ABROAD PUBLICATIONS INC (FT, May 14) The plaintiff was successful in a libel action and obtained judgment for damages in London against a journal, India Abroad, for an edition which had been printed and distributed in the UK by a subsidiary. He sought to enforce the judgment in New York where India Abroad had also published the libel. However, giving judgment for the defendant in New York, the judge stated that the protection of free speech and the press would be seriously jeopardised by entry of foreign libel judgments, granted pursuant to standards deemed appropriate in the UK, but considered antithetical to the protection afforded to the press by the US Constitution. LEWIS &amp; PEAT (PRODUCE) LTD AND OTHERS v ALMATU PROPERTIES LTD AND OTHERS (FT, May 15) Lewis &amp; Peat obtained judgment against three defendants and sought to execute that judgment. Its attempts resulted in court orders which included a garnishee order nisi against Midland, and injunctions restraining Midland from dealing with the proceeds of sale of two cargoes of cocoa and coffee beans after collection of the sale proceeds by Midland. Mr Justice Gatehouse set aside the garnishee proceedings and discharged the injunctions against Midland, declaring that Midland was free to deal with the proceeds of sale in accordance with the instructions of its customer, the National Development Bank of Sierra Leone (NDB); and that NDB was free to give such instructions as it might see fit, including instructions to transfer the monies out of the jurisdiction. Lewis &amp; Peat sought to set aside discharge of the injunctions, and the declaration. Dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that it was of the first importance that routine banking transactions such as these should not be subject to interference by the Mareva jurisdiction, except where an exceptionally strong case had been made out to set aside well-settled principles of banking law. LAWSON (HM INSPECTOR OF TAXES) v JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC (FT, May 20) Johnson Matthey owned all the shares in Johnson Matthey Bankers (JMB) which became unable to pay its debts. It was realised that if JMB could not open for business, Johnson Matthey itself could not continue to trade. It therefore agreed to sell the JMB shares to the Bank of England for Pounds 1 and to contribute Pounds 50m to JMB's resources. It now sought to deduct that sum in the computation of its profits as a revenue and not as a capital expenditure under section 74 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that the Pounds 50m was paid to get rid of the shares and so was a capital expenditure. Allowing Johnson Matthey's appeal, the House of Lords stated that, in the light of the authorities, if the Pounds 50m was paid to procure the transfer of shares, it was attributable to capital whereas if paid to remove the threat posed by JMB's insolvency, it was attributable to revenue. The Pounds 50m had been paid solely to enable Johnson Matthey to be able to continue in business and was not paid to persuade the Bank to take the shares, which were fully paid up and worthless. KHERSON (FT, May 21) The vessel, Kerch, which was owned by a Georgian state company, carried a cargo of oil to Rotterdam, and the cargo-owners claimed damages for breach of contract. The cargo-owners sought to arrest Kerch in Rotterdam in October 1990 when security was not forthcoming. In March 1992, a sister ship, Kherson, was arrested at Felixstowe and the shipowners acknowledged service of the writ so that the action ceased to be in rem against the ship and now proceeded in personam against its owners. Article 21 of the 1968 Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments provided that where proceedings, involving the same cause of action between the same parties, were brought in different contracting states, only the court that was first seised should have jurisdiction. The cargo-owners contended that Article 21 was inapplicable because it was a different cause of action being in rem and not in personam, which also entailed different parties. Declining jurisdiction, Mr Justice Sheen stated the only differences lay in the remedies available to a successful plaintiff and the procedure to obtain those remedies. In the instant case, Article 21 applied as the Rotterdam action and the action before him involved the same cause of action and the same parties. HAMED EL CHIATY &amp; CO v THOMAS COOK GROUP LTD (FT, May 22) Claims were brought against Thomas Cook by the plaintiff, an Egyptian tourist company, under agreement for charter for a vessel on package tours on the Nile. The written contract had provided that the agreement would be governed by Egyptian law but was silent as to jurisdiction. Thomas Cook contended that the contracts were intended to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts. Staying the actions in the UK, Mr Justice Hirst stated that Thomas Cook was entitled to rely on the principle in El Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 119 that the court would generally enforce an agreement on a rectification order where there was convincing proof that there had been a prior agreement that was still effective when the instrument was executed and that by mistake the instrument had failed to carry it out. Moreover, in applying the test of which country was the natural forum, the evidence as a whole pointed overwhelmingly in favour of Egypt since the actions had their most real and substantial connection there.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Closure of Turkish border curbs flow of aid to refugees TURKEY closed its main border route into Iraq for more than three hours yesterday, cutting the overland flow of allied relief to Kurdish refugees in the region, US military officials confirmed. The reduction in the flow of aid came as hundreds of Iraqi troops withdrew from northern Iraq, fleeing an expanded allied security zone established to protect thousands of returning Kurds. Closure of the border followed Turkey's decision to expel a British reporter whom it accused of 'biased' reporting. The article by Mr Robert Fisk, correspondent of The Independent, alleged that Turkish troops were stealing supplies. In Ankara, Mr Morton Abramowitz, US ambassador to Turkey, sought to play down the border closure. He said the problem was caused by Turkish construction workers, due to enter northern Iraq to work on setting up allied refugee camps. They arrived without proper documentation, he said. The incidents came after a rise in tension between Turkey and the allied forces working to move hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish refugees back to their homes. This appears to reflect anger felt by Turkey's military over its loss of control of operations in its own territory. In Brussels, the EC and the British government announced they were to co-finance 20 'mobile support teams' to help Kurdish refugees. Volunteers from the UK's fire and ambulance services, hospitals and Territorial Army, are to be deployed for three months, financed by Ecu2m (Pounds 1.39m) from Brussels and Ecu0.9m from London. In New York, the UN took the first formal step to obtain payment of compensation by Iraq under the ceasefire terms, creating a special fund to be financed from the country's oil revenues. But in a report to the Security Council, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary general, acknowledged that ensuring financing for this compensation fund would be among the most technical and difficult tasks to be undertaken by its proposed commission of experts. Meanwhile, the Security Council's sanctions committee ruled yesterday that individual governments could unfreeze Iraqi assets, if they wished, to enable Baghdad to buy food. But it withheld a decision on an earlier Iraqi request to to sell nearly Dollars 1bn of oil. The UN ruling is unlikely to make any immediate impact. None of the major players are expected to unfreeze Iraqi assets in the near future. The Security Council gave no immediate reaction to an Iraqi request yesterday to delay its war reparation payments for at least five years. Iran swamped by over 1m Iraqi refugees, said yesterday foreign countries had sent just six tonnes of food - five grammes per refugee - in response to its appeals for help.  Some of the food was rotten and had to be destroyed. Iran was compiling a list of countries who had sent such aid, for which the world should be ashamed.</p>

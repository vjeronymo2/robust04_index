			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE GULF: HOW IT ALL STARTED  </P> <P> Late July: George Steinbrenner is still running the Yankees, the governor of  Louisiana is deciding whether to veto an abortion bill and the American press  seems bent on finding out just what David Souter, nominee for the Supreme  Court, thinks about abortion.  </P> <P>  Few Americans pay much attention to the quarrel between Iraq and its little  neighbor, Kuwait. It seemed like just another of those wrangles over oil  pricing that occur before the meetings of OPEC sheiks and statesmen.  </P> <P>  But the rumblings were to suddenly put the United States on war footing in the  searing Saudi desert. Here's how it happened:  </P> <P>  July 17: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, facing an oil glut and declining  revenues, takes aim at Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which had been  exceeding OPEC oil production quotas by more than a million barrels a day.  Hussein demands that the two nations pay $14 billion to compensate for what he  says Iraq lost due to low oil prices. And he tells Kuwait that it must forgive  $15 billion in loans extended during the Iran-Iraq War.  </P> <P> July 18: Hussein's foreign minister accuses Kuwait of having stolen $2.4  billion worth of Iraqi petroleum over the past decade. Kuwait puts its  20,000-man army on alert.  </P> <P> July 19: Kuwait cancels its state of alert. "It was all a summer cloud that has  been blown away," says an unidentified Kuwaiti source who turns out to be  monumentally wrong.  </P> <P> July 23: Reports say that Iraq has massed 30,000 troops at its border and that  U.S. warships in the gulf have been put on alert.  </P> <P> July 24: Kuwait reinstates its alert. The Pentagon announces naval exercises in  the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> July 27: At a tense meeting in Geneva, OPEC agrees to limit oil production and  raise its target price by $3 to $21 a barrel. Kuwait and the Emirates promise  to abide by the new production quotas.  </P> <P> In Washington, the House and Senate defy Bush Administration opposition and  vote for economic sanctions against Iraq. These reflect an accumulation of  complaints over Iraq's attempt to intimidate neighbors, its human rights  record, its use of poison gas and its drive to build nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> Aug. 1: Delegations from Iraq and Kuwait meet in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to  discuss their differences. The Iraqis walk out, saying they did not sense "any  seriousness" from the Kuwaitis.  </P> <P> Aug. 2: A massive Iraqi invasion force crosses into Kuwait, expelling the  government and taking control of the oil-rich state. The action ultimately  leads to the largest U.S. military dispatch since the Vietnam War.  </P></p>

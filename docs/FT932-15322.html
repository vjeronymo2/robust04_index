So Observer has no hesitation in recycling the following quip from yesterday's Daily Mail. Pub customer: 'I'd like half a pint of your best bitter in a pint glass, topped up with a dash of Dom Perignon, three shots of Jack Daniels, two shots of vodka and a couple of cherries.' Without raising a well-trained eyebrow the barman mixed the drink and watched the concoction go down in one. 'I shouldn't have had that with what I've got,' gasped the customer. 'And what have you got sir?' asked the alarmed barman. 'Thirty seven pence,' replied the bounder.</p>

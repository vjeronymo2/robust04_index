			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Greek telecoms group ahead INTRACOM, the Greek telecommunications equipment manufacturer in which Ericsson of Sweden holds a 12 per cent stake, increased net earnings by 4.4 per cent to Dr6.6bn (Dollars 30m) for 1992 after delays in signing contracts held up production. Sales rose by 11.2 per cent to Dr33.8bn. They were led by the company's expansion into eastern Europe with the launch of a computerised lottery game in Russia. Exports amounted to 16 per cent of sales in 1992, compared with 7 per cent in the previous year. Olympic Lotto, a Dollars 15m joint venture between Intracom and the Russian Olympic Committee, uses hardware and software designed in Greece. Intracom has also signed contracts with the governments of Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Moldavia to set up similar lottery games. The company also exports specialised software, both for Ericsson's digital switching systems and the GSM mobile telephone system, as well as equipment for IBM personal computers manufactured in Europe. The company forecasts that turnover will rise to Dr69bn this year following the award of a Dr50bn contract to modernise the Athens telephone network after several months' delay. The turnkey project for OTE, the state-owned telecommunications operator, will be partly funded by the European Community. Intracom is also participating in one of two international consortia setting up competitive mobile telephone networks in Greece. Both networks are due to start operating later this year. The company projects that investment this year will reach Dr7.5bn, focusing on further automation and improving quality control.</p>

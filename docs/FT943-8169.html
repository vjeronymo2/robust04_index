			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Strong growth at Wesfarmers Wesfarmers, the Australian fertiliser, chemicals and coal group, yesterday reported a 88.7 per cent increase in profit after tax to ADollars 139.5m (USDollars 102.6m) for the year ended June. Sales, which rose 34 per cent to ADollars 2.3bn, were lifted mainly by the company's rural trading operations and its fertiliser and building products units. The overall improvement in Australian agriculture and a large contribution from Dalgety Farmers more than doubled the rural trading division's revenue and contributed strongly to group profits. The company forecast further growth in earnings as its expansion activities and acquisition of businesses start to pay off. It said it would spend about ADollars 200m on new capital projects. The company's performance has lifted its earnings per share by 83 per cent to 71.6 cents.</p>

Chihana, who is on a two-day private visit to Zambia, told  reporters in Lusaka on Wednesday [9 February] that at no time  did he say he would seek the re-definition of the border between  Zambia and Malawi. "It should now go on record that I have  never and will never make such demands unless I am mad", he said.    He attributed what he called, the misleading reports to the  Malawian Government and fellow opponents who, he said, had  teamed up to malign him before the Zambian Government.    "Zambians are our brothers and sisters and I should assure  you that my intentions are that when the need arises, Malawians  and Zambians should meet to consider breaking the border so that  the two peoples could mix freely. We are one and the same  people,"Chihana said.</p>

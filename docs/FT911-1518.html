			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Week ahead BRITISH Petroleum is ex-pected on Thursday to announce a loss of around Pounds 50m for the first quarter compared with a profit of Pounds 344m for the comparable period on the historic cost basis. If changes in the value of oil stocks are stripped out, the accounting method favoured by the group, the company is expected to show a small increase in profits of around Pounds 35m. The first quarter's stock losses are expected to be as much as Pounds 425m, compared with Pounds 70m last year. After losing out to Otto Versand in the bidding war for Next's Grattan mail order business, Sears, the retailing conglomerate, has been left looking rather forlorn. That impression may be strengthened when the company announces its full-year results on Thursday showing pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m, a severe reversal on the Pounds 231.4m it achieved the year before. Other large companies reporting next week include Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish packaging group, on Tuesday; and on Wednesday SmithKline Beecham, the drugs maker, and Trafalgar House, the construction, shipping and hotels group. Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sweeteners group which is trying to take over Bundaberg Sugar of Australia, should report pre-tax interim profits on Wednesday of Pounds 92.5m compared with Pounds 87.5m last year.</p>

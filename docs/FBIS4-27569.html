			<p>BFN     [Text] The government is reportedly pushing for a United  Nations resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea right  after holding consultations with the United States and others in  case North Korea has removed the possibility for future  measurements by continuing to replace fuel rods.    Kim Sam-hun, nuclear ambassador, who left the country on 2  June to have a three-day policy consultations between the ROK,  the United States, and Japan in Washington, pointed out that  warning measures have sufficiently been taken up until now. He  added that the government's position is that it is now  inevitable to take measures related to the imposition of  sanctions against the North.    Since our government, the United States, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency have so far made many efforts  for dialogue, Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said, it will also be  difficult for China to offer opposition if a resolution for  sanctions is discussed at the United Nations.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Bosnia negotiators count considerable achievements: Robert Mauthner talks to Lord Owen about the peace process LORD Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the ring-masters of the international conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina, have lost a battle, but they are convinced that they have not yet lost the peace. After five months of some of the most intensive negotiations in recent diplomatic history, they have been obliged to send back their proposed peace package to the United Nations Security Council in the hope that its endorsement by the world body will finally bring the warring parties in Bosnia to their senses. Though clearly disappointed that they were not able to wrap up an overall agreement in Geneva, the mediators have nothing to be ashamed of. They managed, almost miraculously, to persuade the bitter Bosnian adversaries to sit round the same negotiating table for four weeks and reach at least a partial accord on a constitutional framework. The pace of the negotiations has been relentless. During the short intervals between sessions, Mr Vance and Lord Owen have travelled ceaselessly between Geneva, Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo, to lay the groundwork for an agreement. 'I think I have never worked so hard,' Lord Owen said in an interview. 'The foreign secretary is a tough job and so is being a junior hospital doctor (Lord Owen has been both at some stage in his life). But we have worked incredible hours and travelled a long way. It's cost me one slipped disc,' he said wryly. Many people have been surprised by the close partnership between these two men of different generations and with such dissimilar temperaments. But Lord Owen has a simple explanation. 'We have been very close friends ever since we were foreign ministers together (in the late 1970s). I think I can fairly say it was one of the closest British-American relationships in foreign affairs that there has ever been. 'The whole Anglo-American Rhodesian plan, which laid the foundations for Zimbabwe's independence, was done between us. We used to travel and give press conferences together in Africa. So the act that you see here actually has a past history.' Even so, how were clashes avoided between the often abrasive and irritable David Owen and the outwardly gentle, but inwardly tough Cyrus Vance? 'I think most people are amazed by the chemistry,' says Lord Owen. 'I don't know why the chemistry works, but I can only say that, from my part, it's just deep, profound respect.' Indeed, David Owen clearly regards 'Cy' as the senior partner, which doesn't prevent him from sometimes upstaging him in public. It was Mr Vance who first proposed Lord Owen as the European Community's representative in the mediation partnership, after it became clear that Lord Carrington was anxious to give up the job. And it was Mr Vance who has been the conference's chief disciplinarian. 'In August last year we agreed that we would give it six months,' Lord Owen says. 'It was Cy's concept that you had to come to Geneva, that you had to stay here and live, breathe, dream and eat the problem, and that people had to be flowing in and out of your office all hours of the day and night. And that you had to be near enough to go in and out of Yugoslavia and that we had to be in continuous session.' It was also Mr Vance, according to Lord Owen, who insisted that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia should be closely associated with the negotiations, a move which brought quick results when Mr Milosevic put pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to accept the mediators' constitutional principles for Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Having negotiated the ceasefire (of January 1992) in Croatia with Milosevic, Cy Vance has always been clear that we must never ostracise him,' Lord Owen says. 'We never did. Cy's relationship with him is a very important one. There is trust there, at a level of man for man.' Lord Owen, too, has considerable respect for Mr Milosevic's capacities, though clearly not for his past policies. 'Extremely well-informed,' 'a politician to his finger tips,' 'able to grasp every single nuance' of a problem, are among the phrases he uses to describe the Serbian leader. However, it was not until Mr Milosevic won the recent Serbian presidential election that he was prepared to put his weight behind a Bosnian settlement. 'He now has a real power base,' Lord Owen says. 'He is now prepared to take on the hard right, he is prepared to deal with the issue (Bosnia) and he is heading towards leading Serbia back into the European family. I have no doubt of that.' 'He has made grievous mistakes and I think he has understood that, like a lot of the intelligentsia who went down the nationalist, greater-Serbian route. 'They won't change their philosophy that the Serb people must be protected wherever they are. But they have understood the fact that they cannot do this by force of arms. Serbia and Montenegro have also understood, I think, that they have the capacity to be very powerful players in this part of Europe and that, as the pariahs of Europe, they have no chance of achieving this.' Though clearly worried about the adverse effect that an escalation of the fighting between Croats and Serbs in Krajina may have on the peace process, Lord Owen continues to look on the bright side of things. 'The fighting has had a double effect. I think the fact that the Security Council passed a resolution critical of Croatia has actually helped to give the Serbians confidence that the Security Council is not packed completely against them, as they had previously thought.' Lord Owen still believes that, if the right sort of pressure is exerted by the Security Council, the warring Bosnian factions can be persuaded to reach an agreement in New York. But he is sharply critical of any suggestions, on the lines of those mooted by some members of US President Bill Clinton's entourage, that the embargo on arms exports to the Bosnian Moslems should be lifted. Pointing out that the arms embargo applies to all the warring factions of the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen says that, if you lift it for one side, you would also be lifting it for everybody else, 'pouring fuel on the flames'. 'I personally think that, if we were to lift the arms embargo, people wouldn't stay involved in the UN humanitarian effort.' His credo as a mediator is unambiguous. 'I haven't ceased for one moment my indignation and anger about ethnic cleansing. But it's no use getting onto your high horse and saying you won't talk to this or that person because they are branded as war criminals. You have to be objective and fair-minded and genuinely seek a negotiated settlement and leave the moral judgments to others. 'But in your own mind, there must be a determination that what has happened in the former Yugoslavia must be reversed, an absolute belief that we are not going to have the Moslems treated like the Jews once were in Europe and that we must acknowledge that this is a wrong that has got to be righted.'</p>

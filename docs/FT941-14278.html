			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Algerian offer 'not enough' The exiled spokesman for Algeria's outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) said yesterday the release of hundreds of Moslem fundamentalist prisoners was not enough to justify opening a dialogue with the government, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We are happy at the release of some of our brothers but that is not sufficient. We must have the release of all political prisoners, first and foremost our leaders,' Mr Rabah Kebir said.</p>

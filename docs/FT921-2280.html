			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Attention switches to the yen THE DOLLAR ended little changed against the D-Mark, and appeared to be entering a consolidating phase, as dealers switched their attention to the yen, writes Neil Buckley. Demand for the Japanese currency dominated trading. Dealers said this could be no more than a desire to realise profits on short yen positions. It may also have been a response to plans announced by the Japanese economic planning agency for an emergency economic recovery package, which might remove the need for further interest rate cuts beyond the one the market is already expecting. A Japanese news agency said the Bank of Japan was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting shortly to decide on a discount rate cut, which could be as large as 75 basis points. Such a cut has been discounted by the market, and the report had little effect. The lack of dollar buying after encouraging US housing starts figures on Tuesday made some dealers believe it has entered a corrective stage. The US currency closed at Y132.05/15, down from a Y133.15/25 start and a Y133.38/43 Asian close. Against the D-Mark, it was down to DM1.6500/05, from DM1.6535/45 and DM1.6529/34. In New York the dollar picked up to finish at DM1.6532 and Y132.32. Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said: 'The US economy has now turned, production is picking up, housing activity is up, but the market has already priced in the recovery. That means we may see no new highs for a while.' He added that he expected to see the dollar consolidating for a week or two, before rising towards DM1.70. President FW de Klerk's resounding victory in the South African referendum on political reform gave a very strong boost to the financial rand, which closed against the dollar at R3.7280, from a previous close of R3.9610. Dealers said the result would increase foreign investors' confidence in South Africa, and predicted further near-term gains for the rand. The D-Mark was mixed against the EMS currencies, as the markets shrugged off faint rumours that the Bundesbank might raise interest rates today, arising partly from the news that Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, was to attend its council meeting. In spite of one rumour that the reason for this was that Mr Kohl wanted to dissuade the bank from a rate increase, most dealers felt such a rise was extremely unlikely. The D-Mark was stronger against sterling, which ended at DM2.8550/57, down from Tuesday's DM2.8610/15. The pound fell at the opening after two opinion polls gave the opposition Labour party a five-point lead over the Conservatives in the UK general election race, but remained around its effective ERM floor, with some buying interest at that level keeping it underpinned. Sterling weakened to Dollars 1.7290 from a previous Dollars 1.7340. In New York it ended at Dollars 1.7280.</p>

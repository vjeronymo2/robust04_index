			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TURN IN THE QUEST FOR CONSUMER RELIEF;  </P> <P> INSURANCE COMMISSIONER: NOMINATIONS OF GARAMENDI AND BANNISTER MAY REFLECT  CHANGE IN EMPHASIS TOWARD REDUCING COMPANY COSTS AS A WAY TO CUT HIGH COST OF  COVERAGE.  </P> <P> The nominations of Democratic state Sen. John Garamendi and Republican  insurance agent Wes Bannister in the race to become California's first elected  insurance commissioner apparently represent a turn in the search for lower  insurance premiums toward proposals to fund price cuts by reducing the  companies' claims and legal costs.  </P> <P> Both Garamendi and Bannister, in looking forward to what is expected to be a  low-key general election campaign, spoke Wednesday of the importance of  reducing costs to the companies as a vital prerequisite to bringing down  California insurance prices.  </P> <P> That represented a distinct change in emphasis from the talk about simply  rolling back companies' prices that marked the losing campaigns of Democrats  Bill Press and Conway Collis and had been the rhetoric of the backers of  Proposition 103 for the last two years.  </P> <P> Garamendi declared Wednesday that Proposition 103 "needs to be rewritten" and  he said that as commissioner he would establish a strong lobbying office in  Sacramento to push new legislation to do that.  </P> <P> Bannister said that in the campaign "we have to talk about reduction of  premiums through no-fault insurance and through reduction of fraud."  </P> <P> Garamendi vowed to make the commissioner's office the nation's best consumer  protection agency, and remarked of Bannister, "I don't think the people of  California are about to elect an insurance agent to watch over the insurance  industry." But the general tone of his and Bannister's remarks cheered insurers  Wednesday and concerned their rivals, the trial lawyers. Often, when cutting  costs to the companies is mentioned as a means of bringing about lower rates,  legal reform, cutting back on claimants' right to sue and the lawyers' income  are mentioned in the next breath.  </P> <P> Such insurers as Pete Ingham, general counsel for State Farm, Wednesday lauded  the California election returns, both in the governor's race, where Democratic  nominee Dianne Feinstein spoke Tuesday night of cutting claims costs, and the  insurance commissioner's contest as representing a new attitude in California  toward reform.  </P> <P> But Gary Gwilliam, a former president of the California Trial Lawyers Assn.,  said the results were a shame and came about only because of divisions in the  consumer movement that saw such consumer or lawyer-oriented candidates as Bill  Press, Conway Collis and Walter Zelman split the vote against the candidates  more favorable to company views.  </P> <P> Gwilliam said that fielding a single candidate in the future should be a top  priority.  </P> <P> Press, who ran second for the Democratic nomination, losing to Garamendi by  about 175,000 votes, said Wednesday: "Somebody told me this morning it was like  Beirut. We were killing our own." He noted that by adding Zelman's 189,000  votes to his own 638,000, he would have defeated Garamendi.  </P> <P> Garamendi takes issue with any assessment that he would be the insurers'  commissioner. He said after the election that he wants to meet with all  factions in the insurance crisis, including Harvey Rosenfield, author of  Proposition 103, to hear their ideas.  </P> <P> But Rosenfield was smarting Wednesday from the size of the defeat suffered by  the candidate he backed for the Democratic nomination, Collis, and he appeared  in no mood to be friendly with Garamendi. In fact, he said, he is going to  shift his party registration from Democrat back to independent.  </P> <P> Rosenfield's associate, national consumer advocate Ralph Nader, meanwhile, was  unavailable for comment on the defeat not only of Collis, whom he had  supported, but also of gubernatorial candidate Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> Ingham of State Farm said he believes Nader is less effective in endorsing  candidates than he is in taking stands on issues.  </P></p>

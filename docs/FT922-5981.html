			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / General strike expected in Spain A general strike in protest at government economic policies is expected to cause widespread air, rail and road traffic chaos in Spain today, Peter Bruce writes from Madrid. Unions, angry at deep cuts in unemployment benefits, have insisted they will not provide public transport services ordered by the government after the two sides failed to agree on minimum services. The battle over minimum services has become the immediate focus of the strike, which is due to last from 5am until noon. Its success, both sides concede, will initially be measured by the number of people able to get to work. Madrid has set minimum commuter train services at 40 per cent of normal service and, in the capital, insists 40 per cent of public buses should run. Iberia, the Spanish national airline, said it had cancelled nearly 100 domestic and international flights for the morning.</p>

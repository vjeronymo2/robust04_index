			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Seven are accused of stamps swindle STAMP COLLECTORS were the victims of a swindle involving the manufacture of stamps for colonial governments with deliberate printing imperfections, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday. Commemorative stamps printed with errors such as wrong colouring, inverted watermarks and faulty perforations, included some issued to mark the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986, the jury heard. Some stamps produced to mark the Queen's 40th wedding anniversary were printed with an inverted picture. A set to celebrate the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981 rose in value from Pounds 7.50 to Pounds 70 because it had been marked with the word 'specimen'. Opening the prosecution against seven businessmen, Mr Michael Worsley QC said collectors had been willing to pay for the rarity value of such stamps, which they had been told had slipped through the normal checking procedures. 'They thought they were buying a genuine mistake by the printers and were paying a price based on that. They were being deceived,' Mr Worsley said. The defendants deny various charges including conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading between October 1985 and July 1989. The defendants are Mr Clive Harold Feigenbaum, a former chairman of Stanley Gibbons, the stamp dealers; Mr Aart Johan Lagerwaard and Mr Ronald Wallen, both stamp dealers from Southampton; Mr Frederick George Hughes of Thornton Heath, south London; Mr Ronald Frederick Grover of Beaulieu, Hants; Mr Brian Pillinger, managing director of Bristol stamp dealers Urch Harris and Mr John Charles Smith, a director of the Crown Agents Stamp Company. Mr Feigenbaum was the 'mastermind' behind the swindle, Mr Worsley suggested. He owned Format International, the printing business which carried out the work and which was at the centre of any fraud. He also owned two other stamp dealing businesses involved in selling the bogus stamps to collectors. When police searched various premises they found enormous quantities of the bogus stamps along with bags full of instructions to the printers. The fraud involved an enormous trade in the bogus collectors items, Mr Worsley said. Had all the stamps to be produced in court been sold at catalogue value, then philatelists would have been defrauded of tens of millions of pounds. The case continues today.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Hanson issues Pounds 500m bond: Group denies market speculation of big takeover bid HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday launched a Pounds 500m convertible Eurobond, the largest sterling convertible yet seen in the international market. The move triggered widespread market speculation that Hanson was about to make a sizeable takeover bid, although Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, said the issue was 'no signal in that sense'. Mr Taylor said the two aims of the bond were to reduce its sterling borrowing costs and give international investors a new opportunity to buy into Hanson. Analysts pointed out that Hanson had net cash of more than Pounds 500m in its September 30 balance sheet, and estimated that its borrowing powers permitted it to spend up to Pounds 18bn. They said the issue was small compared with Hanson's market value of Pounds 10.6bn at last night's share price close of 220p, down 5p. The analysts added that a large takeover would probably involve issuing shares anyway. Names suggested as possible targets for a Hanson bid included Pilkington, the glassmaker; Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group; and the William Hill betting shop business of Brent Walker, the leisure company. The bond issue appeared to achieve Hanson's aims. There was substantial demand from European institutional investors, centred on Switzerland, said banks involved in the deal. Most of the paper was placed with new investors, unlike some other convertible bond issues by UK companies. The strength of demand for convertible bonds among international investors could attract other UK companies to the market. Mr Taylor said that the coupon of 9 1/2 per cent on the bond compares with current borrowing costs of about 12 per cent in the UK. In February, Hanson announced a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) commercial paper programme in the US to cut the cost of its short-term dollar borrowings. Mr Taylor said that well over Dollars 2bn had been issued under this programme already. The bonds convert into Hanson ordinary shares at 258 3/4 p, a premium of 15 per cent over the closing share price on Monday. They have a final maturity date of 2006. Analysts said that due to the saving on interest costs, the bond should slightly enhance Hanson's fully-diluted earnings. On full conversion of the bond, Hanson's share capital would increase by 3.7 per cent, well within the 5 per cent limit set by institutional investors for issues without a clawback for existing shareholders. The issue was lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston and a syndicate of just four banks - Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Goldman Sachs, NM Rothschild and Salomon Brothers. The five banks will share fees of Pounds 12.5m. However, they took on a substantial risk since the issue was a bought deal with the terms fixed before launch.

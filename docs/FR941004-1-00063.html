			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Change in fire frequency threatens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arctostaphylos imbricata. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fire suppression policies have altered natural processes occurring on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Bruno Mountain. If a fire were to break out on San Bruno  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountain, attempts would be made by the County to extinguish the fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Doug Heisinger, San Mateo County Park Department, pers. comm.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993), to protect the surrounding homes and commercial buildings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a fire-adapted plant that regenerates from seed rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than resprouting from a basal burl. After a fire, seeds that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulated in the soil (i.e. seed bank) sprout, which reestablishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the population. Between fires  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spreads vegetatively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reproduction by seed is important to maintain the genetic diversity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the species. No significant seedling establishment occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until fire eliminates competing vegetation, as with a recent fire at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kamchatka Point that killed the mature plants yet subsequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> induced regeneration from seed (Roman Gankin, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fire replenishes soil nutrients and facilitates seed germination and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seedling reestablishment by eliminating competition and shading. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time between fires is too long,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to reproduce sexually and individuals may become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> senescent. Conversely, fire occurring too frequently also poses a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat. If consecutive fires occurred within a short period (5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years), a non-sprouting species could be eliminated (Paul Zedler, San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diego State University, pers. comm., 1993; Michael Vasey, San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco State University, pers. comm., 1993). The plants either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not reach flowering age or not retain enough seed in the soil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the interval between fires to ensure the persistence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in Factor A, habitat fragmentation may adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alter the physical environment. In addition, habitat fragmentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the risks of extinction by leaving the species vulnerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to chance events such as pest or disease outbreaks, reproductive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure (which can be devastating to annual plants), or other natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or human-caused disasters. The small isolated nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining populations and restricted distribution of both  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lessingia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> germanorum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arctostaphylos imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  make extinction due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stochastic events more likely. A local catastrophe, such as a flood,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease outbreak, extended drought, landslide, or combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several such events, could destroy part of a single population or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire populations. A local catastrophe also could decrease a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population to so few individuals that the risk of extirpation due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> genetic problems associated with small populations would increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial information available regarding the past, present, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future threats faced by these species in determining to propose this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lessingia germanorum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has been reduced to five small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations on the Presidio in San Francisco County and one site on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County; collectively, the populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhabit less than 0.8 hectares (2 acres). This taxon has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affected and is endangered by competition with invasive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alien vegetation, sand quarrying, increased traffic and recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, shading by alien and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> native vegetation, incidental use of fertilizers, bulldozing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential and commercial development, other anthropogenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, and stochastic events.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lessingia germanorum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is in danger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of extinction throughout all or a significant part of its range, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preferred action is, therefore, to list it as endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arctostaphylos imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has always been rare, and is restricted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five small populations on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This species is vulnerable to alterations of the natural fire regime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and stochastic events. Because the threats facing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arctostaphylos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are long-term rather than imminent, the species is not now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in immediate danger of extinction throughout all or a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of its range. However, with continued alteration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural fire cycle, the plant is likely to become endangered within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the foreseeable future. As a result, the preferred action is to list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. imbricata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat, as defined by section 3 of the Act and 50 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 424.02 (d) is: (i) the specific areas within the geographical area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, on which are found those physical or biological features (I)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential to the conservation of the species and (II) that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require special management considerations or protection and; (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time it is listed, upon a determination that such areas are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential for the conservation of the species. Designations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat must be based on the best scientific data available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and must take into consideration the economic and other relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time the species is listed as endangered or threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / High-flyers meet altitude restriction: The changing job prospects for the trainee with a new degree HIGH-FLYING graduate trainees as traditionally understood are an endangered species. The future looks likely to see them, already hit hard by the recession, forced into accepting jobs traditionally considered beneath their skills and expectations. Graduates are likely to continue to find jobs more easily than other groups. Recent figures from the Institute of Manpower Studies show that unemployment among new gradu-ates is more than 10 per cent. However, unemployment among all graduates, rather than just last year's crop, is 4.4 per cent. That is substantially lower than the 9.9 per cent of the whole of Britain's population of working age who are now jobless, according to the Department of Employment, and a fraction of the rate for those without any qualifications. It is less clear, however, what kinds of jobs they can expect for all the hours of studying. Mr Geoff Pike, research fellow at the IMS, says graduates are going to have to get used to working for smaller companies. Small and medium-sized companies, operating in local or regional markets, many of which have traditionally been sceptical of the worth of graduates, are likely to take a higher proportion of graduates over the next decade. This means that graduates will have to work in jobs that they might have seen as being beneath them. However, when occupations become 'graduatised' their status goes up, as in the case of posts in personnel. Mr Matthew Farrow, training policy adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, says: 'Graduates may have to accept jobs lower down the hierarchy than they traditionally expected. But a degree will continue to advance their careers in the long run.' Mr Pike believes that even that view may be over-optimistic, as it neglects the long-term threat to glittering graduate careers posed by the government's planned expansion of higher education. If there are thousands more students, he argues, many more graduates will be black and working-class; many more will be mature students. Already this year for the first time more than half of new students are women. That means that employers will no longer be able to rely on a homogeneous pool of applicants for graduate posts. Mr Pike argues that some employers may downgrade the types of job available for graduates. However, he says, even if the wider band of graduates is unlikely to get to the top as quickly as previous cohorts, they will continue to find jobs comparatively easily, especially in relation to their non-graduate contemporaries, as employers are likely to expand the number of the posts available to graduates. Mr Julian Drury, British Rail's recruitment and assessment manager, responsible for hiring between 150 and 200 graduates for the rail network, says: 'There are certainly some firms which definitely look for white, male, well-groomed, well-spoken young graduates. These companies may find things more difficult, but they are quite a small minority.' He welcomes a more diverse graduate population and says it will make his job easier. British Rail has had to make efforts to recruit from groups - such as ethnic minorities - that tend to be disadvantaged in the labour market. Mr Farrow believes that today's employers recognise the costs of prejudice: 'Firms are realising that it's the skills that count rather than anything else.'</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Amnesty accuses Cuba Amnesty International yesterday accused Cuba of threatening to increase executions of political opponents and urged the government to abandon the death penalty, Reuter reports from London. 'Over the last few weeks senior members of the (Cuban) government have been suggesting that they may execute people they consider 'counter-revolutionaries',' the human rights group said in a statement. One man had already been executed by firing squad this year after being found guilty of planning to carry out acts of terrorism and sabotage, it said. The man was believed to have been executed on January 20, just 23 days after his arrest. The case was 'rushed through a legal system that makes scant provision for adequate defence or impartial review of appeals', the group said. It said Vice-President Raul Castro had threatened to bring back revolutionary courts, which sent scores to firing squads after the revolution.</p>

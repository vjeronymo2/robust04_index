			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Loyalists Prepare for `Long War'"] </F>   [Text] The IRA'S three-day ceasefire was described as an  irrelevance yesterday by the Ulster Defence Association [UDA],  which said it was now working to its own agenda to prevent  Ulster from sliding inexorably into a united Ireland.    In a wide-ranging interview with two senior representatives  claiming to be leaders of the UDA's south Belfast and southeast  Antrim battalions -- the first since the Downing Street  Declaratlon last December -- it emerged that the illegal  loyalist organisation has been studying IRA strategy and is  planning for a "long war."    "Our days of reacting to the IRA are over. As far as we are  concerned our agenda is pro-active."    The wooing of the IRA by the British and Irish Governments  was proof that violence pays, the men said.    "The view from our community is that they've bombed our  towns  and killed our people for 25 years and the British Government is  saying, `Hold on, we don't want any more 3 million pound bombs  in the centre of London.' There is a strong feeling of  alienation within our community."    The UDA had adopted long and short-term policies against  what  it calls the pan-nationalist front -- the IRA, Sinn Fein, the  Social and Democratic Labour Party [SDLP] and the Irish  Government -- they said. "We are planning for a long effort.  Our volunteers are more than capable of carrying on the role of  defenders of our way of life, and as far as we're concerned we  are quite prepared for the long haul."    The men said that given the recent political developments  they believed there was a grim future ahead. "The ingredients  are there for it. I think civil war gets nearer by the month  and that's not war-mongering, that's fact."    The restraint with which the UDA had responded to the IRA's  temporary suspension of activities was proof that it was no  longer simply reacting to republican violence. "We have our own  agenda. Even if there was a permanent cessation of violence  from the IRA it doesn't mean to say we would cause a cessation  of our own policies because there's still the other major  problem of another state on this island laying claim to the  territory of Northern Ireland."    The senior UDA figures said that any extension of the IRA's  ceasefire would be taken as a sign that its terms had been met  by the Government. "There must be a prize for the IRA to call a  ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked  at."    Neither man had any doubt that secret talks between the IRA  and the Government were continuing and that Sinn Fein would  receive the clarification it was seeking. "There's a thin line  between dialogue and negotiation. The IRA want to know what  comes next, what are steps two, three and four. But we would  like to know that too." The UDA was developing its political  agenda: a working group was meeting to fuse two loyalist  blueprints, "Beyond the Religious Divide" and "Commonsense."  The new policy document, setting out proposals for an  independent Ulster within the framework of the European Union,  would be published within the next two months, they said.    The leaders said they realised that the British Government  no  longer wanted Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom,  but they were heartened by other support -- not identified -- on  the mainland for the survival of the Union. Politically they  would prefer to remain within the UK but the alternative was  independence.    "We've a great deal of faith in our own ability. We are a  very independent people. There are people within Northern  Ireland who are more than capable of running this country and we  have no doubt that the day is fast coming when those leaders  will come to the fore."    The UDA wanted all the constitutional politicians in  Northern  Ireland to sit round the same table, settle their differences  and work out new arrangements for its governance. As a gesture  of good faith, two years ago loyalist paramilitaries had called  a three-month ceasefire to allow a similar exercise -- known as  the Brooke talks -- which had been scuppered by the SDLP.    They believed the majority of nationalists would accept an  internal settlement. Those who did not were entitled to pursue  their aspiration for a united Ireland through democratic means,  "not through the barrel of a gun."    One of the men said: "I think people will progress out of  that. We are all inter-dependent within the confines of Europe.  Most of the legislation will be emanating from Brussels, so I  think the majority of people will have moved on, not clawing  themselves into that `little island' mentality.    ``Personally I want to be part and parcel of a greater  social  and economic entity and I'll work with anybody to achieve that  as long as they don't lay unconstitutional claims on my  country.''    The men denied that their aims were sectarian. "We've no  problems whatsoever with integrated education. That would be a  barrier removed, but the main opponent to that is the Catholic  Church. There's other aspects of the Catholic community that we  have no problem living with at all. As far as we're concerned  the cause of the confiict is the IRA."    By pursuing the current political goals the Irish Government  was "giving a reason for the IRA to continue." There would be a  price to pay, the men warned. "They haven't paid it yet, but  all their dues are being recorded and they will have to pay up."    Asked whether they would be prepared to talk to John Hume,  as  the SDLP leader has suggested, the UDA representatives said  there was no merit in the idea. "John Hume will never have our  trust, he will never convince the loyalist community that he is  genuine. He's past his sell-by date and it's time some other  politician emerged to take his place."    Mr Hume had led the SDLP down a road which "we believe a  number of people within his party didn't want to go down." His  removal would allow the election of a new leader with whom  loyalists were certain they could work.    Asked to assess the UDA's present strength and level of  support, the men said: "We've recruits coming in daily who are  prepared to come into the organisation, and we are very pleased  with the amount of assistance that we're getting from people who  would share our views but would perhaps not be prepared to join  us and can give us support in other ways."</p>

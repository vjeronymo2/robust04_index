			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY AIDE CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLEMENT  </P> <P> The building maintenance supervisor in charge of repair work for the city of  Huntington Beach has been charged with eight counts of felony embezzlement in a  double-dipping payoff scheme that siphoned off $10,000 in taxpayers' money,  police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Raymond J. Orlando, 56, was arrested by Huntington Beach police at his Trotter  Road home Tuesday evening, capping a five-month investigation into alleged  fraud by city contractors.  </P> <P> The probe was conducted by the special assignment unit of the Orange County  district attorney's office, according to Police Lt. Ed McErlain.  </P> <P> The investigation was requested by City Administrator Paul Cook after evidence  surfaced into "possible misuses of city employees and time, as well as theft of  city property," McErlain said.  </P> <P> According to the charges, Orlando, who has been the town's building maintenance  supervisor for 2 1/2 years, retained contractors to repair city-owned block  walls damaged in traffic accidents, then submitted two bills -- one to the  city, and another to automobile insurance companies -- for the same work.  </P> <P> McErlain said the double payments were made to the contractors between May and  August, 1989, and that Orlando also arranged for contractors to be paid for  work that was never done.  </P> <P> It was not known if the contractors offered cash kickbacks to Orlando, but the  charges allege that the contractors performed construction work on Orlando's  home at no charge, McErlain said.  </P> <P> McErlain said the investigation is continuing and further arrests are expected,  although no other Huntington Beach city employees are expected to be charged.  </P> <P> Orlando was arraigned Tuesday night and posted $10,000 bail, McErlain said.  Reached by telephone at their home Wednesday, Orlando's wife, Vickie, said her  husband had no comment.  </P></p>

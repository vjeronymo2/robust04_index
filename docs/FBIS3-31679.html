			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F> Union of Vojvodina Hungarians; Arpad Pasza, chairman of the  Democratic Community of Hungarians in Croatia; and Bela Marko,  chairman of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania; by  Jozsef Botlik; place and date not given: "Vital Issues Over the  Border"]    [Text] Last weekend, the leaders of the Hungarian  organizations from beyond the border were in Budapest and were  met by Prime Minister Peter Boross. We interviewed some  participants of the talks on the results of the meeting and on  the situation of the various Hungarian national communities.  <H3>  Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Union of  Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK]: We Want Autonomy! </H3>   [Botlik] What were the results of the Budapest meeting for  you?    [Agoston] I raised two issues at the meeting, one in  connection with the Balladur plan. I explained that, if any of  the region's governments signed it in its current form, the  political goals set out by the organizations of the Hungarian  national communities over the border would in fact become  impossible to achieve. We insist that an agreement like this  also has to contain the autonomy concept that we drew up. The  issue of aid was the other topic. In recent years, the  government of the mother country has also given significant  financial support to the Hungarian national communities over the  border. I asked the prime minister -- as help given to the  national minorities is internationally legitimate -- to help  maintain our institutional system, and to support our efforts  aimed at implementing our autonomy concept. This would be very  important because, certain phenomena in connection with the  financial aid we have received did not help this.    [Botlik] The psycho-terror against the some 400,000  Hungarians and the forceful military mobilizations seem recently  to have eased off. Does the dialogue that began between the  VMDK and the Serbian government have a role in this?    [Agoston] We formulated our autonomy concept two years ago,  at a time when the war was in full swing and the forceful  mobilizations were daily events, and we had to suffer a tough  war propaganda. We started from the premise that it is also in  the interest of the Serbian state -- including its parties --  that the now open and unresolved situation of the Vojvodina  Hungarians is settled. We were certain that sooner or later,  international circumstances will change to benefit our efforts.  In recent months, I also put my talks with Serbian President  Milosevic into this context. As a matter of fact, the meeting  was requested by Milosevic. I raised the personal autonomy of  the Hungarians and that the establishment of an administrative  district with Hungarian majority should begin to be set up in  north Backa or the northern part of the Banat. We would like to  achieve all this gradually. If the Serbian government backs  down from the agreement then we will inform the Hungarian and  the international public about this.    [Botlik] What does personal autonomy mean?    [Agoston] We intend to make progress in three areas. In  education, we would like to establish a Hungarian schooling  system, in culture, we would like to take over the leadership of  institutions and associations and their assets (mainly  buildings), and we would like to establish an independent  Hungarian information system (press, radio, television). All  these would be directed by the personal autonomy's council that  will be established on a multi- party basis. We will probably  initiate elections for this in October. If the promises  received during the talks with President Milosevic come true  then we will be able to set up the Vojvodina Hungarian press and  publishing house and the editorial group of the independent  Hungarian television and radio. We can start setting up the  Hungarian schooling system, and the council of the personal  autonomy can take over certain functions in the area of culture.    [Botlik] At the December elections, five representatives of  the VMDK were elected into the Serbian Parliament. From the  results it seems that they might be the decisive factors....    [Agoston] Unfortunately, this is the situation in Parliament  where the socialists have 123 of the 250 seats and the  opposition has the rest. The opposition is a rather mixed  political group because the VMDK and Seselj's radical party are  together in it although they are not at all in the same camp in  reality. The opposition is divided, therefore, the socialists  have to prepare for an unstable government and they will again  have to call elections after some time. In this situation, our  view is that the VMDK's representatives will not vote for any  such parliamentary decision which would make them clash with  half of the Serbian political palette.  <H3>  Arpad Pasza, Chairman of the Democratic Community of  Hungarians in Croatia [HMDK]: We Pay Attention to the Scattered  Hungarian Groups </H3>   [Botlik] Out of the organizations of Hungarians over the  border, the HMDK is the youngest, it is barely two years old. A  large section of the areas inhabited by Hungarians -- the  Dravaszog [Drava river area] and Slavonia -- is under Serbian  occupation at the moment and a significant proportion of the  population has escaped from these places. How can you organize  yourselves in this situation?    [Pasza] We consider the organization of the Hungarians  living in scattered areas as our main task. For example, there  is a significant diaspora -- mainly intelligentsia -- in the  Croatian capital Zagreb which can still be stopped from being  assimilated. A kindergarten group will be started for their  children in March. Some 1,200 Hungarians are living in the  Tengermellek, they speak their mother tongue but, unfortunately,  their children can only speak Croatian. At the beginning of the  year, 164 people formed the HMDK's local organizations in the  former Hungarian spa Abbazia now Opatija. They have grand plans  and they are also expecting a cultural performance from Hungary.  We will next form organizations in the area of Belovar and then  along the Sava River in Slavon-Brod.   <H3>    Bela Marko, Chairman of the Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania: We Also Want To Become Economically  Strong </H3>   [Marko] Contrary to certain media reactions, we also  considered this meeting natural because it has to be openly and  consistently admitted that the Hungarian organizations operating  in various countries of the Carpathian basin regularly exchange  their experiences. All Hungarian national communities over the  border are living in special situations but their problems are  often similar and, most certainly, this why we came to almost  identical conclusions as to the solutions. In our view, the  introduction of various forms of autonomy leads to the  reassuring settlement of the situation of Hungarian national  communities over the border. As we consider ourselves as  organic part of the Hungarian nation, we expect the Hungarian  Government's political support in our endeavors and that care  for the Hungarians living outside the country's boundaries will  remain an organic and inseparable part of its foreign policy.    [Botlik] In the past years in Europe, a number of proposals  have been made to set up international norms which -- it seems  -- will reassuringly settle the situation of national minority  and ethnic communities....    [Marko] The Balladur plan that is now called the European  Stability Agreement is one of these proposals that apply to the  East European region or a section of it. Its original version  contained several positive elements for national minorities but  most of these were removed from the draft through the amendments  in 1993. This plan would only offer good solutions if, in the  process of settlement, the affected national communities and  governments also held talks and the views of the national  communities were taken into consideration. The latter was  emphasized by the ethnic Hungarian leaders at the Budapest  meeting. Our links with the Hungarian government are not only  of a political nature. We have already received considerable  budget support for rebuilding our educational and cultural  institutional system. The mother country will continue to be  completely open about doing this in the future, too.    [Botlik] What are the most important tasks in improving the  situation of the more than 2 million strong Hungarian national  community in Romania and Transylvania?    [Marko] The priorities we laid down four years ago are still  valid. Unfortunately, the Hungarian Bolyai University of  Sciences still has not been able to restart its operation,  therefore, our education system continues to be incomplete. We  are trying to substitute this with civic social institutions,  foundations, associations, unions, and folk high schools, and  there are also very remarkable church initiatives. We are  trying to use all legal frameworks and expand the possibilities  of Hungarian education to overcome the difficulties and the  acute shortage of teachers. As we often said it in our  statements, the economy is just as important for us, and we  think that we have to do much more than we have done in the past  to help the Hungarian national community strengthen financially.  Through this, people's serious subsistence problems can be  eased, emigration can be reduced, and the general mood can be  improved. This is especially important because an economically  strong national community is less exposed to the state power.  We have to act with more determination in the future because an  anti-Hungarian discriminative process can also be seen in the  privatizations.</p>

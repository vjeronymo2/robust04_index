			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> YOUNG &amp; RUBICAM ADMITS GUILT  </P> <P> Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., one of the world's largest advertising agencies,  pleaded guilty today to making $130,000 in illegal payments in its efforts to  win the contract for the Jamaican tourism account.  </P> <P> The New York-based company was fined $500,000 for conspiring to violate the  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making payments to a Jamaican businessman,  Arnold Foote Jr., who in turn made payments to Eric Anthony Abrahams, the  former minister of tourism in Jamaica, said U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Stanley A. Twardy.  </P> <P> The government alleged that Young &amp; Rubicam made the payments in order to  win and retain the lucrative Jamaican tourism account, for which it produced  the award-winning "Come Back to Jamaica" campaign in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> The government, citing "exculpatory evidence recently turned over to the  government," dropped charges against two Young &amp; Rubicam executives,  executive vice president Arthur R. Klein and former account supervisor Thomas  Spangenberg.  </P> <P> A third Young &amp; Rubicam worker, Steven M. McKenna, faces federal perjury  charges.  </P></p>

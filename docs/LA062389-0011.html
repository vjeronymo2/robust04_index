			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> GRAND FLAG, GREAT LIBERTIES  </P> <P> The Supreme Court now says that as long as there is a message in the act,  flag-burning is not vandalism but a protected form of "symbolic" speech. At the  simplest level, the logic is elementary. It is obvious that "symbolic speech"  will involve the use, and even the occasional abuse, of symbols.  </P> <P> And it is offensive free speech that usually needs judicial protection: The  power to communicate sometimes involves the power to shock.  </P> <P> None of these ideas are especially new, though they are more familiar in the  field of artistic modernism than in constitutional law. Verbal and plastic art  in our century has often explored outer limits of sensation. The language of  some poetry, the grotesqueness (as it seems to conventional eyes) of some  abstract art -- these are examples of what courts have often protected, even  though the most provocative forms of expression have offended millions.  </P> <P> It was inevitable that symbolism as a technique of "speech" would seep into  First Amendment law; that "symbolic speech," though very possibly undreamed of  by the framers of the First Amendment, would raid the armory of art to enhance  and expand its powers to provoke.  </P> <P> The difficulty is in drawing the lines. Some carry symbolic free speech to all  imaginable lengths. Others, provoked by the court's previous tolerance of  pornography or topless dancing, would reject the very idea that free speech  should permit anything other than the most literal and straightforward  "political" expression.  </P> <P> Historically, they have a point. Before perceptions were turned upside down by  modernists like Yeats and Joyce and Eliot, Picasso and Braque, it was as hard  to imagine such issues as it was to imagine, before the invention of flying  machines, how the Commerce Clause might apply to aviation.  </P> <P> The court strongly intimates that it is not licensing casual or gratuitous  vandalism against the flag -- that without a distinct "expressive" purpose,  flag-burning will continue to be a crime. But even with all the hedging,  successor controversies can be imagined springing from the fertile minds of  First Amendment lawyers.  </P> <P> Is it "symbolic speech," for instance, to spray-paint a swastika on a  synagogue, or burn a cross in someone's front yard? Most of us would scoff at  the mere idea that such outrages might follow logically from the toleration of  flag-burning. But where are the "bright lines" (as judges like to say) that  distinguish the one from the other?  </P></p>

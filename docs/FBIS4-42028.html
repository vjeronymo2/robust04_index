			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Mykola Horvat from </F> Transcarpathian Oblast: "It Depends Upon the Authorities What  Kind of Free Economic Zone We Will Have"]    [Text] In the course of the election campaign in  Transcarpathia, the question of the attitude on the part of the  contestants to the idea of introducing a Free Economic Zone in  the region has become a major one.    Together with their supporters, the present candidates for  "governors" and local "parliaments" may be divided into three  camps.    The first of these, which includes present leaders of the  oblast and of numerous industrial enterprises and farms, and  also individual scientists and representatives of a number of  influential public and national-cultural societies, supports the  idea of creating in the region a Free Economic Zone  "Europe-Center" (precisely under this name a package of  documents was submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet of  Ministers and the Supreme Council). The main author of the  bill, Ukraine's people's deputy Serhiy Ustych, who masterminded  and inspired the project and is the leader of the group, is also  one of the real claimants to the post of chairman of the oblast  council. He is also supported by a considerable number of the  more than 200 registered candidates for 60 seats in the  "parliament" of the region. The most significant of their  arguments is, first and foremost, the advantageous economic and  geographical situation of Transcarpathia (it borders upon four  post-socialist states), which may serve for Ukraine as a kind of  bridge between the countries of eastern, central, and western  Europe, as an experimental proving ground for the development of  civilized entrepreneurship, for the attraction of foreign  investments for technical and technological re-equipment of  production, and may promote our country's integration into  various economic, financial, and other structures of the world.    The second camp, which unites, first and foremost,  representatives of local cells of Rukh [Ukraine's People's  Movement for Perestroyka], Ukraine's Democratic Party, Ukraine's  Republican Party, Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly, and a number  of other organizations of national democratic denomination that  are adamantly against the Free Economic Zone project in its  present form. In their opinion, the introduction of a Free  Economic Zone may lead to Transcarpathia's secession from  Ukraine and to a situation where the region will be plundered by  Western investors. They also fear that it will enable those  officials who govern the region, to make a fortune at the  expense of others.    This is the position adhered to by former people's deputy of  Ukraine and presently candidate for "governor" Viktor Bed. On  the whole, he does not reject the idea of a Free Economic Zone  and comes out decisively in favor of free entrepreneurship and  various economic experiments. However, he believes that the  introduction of the zone is premature as long as questions of  ownership, civilized privatization, or land reform in the region  remain unresolved. Nor does he agree with the present project  of the system of management of the Free Economic Zone, when  members of the so-called Oversight Council or General  Directorate are not elected nationwide.    Yet another claimant to the seat of chairman of the Oblast  Council and former first secretary of the [Communist] Party  Oblast Committee Professor Vasyl Khymynets is also opposed to  the present variant of the bill on a Free Economic Zone in  Transcarpathia. In his election campaign, he exclusively  promotes legitimization of the results of the oblast referendum  held on 1 December 1991 on granting the region the status of a  special self-governed administrative territory, which is not the  same as a Free Economic Zone (even though some politicians try  to equate these entirely dissimilar notions).    One more candidate -- the present presidential  representative  in Uzhhorod Rayon, Ukraine's people's deputy Mykhaylo Dancha, if  elected "governor," will seek legislative confirmation of the  special economic rights of self-government.    Finally, the third "team" includes those who, in principle,  also support the idea of a Free Economic Zone in Transcarpathia.  However, not on the scale of the entire oblast, but, to begin  with, in individual towns or districts. Present mayor of  Uzhhorod Emil Landovskyy is a proponent of such a stand. He has  also actively joined the struggle for the highest post in the  region. He and his supporters believe that such an approach is  the least risky and, if it fails, the losses from the experiment  will be minimal. When it proves its viability by concrete  results, it may be introduced throughout the territory of the  oblast.    As is known, the "old" composition of the Supreme Council  "killed" the initial bill on the Free Economic Zone in  Transcarpathia. Although, in the opinion of many, at that time  political ambitions prevailed over sound economic common sense.  The working group analyzed the constructive criticism and  proposals voiced at the Supreme Council session, amended the  project and sent it to the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme  Council for further consideration.    Incidentally, the package of documents has already been  approved by a number of authoritative international institutions  and experts, by the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, an organization for industrial development -- a key  structure of the United Nations, which is also ready to take an  active part in attracting investments for implementing major  programs.    Thus, by voting for a supporter of a particular trend in the  development of Transcarpathia, the voters will determine the  future of the region.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Warsaw, 16 June -- [passage omitted] The  president was the guest of the morning program "Signals of the  Day" on Polish Radio First Program and answered questions from  listeners for an hour and a half.    "I have already said it and say it again, this is the best  program in the past five years", said the president, assessing  the government's economic development plan, "The Strategy for  Poland." The president added that specialists should now  consider ways of implementing the plan.    Many questions were on reprivatization. Walesa said that he  was in favor of the restoration of property but stressed that it  would be very difficult to sort out past ownership issues. The  president quoted his proposals to carry out reprivatization.  According to them the owner would receive the whole property,  children would receive half, and grandchildren a quarter.    Answering questions on vetting and decommunization, the  president said that he was in favor of vetting either by  disclosing all documents available or by courts, prosecutors'  offices and other authorized institutions conducting this.    The president said that he will take part in the forthcoming  local elections and added that he hoped these will not be  political elections. When asked who he will vote for Walesa  said: "I trust my wife and my family."    "Are we going to decide whether we live in a Polish  People's Republic No. 2, or in a country where democracy is  being built, or whether we're to be motivated by the principle  of a separation of powers, or not?", the president asked a  listener who accused him of not taking steps to fully clear up  the issue of the killing of Father Jerzy Popieluszko and the  punishing of the perpetrators of the crime against Grzegorz  Przemyk. "What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to violate  principles, take over power, become first secretary, Stalin, or  make room for a Stalin?" Walesa retorted.    The president confirmed that he will not sign the amended  abortion law which allows abortions in cases where the woman  suffers from material hardship. "I cannot sign this kind of  decision on murder and I will never sign it," he said. Walesa  described attempts to adopt or reject the concordat as  "something we should all be ashamed of". He said in a situation  where there is pressure to increase wages he will sign the new  law on taxing excess wage increases, otherwise "the reforms will  be destabilized".    The president was also asked about personnel matters,  including, why he appointed Henryk Goryszewski to the post of  head of the National Security Bureau despite information, which  has also appeared in the mass media, that his son-in-law was  involved in "the car scandal." "Before I appointed Mr.  Goryszewski, I ordered a careful examination of his involvement  in these matters," the president said and added that everyone  should answer for themselves. "I have four daughters and will  have four sons-in-law but I don't know what they will be like  and I am not going to take responsibility for them," the  president said.    "I did not chose a wife for you so please don't chose one  for  me," the president replied to a listener who accused the  president of employing "political amateurs" like Wachowski and  Falandysz in the Belweder Palace.

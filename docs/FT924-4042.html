			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Lords' ruling closes loophole in fraud prosecutions A LEGAL loophole preventing theft charges being brought in some cases of alleged fraud was closed yesterday by the House of Lords. By a majority of four to one, five law lords allowed an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a Court of Appeal decision to quash the conviction for theft of Mr Edwin Gomez, a shop manager. The law lords' ruling is seen as having widespread implications for the bringing of theft charges in cases of alleged white-collar crime. After yesterday's ruling, theft charges could now be more easily brought against dishonest company directors who persuade fellow directors to agree to the transfer of assets, not knowing the improper purpose of the exercise. Mr Gomez was originally convicted of the theft of electrical goods after persuading his manager to accept cheques as payment from a Mr Jit Ballay which he, Mr Gomez, knew to be stolen. The appeal court quashed the theft conviction, ruling that since the shop manager had authorised the transfer of the goods there could have been no 'appropriation' as required by the Theft Act. After the ruling that the appeal court decision was wrong, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said: 'The pillaging of companies by those who control them is now all too common. It would offend both common sense and justice to hold that the very control which enables such people to extract the company's assets constitutes a defence to a charge of theft from the company.' The decision may have implications for the prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International. Last June a High Court judge dismissed 46 charges of theft involving some Pounds 119.5m against Mr Nadir after his counsel, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, had argued there was no evidence of appropriation of funds in connection with transfers by Mr Nadir from PPI's bank to the account of a wholly owned subsidiary, Unipac, or the Midland International account of the Industrial Bank of Kibris, a bank owned by Mr Nadir.</p>

Li Yongjin, vice chairman of the  standing committee of the provincial people's congress, chaired  the session.    Entrusted by the meeting of chairman and vice chairmen,  Zhang  Liyin, chairman of the commission on politics and law under the  provincial people's congress standing committee, made a report  on examination of the local rules and regulations and opinions  on examining the local rules and regulations. Zhang Liyin said:  According to the decision made at the meeting of chairman and  vice chairmen, from September to December, we comprehensively  examined the local rules and regulations formulated and approved  before the end of 1992. The statistics showed that 81 local  rules and regulations were examined this time. Through  examinations, 54 continued to be effective, 4 had to be  abolished, and 23 continued to be effective but should partially  be revised. Zhang Liyin set forth in his report: We suggest  that the provincial people's congress standing committee should  make a decision on abolishing the local rules and regulations  that should be abolished and should organize forces to firmly  work out a draft resolution on revision and strive to basically  finish the revision tasks in 1994.    Entrusted by the provincial government, Liu Deyun, chairman  of the provincial family planning commission, made a report on  family planning work. He said: According to the analysis and  calculation by the provincial population surveying team and the  investigations on the examples in family planning work, the  province was expected to be able to fulfill the population  control plan. Simultaneously, the overall family planning work  level was improved when compared with that of previous years.  After citing that the grass-roots areas were weak in the basic  family planning work, their input to the family planning work  was seriously insufficient, and the grass- roots statistic  figures were not real, he urged that in 1994, the leaders at  various levels should further upgrade their awareness of  "personally engaging in the family planning work and assuming  overall responsibility," exert efforts to grasp the grass roots  and lay a good foundation, and concentrate efforts on solving  the problems due to the failure to grasp or not effectively  grasp the village-level family planning work.    Entrusted by the provincial government, Song Xilin, director  of the provincial land management bureau, delivered a report on  implementation of the laws and regulations on land management.  He said: So far, all cities and counties across the province  have completely finished the establishment of the basic farmland  protection areas and protected 76.075 million mu of farmland,  including 70.745 million mu of cultivated area; and 72 percent  of the cultivated areas were protected. From the beginning of  1992 to the first half of 1993, more than 90 pieces of state  land were sold, more than 50,000 mu of land were sold, and 1.85  billion yuan of money were earned from sales of land. From the  beginning of last year, the province signed 38 contracts on  large-scale land development with foreign businessmen and sold  rights on utilization of 43,000 mu of land; and was able to use  $1.7 billion through these channels. Town and township  enterprises began to experiment with the paid use of land. Song  Xilin also set forth opinions on the existing problems and asked  standing committee members for examinations and discussions.    Entrusted by the provincial government, Gong Huanwen,  chairman of the provincial planning committee, delivered a  report on the construction of key projects. He said: This  year, the province arranged 159 key projects, an increase of 56  projects or 54.4 percent over the previous year. The total  investment was 51.5 billion yuan. The planned investment of the  fiscal year was 10.82 billion yuan, (excluding the investment in  preparatory projects and the Beijing-Jiulong railway project,)  an increase of 6.066 billion yuan or 127.6 percent over the  previous year. All this appropriately helped promote the  fulfillment of the plan for investment in fixed assets and the  increase in the national economy. After reporting the provincial  situation in the investment in key projects, the progress of key  projects, the main measures that were adopted, and the existing  problems, Gong Huanwen pointed out that the provincial  government would ask relevant departments to organize special  leading bodies to generally and thoroughly examine and  investigate the key projects with excessive construction funds,  set forth opinions on solving the problems in this regard, and  work out measures for controlling overspending on key projects  so as to reduce construction investment and alleviate the  contradictions between supply and demand of capital.    Present at the session were Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the  standing committee of the provincial people's congress; and  Zhang Zhenhuai, Liu Zongyao, and Gao Yongtang, vice chairmen of  the standing committee of the provincial people's congress.    Present at the session as nonvoting delegates were Guo  Shichang, vice governor of the provincial government; Ping  Yijie, president of the provincial court; and Zhang Dianshan,  deputy chief procurator of the provincial procuratorate.</p>

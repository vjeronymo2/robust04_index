They agreed on one thing: President Bush needs congressional  approval before going to war.  </P> <P> Detroit Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton said he will ask Roman Catholic  bishops to sign a statement asking Catholic soldiers to become "selective  conscientious objectors" against war in the gulf. He will press for a  discussion of the gulf crisis at an annual meeting of bishops that opens today  in Washington.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, Vice President Dan Quayle discussed a military resolution with U.N.  Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but officials did not reveal the  U.N. leader's response. Quayle will discuss the crisis with at least 11 world  leaders in Tokyo for the enthronement of Emperor Akihito.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary have offered or are  prepared to offer military medical teams trained in treating injuries from  chemical warfare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> Iraq said it would attend a proposed Arab summit if the agenda included the  Palestinian question, and if it is consulted on the time and place. The Iraqi  offer came in response to an appeal by Morocco's King Hassan II, who said such  a meeting would be a "new and last chance" for a peaceful solution.  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein also said in a British television interview that  he is ready for talks on security issues in the Middle East.

"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hostage Front:  </P> <P> Iraq tried to swap all its hostages for a nonaggression pledge from France and  the Soviet Union but both rebuffed the approach, diplomats said.  </P> <P> They said French President Francois Mitterrand told Jordan's King Hussein last  week that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rejected the offer at  their October summit in Paris.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soviet and Eastern European Citizens in Iraq and Kuwait:  </P> <P> Soviet Union: 3,000  </P> <P> Yugoslavia: 1,300  </P> <P> Poland: 1,213  </P> <P> Bulgaria: 690  </P> <P> Romania: 640  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia: 66  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAY ON BOOK ABOUT ISRAELI AGENTS UPSET;  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP: JERUSALEM ARGUES THAT THE WORK ENDANGERS ITS INTELLIGENCE  OPERATIVES. THE PUBLISHER SAYS IT WAS BEING SILENCED BY A FOREIGN COUNTRY.  </P> <P> Arguing that it was being muzzled by a foreign government, St. Martin's Press  on Thursday won an appeal overturning an injunction that had restrained the  company from distributing a book purporting to expose the Mossad, Israel's  super-secret intelligence agency.  </P> <P> Issuing a brief ruling in the precedent-setting case, the Appellate Division of  the New York Supreme Court dismissed a stay issued by a lower court judge  Wednesday. The Israeli government had sought the stay on the grounds that  publication of the book would endanger its intelligence operatives.  </P> <P> The book purports to name Mossad agents, and describes the intelligence  agency's alleged operations and training techniques.  </P> <P> It also contains the sensational charge that Israel knew in advance about a  terrorist attack in Lebanon that killed 241 American servicemen in October,  1983, but withheld full information about the impending action because it  wanted to poison relations between the United States and Arab nations. The  Israeli government has vehemently denied the allegation.  </P> <P> The four-judge Appellate Division panel ruled that the Israeli government had  failed to show that the book endangered the lives of its agents. The judges  said the publisher already had shipped 17,000 copies of the book, including  many newspaper review copies, and "any grant of injunctive relief in this case  would be ineffective."  </P> <P> The temporary injunction apparently was the first time that a foreign  government has blocked, even briefly, distribution of published material in the  United States. The Israeli government obtained a similar injunction that  remains in force in Canada.  </P> <P> State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Dontzin on Wednesday had ordered St.  Martin's Press to cease publication and distribution of the book, pending a  hearing.  </P> <P> "This was a case of a foreign government reaching across our borders and  telling Americans what they can read and what they can publish," said Thomas  McCormack, chief executive officer of St. Martin's Press. "It is totally  unacceptable and I am gratified they were stopped."  </P> <P> McCormack said his company had received 50,000 orders for the book, "By Way of  Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer," by former agent Victor  Ostrovsky and Canadian journalist Claire Hoy. He said St. Martin's had decided  to print 100,000 copies.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Thursday with the Washington Post, Ostrovsky said he  has been in hiding in Canada to avoid being kidnaped and taken to Israel.  </P> <P> On Sept. 5, Ostrovsky said, two men he described as "ranking Mossad agents"  appeared at his home and warned that, for his "own safety," he should try to  stop publication of the book. Since then, he said, he has lived like a  fugitive, sleeping at a different place each night. "It's scary," he said.  </P> <P> McCormack said that "it is my understanding (the agents) did not threaten him.  They tried to reason with him and perhaps tried to assure him if he abandoned  this book, there would be no loss in income because of the decision. I was not  told that any overt, any explicit threats were conveyed."  </P> <P> John Lerner, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate,  Meagher &amp; Flom, which represented the Israeli government, said discussions  were under way whether to appeal.  </P> <P> "The issue is whether a former employee of a foreign intelligence agency is  going to be permitted to breach his contractual duties to a foreign government  and inflict irreparable harm on employees of that government and whether that  conduct will be restrained. There are names in the book," he said.  </P> <P> The appellate decision "eviscerates protection that should be given to our  secrets. What happens to a CIA agent breaching his duty who publishes in  Israel? The hallmark of comity between the laws of various nations is  reciprocity . . . ."  </P> <P> Israeli sources said Ostrovsky, 40, was born in Edmonton, Canada, and  immigrated to Israel in the mid-1950s. He served in the military police and  reached the rank of captain before joining the Israeli navy. He later served  with the Mossad for two years before being dismissed as unreliable and returned  to Canada.  </P> <P> Staff Writer William Tuohy in Jerusalem also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

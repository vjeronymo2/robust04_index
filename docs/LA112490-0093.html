			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY;  </P> <P> FOR MEXICO, THE ISSUE IS JOBS;  </P> <P> BUSH-SALINAS TALKS WILL FOCUS ON FREE TRADE AND ITS IMPACT ON BOTH NATIONS.  </P> <P> When Presidents Bush and Carlos Salinas de Gortari sit down Monday afternoon to  an outdoor lunch near the city hall of Agualeguas, a small farming community in  northern Mexico, one issue will overshadow all others: jobs.  </P> <P> The two leaders will be meeting for the sixth time -- they first met as  presidents-elect late in 1988. As other sensitive issues have slipped slightly  from the top of the agenda in the touchy U.S.-Mexican relationship, the  question of free trade and its impact on jobs in each country has only been  magnified.  </P> <P> Bush, who is scheduled to return to Washington early today after a grueling  weeklong trip to Europe and the Middle East, will set out for the 27-hour visit  after spending barely two days at home.  </P> <P> Although he could have easily added it to his five-country Latin American trip  that begins Dec. 2, the President decided to make it a separate event to  demonstrate the Administration's special interest in Mexico and its desire for  improved economic cooperation.  </P> <P> ISSUES: In the White House view, Salinas "is a new kind of Mexican leader," a  Bush aide said. The 42-year-old Harvard-educated economist has tried to move  his country toward market-oriented reforms, "and we want to encourage that  process," the official explained.  </P> <P> While Bush leads the applause, the cheering section will include Commerce  Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. Even as Bush and Salinas confer, he will be  taking a delegation of U.S. business executives around Mexico to talk on a more  nitty-gritty level about trade and business prospects with their counterparts.  </P> <P> As it is, Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, behind  Canada and Japan. U.S. exports to Mexico last year were worth $25 billion,  according to White House statistics.  </P> <P> But unlike past years, when U.S. and Mexican leaders each had reasons for  shying away from free-trade agreements, Salinas is now actively courting them,  having proposed a free-trade agreement to Bush in June. The reason: to hang  onto some of the capital now heading toward the competitive, low-cost  production centers in Asia and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> OBSTACLES: But here's the rub: Although Bush and Salinas are likely to find  themselves approximately on the same side of the fence on this issue -- a  rarity in the often-acrimonious U.S.-Mexican relationship -- they are both  likely to face opposition at home.  </P> <P> As viewed by some on the U.S. side of the border, the opening up of trade could  mean a further seepage of investment -- and jobs -- southward, prompting  protests from Congress. And among Mexican opposition leaders, there is concern  that a trade agreement, with the resulting expansion of foreign parti- cipation  in the Mexican economy, would bring about exploitation of Mexican workers.  </P> <P> While possible approaches and safeguards for those concerns may dominate the  presidential sessions in northern Mexico, two other longstanding topics, drugs  and immigration, will also require attention.  </P> <P> "Mexico wants to make sure the border remains open and people can come across,  and we'll express our concerns about drug smuggling," the White House official  said.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: An actual free-trade agreement could be several years away.  Complicated terms must be negotiated. But Bush appears willing to count the  trip a success if it produces merely harmonious discussions with the Mexican  president and a sense of progress in the future toward eliminating tariffs  between the two nations.  </P> <P> "We'll come away re-emphasizing the importance of an agreement and of getting  to work on it quickly," said one White House official. "Keeping the economic  relationship on track is the main thing."  </P></p>

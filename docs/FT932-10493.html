			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Dahrendorf quits as Independent chairman SIR RALF Dahrendorf has resigned as chairman of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and Independent on Sunday, blaming his departure in part on the company's failed attempt to buy the Observer. Sir Ralf, appointed chairman in February 1992, resigned on Monday, a few days after The Guardian announced that it had beaten Newspaper Publishing in its bid to win ownership of the Observer. Sir Ralf did not think it was right for Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, chief executive and editor of The Independent, to buy the liberal Sunday newspaper and effectively close it down as a separate title. In a tough resignation letter Sir Ralf, a former head of the London School of Economics and now warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, was also critical of the management style of the company under Mr Whittam Smith. Sir Ralf made it clear to friends even before the resignation letter that he did not approve of an authoritarian rather than collaborative style of management. He has made it clear that he was increasingly out of sympathy with the political line of The Independent, which he found too right-wing. It is believed the distinguished academic found the more left-of-centre Independent on Sunday more to his taste. The Independent carried a five-line announcement yesterday that Sir Ralf had resigned but gave no explanation and no hint that fundamental disagreements were invol-ved. Mr Whittam Smith declined to discuss Sir Ralf's resignation yesterday or the reasons for it. He said however that a successor would be announced soon. 'We're not quite there yet,' said Mr Whittam Smith, who is also criticised in Paper Dreams, a book by Mr Stephen Glover, a fellow founder of The Independent, which is about to be published. Mr Glover resigned amid rows about the integration of The Independent and Independent on Sunday. Mr Whittam Smith denied rumours that his attempt to make an increased bid for The Observer had been blocked by El Pais of Spain and La Reppublica of Italy, the largest shareholders in Newspaper Publishing. He said he had made a bid for the Observer and stuck to it. Sir Ralf Dahrendorf was understood to be particularly close to the continental European shareholders of Newspaper Publishing.</p>

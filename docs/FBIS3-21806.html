This exchange is allegedly  being negotiated by Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers and African  guerrilla elements who, since the 1970's, have received weapons  manufactured in the former USSR. This week the Rio de Janeiro  PF (Federal Police) started to investigate the relationship  between Brazilian drug traffickers and African guerrilla  elements.    Rio de Janeiro PF Superintendent Edson Antonio de Oliveira,  42, said the suspicion regarding the exchange of drugs for  weapons surfaced with the confiscation in Rio de Janeiro  shantytowns of ammunition made in the former USSR member  countries.    The occupation of the Mangueira shantytown (in northern Rio  de Janeiro) by agents of the Civil and Military Police early  this week interrupted the "war" between drug rings that has  already resulted in 14 deaths, and the seizing of Russian-made  AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle shells. This rifle can fire up to 800  shots per minute.    Oliveira said that foreign weapons acquired by the Rio de  Janeiro drug traffickers usually come via Miami (United States)  and Paraguay. The superintendent asserted: "Russian weapons do  not come through these two routes because this type of weapon or  ammunition do not exist in Miami or Paraguay."    The PF investigations have shown that the Russian weapons  may  be coming from Africa through the Middle East and Asian  countries such as Afghanistan, that have overcome difficult  phases of regional wars and battles.    Oliveira commented: "Russian weapons are cheaper because  there are great quantities of them in African countries in  conflict and in Lebanon. We are greatly concerned. As soon as  these conflicts are over, the excess weapons are put up for  sale."    The contacts between Rio de Janeiro underground  organizations  and terrorists of countries such as Angola, Namibia, and Zaire  may be being made by Africans who enter Brazil as tourists.    A new route for the international trafficking of weapons may  be being established the same way as Africans acted as middlemen  for the shipment of cocaine from Brazil to Europe -- the  Nigerian connection.    Since the 1980's Rio de Janeiro represents a sort of  supermarket for the population of poor African countries.  Thousands of Angolans, Nigerians, Zairians, and Ghanaians come  to Rio de Janeiro every year as tourists and return loaded with  all sorts of merchandise (from sandals to electrical appliances).    The PF is investigating whether these tourists are not  representatives of guerrilla organizations, in charge of  maintaining contact with Rio de Janeiro criminal organizations  such as the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command).    Groups of policemen specialize in supplying drugs and  foreign  weapons to drug traffickers linked to the CV and TC. Parallel  investigations carried out by the Civil and Federal Police came  to the same conclusion.    The DRE (Drug Control Precinct) of the Civil Police has  identified groups of suppliers made up of civil, military, and  federal agents. These groups sell sophisticated weapons that  usually arrive in Rio de Janeiro through the International  airport (northern zone), on their way to the drug traffickers.    One of the groups of suppliers is allegedly headed by Civil  Police Detective Cesar Pereira da Silva. DRE Director Walter  Alves de Oliveira, 54, said the group sold weapons and drugs to  Orlando da Conceicao, or Orlando Jogador, who is regarded by the  police as one of the biggest drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro.  Jogador has cocaine and marijuana "sale spots" in the  Bonsucesso, Penha, and Ramos shantytowns in northern Rio de  Janeiro. Pereira da Silva was arrested last December.</p>

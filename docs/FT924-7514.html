			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Rally marks diminishing fear of the President-elect CLINTON-PHOBIA seems to be diminishing, at least temporarily, in the US credit markets. The long end of the government bond market, which reacted badly in September and October to the prospects of a Democratic presidential victory, rallied strongly last week in spite of Governor Clinton's impending occupancy of the White House. The rally - the most sustained rise for almost two months - was the more impressive for occuring in circumstances which might normally be expected to weigh the market down: a heavy Treasury bond auction and a slew of positive economic reports. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted in late trading on Friday at a yield of around 7.572 per cent, down from almost 7.76 per cent a week before. Three main factors appeared to underlie the change in sentiment: First, the market seems to be coming round to the view - albeit warily  - that it may have over-reacted to a Clinton presidency in sending long bond yields soaring from around 7.22 per cent in early September, interrupting a steady downward trend. Mr Clinton has gone out of his way since the election to reassure the money markets that he is not a fiscal firebrand, and Wall Street is increasingly of the view that his proposed economic stimulus will not seriously ignite inflation, as was once feared. Second, the market saw the removal last week of a second leading cause of recent uncertainty - the Treasury's Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding programme, which turned out better than many had feared. Third, the economic fundamentals still seem relatively benign for the bond market, with inflationary pressures extremely subdued. The market was especially cheered by Tuesday's news that the core producer price index figure rose a scant 0.1 per cent in October, although the enthusiasm was dampened a little on Friday by a strong, but possibly aberrant, consumer price index figure. True, there have been plenty of statistics over the past two weeks to suggest that the US economy may be at last picking up steam, which would normally tend to depress bond prices on fears of inflation. Friday, for example, brought forth a stronger than expected jump in October retail sales and signs of reviving consumer confidence. Even so, growth next year is likely to be subdued at best - many forecasts are pitched around 2 per cent to 3 per cent - and the gloomy end of the economic spectrum insists that the vitality is a mirage. Mr Philip Braverman of DKB Securities, asserts: 'The US economy not only remains mired in deep economic distress, it is still in recession.' The green shoots of economic growth visible over the past few weeks seem likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to leave monetary policy on hold, with the Fed funds rate at 3 per cent, when its policy-making Open Markets Committee meets tomorrow. Wall Street does not rule out the possibility of the Fed easing once more before Christmas if the unemployment report for November, due out in early December, turns out very weak. Diminishing hopes of easier short-term money, combined with the rally in long bonds, have helped to narrow somewhat the yawning yield differential between short and long term instruments. The 30-to-10 year spread narrowed to 76 basis points last week, while the 10-to-two year spread dropped to 230 basis points. That could have further to go if the market keeps its nerve over President-elect Clinton, though many analysts see a yield of 7.5 on the long bond as a tough floor to break through in the short-term. However, sentiment, could be significantly affected by the governor's choice of treasury secretary.</p>

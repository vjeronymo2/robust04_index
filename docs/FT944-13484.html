			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BFI warns Attwoods investors Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste group stalking Attwoods, yesterday sought to steal a march on the UK company by urging investors to be wary of promises made in fighting off the Pounds 364m cash bid. The letter was sent to shareholders in advance of Attwoods' second defence document, which is expected this week. Attwoods is thought to be planning to publish projections on sales and profits which would show expectations of a substantially improved performance in 1995. The defence is expected to reinforce Attwoods' argument that the offer is too low. BFI said its own document 'reiterates that the group has not lived up to its promises.' Since 1992 operating margins and earnings per share had fallen, while debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds had risen. BFI quoted a series of statements made by Attwoods since 1992 to support its claim that the group had consistently failed to deliver on promises of improvements. 'Don't take any more chances,' BFI said. 'Don't gamble your investment and risk further disappointment. We urge you to accept the BFI offers.' The statements chosen by BFI were excerpts from annual reports and newspaper articles. Attwoods responded last night by saying that the quotes had clearly been taken out of context. 'This is complete nonsense,' the company said. 'No one ever disputed those three years would be difficult.' Attwoods published its own excerpts from annual reports dating back to 1992, indicating substantial uncertainty over trading conditions up to 1994. However, Attwoods said it was grateful to BFI for reminding shareholders of recent confident remarks for 1995. It would shortly outline the specific factors which underlined that confidence. BFI is offering shareholders 109p cash for Attwoods ordinary shares and 85p per preference share. At current exchange rates, BFI said this represented Dollars 9.20 per American Depositary Receipt, equivalent to five ordinary shares. BFI stressed that, if successful, it would pay the declared final net dividend of 3.25p. It is today expected to publish its full-year results showing profits for the first time in its recycling business. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investments yesterday disclosed that it had sold virtually all of its preference shares to Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank.</p>

			<p>Develop   Bi-Based Superconductor by Crystallized Glass Method   <F P=102> 94FE0284A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Dec 93 p  6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0284A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Nagoya Institute of Technology's Professor Yoshihiro  Abe, et al., in cooperation with the Chubu Electric Power  Company, has developed a new way to produce a high-temperature  superconductor encased in metal tubing. Using a crystallized  glass method, melted bismuth-base material is poured into a  tube-shaped container (mold) made of an inactive metal such as  silver, where it is solidified, formed, then reheated while  still in the container, thereby becoming superconductive. The  unique feature of this method is that a substance such as silver  oxide, which releases oxygen at a high temperature and does not  easily obstruct superconductivity is added to the startup raw  material in advance so that superconductivity is achieved  without supplying oxygen during the heating process. This is  being noted as an easy method to produce superconductors with  complex shapes, such as silver-shielded superconducting coil.    To make superconductors practical, they need to be formed  into wire, coils, pipes and many other shapes, but it is very  difficult to do this with bismuth-based materials using  powder-pressing or sintering, the methods normally used. In  contrast, the crystallized glass method, the target of Professor  Abe's R&amp;D, can be used to make any shape because the startup  raw  material is melted at temperatures from 1000C to  1400C, poured into a container with the desired shape, and  cooled and solidified quickly.    However, superconductors made with this method are not  superconductive at the solidification stage. Thus to become  superconductive, the external container had to be removed, then  the substance heated when air or oxygen could be supplied. To  achieve phase 223 and other superconducting crystals, oxygen  must be supplied to change univalent copper ions in the startup  raw material to bivalent copper ions. It was thought, therefore,  that superconductivity could not be achieved if the heat process  was applied when the material was in a non-oxygen state of being  shielded by a metal container.    Methods are being studied to make bismuth-base  superconductors into wire, either by cladding the wire with  metal or by drawing the wire while already clad. Since  processing would be greatly simplified if the metal container  could become the shielding material, Professor Abe, et al.,  studied ways to achieve superconductivity while the material  remained in the metal container, and tried to resolve the oxygen  supplying problem by adding silver oxide to the startup raw  material.    The breakthrough occurred when it was found that most of the  univalent copper ions became bivalent by the release of oxygen  from silver oxide at high temperatures. Addition of silver oxide  to the startup raw material to raise critical current density  has been tried with the sintering method, but this was the first  time that it was revealed that it was possible to achieve  superconductivity through reheating without oxygen or in a  vacuum by the crystallized glass method. Experiments with thin,  long, tube-shaped containers made of silver have been  successful, and it is hoped that this can be developed as a  practical way to fabricate superconductors.</p>

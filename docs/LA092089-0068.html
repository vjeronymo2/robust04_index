			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER DELAYS, CAMPEAU HAS BAILOUT LOAN;  </P> <P> REICHMANN BROTHERS GET CONTROL OF FIRM'S RETAILING UNITS  </P> <P> After more than a week of tense negotiations, Campeau Corp. said Tuesday that  it finally has secured a $250-million loan that will bail out its cash-starved  U.S. retailing companies.  </P> <P> In exchange for the infusion, the wealthy Reichmann brothers of Canada and  their Olympia &amp; York Developments, as expected, gain control of the  retailing units and will oversee Campeau's previously announced overhaul,  including the sale of the glitzy Bloomingdale's chain.  </P> <P> The Reichmanns supplant Robert Campeau, the bodacious Toronto entrepreneur  whose hard-won acquisitions of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores  put his company deep in debt.  </P> <P> Even though the company made much of the notion that its immediate liquidity  crisis has passed, others said they would wait and see.  </P> <P> Heller Financial Inc., a Chicago-based factoring firm that acts as a financial  middleman between clothing makers and retailers, said it has not yet resumed  shipments to the Federated and Allied chains. It halted shipments to the chains  last week when Campeau's troubles were laid bare in financial filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Get New Chief  </P> <P> The firm has advised manufacturing clients that future sales to Campeau's  chains would be "at their sole credit risk" but that Heller would closely  monitor any changes in Campeau's status. That situation still applies,  spokesman John Brooklier said Tuesday.  </P> <P> To restore Campeau Corp. to health, a four-member special directors committee  was appointed to develop and implement plans. A new chief executive and a new  chief financial officer will be named later, Campeau Corp. said.  </P> <P> Although the changes were viewed as a setback to Robert Campeau, he sought in a  prepared statement to put a good face on the arrangement.  </P> <P> "At my request, Olympia &amp; York has agreed to substantially increase its  investment in Campeau and to be primarily responsible for the refinancing and  restructuring," Campeau said. "The significant experience and expertise of the  Olympia &amp; York organization will greatly assist in the endeavor."  </P> <P> Although Campeau retains his chairman's title, a new, pared-down board of  directors eliminates many of his relatives and longtime associates. Among those  are his wife, Ilse, and a son, Daniel.  </P> <P> The board will now consist of 10 members, half its previous size. In addition  to Campeau, 66, they include Ronald W. Tysoe, the 36-year-old president and  chief operating officer of Campeau Corp., and Byron E. Allumbaugh, chairman of  Ralphs Grocery in Compton, of which Campeau owns a majority of the stock. Three  other directors, including Albert Reichmann, were named by Olympia &amp; York,  and the remaining four are from outside.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stymied by Creditors  </P> <P> On the special restructuring committee will be Lionel G. Dodd, chief operating  officer of Olympia &amp; York, who as chairman of the panel could break a tie  with an extra vote; Robert J. Butler, retired president of the Eaton's  department store chain of Toronto; G. William Miller, former U.S. Treasury  secretary and now head of a merchant banking firm in Washington, and Tysoe.  </P> <P> For days, Campeau Corp. had indicated that it hoped at any time to announce the  loan arrangement, but observers said the company was repeatedly stymied by  demands from cautious lenders who wanted to protect themselves. The agreement  was not fully cleared until 6:30 California time Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> Soon after the loan agreement was announced, Allied Stores received $50 million  and immediately covered an interest payment that it had been unable to make  last Friday.  </P> <P> Under the deal, Olympia &amp; York will receive warrants entitling it to buy  Campeau shares. If it buys all 16 million additional shares, its stake in  Campeau would rise to about 38.4% from the 24.5% held now. Meanwhile, Robert  Campeau's stake would drop to 43.2% from about 54%.  </P> <P> The imminent settling of the cash crisis was cause for celebration for at least  one interested party Monday night. Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub, who  has said he would like to buy the 17-store chain, and a 15-person entourage  popped open champagne bottles at Bouley, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan.  </P> <P> CAMPEAU'S U.S. HOLDINGS  </P> <P> Here is a list of U.S. properties Campeau Corp. owns or holds an interest in,  according to the company's 1989 annual report:  </P> <P> Federated Department Stores Inc.  </P> <P> Abraham &amp; Straus, 15 stores in New Jersey, New York.  </P> <P> Bloomingdale's, 17 stores in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, New  Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia.  </P> <P> Burdines, 30 in Florida.  </P> <P> Lazarus, 43 in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia.  </P> <P> Rich's-Goldsmith's, 26 in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee.  </P> <P> Allied Stores Corp.  </P> <P> Jordan Marsh, 26 stores in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,  New York, Rhode Island.  </P> <P> Maas Bros.-Jordan Marsh, 28 in Florida, Georgia.  </P> <P> Stern's, 24 in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> The Bon, 39 in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.  </P> <P> Ralphs Grocery Co.  </P> <P> 139 stores in California. *  </P> <P> Shopping centers  </P> <P> Shoppers World, Framingham, Mass.  </P> <P> Northshore Mall, Peabody, Mass.  </P> <P> Tacoma Mall, Tacoma, Wash.  </P> <P> Northgate Mall, Seattle, Wash.  </P> <P> Bergen Mall, Paramus, N.J.  </P> <P> Columbia Shopping Center, Kennewick, Wash.  </P> <P> Office and mixed-use  </P> <P> 333 Bush Street, San Francisco  </P> <P> Business parks  </P> <P> United States, 937,000 square feet of rentable area.  </P> <P> * Updated from annual report figure  </P> <P> Source: Associated Press  </P></p>

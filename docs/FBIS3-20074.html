			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Yugoslav problem, the issue of The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], and the crucial  organizational problem of the number of minority votes needed  for a veto after expansion are the basic topics at the informal  meeting of the European Union [EU] foreign ministers that opened  yesterday and continues today in Ioannina under the chairmanship  of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Our special  correspondent Pavlos Tsoundos has the following report.    [Begin Tsoundos recording] The foreign minister agreed on  the need to strengthen the EU role in the Bosnian crisis and  decided to undertake an initiative for an overall solution to  the problem. The 12 agreed that (Hans Koschnick), former mayor  of the German town of Bremen, would undertake the administration  of Mostar, where fierce fighting took place between Croats and  Muslims for control of the town. The 12 also decided to work  for the return of the Serbs to the peace process.    In its reports, the Greek presidency welcomed U.S.  participation in the peace process and described as a positive  step the recent agreement for the establishment of a  Croatian-Muslim federation. However, the territorial arrangement  between Croats and Muslims on the one hand and Serbs on the  other hand remains a thorny problem.    On the issue of FYROM, Karolos Papoulias, who presides over  the Council of Foreign Ministers, briefed his EU partners on the  Greek countermeasures against FYROM and they had an initial  exchange of views. It is expected that the discussion will  continue.    A preliminary discussion was held on the critical  organizational problem created by the projected EU expansion as  of 1 January 1995. The talks are expected to intensify through  contacts of the troika-- Greece, Germany, Belgium--with the  British and Spanish sides. According to British sources, London  remained firm in its position favoring an increase in the number  of votes needed for a veto from 23 to 27 in the Council of  Ministers after Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria join the EU  on 1 January 1995. According to reports, Spain, which was  initially aligned with the British position, accepted the  increase in the number of veto minority votes provided that it  would be in force after 1996 when the intergovernmental session  is held to revise the EU institutions.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe noted that some progress  was made in the FYROM issue but did not commit himself to the  possibility of a final solution to the problem. [end recording]</p>

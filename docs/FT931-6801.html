			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Jawboning in the G7 WITH THE notable exception of the US, the leading industrialised countries face an increasingly bleak economic prospect this year. Japan is experiencing the biggest decline in output since the oil shock of the mid-1970s, while the banking system creaks under the weight of mountainous bad debts in property. Germany is sinking further into recession as the Bundesbank sticks doggedly to its anti-inflationary stance. The French economy is hamstrung by absurdly high real rates of interest and actually shrank in the fourth quarter of last year. Meantime the elusive British recovery remains just that: elusive. At times like this, when global growth is unequally distributed and trade imbalances are mounting, leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised countries are tempted to cook up plans to invigorate the world economy. Yesterday President Bill Clinton succumbed to the urge. In an explicit return to the rhetoric of global policy coordination, he called for Japan and Germany to 'act as engines of global prosperity'. And the Treasury Secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen, in London this weekend for the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, has made no secret of his wish to push the G7 into a more active global role. Yet past experience, from the locomotive experiment of the late 1970s, to the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s, suggests that co-operative growthmanship has a nasty way of ending in disaster. Equally to the point, much of the G7 is already pushing in the right direction under powerful domestic impetus; and those countries, like Germany, where policy change is overdue, have a compelling agenda of their own. The Bundesbank is unlikely to succumb to siren calls for looser monetary policy, at least not at a time when its worries about inflation are palpably justified. It is fully entitled, on its past record, to take its own counsel on the appropriate moment to ease. Economic costs Nor are the French likely to be any more accommodating. A country that has been prepared to incur huge economic costs within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism for wider foreign policy goals is unlikely to throw in the towel now for the sake of G7 co-operation. France's reading of its own interests may be difficult for others to fathom, but its dismal unemployment figures bear witness to the depth of the commitment to the franc fort policy. Japan looks a more tempting target for a new US administration. As the world's largest creditor nation, with plenty of room for fiscal manoeuvre, it could readily move in a more expansionist direction; and the US has traditionally exerted greater influence on its domestic affairs. Yet the dire state of the Japanese economy owes much to earlier US demands for looser monetary policy in the second half of the 1980s. Nor are calls for a further appreciation of the yen helpful, since they imply a misreading of the Japanese trade surplus. Japanese exports have shown scarcely any growth over the past two years. The yen, meantime, is already at record levels both in trade weighted and dollar terms. Such has been the pressure on profits in Japanese industry that job cuts are beginning to take place in an economy where the big corporations traditionally shelter the workforce from the depredations of recession. This week's news of Nissan's decision to close a car plant was a further psychological shock. The reason Japan's trade surplus has soared is simply that imports have collapsed as the economy sinks into the mire. Trade imbalance The longer term causes of the US-Japan trade imbalance are structural. They reflect the excessive Japanese propensity to save and the equal and opposite lack of saving in the US. By showing willingness to address an excessive US budget deficit in his State of the Union message, President Clinton is at least moving in a constructive direction. But this new-found fiscal virtue is no reason to pressurise the Japanese when the country is already pulling out the stops to prevent a financial collapse. A further, expansionary fiscal package is widely regarded as inevitable at a time when the Japanese social contract is more seriously threatened than it has been for decades. In short, domestic political pressure and market forces are already pushing Japan in the direction that President Clinton wants. The same is true in all the other economies that have been particularly heavily burdened by debt, not least Britain, where high profile lay-offs this week by ICI and British Gas tend to distract attention from the underlying reality - namely, that the government cannot escape from a severe fiscal bind without restoring rapid economic growth. The moral for the G7 is that there is no harm in jawboning the Germans over their fiscal irresponsibility, nor in seeking to fathom the self-denying economic habits of the French. But Mr Clinton's exhortations on trade, and on assistance for Russia, offer a more promising agenda than any global dash for growth.</p>

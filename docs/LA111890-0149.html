			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RUTH C. JONES; RETIRED KINDERGARTEN TEACHER  </P> <P> Ruth C. Jones, who taught kindergarten at Newhall Elementary School for about  40 years, has died at a Valencia hospital. She was 86.  </P> <P> Mrs. Jones died Wednesday of natural causes, according to a nephew.  </P> <P> Born June 28, 1904, in Hibbing, Minn., she began teaching kindergarten at  Newhall Elementary School in the early 1920s. Upon her retirement in 1962, the  school declared a Ruth Jones Day and honored her with an open house, said Betty  Granger, principal of Old Orchard Elementary School in Valencia.  </P> <P> For several years after she left Newhall Elementary, she would return on the  first day of school to greet the new kindergarten pupils. The walls of her room  at the Santa Clarita Convalescent Hospital, where she most recently lived, at  times were decorated with artwork done by schoolchildren.  </P> <P> She has no immediate survivors. Her husband, Wallace Jones, died in 1964.  </P> <P> Services are private. Eternal Valley Mortuary in Newhall is handling the  arrangements.  </P></p>

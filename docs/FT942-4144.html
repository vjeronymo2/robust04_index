			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Yeltsin decree lifts curbs on foreign banks President Boris Yeltsin, in a further push for economic reform, announced yesterday that he had signed a long-awaited decree lifting severe operational restrictions on western banks. Accompanied by other measures such as the introduction of long-term housing mortgages, the banking decree was a pre-condition for European union ministers to endorse at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday a partnership and co-operation treaty with Russia. Mr Yeltsin said the decree, which lists only those restrictions slapped retroactively on half a dozen western banks which had previously received full Russian banking licences, would 'spark criticism' from Russian banks eager for protection from western competition. EU diplomats said restrictions would be removed not just on EU banks but on US, Turkish and Swiss banks which also suffered from the ban on banks taking deposits from Russian customers. 'There must be gradual, cautious involvement of foreign banks in our commercial and financial life,' Mr Yeltsin said. He gave no details on the decree, which he said would also regulate local banks and strengthen the central bank. Last November Moscow froze new foreign bank entry to Russia until 1996, imposed offshore status on licensed foreign banks and barred them from dealing with Russian clients, in a decree aimed at wooing the country's strong anti-western banking lobby. However, the EU treaty to be signed in Corfu on June 20 still gives Russia the right to close its fledgling financial markets to Europeans who may wish to join it in future. Mr Yeltsin for the first time also promised action to clean up Russia's virtually unregulated financial markets. He said he planned a decree which would combat fraudulent financial advertising and offer some protection to millions of small shareholders created overnight by Russia's mass privatisation campaign. But he also badly let down a key reformer, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, by publicly ordering him not to try to stop the Moscow mayor's 'special' privatisation plan which basically short-circuits Mr Chubais's nationwide programme. However, the Russian leader took a courageous stand under intense pressure from the country's defence lobby for an increase in military expenditure which would wreck the 1994 budget approved by the lower chamber of parliament on Wednesday. He told the military that the only way they would get extra finance would be through non-budgetary sources - such as arms sales like a recent Dollars 550m (Pounds 367m) aircraft sale to Malaysia. He also told them they had to do more to cut military procurement as well as Russia's 3m-strong army. Finally, he said he had ordered the Interior Ministry and domestic intelligence service to cleanse Russia of 'criminal filth', saying gangsters were trying to grab hold of the economy and even to get into politics.</p>

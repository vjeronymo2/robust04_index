			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BARNETT LEADS SANTA MONICA SYMPHONY  </P> <P> Of the four men who have been engaged to conduct the Santa Monica Symphony this  season -- ergo, the four contenders for the post of music director -- John  Barnett, who led the orchestra Sunday evening at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium,  has the longest resume, having conducted in too many cities to list here.  </P> <P> At 72, Barnett is also the oldest.  </P> <P> That may or may not affect his chances to succeed Yehuda Gilad as the  orchestra's sixth conductor; although Gilad was the youngest of five candidates  in 1981-82, Victor Bay, Gilad's predecessor, began his 16-year tenure at the  age of 69.  </P> <P> As his calling card, Barnett chose an all-orchestral program of music by  Beethoven, Elgar and Strauss. Following a serviceable reading of the "Leonore"  Overture No. 1, he presided over a generally respectable, utterly conventional  account of Beethoven's First Symphony. Barnett's Beethoven proved pleasant  enough, but not especially exciting. He infused too little brio into the score,  de-emphasizing, for instance, the syncopated accents in the Scherzo, and doing  little to instill the music with a sense of momentum.  </P> <P> Though the strings found themselves scrambling more than a few times, the winds  remained in good form, even if the woodwind solos were difficult to hear in the  barn-like hall.  </P> <P> Balance problems proved even more bothersome in the Suite from Richard Strauss'  "Der Rosenkavalier," where individual lines, during the tutti sections,  dissolved into a kind of murky fog of sound. Surely, Civic Auditorium was not  entirely to blame.  </P> <P> Still, one found much to admire in this "Rosenkavalier" Suite: Barnett  generated exciting contrasts and paced the 20-minute work intelligently;  moreover, the solos were executed brilliantly.  </P> <P> Before the suite, Barnett conducted the orchestra's strings in an imperfect but  elegantly phrased reading of Elgar's Serenade in E minor.TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

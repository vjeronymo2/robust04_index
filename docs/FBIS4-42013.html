			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Difficult Work Is Ahead of Us"] </F>   [Text] A session of the UN Economic and Social Council  opened in New York yesterday. In terms of significance, it  occupies third place in the structure of the United Nations  after the General Assembly and the Security Council. Ukraine is  a member of the UN Economic and Social Council and participates  in all its sessions.    "This time, our delegation must raise, first and foremost,  the questions of social and economic development of the  Ukrainian state, the course of reforms, and the assistance to  these processes on the part of the United Nations," said First  Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mykola Makarevych. "Besides,  we must also draw the attention of the world community to two  problems that are important and painful for us -- the presently  effective UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia and the  size of Ukraine's monetary contribution to the United Nations.  We will again insist that it is primarily the civilian  population that suffers from the sanctions. That is why we  attach great importance to either canceling the sanctions or  minimizing them. Regarding contributions, very complicated work  is envisioned. We are not only indebted to the United Nations,  but also to other international organizations. Even though the  percentage is, in fact, exceedingly high for Ukraine, the money  must be paid. In this direction, we will continue to elaborate  a mechanism enabling us to correctly calculate the size of our  contributions and submit the relevant information to the United  Nations."</p>

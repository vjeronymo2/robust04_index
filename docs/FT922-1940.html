			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: ADB signals start of borrowing programme AN increasingly ambitious borrowing programme was marked yesterday by the Asian Development Bank. This year, the ADB hopes to borrow over Dollars 3bn from the capital markets. This is expected to increase by around Dollars 500m a year over the next few years. Until last year, the bank borrowed under Dollars 1bn annually. Increased borrowing partly reflects increased lending to the developing nations of Asia. Demand for loans has increased with the pace of economic development. Loan disbursements were over Dollars 2bn last year, against just Dollars 600m in 1986. The ADB was also able to fund some lending from excess liquidity built up during the mid-1980s. Mr Rip Min, assistant treasurer, said excess liquidity resulted from a change in the bank's lending terms in 1986 when it moved from making fixed to mostly variable rate loans. The change was designed to limit the bank's own refunding risk, by ensuring that its return from lending was always in line with its cost of funds. Since market risk was lower, lending margins were cut. As margins were reduced, borrowers pre-paid outstanding loans, leaving the ADB with a substantial over-hang of liquidity which is only now back to the pre-1986 level. The ADB currently makes 'hard loans' to development projects at a margin of 40 basis points over its cost of funds.</p>

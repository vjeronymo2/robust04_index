			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vida Kocjan: "How Will This Year's Budget Pie Be </F> Divided?"; all figures as published]    [Text] On 6 May the State Assembly adopted the state  budget, precisely according to the provisions of the rules of  procedure, since they provide for it to be adopted within three  days. In discussing the 130 amendments, the most important  innovation is that the deputies adopted an amendment from the  committee for infrastructure and thus provided for a  1.3-billion-tolar [T] increase in the state treasury. The  planned deficit thus increased from T11.8 billion to somewhat  more than T12.8 billion, which means about 0.8 percent of the  social product. The additional T1.3 billion will be used for  maintaining regional and local roads.    The budget's framework is:    --T394.8 billion in revenues;    --T07.9 billion in expenditures;    --a deficit of T12.8 billion.    Through a government amendment the deputies allowed an  increase in the State Council's material costs, increasing them  by more than T8.5 million, and also increased other working  expenditures by a little more than T4 million. This year the  State Council will receive almost T138 million of the state pie.    At the government's suggestion, they added another T25  million for the guardian of human rights, so that this job will  now cost citizens more than T2.715 billion.    They took T200 million from the item on material costs for  the Ministry of Internal Affairs and transferred it to the  Ministry of Culture, which will use it for the Triglav National  Park and other regional parks. Instead of T19.094 billion, the  Interior Ministry will only cost us 18.995 billion, and T9.5748  billion will now be spent on the Ministry of Culture.    For the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the deputies, within  the  framework of T4.2395 billion, transferred 40 million from the  promotion item to financing Slovene minorities abroad. The  overall amount remained unchanged.    For the Ministry of Defense, they increased material costs  by  T220 million and reduced by that amount the item on machinery  and other equipment, capital maintenance of military equipment  and weapons, and maintenance of material-technical resources.  The deputies allocated more money for training the Territorial  Defense reserves (by more than T68 million), financing the  increase from other items for that ministry. They increased by  T240 million the amount for feeding soldiers performing military  service, obtaining that amount by redistributing items within  the defense budget. This year's final amount for that ministry  therefore remains the same -- T24.6545 billion.    At the government's suggestion, T87 million allocated for a  research shaft for the underground storage of gas was taken away  from the Ministry of Economic Activities and transferred to a  new item for geothermal energy. There was a T163-million  reduction in funds allocated for restructuring and preserving  jobs. This year that ministry will receive somewhat less than  T7.691 billion in state money (instead of the initially planned  T7.8536 billion).    The Ministry of Agriculture received a T140-million increase  in funds for the public forestry service, and likewise an  additional 15 million for the comprehensive management of the  countryside and the rebuilding of villages. Another T15 million  was also added for winery roads, and almost as much for  agricultural infrastructure. As a result, there was a  T25-million reduction in the amount planned for the reclamation  of Lendava-Crnec. This year T10.700 billion is expected to be  allocated for that economic activity.    The Ministry of Transportation and Communications received  the most. Because of new investments in regional and local  roads, the public debt was increased by T1.3 billion. This year  about T27.575 billion will be allocated by that ministry.    The deputies also adopted almost all the proposed amendments  to the items for the Ministry of Labor. They increased subsidies  for student food by T150.6 million, but reduced republic  entitlements by T10 million and transferred them to preschool  education for young Gypsies. For constructing new housing  communities for the disabled (in Ljubljana and in Maribor), they  added a new item in the amount of T32 million. That amount,  however, was reduced by subsidies in the Ministry of Economic  Relations and Development. This year that ministry will be  allocated approximately T86.700 billion.    The Ministry of Education and Sport was allocated T1.4  million for athletic scholarships, and that amount will increase  the deficit further. This year the deputies allocated T62.148  billion to that ministry.    From the state reserve funds, the Ministry of Finance was  allocated T35 million to build a secondary school in Izola. This  year that ministry will receive T115.6203 billion.    There were no major discussions about the other ministries.  We can only single out the discussion about the items for the  Ministry of Culture, in which the deputies rejected most of the  proposed amendments.    We cannot overlook the fact that in the very first draft  budget for this year, the president of the Republic of Slovenia,  the State Assembly, and the Constitutional Court were given  exactly as much money as they requested (T202.3 million, T2.0694  billion, and T496.1 million, respectively). Consequently there  was no discussion about the items for these three big consumers,  and likewise they did not submit additional amendments.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Signs of a return to fundamentals - Capital &amp; Credit A more optimistic mood seems to have settled on the European government bond markets in recent weeks. Yields on German bonds have fallen back by almost 0.5 percentage points from their peak of 7.3 per cent in June. Last week alone, UK government bond prices rose by almost 3 per cent, despite a slight setback on Friday. Investors may have at last begun to realise that, judging by the economic fundamentals, bonds are cheap and current bond yields attractive. Inflation in Europe remains subdued, even in the UK, which is furthest down the road to economic recovery. 'The fundamentals are at last beginning to exert themselves,' says Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi. 'At some stage the rally may run into profit-taking, but reality does at last seem to be settling in.' 'This rally feels different,' says Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets. 'There is money coming in from the US and people are talking in a different way than they did after earlier rises.' For the first time in many months, there is talk of hedge funds coming back into European markets, particularly the UK and Germany. It was these highly-leveraged pools of speculative capital which abandoned bonds so spectacularly at the beginning of the year and helped trigger the bear market. Institutional investors, it seems, sidelined for so long by uncertainty and market volatility, are also being tempted back into bonds by high yields. It is not surprising that the strongest performers in recent weeks - Italy, Spain and the UK - are those markets that were hit the hardest by the general bond price decline, for it is in these markets that the need for correction is greatest. Also in investors' minds may be the thought that the rise in long-term interest rates caused by the increase in bond yields may slow the pace of economic recovery, forcing a further downward revision to growth and inflation forecasts and providing another spur to bonds. Similarly, the recent strength of the D-Mark against the dollar implies a tightening of monetary policy, further reinforcing the low inflation outlook in Germany and in Europe generally. Many foreign investors have also been attracted into Europe by the gains offered by holding bonds denominated in currencies that are rising. There was also obvious relief in bond markets when the US Federal Reserve did not raise short-term interest rates in an attempt to support the ailing dollar at its meeting on July 6 and following the G7 summit in Naples. Another, simpler explanation of this month's rise may be that many institutional investors sold loss-making bonds ahead of the end of the second quarter, when they traditionally publish their financial reports, and with that hurdle passed, they have returned to the market. However, despite the recent gains, most activity is still confined to the futures market and trading in the cash market remains thin, a sign that confidence has still not fully recovered. Furthermore, the economic fundamentals are not radically different from what they were in the first part of this year, when forecasts of future inflation were already very low. As a result, many commentators think this rally will be short-lived. 'We cannot rule out the possibility that the rally will continue for a few days yet, but in fact nothing has changed,' says Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg. 'The Fed will still raise interest rates, the psychological impact of what has been happening to currencies has gone now, and the problem of issuance remains,' he says. The rise in real yields has been blamed on the large supply of new bonds issued by governments to fund their huge budget deficits. Mr Magnus estimates that the G7 leading industrialised countries will issue Dollars 102bn of gross government debt in the next four weeks. 'All we are seeing is a technical bear market squeeze upwards,' he says. As has been the case throughout this bear market, opinion is divided. There may be a real test of market sentiment this week when the Bundesbank comes to the market with an auction of 10-year bunds, after cancelling its last two auctions due to lack of demand, and the Bank of England announces details of its auction of conventional gilts, the first time it has dared to tap the longer end of the yield curve for some time.</p>

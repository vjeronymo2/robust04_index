			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Media Futures: 3i acquires 25% stake in First Information Group Touch the screen representations of a Pounds 10 and Pounds 5 note in the museum of the Bank of England and interesting things start to happen. The cricket game from The Pickwick Papers of Charles Dickens on the back of the Pounds 10 note comes to life , as does Stephenson's Rocket locomotive on the back of the Pounds 5 note. They are part of an award-winning CD-Rom recounting the history of the Bank, now celebrating its 300th anniversary, produced by First Information Group. Today FIG, which believes it is the UK's largest independent multimedia company, announces that 3i, the investment capital group, has bought 25 per cent of the company for Pounds 4m of equity and loan finance. It is 3i's largest investment in multimedia so far. FIG was set up less than a year ago by Mr James Edmonds,the entrepreneur who recently flew a microlite aircraft from Wiltshire in England to China to raise money for charity. To create FIG, he organised a management buy-out of Chrysalis Multimedia from its parent group. Mr Edmonds is a 48-year-old lawyer who built up a US-based holiday and travel business sold in 1992 for Pounds 50m. 'I made a bomb, but I didn't want to retire. I spent a year with colleagues looking for something to invest in and we decided on multimedia,' said Mr Edmonds. FIG plans to use the 3i money to purchase the electronic rights to a wide range of established educational and training books and add digital moving and still images and sound to the original text. Agreements in principle have already been signed with publishers for as many as 30 titles, plus options on others, and FIG will now act to finalise the deals. Initially titles will be aimed at the US market, as that is where the installed CD-ROM base is at the moment. The first title, to be released by Christmas, is likely to be a history of the American Civil War. Another title in development is a children's encyclopaedia. 'It's a simple philosophy. We sell off the back of the established books,' says Mr Edmonds, who hopes that multimedia is about to take off and that he will make another 'bomb' as a result.</p>

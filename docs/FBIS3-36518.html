			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Recently, the Georgian minister of agriculture and  food production and the Turkish minister of agriculture and  rural affairs signed a protocol on technical, scientific, and  economic cooperation between the two ministries in Ankara. It  contains four paragraphs and stipulates the extension of  cooperation in the spheres of agriculture, food production,  cattle-breeding, and fisheries. Our correspondent Dilar  Jvebenava has been told at the ministry that Turkish experts are  expected to visit in the very near future and will carry out  research of conditions for cooperation. This will be followed  by a return visit by our delegation. Thus, partnership with a  neighbor is useful, especially with Turkey as a wealthy,  politically stable, and economically strong country, which is in  line with European standards and where the Georgian diaspora is  best represented.</p>

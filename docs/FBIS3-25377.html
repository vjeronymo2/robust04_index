			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] today fired more than 20 machine gun rounds at an  aircraft of the World Food Program and hit one of its wings.  After carring out a mission in the province, the Boeing 727  aircraft was shot at as it was returning to Luanda, where it  made an emergency landing. We learned on the site that it will  take some time before repair work can be carried out. UNITA is  intensely shelling the city of Malange.</p>

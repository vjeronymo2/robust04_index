			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / ITV seeks new era for broadcasting THE ITV companies yesterday asked the government to look beyond the debate on the future of the BBC and instead produce 'a new blueprint for a new era'. The television companies also argued for equality of treatment with cable and satellite channels. In their response to the government's green paper on the future of the BBC the ITV companies call for: Changes to ownership rules covering television. A closing of the 'loophole' that allows News International to own 35 per cent of the British national press and 50 per cent of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. Parity of regulation for all commercial broadcasters so that all cable and satellite channels available in the UK would, like ITV, have to meet the EC requirement for a minimum 51 per cent of programmes to be made in Europe. In their submission to the National Heritage Department, the ITV companies say that the 1990 Broadcasting Act which dealt with commercial television was a retrospective document rather than a blueprint for a more volatile future. ITV argues: 'The discussion leading to the next BBC charter in 1996 cannot make sense without careful consideration of the industry as a whole.' The ITV case is backed by a study by consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton on the economic implications of the rapid changes in broadcasting. The consultants argue that only 19 per cent of all programmes on channels available in the UK last year were made in Europe. This could fall to 13 per cent by the end of the decade. Booz Allen says a 1991 trade deficit of Pounds 100m on television programmes will rise to Pounds 640m by the end of the decade without government action. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and LWT chief executive, said: 'If we're not careful the British television production industry could go the same way as the British film industry.' BBC transmitters should be privatised, ITV argues, to provide competition for National Transcommunications, the Independent Broadcasting Authority's privatised transmitting and engineering arm. The ITV companies were unable to agree on whether they wanted an extension of the moratorium on takeovers, which runs out at the end of this year. Instead the government is asked to examine 'the existing ownership regulations in broadcasting in the light of the major changes that are likely to occur in the industry from the mid 1990s on'.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Harcourt General to spin off theatre chain HARCOURT GENERAL, the publishing, retailing and movie house business which used to be known as General Cinema, yesterday announced it was severing its ties with its origins by spinning off its theatre chain business in a distribution of stock to shareholders. General Cinema, which started as a movie house business and owns a majority stake in department stores group Neiman Marcus, acquired Harcourt Brace, the publishing company, in a Dollars 1.4bn takeover in 1991. In March this year it changed its name to Harcourt General. Mr Richard Tarr, chief executive, said that 'although the theatre business represents the historical foundation upon which our company has been built, it is today a relatively small component of Harcourt General and represented slightly less than 5 per cent of 1992 operating earnings.' He believed the business would benefit from being a separate company with direct access to capital markets and freedom to pursue investments and acquisitions. General Cinema Theatres operates 1,351 screens at 248 locations and had operating earnings before corporate expenses of Dollars 11.9m in the year to October 1992, on sales of Dollars 457m. In the nine months to July it had Dollars 20.9m in earnings on Dollars 380m in sales. Harcourt General shareholders will receive one share in the new business, GC Companies, for every 10 shares of Harcourt General common and class B stock. Harcourt General will have no further stake in the business.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Leading Article: EC anti-trust IT IS IRONIC, given Sir Leon Brittan's firm stewardship of EC competition policy, that the European Commission's fitness to exercise power in this field is increasingly questioned. That, however, is as much a tribute to Sir Leon's success in placing competition policy higher on the EC agenda as it is a symptom of unease at the commission's sometimes haphazard record in enforcing it. The need for effective EC-wide competition safeguards in a single market is indisputable and has been explicitly recognised with the passage of the EC merger regulation. However, the procedures for achieving this goal are flawed. Not only do they lack clarity; but in a community where the biggest threats to free markets are often the actions of governments rather than of companies, they are too prone to political manipulation. This week, Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission urged that at least some of the EC commission's powers be transferred to an independent authority. Sir Leon has rejected such demands in the past, asserting that any alternative to the present system would be at least as vulnerable to political interference. But while there may be some truth in his argument, it ignores two important points raised by Sir Sydney One is that by acting as investigator, prosecutor, judge and executioner, the commission risks conflicts of interest by combining too many incompatible roles. Sir Sydney proposes giving responsibility for investigation and adjudication to a body independent of the commission, or at least of its prosecuting arm. Secondly, such a body should routinely publish its detailed findings. That would inject much-needed transparency into a system which currently imposes no onus on Brussels to justify competition decisions. These proposals would favour fairer and more consistent decision-making, though they would not of themselves safeguard against political meddling. There is room for debate on how that could best be achieved. But for Brussels to persist in denying any need for reform would be both myopic and contrary to the principles of efficient and equitable policy which Sir Leon has sought energetically to uphold.</p>

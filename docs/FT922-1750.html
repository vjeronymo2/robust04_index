			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: It's nicer to stay in bed - London Markets FOR MUCH of the week, investors must have wished they had imitated Pandora Maxwell's brisk way with early-morning callers. If only they had stayed in bed, everything would have been fine. It's getting up that causes the world's problems. On the other hand, there are sometimes unforeseen consequences of drawing the duvet firmly over your head. Take the GPA flotation, for example. When that nice Tony Ryan came knocking at the door, offering stock in his aircraft leasing company, the UK's investment community rolled over in bed mumbling: 'Wake me when it's over.' So did everybody else in the known investing universe, except the retail customers of Nomura in Japan. Judging, wisely, that 10,000 Osaka housewives were unlikely to prove a stable capital base, the company pulled the flotation in the early hours of Thursday morning - at about the time, curiously enough, as the TV crews clambered into their Range Rovers and set off for their dawn vigil outside the Maxwells'. At this point, Pandora Maxwell was not the only one to feel a cold chill creeping in under the bedclothes. GPA itself was a bit of a special case: a giant company based in a small economy, market leader of a business that is viewed generally as the financial equivalent of heavier-than-air flight. (Do you really understand how a jumbo stays up? Well, neither do I; and that goes for aircraft leasing, too). But no matter how special GPA was, the failure of its flotation was bound to send ripples through the market. In Thursday's trading, it is hard to disentangle the impact of the GPA announcement from the after-effects of falling share prices in New York and Tokyo, factors which themselves contributed to GPA's decision. Nonetheless, GPA certainly contributed to Thursday's 35.7-point drop in the FT-SE 100 index. And its impact will linger. A string of other issues - most importantly, the sale of a big chunk of the stock in Wellcome, the drugs company - hang over the market. Although shares bounced back on Friday, investors are likely to be jumpy until the Wellcome sale is safely out of the way in mid-July. They have a lot to be jumpy about. The chart alongside shows what has happened to the FT-Actuaries All-Share index over the past five years: nothing. On July 16 1987, the peak of the 1980s' bull market, the All-Share closed at 1238.57. On Thursday, it closed at 1,238.10. If you had owned a representative portfolio of shares worth Pounds 50,000, you could have sold them in the summer of 1987, bought them back again this week, and still had enough change for a pint of beer and a packet of crisps. You can come to two conclusions about the market's inability to stay above the 1987 peak for long. The first is that the last leg of the 1980s' bull market was an aberration, an unsustainable leap into the stratosphere which should be ignored when you plot a steady trend of long-term growth for equity values. The second, less comforting, is that things have changed: UK equities cannot clamber back above their 1987 levels because, for the foreseeable future, the domestic economy is trapped in a tunnel of slow economic growth and low returns. On the first view, UK equities may be going nowhere for the moment, but that is purely a temporary phenomenon: the only thing holding them back is high German interest rates and, when the markets start to expect a decline there early next year, equities will take off again. Coming from one of Britain's top fund managers, that view sounded plausible enough this week. There is only one snag: it is exactly the same case he was making at the turn of the year, when he was expecting German interest rates to come down in the spring of 1992. That date has now slipped a year. If it slips much more, the debate over whether we are in a normal pattern (slightly delayed) or in some new unpleasant phase becomes simply one of nomenclature: the substance is the same. Support for this thesis came from economic and corporate announcements this week. Retail sales volume, seasonally adjusted, rose by only 0.3 per cent in May; averaged out over that month and the two before, sales were 0.1 per cent lower than in the previous three months. Manufacturing output in April rose 0.3 per cent, continuing an upward trend that began in February. Recovery from recession clearly is proving slow and painful. On Thursday, ICI warned analysts that signs of an upturn it had noticed in UK demand during late March and early April had petered out. 'We can only hope rather than expect an economic upturn to help us in the second half of the year,' said Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief operating officer. All this could be seen as evidence that, clamped in the European Monetary System - a vice that became a bit more robust this week as Irish voters said yes to the Maastricht treaty - the UK has no choice but to come to terms with German or French standards of economic competitiveness. Of course, if you believe, like that fund manager quoted earlier, that the UK's big manufacturing companies have been through their restructuring and are now fully competitive with their international rivals, then you have reasonable grounds for thinking that the present economic unpleasantness will soon be over. On the other hand, Monday's trade figures showed a 25 per cent rise in import penetration since the trough of the last recession. Looking at those numbers, you might conclude that the problems are deep-seated ones of training, finance, and industrial structure. On this, more pessimistic view, UK equities will really break away from 1987 levels only when the economy as a whole is more competitive. While we wait, I think I'll slip back to bed for just a few minutes more . . .</p>

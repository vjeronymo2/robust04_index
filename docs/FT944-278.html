			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Mexican finance minister set to hang on Wall Street wants Jaime Serra Puche's head. Managers at the brokerage houses and mutual funds which have lost billions of dollars in the Mexican market over the past two weeks say the country's finance minister has mismanaged the currency crisis. Confidence in Mexico will not return until Mr Serra goes, the money managers say - always adding a quick 'don't quote me on that'. These foreign investors are unlikely to get their wish. As the economic team surrounding President Ernesto Zedillo yesterday crunched out an economic stabilisation plan, Mr Serra is looking increasingly secure. Ahead of the announcement of the plan, government officials and political analysts said Mr Zedillo would attempt to ride out the crisis without making any immediate modifications in his cabinet and that the new president would try to restore investor confidence by changing policies, not people. 'So far Zedillo's response to this crisis has been tactical, making moves day by day. But he and his people know that to succeed they need to put together a real strategy,' says Prof Guillermo Garduno, professor of political science at the Mexican Institute of Technology. 'Replacing Serra only makes sense as a tactic, but it wouldn't be very strategic less than one month into the government.' A two-pronged political strategy is beginning to emerge. The first part is to blame ex-president Carlos Salinas and Mr Pedro Aspe, his former finance minister, for much of the current crisis. This move would follow a tradition in Mexico of the new president coming down hard on the predecessor who hand-picked him. Specifically, Mr Salinas and Mr Aspe will be taken to task for not devaluing, even when they saw compelling economic reasons to do so. Several senior government economic officials, including Mr Guillermo Ortiz, communications and transport minister, had been privately explaining the need for a devaluation as early as November 1993. But these officials were overruled by their superiors for political reasons, namely the fear that a devaluation would cause the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party to lose votes in last August's election and because it take some lustre off Mr Salinas' campaign to become head of the World Trade Organisation. Mr Salinas' dwindling chances of a move to Geneva, and a post-devaluation poll showing the PRI likely to be crushed in February's state elections, show just how right the two former officials may have been. Obviously, should Mr Zedillo launch such an attack, it would cancel the possibility of every foreign investor's dream come true, namely the return of Mr Aspe to the finance ministry. Most political analysts say bringing Mr Aspe back would be damaging to the presidency. 'Zedillo needs to consolidate power or this is never going to work. Aspe's return would be a recognition that Zedillo is weak and not in control of the situation,' says Prof Garduno. The second part of the president's gambit will be to keep the cabinet intact, but to redistribute finance responsibilities among various ministers. Although Mr Ortiz was the most elegant advocate of devaluation in the Salinas administration and is therefore a prime candidate to replace Mr Serra, Mr Zedillo desperately needs him at communications and transport in order to carry out many of the privatisations that will be a key component of the stabilisation plan. Keeping Mr Ortiz in place would also protect him, leaving open the possibility of him taking over at the finance ministry in the future. Many analysts believe an already devalued Mr Serra will be kept around to do the dirty work of implementing a severe austerity plan and then be dismissed at the end of next year. 'In all wars there are deaths,' says Mr Federico Arreola, a political columnist. 'And in the Zedillo's war against economic difficulties, Serra will eventually have to be sacrificed. . . even though he might not be at fault.' Yet government officials recognise that this strategy will not work unless the war in Chiapas province is resolved and political stability is restored. In fact, since the financial crisis began nearly two weeks ago, more progress has been made towards reopening negotiations in Chiapas than on the economic front. 'In terms of restoring confidence in this government, a solution in Chiapas would be worth one hundred cabinet changes,' says a government official.</p>

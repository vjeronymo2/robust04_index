			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is also currently planning to propose in November 1994, a second tier standard. Under this standard, beginning on January 1, 2005, freshly manufactured locomotives and locomotive engines will be required to meet a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission standard no higher than 6.0 g/bhp-hr. EPA is also considering standards more stringent than this number, to approximately 4.0 g/bhp-hr. EPA requests comment on the feasibility of these standards, especially on the use of diesel fuel. Again, on the basis of an average locomotive and an average train, this requirement represents a reduction of between 61 percent to 65 percent in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from uncontrolled levels when fully phased in.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also intends to set standards for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate and smoke emissions for freshly manufactured locomotives and locomotive engines. To the extent EPA regulates remanufactured engines, the standards for these pollutants will also apply to these engines. The standards that become effective in 2000 will be set at levels that approximately equal present emission levels. For the standards that become effective in 2005 for freshly manufactured locomotives, EPA is presently considering some increase in the stringency of the particulate standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission controls on freshly manufactured locomotives would achieve only limited emission reductions in the time frame required for compliance under the California FIPs without some effort to significantly enhance turnover. EPA's best estimate of emission reductions resulting from freshly manufactured locomotives is approximately a 5 percent to 7 percent reduction in locomotive NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions in 2005, and a 11 percent to 14 percent reduction in 2010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Remanufactured Locomotives. While EPA's authority to regulate freshly manufactured locomotives is clear from section 213(a)(5), EPA has not yet determined whether to regulate remanufactured engines in its national rule. National regulation of remanufactured locomotives would alleviate many of the concerns described above regarding interstate commerce and could potentially avoid intermodal shift. It would also get quicker and more lasting reductions in emissions for the nation than would a rule which only regulated freshly manufactured locomotives. However, it would be designed to achieve reductions appropriate for the nation and may not be as aggressive as regulations applied to other sources in California. EPA is therefore proposing two options for remanufactured engines, a national approach and a California only approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to keep in mind that there are at least two types of remanufactured engines. First, there are those engines built before the effective date of EPA's regulations on new locomotives. Most of these engines can be remanufactured to achieve emissions levels lower than they are currently meeting. Second, there are those engines built to comply with EPA's national regulations on new locomotives. If EPA does not regulate remanufacture of these engines, most of the engines will be unregulated after they reach their first rebuild. Depending on the emissions standard they are designed to meet and the technology used to meet it, these engines could be remanufactured to meet substantially more stringent levels. On the other hand, requiring them, after remanufacture, to continue to meet the emissions levels they were designed to meet would not add any cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A national or state remanufactured engine emission standard could affect either or both groups of engines. EPA is discussing them together because they raise very similar legal and enforcement issues. Additionally, it is our understanding that CARB is considering regulations that will affect both groups of engines. Commenters are encouraged to consider the requirements and note any differences that need recognition in their comments. EPA also requests comment on any other alternative plan or plans to achieve meaningful emission reductions from remanufactured engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Option I: National Regulations. Under Option I, a national locomotive program would be proposed in November 1994 which would regulate locomotives and locomotive engines remanufactured after January 2000. These locomotives and locomotive engines would be required to comply with an emission standard such that emissions would not exceed approximately 8.0 g/bhp-hr, for locomotives manufactured prior to January 2000, or the standard the engine was originally certified to meet, for locomotives manufactured beginning in January 2000. EPA expects that this option will be generally feasible for locomotives and locomotive engines manufactured after January 1, 1973 and would apply until scrappage to all locomotives affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the American Association of Railroads the usual time between rebuilds for Class I railroads is approximately 6 years. Therefore, most, if not all affected locomotives should be remanufactured within six years of the program being implemented, i.e. by January 2006. EPA's best estimate of emission reductions attributable to this option, including the reductions achieved from freshly manufactured locomotives, is approximately a 35 percent to 43 percent reduction in 2005, and a 38 percent to 46 percent reduction in 2010 from the unregulated baseline, depending on the assumed levels for today's unregulated engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 22 (CTK) -- An overriding unwillingness  to decentralize the state is one of the reasons for putting off  discussion of the constitutional bill on the creation of higher  units of local administration, Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA)  Deputy Oldrich Kuzilek told journalists today.    He said the government's failure today to support the bill,  put forward by ODA Deputy Chairman Jan Kalvoda, was the result  of excessive procrastination with regard to the material, which  had been at the government's disposal for a long time.    Unwillingness to discuss the material was also the result of  some coalition parties being unable to form an opinion on the  issue. "I could show most evidence of this inability in the  Civic Democratic Party (ODS)," Kuzilek said.    Chairman of the Deputies' Group of the Christian Democratic  Party (KDS), Marek Benda, said the government's decision could  have been expected. "There were fairly substantial reservations  towards the material, and from different coalition parties," he  told journalists. The fact that the government was going to  discuss the problem again next week was a signal that there was,  however, a will to finish dealing with it, he said.    With regard to speculation that the government might suggest  shifting the deadline of June 30 by which it had undertaken to  put a bill on the matter before parliament, Benda said he did  not believe the KDS would consider June 30 uncrossable.    While KDS leaders would be willing to consider putting back  the deadline, they were not able to consider rewriting the  constitution. "For us, the constitution is a law which we intend  to honor," Benda said.</p>

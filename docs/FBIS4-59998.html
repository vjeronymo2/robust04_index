			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Eudes Barbier] </F>   [Text] Dubai, May 18 (AFP)--Yemen's two-week-old civil war  has begun to paralyze the country, hitting its oil industry and  threatening the entire economy of one of the world's poorest  nations.    Yemen relies heavily on foreign currency earned from exports  of its total oil production of 320,000 barrels per day (bpd).  But heavy fighting between rival north and south forces has  badly hit the industry.    The Canadian oil company, Canoxy, has already suspended  extraction of 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the al-Masilah  fields in the eastern province of Hadramaut.    Tankers, faced with higher insurance fees because of the  war,  refuse to load at the port of al-Mukalla, 700 kilometers (435  miles) east of the southern capital Aden and the destination of  al- Masilah's oil.    However, the American oil company Hunt has continued to  operate in another major field at Ma'rib, east of the capital  Sanaa, piping out oil to the port of al-Hudaydah on the Red Sea.    The war has also created a rush on fuel in Sanaa, the  northern capital cut off from oil supplies from the country's  only refinery in the southern stronghold of Aden.    Long lines of people queue daily at gas stations for small  quantities of fuel distributed by the army which has  requisitioned most of the available supplies.    The operation of the Little Aden refinery, at the extreme  west of the bay of Aden, is also threatened, even though it has  been working to full capacity. Its output could be severely  reduced or even halted by any suspension in al-Masilah's  production if the fighting continues.    The fuel shortage is limiting the transport of goods and  produce in the north. And, in the south, Aden is surrounded by  fighting and can only be reached by sea.    But many shops and markets in Sanaa and Aden remain well  stocked, despite panic-buying by some families. And banks and  services also continue to operate in the cities, even though  many are badly understaffed.    Schools in Aden have closed, and open only irregularly in  the  north as many foreign teachers have been evacuated. Residents  of Aden are unable to leave the city, but Sanaa is almost  deserted after people fled to take refuge in nearby villages.    The massive evacuation of thousands of European and Asian  expatriates has also thrown many sectors of the economy in  disarray.    But the fighting has not adversely affected the Yemeni  currency which has only risen slightly to 80 rials a dollar in  Sanaa and Aden, whereas before the war it was around 70 rials to  the dollar.    Experts say the rial has been saved by a busy black market,  always strong in Yemen, classed as one of the 32 least developed  countries in the world.</p>

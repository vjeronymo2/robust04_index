			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 18 -- According to a forecast prepared  by the Agriculture Ministry and the Agricultural Market Agency  grain crops will amount to about 25.1 million tons this year and  will be higher by over 1.5 million tons than in 1993, Deputy  Agriculture Minister Jerzy Pilarczyk told the Senate Agriculture  Committee on Wednesday.    If the forecast proves true farmers will want to sell some 3  million tons of grain this year. However, according to the  Chairman of the Agricultural Market Agency Kazimierz Gutowski  grain storage and processing plants will be able to purchase  about a million tons and the agency a further 800,000 tons.  Other enterprises will have to be found to purchase the  remaining 1.5 million tons that can be offered by farmers, he  told the senators.    The State Atomic Energy Agency will prepare within a year  and  present to the government a programme of ecologically safe  storage of radioactive waste materials, the agency's president  Jerzy Niewodniczanski told the senate's Environment Protection  Committee on Wednesday.    During the discussion on the subject the senators focused on  the activity of services responsible for monitoring the level of  concentration of radioactive substances in the air, water and  soil as well as the preparation of border guards in discovering  and foiling the attempts at smuggling hazardous substances into  Poland.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Lonrho hotel deal could fall foul of US embargo THE US is seeking further details on the Lonrho sale of a share of Metropole Hotels to Libya before deciding whether the deal brings the hotel group under the terms of its six-year-old embargo on US dealings with Libyan institutions. US companies and individuals would be barred from doing business with the hotel chain if the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) decided the deal brought the hotels under the embargo's terms. Breach of the embargo is punishable by large fines or even prison sentences. The US ban on dealings with Libyan interests was established in 1986 after US intelligence alleged Tripoli was behind the terrorist bombing of a nightclub in Berlin which killed a US soldier and wounded 60 American citizens. More than 60 companies are on the OFAC list of proscribed institutions - most of them wholly Libyan-owned or Libyan-controlled. US officials said yesterday it was unclear whether the state-run Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company's one-third share of Metropole Hotels was enough to make it count in OFAC's eyes as a Libyan entity. OFAC blacklisting could bar US citizens from staying in Metropole hotels. Most are in Africa and the UK. The US is so far the only country barring trade with Libya, although the EC has had an arms embargo in place since 1986 and restrictions governing the number and movements of Libyan diplomats. Many observers suggested that Libya's willingness to go ahead with the deal indicated that Tripoli was confident the United Nations would not impose a full trade embargo or freeze on Libyan assets to follow the arms and civil air ban likely soon to be voted upon by the Security Council. British officials say they will rule out no measures to increase pressure on Tripoli, but suggest an assets freeze would by no means be the next step. Libya has nevertheless shifted up to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of its liquid assets out of British and other European banks to safer havens in the Middle East apparently to safeguard against a possible freeze. However, Tripoli has so far done nothing either to liquidate its other European assets or to change their ownership structures. Most of its interests lie in its Tamoil petroleum distribution network in Italy and Switzerland. Moreover, Libya has recently bought both hotels in Egypt and several office blocks in London - again suggesting that it does not feel immediately threatened by an assets freeze.</p>

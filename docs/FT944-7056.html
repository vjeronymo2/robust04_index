			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): A reader writes While on holiday in France in the summer at EuroDisney, its staff made two separate errors while processing payments on my Visa card. Both required credits to be made. When I got my statement, however, I noticed there was a loading of around 5 per cent on these credits. On querying this, I received a further credit. I then found that a friend had exactly the same problem on a holiday in the US  -also involving Disney. I wonder if other readers have had similar experiences.

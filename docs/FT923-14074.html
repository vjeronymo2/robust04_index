			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Observer: Howdo, pardner? The success rate of husband-and-wife teams in retailing is scarcely one to threaten wholesale redundancy among marriage guidance counsellors. Admittedly, Body Shop's Anita and Gordon Roddick appear to have made a triumph of both business and married life. But they are very much the exception. Compared with their results in partnership, some couples seem to do better apart. Hence there is more than usual interest in what will happen to Liz and George Davies - the former dream team that used to run Next. Having lost their company in a 1989 boardroom coup and sacrificed their marriage, they are now going their separate ways. George, who is a good 10 years older than his ex-wife, seems to be doing quite well designing casual clothes for Asda. But not a lot has been heard about his new 'Magalogue' - a combination of magazine and catalogue - which was launched with great fanfare earlier this year. Early days yet, but some retailing analysts believe that 39-year-old Liz is a better bet than her husband over the long-term. Yesterday, she popped up as buying director at Mothercare, a Storehouse subsidiary. 'She is the sort of person who gets on and does things, whereas George just makes a lot of noise,' was the verdict of one City figure.</p>

It will be held in the former Russian  Press House, Ul. Pushkinskaya 26, and is to be addressed by  President Boris Yeltsin, a source in the office of First Deputy  Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko told Interfax.    A meeting chaired by Shumeyko on Monday prepared the agenda  for the Federation Council's first day, which includes the  election of the speaker, his deputies, chairpersons for 10  proposed committees and the senior bodies of the house, as well  as voting on session regulations.    Shumeyko is going to run for speaker, the source in his  office said.    Federation Council deputies, who asked not to be identified,  told Interfax that, in addition to Shumeiko and former chairman  of the Moscow City Council Nikolay Gonchar, candidates to the  post of speaker might include the chairmen of the parliaments of  the Russian republics of Karelia and Komi, Viktor Stepanov and  Yuriy Spiridonov. The deputies described the latter two as  "independent politicians standing for a single Russian  Federation."    The deputies said a motion was expected to be made to elect  three deputy speakers, one representing the republics, one the  regions, and one the autonomous areas of Russia.</p>

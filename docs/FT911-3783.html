			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (11): Step by step to private ownership - Case study, Banco Totta &amp; Acores WHAT happens when a state-owned bank becomes private, and how does it prepare for the change? For Mr Alipio Barrosa Pereira Dias, president of the Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA), the first Portuguese bank to be privatised, save for about 16 per cent remaining in state hands, privatisation was a crucial factor for the bank's future development not just because of the change in ownership, but because it enabled the bank to do several things that it could not do before. The privatisation itself took place in three separate stages: an initial floation on the stock exchange of 49 per cent of the bank's share capital in July 1989, followed just over a year later with the sale of anothger 31 per cent stake. A capital increase last December, finally brought the private shareholding in the bank to above 84 per cent. Despite government limits on the purchase of privatised shares by foreigners, Banesto, the Spanish banking group, managed to build up directly and indirectly a controlling interest in the bank. Today, Banesto holds directly around 10 per cent of the shares, while Valores Ibericos - a joint venture with a Portuguese partner in which it holds 49 per cent, has another 28 per cent. Other shareholders are small and in practice Banesto has effective control of the bank. From the very begining, the privatisation had a dramatic impact on the bank. First and foremost, it allowed it to strengthen its capital base and grow. Like all Portuguese state-owned banks that were nationalised in 1975, BTA had seen its need for fresh capital frustrated by the unwillingness of successive governments to provide new funds. A weak capital base was a common problem for the nationalised banks. It was a double handicap at a time when a system of credit ceilings - established in the late 1970s and only recently abandoned - limited the amount a bank was allowed to lend on the basis of its capitalisation. With expansion thus constrained, BTA had to face increasingly tough competition from new foreign and private Portuguese banks allowed to operate once more after an initial liberalisation of the banking system in 1984. By 1989, the need for fresh capital had become urgent if the bank was going to remain competitive and grow. Privatisation came just at the right moment. 'It became possible to raise the bank's capital and with more capital we could expand our activities. This was the most important effect of privatisation,' Mr Dias says. Paradoxically, the credit ceilings now started to work in BTA's favour. The state-owned banks which were denied new injections of funds from the government could only strengthen their own capital base either by issuing limited amounts of participation certificates, or by ploughing back into the bank what profits the state as main shareholder would decide to leave them. This clearly hampered their development, which was already more difficult because of their heavy burden oif bad debts, inefficient structures and overstaffing. The second most important effect was to give the bank a new sense of direction. Mr Dias who had joined BTA in 1988, prepared a new strategic plan for the bank aimed at modernising operations, improving research and internal controls, increasing the number of branches, and making more efficient use of human resources. Staff had to be reduced and productivity raised, older employees were retired early or retrained. Whereas in December 1987 the bank had on average 37 employees per branch, this is now down to 23 employees. The total number of employees has been reduced from about 4,500 in 1988 to 4,200 today in spite of an increase in the number of branches from 127 in February 1988 to 173 now. Mr Dias says he expects to open up another 10 to 15 branches by the end of this year. Productivity has risen dramatically, helped by the introduction of new computing and software systems. Privatisation also meant changes in the image of the bank and in the attitude of its employees. 'Sometimes it was simple things, like employees coming to work in casual clothes without a tie. We had to explain to them this gave the bank a bad image. But you couldn't legislate this, you had to win their cooperation,' he says. Another problem was the length of the privatisation process. For a period of months, the future of the bank and of its shareholding structure remained uncertain. This made it especially important for the bank's management to maintain the full confidence of both the financial authorities and of its staff. 'It was crucial during the privatisation to make people understand the need for the process,' Mr Dias says. Consultations and persuasion created a better climate than edicts from above and sackings, though some lay-offs were inevitable. But over a year and a half after the initial part-privatisation, Mr Dias feels he has overcome the biggest obstacles - 'now we compete on equal terms with the private banks. By next year we'll be in a position to do much more.'</p>

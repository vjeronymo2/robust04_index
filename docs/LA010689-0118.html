			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO';  </P> <P> MIXED REACTION TO FILM FROM REAL TALK-SHOW HOSTS  </P> <P> And what do talk-radio show hosts say about "Talk Radio" -- that movie where  off-the-wall chatter between listener and host bounces back and feeds on itself  and where, from the very beginning, the viewer knows that the man at the mike  will be assassinated?  </P> <P> Some seemingly speak non-stop about it. Others are not talking at all. Still  others have resisted seeing it. And KABC-AM (790), which likes to call itself  the "talk radio" station, has banned any advertising or even discussion of the  film on its air.  </P> <P> "I'm angry about it," said KFI-AM's Tom Leykis, "because there was no need to  kill the main character. Using the shooting of (Denver radio show host) Alan  Berg was, I think, a smarmy attempt to capitalize on all the publicity that  that murder got. Alan Berg was a far more interesting character than the  character in the movie. . . . What really troubles me is that this is the  second movie in less than a year where a radio host is killed. Remember  'Betrayed,' where a liberal talk-show host got shot by a right-wing extremist?  It's real convenient for Hollywood to use radio talk-show hosts as fodder."  </P> <P> "It scares the hell out of me," admitted deejay Jay Thomas of KPWR-FM, who  worries about "Talk Radio" prompting copy-cat murder attempts.  </P> <P> "Some nut goes up there and shoots the hell out of him. Early in my career in  Los Angeles, I was chased by a nut with a knife. I guess he thought my face was  incredibly ugly on the bus. . . .," Thomas quipped, referring to KPWR's ads  plastered across the sides of Los Angeles buses with his face and the slogan,  "We apologize for Jay Thomas this morning."  </P> <P> "The movie was so dark and depressing," Thomas said. "That's not the kind of  radio I do. I play records; I make jokes. They threaten me, I take it back."  </P> <P> "Talk Radio" is loosely based on the life of Berg, a liberal who was gunned  down by white supremacists in 1984. Like Berg, whose show was on station KOA,  the character of Barry Champlain (played by Eric Bogosian) had been in the  men's clothing business and had a quirky yet close relationship with his  ex-wife. Berg was killed in the driveway of his condominium after arriving home  from a dinner date with her.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible film," fumed George Green, president and general manager at  KABC-AM. "It's a misrepresentation of what this business is all about. I told  them (the hosts of his station's programs) not to give any publicity on the air  to that movie. Of course, what they say in a newspaper is up to them.  </P> <P> "We've spent 25, 30 years portraying talk radio as being a quality medium with  quality people," Green added, "and they (the movie makers) took one small piece  of talk-radio history with some murder in Denver and took a tremendous  director, Oliver Stone, and concocted a picture that misrepresented what people  listen to. They portray sickies who may be listening to other stations -- but  very few (stations). Very few managers would tolerate that kind of personality.  </P> <P> "This is Hollywood at its worst," he said. "This picture is not doing this  community any good. There's enough hostility in a community without reaching  down for an incident uncomfortable to people in our business. . . . The real  world is conversations. Do you think there's any semblance between the motion  picture and our radio station?"  </P> <P> Larry King said the fact that he was the only actual talk-show personality  mentioned in the movie -- "you're going to be another Larry King," Champlain is  told early on -- "makes it embarrassing not to like the movie. Alan Berg was  very liberal. Morton Downey is very conservative. This guy (Champlain) really  had no opinion. I would not listen to that show. It's a kind of one-note show.  The caller calls in. He's going to get angry. You didn't learn anything at all.  I was bored. Mostly I was bored. . . ."  </P> <P> "I'm not racing out to see it," said Lee Larson, vice president of KOA in  Denver, who had been the general manager at the time of Berg's murder. "I raced  to read the book, and I found it very good and enjoyable. It captured the  complexity of Alan, and it also helped you see where he was serious and where  he was being a good entertainer. But since the movie was not a true reflection  on his life, it's not the first thing I want to see.  </P> <P> "People tend to exaggerate the talk-show host," Larson added, "especially right  now with what's happening in television talk, with the debate as to whether  some of the talk shows are trash television or a responsible form of  entertainment. And Alan was certainly one pioneer in that area, being somewhat  outrageous in the topics he chose to talk about, some of the opinions he  expressed and the vehemence with which he expressed them."  </P> <P> Not all the talk about "Talk Radio" was negative.  </P> <P> KGIL-AM's Carole Hemingway deemed "Talk Radio" "a very powerful movie. Oliver  Stone wanted to point out just where all the hate leads. It leads to a dead-end  street, and we've been sort of inundated with the Morton Downeys, the Geraldos  and their imitators on radio. . . . I'll tell you something that doesn't ring  true. You never ever get that plethora of sick calls, one after another, but if  a talk-show host spews and breeds hatred the way this one does, anything can  happen."  </P> <P> Despite concerns that the movie "puts all of us in danger," Leykis said he  found "Talk Radio" to be the "most realistic portrayal of radio" that he's  seen.  </P> <P> "The relatively dark studio in which he paces around. He calls people names. I  do. He hangs up, which I do, and (the idea that) talent is nothing but meat. .  . . And the board operator, the engineer, was a carbon copy of the engineer I  had 10 years ago in Phoenix. . . ."  </P> <P> What sounded particularly false to several talk hosts was the fact that  Bogosian's character would be told his program was being picked up for national  syndication with just three days' notice.  </P> <P> In New York, where he has been on WMCA for 38 years, Barry Gray said he hadn't  seen the film.  </P> <P> "It must be psychological because it played here in New York, and I didn't go  see the play either. The Alan Berg kind of radio is not what I do. Michael  Jackson (of KABC-AM) and I are much more alike. Today I talked with a local  Washington bureau chief about (Michael) Dukakis' announcement he was not going  to run for governor (of Massachusetts) again, and whether that meant he was  running for President again. That's the kind of radio I do. I'm not into  insulting people.  </P> <P> "I think shock radio is going to shock itself out of business in another year.  Like the Enquirer, there are just so many three-headed monkeys you can write  about."  </P> <P> And in New York, where disc jockey Howard Stern of WXRK has made a splash with  sharp jibes and put-downs, agent Don Buchwald explained that "quite frankly, he  (Stern) hasn't been commenting on that (movie) at all." Then, interrupting a  reporter's question, Buchwald hung up.  </P></p>

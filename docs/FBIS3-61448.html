Tashker, N.K. </F> Sokolova, Kiev Scientific Research Institute of Occupational  Safety and Health; UDC 616.33/.34-02:[547.262+615.285.7]-07]    [Abstract] The combined effect of ethanol and pesticides,  particularly ethanol's ability to aggravate the toxic effect of  pesticide, is discussed, and the combined effect of  0,0-dimethyl-0-(2-2-dichlorovinyl) phosphate (DDVP) and ethanol  is investigated. To this end, an experiment is carried out on 84  male rats with a mean weight of 220-240 g separated into six  groups (with one control group) with different exposures to one  or both agents. The condition of the test animals was  ascertained by examining a complex of physiological and  biochemical indicators and pathomorphological research. The  status indicators of white rats after oral administration of  DDVP and ethanol is summarized; the study indicates that the  effect of ethanol upsets the behavioral reactions of the animals  who displayed a tendency toward a decreased spontaneous motor  activity (SDA) and a considerable increase in the latent period  of cognitive reflex (LPPR); the summation threshold index (SPP)  increased only in rats who received ethanol alone. A study of  the mixed function oxidase (OSF) shows that it is induced  somewhat in animals exposed to ethanol or the ethanol-and-DDVP  mixture. The conclusion is drawn that the extent to which the  two substances and their combinations affect the test animals  increases in the following sequence: ethanol, DDVP,  DDVP+ethanol, and ethanol and DDVP+ethanol against the  background of alcoholization. Thus, given contact with an  organophosphorous pesticide, ethanol may have an unfavorable  aggravating effect, especially if taken regularly. Tables 1;  references 10: 9 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

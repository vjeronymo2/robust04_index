			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Blow for Names over cover ruling Lloyd's underwriters being sued for alleged negligence yesterday won the right not to reveal the total amount of insurance cover available to meet claims against them. The Court of Appeal ruled that while the underwriters' insurers should disclose to Names the wording of relevant 'errors and omissions' policies, they should not have to reveal the extent of their total cover or the premiums paid. The ruling is a setback for some Names who could have used the information to improve the strategies of their legal campaigns. Full disclosure of the sums available for damages claims could also have acted as a catalyst for possible out-of-court settlements. The Court of Appeal partially overturned an order made by Mr Justice Phillips, the trial judge for the Gooda Walker and Feltrim actions, that the insurers should make full disclosure of the details of their cover to help the courts decide how damages should best be paid. At the centre of the issue is the acknowledgement by all involved that the total damages claimed against underwriters - thought to approach Pounds 3bn  -might considerably exceed the amount of insurance cover available. Following the victory of the Gooda Walker Names, who won damages initially estimated at Pounds 504m, the courts have begun considering how best the damages should be paid. Mr Justice Phillips had been considering whether damages should be paid on a 'first come first served basis' - with the Gooda Walker Names heading the queue - or on another basis intended to spread damages among all successful Names, no matter when their cases come to court. Giving judgment, Lord Justice Saville said the insurers should not have to disclose the total amount of their cover since this was not relevant as a matter of law. However, he continued: 'I do so with regret for it seems to me that in the circumstances of the Lloyd's litigation, there is much to be said for the view that the sooner the parties know where they stand as regards likely recoveries at the end of the road, the sooner and cheaper will be the resolution of this litigation, which can only be for the benefit of all.' Clyde &amp; Co, solicitors acting for the errors and omissions insurers, said a figure for the total cover available would anyway have been 'misleading'. It would not have corresponded to the cover available for individual claims against particular Lloyd's agencies. In a statement, Clyde &amp; Co said the insurers were 'firmly convinced' that the insurance cover for damages awarded to Gooda Walker Names would be 'significantly less' than was available under the Lloyd's settlement offer rejected by Names earlier this year. It also revealed that at the time of the settlement offer Names' action groups - including the Gooda Walker action group - had been offered the chance to verify, on a confidential basis, the level of errors and omissions cover available. The Gooda Walker group had not taken up that offer, Clyde &amp; Co said.</p>

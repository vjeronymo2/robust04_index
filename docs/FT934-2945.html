			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Peruvian equities enter a new period of maturity - Sally Bowen finds that trading has calmed down Lima's small but turbulent stock market looks set for a period of calmer trading patterns. Investors can expect less spectacular gains than hitherto, but their Peruvian holdings should cause them fewer sleepless nights. The Lima bourse - the second most profitable in the world in 1992 with a dollar gain of 125 per cent, according to IFC data - is showing signs of greater maturity. For example, a new law requires purchase orders to be handled in strict rotation, while regulations outlawing insider trading and introducing consolidated balance sheets, both in the pipeline, are further indications that the equity market is coming of age. Expansion since the introduction of liberal economic reform in 1991 has maintained a dizzying pace. Daily turnover now regularly reaches Dollars 10m, against Dollars 300,000 just two years ago, and this year's total has already topped Dollars 1.5bn, up from Dollars 550m in 1992. Until 1993, some eight major shares accounted for 80 per cent of all trading, whereas now that same percentage includes more than three dozen issues. Foreign investors are still responsible for two-thirds of daily trading but, say local brokers, the more speculative investors are moving on elsewhere and there is less volatility. Lima's general share index has put on an impressive 70 per cent in the year so far, even though 22 per cent was knocked off values last month. Some analysts attribute the November slide to an unenthusiastic 'yes' vote in October's referendum on the constitution. Others say that it was a predictable adjustment to over-valuation. Spectacular price rises in the past few years 'have been entirely due to a revaluation of assets', says Mr Federico Laffan, Peruvian fund manager of Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets. Blue chips were 'so ridiculously cheap you just had to put money in - even though reliable information on companies was non-existent', he adds. Distortions originating from the hyper-inflation of the late 1980s has meant that standard indicators are all but useless to measure the real worth of Peruvian shares, and foreign fund managers have had to resort to makeshift indicators such as market capitalisation and sales. 'If you saw a company with sales of Dollars 100m and market capitalisation of Dollars 10m, then the share was extremely cheap,' remarks Mr Laffan. 'Now the markets have emerged from that initial revaluation phase. Even with November's price correction the blue chips look expensive and the earnings tendency is uncertain.' Foreign and Colonial's Peru Fund has done well, however, showing 25 per cent appreciation since it got fully under way in late June. This year's profits have come largely from riskier 'second tier' stocks subject to a revaluation similar to that which the blue chips experienced last year. Selected second liners - often companies bought by foreign investors - have risen by up to 900 per cent this year. But such bargains are no longer to be found and future price rises, say brokers, will be more rational and orderly. 'Peru is coming out of recession and once sales pick up and companies are working nearer full capacity, price/earnings ratios will look attractive again,' says Mr Jose Almenara, general manager of the stock exchange. According to Mr Jose Picasso of Argos, a Lima stockbroking firm, buyers in 1994 will be 'much more selective, looking closely at who is managing a company and how well prepared it is for the changed economic environment'. Mr Picasso predicts that next year's growth will be in consumption oriented companies and mining, a long depressed sector where foreign capital is entering strongly. Most analysts agree that consolidated balance sheets will be a key step in the transformation to modernity. At the moment companies do not disclose the extent of their holdings in other activities. 'If that law comes through,' says Mr Laffan, 'I would turn from my currently neutral position into a raging bull.'</p>

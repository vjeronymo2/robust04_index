			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline/Bayer SmithKline Beecham's sale of Sterling's north American consumer healthcare business to Bayer looks a smart move. SB never needed Sterling's operations to strengthen its US over-the-counter businesses. The driving logic was to fill geographical gaps elsewhere. Yesterday's deal rids the company of embarrassing product overlap and reduces debt which had become sufficiently burdensome to worry some investors. The only possible fly in the ointment remains an as yet unquantified tax charge. Whether Bayer has pulled off a masterstroke is more doubtful. On a romantic level, for the first time in nearly 80 years, the German company enjoys the right to use its own name and the Bayer Cross trademark in the US. Strategically, the group justifies the purchase by arguing it now has strong brand names in the three largest US OTC categories. By 1995, the group expects hopes to have critical mass, with projected annual OTC sales in north America of more than Dollars 700m. Bayer can afford the acquisition, and has been helped by the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar. But the question remains whether the deal is good value. The speed with which it was concluded, and the poor negotiating tactic of announcing interest within hours of SB's Sterling acquisition, will not have reduced the price. At 23 times last year's earnings, the business does not look cheap. Bayer will have to work hard at building margins to avoid the criticism that a German chemicals company has yet again overpaid for assets.</p>

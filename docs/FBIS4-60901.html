			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Korolkov report: "Chernomyrdin Intends To Ease the </F> Lot of the Press"]    [Text] The prime minister has supported a draft law on  state protection, Boris Mironov, chairman of the Russian  Federation Committee for the Press, reported at a press  conference, the state protection in question being applied to  the mass media, book production, and those sectors -- the  printing and paper industries -- which provide them with  services.    Under the draft law, among other things, the printing  facilities of the mass media are exempt from the payment of  customs duties for the import of paper, printing equipment, and  spare parts which are not produced in Russia. Publishing houses  are also exempt from customs duties for the products they  export. The mass media will receive a 50 percent discount on  postal, telegraph, and telephone communication charges.    If the draft law proposed by the Committee for the Press is  passed by the State Duma, it will cost the state exchequer R1  billion. Unlike Chernomyrdin and the Ministry of the Economy,  which have supported it, the Finance Ministry is against. This  is understandable: It fears that other sectors will also argue  their exceptional status and demand similar concessions.</p>

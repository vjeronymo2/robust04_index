			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MISS. STATE-PERKINS TALKS FAIL  </P> <P> Ray Perkins interviewed for Mississippi State's football coaching position, but  the negotiations have apparently broken off.  </P> <P> A sticking point reportedly was Perkins' demand for extensive control of the  football program, according to a published report in today's Clarion-Ledger, a  Jackson, Miss., newspaper.  </P> <P> Perkins, fired Monday as coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Houston Coach John Jenkins said he had been offered a blank check by  Mississippi State Athletic Director Larry Templeton.  </P> <P> "There was no bargaining," Jenkins told Houston television station KRIV. "He  said, 'Here's a blank check, fill in the blanks. What else do you need?' For me  to leave Houston means I'm making a statement, like a marriage to Mississippi  State. I'm looking at a lifetime deal." Jenkins said that despite the offer, he  hopes to remain at Houston.  </P></p>

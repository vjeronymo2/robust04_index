			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sacrosanct dividend is weak ground on which to fight Sir, Paddy Linaker's article, 'City must defend its capital position' (Personal View, April 19), provided a good starting point for debating the City's role in financing companies and its attitudes to dividends. It also underlines the difficulties that institutions are going to face in coming up with a unified approach. Whatever the theoretical strength of the 'dividend discipline' argument, the public perception is of rapacious institutions demanding dividends at the expense of all else and of failing to take their share of the pain in difficult times. In industries where margins and return on capital are volatile, it is difficult to see why dividends should be held through the downswing, especially if this is at the cost of investment in capital equipment, R&amp;D and training - thereby diminishing future growth prospects. The primary function of the stock market is to provide new capital to finance growth, given that capital is finite and needs to be rationed according to where it will earn the highest return. The slightly quaint but durable share underwriting process in the London market has proved highly effective in providing new capital even at times of financial distress. However, the notion that City institutions should encourage companies to maintain dividends at all costs and then to pay those dividends back via an equity issue seems iniquitous. It is also grossly tax inefficient. The M&amp;G should be congratulated on encouraging the City to set the agenda in the debate about savings and investment flows. However, if it chooses to rally around the banner of sacrosanct dividends, it will be fighting on weak ground.

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS DEFEAT OILERS TO END LOSING STREAK  </P> <P> Running back John Stephens sparked New England's offense, and the defense shut  down the AFC's highest-scoring team as the Patriots beat the Houston Oilers,  23-13, Sunday.  </P> <P> Stephens, sidelined the last two games with an ankle injury, opened up New  England's running game, making it easier for quarterback Doug Flutie to throw  and the Patriots to end their three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Stephens gained 59 yards in 21 carries and played key roles in New England's  first three scoring drives. He also ran for an 11-yard touchdown that gave the  Patriots a 20-3 lead with 5:58 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "The fact that we were running the ball so well made it a little bit easier on  our offensive line" to block on pass plays, said Flutie, who was sacked just  once.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel there was anything their defense could do that we weren't  prepared for," said Stephens, the AFC's second leading rusher as a rookie last  year.  </P> <P> Greg Davis added three field goals as the Patriots, who began the game as the  AFC's lowest-scoring team, matched their point total for their previous three  games.  </P> <P> "There was a sense of urgency," Flutie said. "We wanted to win badly, and if  you want it badly enough, you can do it."  </P> <P> Houston Coach Jerry Glanville was frustrated with the Oilers, who lost two  fumbles on kick returns that set up touchdowns.  </P> <P> "You can't win if you can't make basic plays," he said.  </P> <P> The Oilers, who averaged 38 points in their previous three games, got field  goals by Tony Zendejas of 46 yards on the final play of the first half and 22  yards early in the fourth quarter. Warren Moon threw a 20-yard scoring pass to  Drew Hill, cutting the lead to 23-13 with 5:11 left.  </P> <P> Moon was sacked three times and intercepted twice after completing a career  high 82.6% of his passes in a 39-7 win over Miami last week. He completed 14 of  29 passes for 227 yards against the Patriots.  </P> <P> The Patriots (2-3) got a first-half touchdown for the first time in four games.  Marvin Allen's one-yard run with 1:08 left in the first quarter made the score  10-0. It was set up by Stephens' seven-yard run for a first down at the Houston  one-yard line.  </P> <P> Davis kicked field goals of 30 yards in the first quarter and 34 yards in the  third quarter, giving the Patriots a 13-3 lead. He added a 43-yarder with 6:49  left.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Pep offers 10% A NEW personal equity plan offering a tax-free income of 10 per cent has been launched by fund management group John Govett. The fund, which is an authorised unit trust, will invest in UK equities and government bonds issued by overseas countries. The equity portion - which will have to be at least 50 per cent to qualify for Pep rules - will yield between 5.2 and 5.7 per cent. That puts a heavy burden on the bond portion of the portfolio to provide the bulk of the income. Accordingly, the fund will venture into markets such as Turkey, where bonds yield between 65 and 70 per cent. There is obviously a risk attached with any bond which yields this much  - and the risk in this case is currency depreciation. A fall in the Turkish lira could wipe out all of the extra interest earned by the fund once the proceeds are translated back into British pounds. The consequence for investors is that there is a chance of capital loss if the fund managers miscalculate. Simon Osborne, who will manage the bond element, says he will invest initially in Mexico, Turkey, South Africa, Spain and Italy. Judging by the success of Foreign &amp; Colonial's futures-based Pep, which raised Pounds 250m, any product yielding 10 per cent is likely to arouse a lot of interest from investors in present conditions. But the Govett fund, while easier to understand than F &amp; C's - which earns income from option premiums - is probably higher risk. It is tempting to believe that there must be an easy way of earning 10 per cent income but, with base rates at 6 per cent and long gilt yields at 7.5 per cent, this is not the case. The bond portion of the portfolio is likely to suffer capital loss and the equity portion will have to grow to compensate for this. Given that UK equities are at an all-time high, there is a real chance this might not happen. Nevertheless, there will be some investors who are so attracted by the income that they will be willing to risk capital loss. For a top-rate taxpayer, a 10 per cent income in a Pep equates to 16.67 per cent from a building society. Charges will be 5 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual. There is no additional charge for the Pep. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and the maximum, for Pep investors, is Pounds 6,000. Income payments will be made monthly to investors' bank and building society accounts. On a full Pounds 6,000 investment, the return would be Pounds 50 a month.</p>

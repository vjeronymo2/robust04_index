			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Games people play: Berlin's Olympic bid has exposed divisions An elderly, dapper American woman is fast becoming a cause celebre in Germany. At the World Athletics Championships in Stuttgart last week, she was trying to convince the International Olympic Committee to stage the games in Berlin in 2000. During the next few days, she will be in Berlin to win over the sceptics to her cause. It is time, she says, for Germans to unite and make a final bid for the Games before the IOC makes its decision on September 23. The woman is Ruth Owens, the widow of Jesse Owens, the black athlete who stormed to victory in 1936, when the Nazis staged the games in Berlin. 'If Jesse were present when the final decision is taken on who will host the Olympic Games in the year 2000, I am sure Berlin would be his first choice,' she said recently. Berlin's chances for hosting the Games are slim, however. Sydney appears to be the favourite; Beijing and Manchester are strong contenders. But unlike the other cities which want to reap the glory and honour of hosting the Games, as well as profit from selling broadcasting rights, Germany's Olympic committee, and the country's industrial establishment, have a broader agenda. For them the Games are a means to speed up unification. 'We are not talking political unification. We are talking about what effect the Games in Berlin would have on the psychological unification, as well as improving the infrastructure in east Berlin and in other parts of eastern Germany,' explained Mr Christian Furstenwerth, the spokesman for Olympia GmbH, the public relations arm of Germany's Olympic committee. Those firmly behind the Games include Mercedes Benz, Deutsche Telekom, Lufthansa, leading commercial banks, and Daimler Benz. German industry has already pledged DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in investments and promotion. 'Berlin was the symbol of the great divide between east and west during the cold war,' said Mr Bernd Sturzl, a Daimler Benz spokesman. 'The games will represent the new unity, not only of Germany, but of Europe. It would provide such a big impulse for the psychological unity of the country,' he added. The desire to unite the two Germanys, not only economically and politically but also psychologically is a dominant theme among the Olympic supporters. But the fact that this impulse exists reflects the sense of malaise which followed the euphoric days of November 1989, when the Berlin Wall was dismantled. Since then, unification has often lapsed into recrimination and bitterness. Easterners resent the way westerners look down on them, the closure of large sectors of manufacturing industry, and the 'colonisation' of the five new states by western speculators. In the west, conversely, resentment focuses on the higher taxes earmarked for subsidising the east and bringing living standards up to western standards. In Berlin, the divisions are even sharper. West Berliners have lost the privileges which existed before the wall collapsed: lower taxes, exemption from military conscription and the loss of financial support from Bonn. East Berliners object to the high prices of food, rent and housing. But would the Olympics help overcome the mutual suspicion between east and west Germans? Mr Klaus Harke, a member of Bundis 90/Green Party, the main opponent of the Games, believes the cost of staging the Olympics would create further resentment and, in addition, recall unpleasant memories of the 1936 Games. 'Many Berliners cannot deal with the changes. They already have to cope with too much. Everything is too fast for them. You can't expect them to lobby for the Olympics. With the Games, our city will be turned into a city of services, and nothing else. And then when the Olympics are over, all the promises about new jobs will not be realised,' he said. 'Look at Barcelona and Montreal. They are still paying back their debts from holding the Games.' Berliner Bank and Daimler Benz disagree. They believe the Games will cost about DM3.2bn, which would be financed though the selling of television rights, private investment and marketing revenues. More important, they argue that improvements to the infrastructure, including telecommunications, roads, sports facilities and housing, would boost long-term investment in the city. 'Red tape for planning permission would be cut if we had the Games here. We could really get a move on in developing the city,' said an official at Berliner Bank. Investment would not be confined to Berlin. Sailing events would take place on the Baltic coast in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, thus attracting a large injection of capital for tourist facilities. Other events would be staged in Brandenburg and Saxony. 'The Games would boost the self-confidence of the easterners. Their cities would be visited,' said Mr Sturzl from Daimler Benz. 'Look at the situation in Berlin since unification. It is already attracting people from east and western Europe,' said Mr Furstenwerth. 'If the Olympics came here in 2000, it would prove that Berlin was once again a normal city. It would be at the heart of the united Germany.' However, the latter point is not welcomed by those in the western-most parts of Germany, particularly people working for the federal government in Bonn. 'If Berlin gets the Olympics, it will be difficult for the government to find excuses not to move the entire administration to Berlin,' said an economics ministry official. The government has already pledged to shift some department over the next few years. The date for the final move of the government will be decided this autumn. The official added: 'We have always used the excuse that the infrastructure in Berlin is very poor, and in any case, it would cost too much to move the government to Berlin. But if private investment helps prepare Berlin for the Games, that would probably precipitate the government's move over there. That's why I don't want the Games in Berlin.'</p>

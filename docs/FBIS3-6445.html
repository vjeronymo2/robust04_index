			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The details of a comprehensive Russian aid program,  which Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata plans to present to  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during talks with him,  were disclosed on 16 March. Hata is scheduled to visit Russia  on 19 March.    According to the disclosure, Japan plans to extend $60  million in aid in two stages to help promote reform in Russia.  In the first stage, $40 million is to be used for specific  projects. The main feature of the aid program is the opening of  a "Research Center for Education on Japanese Business  Management" (tentative name) to be utilized for a business  management course under the Moscow University's economics  department. The purpose of the research center is to teach  Russian students about Japanese business management and  financial know-how, among other topics. Approximately $10  million is to be appropriated for the research center's  construction. The aid program is aimed at promoting a smooth  transition of the Russian economy to a free market economy by  taking full advantage of Japan's experience -- as a nation which  has developed into an "economic superpower" -- in postwar  rehabilitation and reconstruction. Japan is the first nation to  extend such an aid program, the primary objective of which is to  foster human resources.    This aid program is in line with agreements made at the  summit meeting of major industrialized nations (G-7) held last  April. These agreements have served as the basis of Japanese aid  to Russia. Japan and Russia have previously considered plans to  work out specific projects on the basis of documents drawn up  between the governments of the two nations regarding agreements  on implementing Japanese support in promoting reform in Russia  and humanitarian aid. The two nations worked out the agreements  during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October.    The research center to be constructed on the campus at  Moscow  University is scheduled to open in September 1995. Courses are  to be set up on such topics as the privatization of state-run  enterprises, banking and financial know-how, and the Japanese  language. Business experts at private Japanese firms and banks  are to be sent to the research center as instructors.    Future plans are to model the research center after the  so-called "business schools" in the United States. It is hoped  that the research center "will become a center for personnel  exchanges between Japan and Russia," (as stated by a Foreign  Ministry source). Foreign Minister Hata plans to sign papers for  the agreement on construction of the research center when he  visits Russia.    In addition, there are plans to set up training facilities,  called "Japan Centers," in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. Here,  seminars will be held on business management, the Japanese  language, and other subjects for businessmen, public employees,  and students. Another $10 million is to be appropriated for the  construction of these facilities.</p>

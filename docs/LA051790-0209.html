			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: TOURISM;  </P> <P> RITZ-CARLTON GIVES PARENTS BREAK, OFFERS CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Nothing like a night away from life's troubles to calm the soul. All it takes  is a quiet dinner and a movie, just a few blissful hours away from your  problems and responsibilities.  </P> <P> Problems, that is, such as picking up your socks, making decent grades or  trying to impress the girl who sits three desks away. A child, after all, can  use a break, too. And that's where the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel thinks it has  the answer.  </P> <P> For the third summer, the Dana Point hotel is trying to capitalize on the  family vacation market by sponsoring a children's program. It is designed to  give parents a rest from watching junior and to give children a chance to, uh,  chill out.  </P> <P> Children's programs at hotels are not a new idea, but the Ritz-Carlton version  is more elaborate than most. For $40, parents will be able to put their child  through a daylong list of events that includes gymnastics, sandcastle contests,  swimming pool games, arts and crafts, and kite flying.  </P> <P> On Friday and Saturday evenings, the hotel organizes a dinner and movie for  children -- allowing parents the chance to escape for a romantic dinner if they  choose.  </P> <P> For teen-agers, the seaside hotel will be offering informal volleyball and  croquet.  </P> <P> Despite room rates that start at $185 a night, the Ritz-Carlton has been a  destination for vacationing families. The hotel promotes itself as an ideal  location for visits to Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, as well as to Sea  World and the San Diego Zoo.  </P> <P> "This is where families come, and to have something to do with the kids is  important," said hotel spokeswoman Christie Johnson. The children's program  starts June 22.  </P> <P> At the end of summer, the hotel, which is only 6 years old, will undergo a  million-dollar refurbishment.  </P> <P> For starters, the Cafe restaurant will be remodeled and its name changed to the  Terrace Restaurant.  </P> <P> The lounge will also be made over. Though the furniture looks as new as ever,  General Manager Henry Schielein points out wobbling antique replica chairs as  evidence of the effects of five years of power lunches and sunset cocktail  parties. The hotel will remodel its suites later this year and eventually plans  to redo its guest rooms.  </P></p>

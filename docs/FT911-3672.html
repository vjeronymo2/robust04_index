			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Cheap loans row taxes Spanish Socialists A YEAR-LONG low key guerrilla war by Spain's governing Socialist party against the conservative finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, is escalating sharply over the latter's dismissal of a party proposal to use Spanish banks to finance cheap mortgages for 400,000 people in the next four years. The Socialist party, which faces testing municipal elections on May 26, plans to use low home financing as its main election plank. However, when it was first mooted last week that Spanish banks might be forced to set aside funds to enable homebuyers to take mortgages at 8 per cent, Mr Solchaga, with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' tacit support, rapidly and pronounced it unworkable. The banks, he said, could not be asked to make unprofitable loans. Normal mortgages cost more than 18 per cent in Spain. Party officials immediately hit back accusing the finance minister of trying to hijack its election programme. Two days later Mr Gonzalez steered a cabinet meeting into announcing that finding cheap homes for people was a good idea but that some other way would have to be found to do it. What he meant was that taxpayers would have to come up with the money. On Monday, for some reason, Mr Solchaga repeated, on radio, his view that the party's original plan was quite unworkable. The party immediately accused him of being blinded 'by his own fuzzy vision'. He promptly retorted that 'if they are going to accuse me of fuzzy vision they should accuse (Mr Gonzalez) the same way'. Mr Gonzalez is trying hard not to take sides, though he probably agrees with his finance minister. Mr Solchaga's toxic relations with party administrators go back more than a year, when he began to criticise openly the control over the party held by Mr Alfonso Guerra, the left-wing former deputy prime minister. Mr Guerra left the government in January in the wake of a family financial scandal, but he has remained deputy party leader. Mr Gonzalez has tried to declare his government's independence from the party but it is clear he cannot totally divorce himself from grassroots or even bureaucratic party opinion. At the moment, the row may actually be working to the Socialists' benefit, as cheap housing has become the dominant issue in the local elections. But the constant sniping between finance minister and party is beginning to irritate the prime minister seriously.</p>

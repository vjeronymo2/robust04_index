			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Daddy, how do we create jobs?: There is a radical - if unpopular - solution to unemployment 'DADDY, isn't there a way the Government could get rid of unemployment?' 'Yes,' I said. 'It would completely disappear if the government withdrew all benefits to the unemployed. Then everyone would either work or starve.' 'I can't believe I am hearing this. . . .' 'Well, not many would actually starve,' I continued, 'There would be charities, soup kitchens, workhouses - things like that. And don't forget, the government would save Pounds 12bn a year by not paying benefits. 'It could use this money to paint hospitals, repair roads, clean up our cities. That could provide perhaps 1m jobs. So instead of being paid for doing nothing . . .' 'Daddy that's utterly heartless. There must be a better way.' 'You mean, apart from just waiting for green shoots? Yes there is. The government could borrow Pounds 30bn and spend it digging a huge hole in the ground for the Channel tunnel rail link and cleaning up litter. With that sort of money it could create millions of jobs.' 'So?' 'Unfortunately, the Government borrowed so much to win the last election and to pay for the unemployed that it is running out of credit. Now it is being told to cut spending, which would throw even more people out of work.' 'But what you want to do . . .' 'I never said I wanted to do it. You asked if there was a way. But it is not as crazy as you think. It is how things work in Hong Kong, and they are doing tremendously well. The Americans have very low unemployment benefits compared with ours and they have created millions of new jobs.' 'Even so,' she said, laying aside The Guardian, 'We would become a low wage, low skill economy.' It is a troubling point. But the fact is that Britain has squandered its intelligence. The report this week from the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit said that one in five 21-year-olds is innumerate and one in seven illiterate. It is not obvious why a Briton who cannot read a manual nor add up a customer's order should be paid more than assiduous workers in Hong Kong or Malaysia. On the other hand, not everyone can be an electronics expert. As technology advances, will some people inevitably be left behind to depend on the work of others? It was Mr Parrack, the decorator, who dispelled this gloomy thought. He is expensive, but we use him because he never lets the paint run, neither does he leave any speck on the carpet. 'How have things been going for you in the recession?', I ask. 'Terrible, Mr Wilkinson, absolutely terrible. I haven't had a free weekend for the last two months.' Of course not. Parrack cleans immaculately after each day's work. He even found a way to dismantle and re-assemble the kitchen without upsetting the cook. He was recommended to us. We recommended him to everyone. Yet Parrack's work is not, by modern standards, highly skilled. His secret lies less in sandpaper and undercoating, than in a wonderful attention to detail and, above all, care for the customer. His are the qualities that created profit and jobs at Sainsbury, Toyota, Sony, MacDonalds. (But were sadly neglected in the get-rich-quick culture of the Thatcher debt binge.) However deep the recession, Parrack will never need the dole. Does it follow that if the dole were abolished, everyone would suddenly become like Parrack? Alas, no. But that does mean he would have little to fear from a flood of cheap unskilled labour. His survival would help to re-establish, as folk wisdom throughout society, that you earn a good living only by offering excellent service. Yet even if it were proved that abolishing the dole would result in all the 3m unemployed finding jobs, no government would dare to do it, (although this government does intend to reduce bogus claims for invalidity benefits). The Tory heartlands would join my daughter's cry that ours is not that kind of society. We are fortunate indeed that society can save us from many evils. Yet too few Europeans understand that society cannot protect us from a bleak and elemental truth: in spite of the cushion of inherited resources, and the redistribution of our present incomes, only two things in the end stand between us all and starvation - work and skill.</p>

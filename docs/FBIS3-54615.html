In the Gaza Strip, terrorists opened fire on Israelis in  three separate incidents. There were no injuries. Two of the  incidents occurred in Gush Qatif, when terrorists opened fire on  Israeli cars. The third happened when terrorists shot at an Army  patrol in Gaza.    In Khan Yunus, two homemade explosive devices were thrown at  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and Border Police patrols. There  were no injuries in that incident either.    A resident of the Jabalyah refugee camp was murdered last  night. He was believed by his attackers to be cooperating with  Israel. Members of his family brought him to a nearby Army base,  but efforts to save him failed, and he died of his wounds.</p>

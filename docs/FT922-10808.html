			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (3): Depositors spot a snag - Regulation: BCCI put the new scheme to an early test IN THE centre of Douglas, a statue of Queen Victoria looks down disapprovingly on the local branch of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The island's regulators know how she feels. BCCI cannot be said to reflect too badly on the Isle of Man, given the number of jurisdictions which allowed the bank's fraudsters free rein. But BCCI did put the island's new deposit protection scheme to an unwelcome early test. The Manx scheme was started by the Financial Supervision Commission in February last year. Deposits are protected up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 held, offering an effective maximum of Pounds 15,000, and this also extends to the sterling equivalent in foreign currency deposits. The island was justifiably proud that this offered exactly the same protection as is offered under the UK's Banking Act. Then came the BCCI shut-down. The Manx branch had approximately Pounds 90m on deposit, and 5,000 depositors. It at least gave the new consumer-protection regime an opportunity to show itself in action. But this month, depositors spotted a problem and started to complain. Mr Jim Noakes, chief executive of the Financial Supervision Commission, explains: 'There certainly has been unrest, but that's based on a misconception. The regulations of the scheme require that, before the scheme manager can pay compensation to anybody, that person must permit the scheme manager to stand in his shoes, as far as his rights in the liquidation and any other rights are concerned. The depositor is not forced to have compensation if he doesn't want it.' In the Isle of Man, the depositor's rights need to be assigned - in the UK, according to Mr Noakes, there is no choice. He adds that the FSC is only standing in depositors' shoes until it retrieves as much money as it has already paid to depositors. If it manages to retrieve any more, this will go in full to depositors. The issue aroused depositors' ire, because a scheme proposed by the government of Abu Dhabi would compensate depositors for 10 per cent of amounts held on deposit. Those with Pounds 150,000 or more would therefore do better under this than under the Manx scheme - hence their annoyance. Mr Noakes has taken the dispute philosophically. The issue is still relatively minor, when set against the advances the island's regulators have continued to make in the last year. They are keen to stamp out any criminal elements, but regulators are also at the forefront of the Isle of Man's attempt to become a front-line financial centre. The other big development of the last year has come through the Financial Business Act, which aims, according to Mr Noakes, to broaden the scope of regulation to affect the wider running of the system, rather than just investor compensation. This includes investment professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, and also intermediaries such as stockbrokers and futures and options dealers. The FSC recognised it had a problem of resources in finding the expertise to regulate these specialist areas. Normally, this problem is overcome by adopting strict licensing criteria before allowing companies to trade, and therefore reducing the need for close supervision. However, the FSC was determined not to stop specialist intermediaries and professionals from coming to the island. Its solution could be very attractive for overseas investors - negotiations are now in train with UK self-regulatory organisations and representative professional bodies to set up what Mr Noakes calls 'mutual assistance arrangements'. This offers up the possibility of combining Manx taxes with protection from such bodies as the English Law Society, the Securities and Futures Authority and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He says: 'We are very hopeful, and we've had very positive responses from all of them.' Meanwhile, he says professional consultants on the island recognise that the only other option - for the FSC to employ a specialist - would be much more expensive. This reveals an odd aspect of regulation on the Isle of Man. It is vital that the regulators show their teeth, and use them to bite into any wrongdoing. The island could not withstand another embarrassment on the scale of the Savings and Investments Bank collapse. But they are also working to expand the industry. Mr Christopher Edmonds, supervisor of collective investment schemes for the FSC, makes this explicit when talking about the island's innovative 'restrictive scheme' fund management regulations. 'I think we've got the balance right between providing a measure of regulation whilst at the same time providing the flexibility for the operators we've allowed into the marketplace to develop and innovate the kind of products which their customers are demanding.' The current success of Manx financial services suggests Mr Edmonds is correct - the regulators have found the right balance.</p>

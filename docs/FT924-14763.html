			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: What I would do as chancellor In the long run we are all dead - Lord Keynes (circa 1921). Keynes is dead and we are living in the long run - Participant at a Keynes conference, 1991. Saying what one would do, if one were chancellor, is a form of journalism best indulged in one's 20s. We are where we are through a complex historical process; and there are no hitherto unused monetary indicators waiting to be pulled out of a hat, the mere announcement of which will restore credibility. Some so-called market commentators are looking in a dark room for a black cat which is not there. Moreover, the whole 10-point programme attitude of mind is misguided. For it assumes that there are a few technocratic gimmicks by which a few clever people at the centre could point a painless way to growth without inflation. It is this rather than any specific doctrine, which is the malign aspect of Keynes's legacy. What I object to most in the programmatic approach is the absurdly over-inflated role it gives to government. The political philosopher Michael Oakeshott made a distinction between the state as an enterprise association, with specific aims and purposes, and the state as a civil association, which provides a framework of law and institutions in which individuals, companies, voluntary bodies and many other groups pursue their own purposes. Not only is a civil association a much more congenial idea; it is also less unsuccessful. The enterprise association reached its highest form of development in the Soviet five-year plans. These collapsed, together with more moderate Swedish type ideas for reforming society from the centre. No government has the knowledge - much of it unquantifiable - which would be required for such ambitions. Yet political discourse is still in the language of the enterprise association. Even radical-right Conservative governments believe they have to do something called 'promoting growth'. Having said all this, I will swallow my words with a 10-point non-plan. This is partly because I have been asked to do so and partly because this is a journalistic way of encapsulating a few thoughts, acceptable if very sparingly used. The intention is to improve the framework of rules and institutions of civil society rather than to ask for implausibly heroic political leadership. The reason why the British found it so difficult to live with the exchange rate mechanism has nothing to do with the alleged misdeeds of the Bundesbank or even the entry parity. Nor has it much to do with the personal qualities of the chancellor. The British are just very addicted to the inflationary habit, which they find so difficult to kick. Politicians and commentators have evinced a curious born-again belief in fiscal activism. They want, mostly unspecified, public expenditure cuts. But of course these must not affect infrastructure, investment, or any other area where they are actually likely to be made. It just happens that on the evidence of the past two decades, monetary and exchange rate policies are far more potent weapons against inflation than fiscal policy. There are many reasons for wanting to balance the budget once economic activity is on a sustainable trend level. But with free capital markets there is an extremely loose link between the budget deficit and either inflation or interest rates. The main reason why politicians are turning to fiscal policy is that for the moment tight money seems to be politically more unpopular. In addition - as we see from the memoirs of the Callaghan period - ministers find it much easier to dispute with each other on spending programmes than on monetary or exchange rate policy, which is left to a tiny inner group. Having got all this off my chest, here is my 10-point non-programme: 1. There should be a standing commission on laws and business practices which make it difficult to reduce inflation, or increase the costs of so doing. My own most important articles have not been my running commentaries on macroeconomic policy, but the occasional pieces I have written on practices such as upwards-only rent reviews of business rents or the insidious effect of treating house purchase as a foolproof investment for gain rather than a way of providing shelter. The commission should avoid an indiscriminate onslaught on indexation, but probe notions such as the annual wage round, the rate for the job and nationwide bargaining. 2. There should be a thorough investigation of the events leading up to the humiliation of Black Wednesday, when the UK ignominiously left the ERM. This should go well beyond the ritual calls for the resignation of the chancellor and look at the whole machinery of Treasury and Bank of England advice which has guided successive chancellors, and which would deprive key officials of the excuse that they cannot answer back. 3. There is no point in just calling for an independent Bank of England, if this means just giving slightly more power to the existing Bank. Indeed no central bank has covered itself in glory in recent weeks. What is required is a new Bank of England Act which would give the Bank specific objectives, for which it could be held accountable, and which would not prevent it being ultimately merged with the European Central Bank envisaged in the Maastricht treaty. Once the new institution is established under a new act it would be given sufficient independence to put monetary policy at one or two removes from the political expediency of those concerned with managing party conferences. 4. The government should declare its aim of rejoining some version of the exchange rate mechanism when the time is ripe. This is deliberately harking back to the Thatcher formula, with the big difference that the aim would be to rejoin rather than find excuses for not so doing. Moreover the discussion should be open and above board without the 'I must prevail' attitude of the former premier. Those official advisers - not all that thick on the ground - who seriously favour returning, suggest two conditions. The first is that German interest rates should be seen to be moving clearly downwards; in fact German money market rates have already fallen by nearly one percentage point, much more than the official Lombard rate. The second is that the UK should be clearly emerging from recession. I am more worried about this second condition, the fulfilment of which will remain a matter of opinion. I would rather just say that the UK should rejoin the ERM when German interest rates are over the unification hump. And preferably within two years. 5. In the meanwhile there should be a broad band exchange rate objective. The difficulties of German reunification make the D-Mark target on its own temporarily difficult. On the other hand the weakness of the dollar distorts the sterling index too. So I would temporarily settle for some kind of average between the two. The chart illustrates how close the relationship is between the internal and external value of the pound. But it is a medium to long-term one. For instance, inflation could slow down in the 1980s, even though the pound was falling because there had been an earlier sterling overshoot. But as the slide went on, it was inevitable that sooner or later it would find its way into domestic inflationary pressure. It is the insidious depreciation of sterling, year after year, which feeds into inflation rather than the short periods of intense pressure which hit the headlines. It is much more important that sterling should remain in the same broad band (or higher) over the next few years than exactly how low it falls in the next few weeks. 6. There should be an objective for total domestic spending, measured approximately by my old friend, nominal gross domestic product. The target path I have suggested is based on projections by the investment bank Goldman Sachs made when the UK was still in the ERM. The idea is to ensure sufficient demand to maintain economic growth, but only if inflation continues to come down. It is this direction which matters rather than highly fallible targets for intermediate measures of money, credit and the like. The key relationships are so unreliable and change so frequently that they should be changeable at the discretion of the Bank of England, or whomever is operating monetary policy. It would be a crass mistake to centre policy around intermediate objectives which will carry little conviction. 7. Under normal circumstances that would be that. But in view of the breakdown of confidence a separate target path is needed for inflation itself, in terms not of the ridiculous Retail Prices Index but some underlying measure of inflation of which the GDP deflator is an example. If you have a target path for nominal GDP and for inflation, you implicitly have a projection for real growth as well. But the latter is residual and cannot easily be influenced by government. 8. Interest rate policy would be governed by points 4 to 7. Meanwhile, I can see no point in massive public spending cuts or tax increases in a recession, whatever the mythology of 1981. Public spending should be curbed sufficiently to secure a balanced budget in the longer term. 9. Much more important is the breakdown of public spending - not between production and consumption, which is a statistical artefact - but between purchases of goods and services, inflationary pay increases and cash transfers. A freeze of all public sector wages would repeat the cardinal sin of all previous incomes policies in ignoring supply and demand in particular labour markets. On the other hand a simple freeze in the public sector wage bill, would make it all too easy to carry on with a conventional wage round at the cost of dismissing public sector workers. The freeze must operate at the level of average pay per head. 10. To achieve the maximum realism with a minimum of hardship, social security needs to move humanely, but uncompromisingly towards selectivity. To be blunt, future increases in pensions and child benefits should go to those who need them rather than wastefully distributed all round. What would happen if there were conflicts between the nominal GDP, exchange rate and inflation objectives? We would be doing extremely well if any of them were taken seriously enough for conflicts to arise. In any case I would not last long as chancellor in any conceivable British cabinet to have to resolve them.  ---------------------------------------------------          Some medium-term targets (% change)  ---------------------------------------------------              Nominal      GDP        Real               GDP*     deflator*     GDP* 1991           4           6         (-2) 1992           4           5         (-1) 1993           4 1/2       3        (1 1/2) 1994           4 1/2       2 1/2      (2)  --------------------------------------------------- * At factor cost Source: adapted from Goldman Sachs  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

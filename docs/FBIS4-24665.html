			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Dehua (2621 1795 5478) and correspondent Xu </F> Xiaolin (1776 2556 3829) ]    [Text] Korla, 16 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--To date, the  reserves of nine oil and gas fields have been verified in Tarim.  By the end of last year, Tarim had produced an accumulated  total of 3.23 million tonnes of crude oil. At present, the  daily output of crude oil in Tarim has reached 6,000 tonnes, and  the annual output of crude oil of this year is expected to be  2.1 million tonnes.    Since oil prospecting and exploitation began in Tarim five  years ago, the reserves of nine oil and gas fields, including  Lunnan, Donghetang, Gatamu, Mulake, Jiefangqudong, Tazhongsi,  Momai No 7, Hongqigou, and Tiergen, have been verified.  Thirty-four industrial oil- and gas-bearing structures and 17  high-yielding oil and gas wells and points have been discovered.  This has fulfilled the state plan for ensuring reserves for the  5-million-tonne production capacity during the Eighth Five-Year  Plan. A series of major breakthroughs with strategic  significance have also been made while prospecting in the region.    The discovery of the Tazhong 1-billion-tonne grade oil field  with Tazhong No 4 as the main body in 1992 and the important  discovery of the No 6 anticline of the No 10 structure in the  northern slope zone of the Tazhong low swell in 1993 have  unfolded the broad prospects for the discovery of large oil  field group in the Tazhong area. In the Tazhong area, in  addition to continued discoveries in the Lunnan and Donghetang  Oil Fields, the general analysis on several structures of the  Luntai broken swell has led to the discovery of four oil- and  gas-bearing structures in the Momai No 7, the Yaha, and the  Hongqi structures. A number of high-yielding oil and gas wells  have been drilled. All this fully shows the gratifying  prospects for the discovery of large oil and gas fields in the  Tarim Basin.    Taking part in the prospecting and development of the Tarim  Oil Field are over 10,000 people from the well-drilling teams in  the six major oil fields in Huabei, Central Plain, Daqing,  Sichuan, Shengli, and Xinjiang.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] Members from the Lower House of Parliament voiced  mixed reactions to the UN Resolution [904]. While recognizing  the rare unvetoed resolution, they urged the international  community to ensure the protection of the Palestinians. They  also voiced concern at Washington's position on Jerusalem. Maha  al-Sha'ir went to the Parliament and asked some of its members  about last night's resolution.    [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali, Foreign Relations  Committee chairman] I was really disappointed that the  resolution took more than three weeks to be adopted and in the  consultation and negotiation behind the scenes until they  reached that resolution. The positive, I suppose that this has  been a resolution which give the Palestinians the right to have  a protection in the occupied territories, international security  present to protect the Palestinians and to give them certain  protection in the occupied territories. The negative thing is  the position of the United States concerning the Jerusalem  problem. The massacre itself has proved that Jerusalem is a  very important issue and the sensitive and important issue  should be discussed.    [Samir Qa'war] You know that Jerusalem is for everybody in  the world really and it is for the three religions and it has to  be solved within the context of the peace process negotiations,  but we hope that the Arab rights in East Jerusalem will be  realized to be controlled by the Arabs.    ['Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah] Well, I don't think this is a  pertinent resolution concerning a massacre of such a magnitude  and the delay of the resolution which has taken around one  month. Were it against any other country, it would have taken  place instantaneously. The United States has been delaying  taking such a resolution up until it mitigated the massacre  itself after putting so many pressures on the PLO and on other  members of the Security Council. Second, it only condemns; it  didn't take any measures concerning the occupation, concerning  the protection of the Palestinians. [end recording]</p>

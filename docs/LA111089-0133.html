			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SMITHSONIAN VISITORS' CENTER HAS HIGH-TECH COMPUTER DISPLAYS  </P> <P> The Smithsonian Institution opened a $2.7-million visitors' center Thursday  that boasts high-tech computer displays in the same historic Castle building  where Abraham Lincoln observed hot-air balloon maneuvers during the Civil War.  </P> <P> Electronic wall maps, touch screen video displays in seven languages, two movie  theaters and scale models of Washington's downtown tourist attractions will be  available to the 3 million visitors who are expected to visit the new  Smithsonian Information Center next year.  </P> <P> One stop at the Victorian-style Castle's great hall, Assistant Smithsonian  Secretary Ralph Rinzler said, "will help visitors make the best use of their  time at the museums and save them the frustration of an endless trek from  building to building."  </P> <P> The Smithsonian has expanded greatly since 1855, when the Castle was built to  house its early scientific collections. Today, the Smithsonian includes 14  museums and galleries, plus the National Zoo.  </P> <P> At the newly renovated ground floor of the Castle, cherry-wood kiosks contain  13 video screens giving tourists detailed information and travel directions to  Smithsonian attractions and scores of other Washington landmarks.  </P> <P> In addition, the former Children's Room at the south entrance, closed nearly a  half-century ago to make room for offices, was restored and reopened to the  public Thursday as a lounge.  </P> <P> The two-year renovation of the ground floor of the red sandstone Castle, whose  towers, gables and battlements are a familiar sight on the National Mall, was  privately financed by donations from individuals and several foundations.  </P></p>

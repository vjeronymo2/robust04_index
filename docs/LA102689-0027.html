			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE POWER OF PEANUT BUTTER  </P> <P> Americans bought 700 million pounds of peanut butter last year, says Mitch  Head, executive director of the Peanut Advisory Board. That's three pounds per  person, and enough to cover the entire floor of the Grand Canyon.  </P> <P> Peanut-butter consumption has risen more in the last two years than ever  before. It's no wonder, then, that the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the  No. 1 sandwich in America. Each day, 20 million adults (who prefer chunky  peanut butter) and children (who prefer creamy) carry it to work or school. By  the time the average child finishes high school, he or she will have eaten some  1,500 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, according to Head.  </P> <P> Nobody knows how the iconic sandwich originated.  </P> <P> "It's definitely American, and probably started in the early 1900s," says Sarah  Laubner, assistant marketing director for Trombly's Peanut Butter Fantasies in  Boston, a company that markets peanut butter to adults. Jelly has been spread  on bread for ages. Peanut butter came along about the turn of the century.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peanut Butter Accompaniments  </P> <P> But as the people at Peanut Butter Fantasies know, jelly isn't the only thing  that complements peanut butter and bread. How about a cucumber, cream cheese  and peanut butter sandwich? Or Trombly's peanut butter dark sider, a Reuben  sandwich made with peanut butter?  </P> <P> "It's always been pounded into our heads that peanut butter only goes with  jelly," says David Thibodeau, president of Trombly's. "People are saying 'Hey,  we found our own way to eat peanut butter. It's a flavor we grew up on, and we  can use it so many different ways.' "  </P> <P> True fans will confess to using mayonnaise, honey, marshmallows, bananas,  potato chips, chocolate, raisins, cheese, bacon -- almost anything. But  "nothing will ever replace the standby PB&amp;J," says Thibodeau. His personal  favorite: peanut butter and strawberry jam on burnt toast.  </P></p>

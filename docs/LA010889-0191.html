			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONE WORKER FOUND FOR ALL THOSE JOBS  </P> <P> A friend was kind enough to share with me your Orange County employment story  in the Christmas edition of the Times ("Job Openings in Orange County Exceed  Workers," Dec. 26). I am somewhat mystified by the allegation of employers that  they can't find workers.  </P> <P> I have been unemployed since August, except for a brief stint as a "gofer" for  a school portrait studio . . . at less than living wages.  </P> <P> Perhaps you will remember me as Suburban Editor of the old Daily News Tribune.  Since I was let go there ("economic staff reductions"), I was news editor of  the Anaheim Bulletin for 6 years, but was let go on an hour's notice there,  with a number of weak reasons, including economics. I then worked in a PR  agency for a year before it too was hit by an economic crunch. For about 5  years I worked for the Boy Scouts of America in Los Angeles (PR, photos,  camping services), until I was suddenly fired early in August. Since that time,  the hungry-for-employees firms here in Orange County, and elsewhere, have  either ignored my applications for work, or have responded that I am  "over-qualified" or "not qualified."  </P> <P> Where are all these Orange County employers (the Employment Development  Department has only jobs listed for minimum or near-minimum wages that won't  pay enough to cover even the cost of my very low mortgage payments)?  </P> <P> I have sought jobs outside of journalism, but was told that I wasn't even  qualified to be a $1,500-per-month school janitor.  </P> <P> DEAN WHINERY  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

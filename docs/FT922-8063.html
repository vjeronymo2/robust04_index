			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (5) - A room with a view of the sea / Hotels, City centre accommodation is being improved but many visitors still prefer to go further afield POORLY served until recently by top hotels, Genoa has used the Columbus Exhibition to spur both rebuilding and new construction in a bid to offer business travellers more choice. The closure some years ago of the Colombia, Genoa's member of the Aga Khan's luxury CIGA hotels chain, has made the lack of top hotels more evident than ever. However, business visitors should note that the Colombia is supposed to re-open as a residence, which could be useful for those planning a longer stay. While the options within the city are now improving, the limited range and the fact that Genoa's leading hotels are often booked up months in advance for big events such as the annual Boat Show, means many visitors prefer to look outside town. For those not facing early-morning appointments in the city centre, staying somewhere along the coast could be a positive boon. And all the seaside towns except Portofino have good rail links with Genoa. Running from west to east, and beginning in Genoa itself, here is our choice: The high rating for the down-at-heel Savoia Majestic, facing the Colombia on the other side of Principe station, seems to stem primarily from the fact that none of the guide books which recommend it highly have been there recently. The hotel has also suffered from the general shift in Genoa's city centre from Principe station in the west to Brignole further east. Well located between the two is the Jolly Plaza. Even with building work to revamp the hotel still under way, it is surprisingly characterful by the Jolly chain's normally bland standards. There is also a car park nearby. Ten minutes away on foot is the Bristol, set under the arcades of busy via 20 Settembre. For some, the sombre hotel, all red leather upholstery and restrained colours, exudes the atmosphere of a London club, and typifies Genoa's Anglo-Saxon leanings. I found it depressing. Just by Brignole station in the new Corte Lambruschini complex is the Star, completed last year, and striking for its angular architecture. The hotel, expensive by local standards, is all a modern businessman's base should be - and little more. A range of facilities is available for conferences of up to 580 people as well as smaller meetings, and there is underground parking. The absence of a hotel at Genoa's small Christopher Columbus airport should be corrected towards the end of this year with the opening of the big new Sheraton. It may be worth a try, in spite of the inconvenient location. Substantial facilities for meetings and conferences are also planned. Outside the city, visitors should look exclusively along the eastern Riviera, rather than the industrialised immediate west. The choice starts at the small town of Nervi, now incorporated within Genoa itself, and runs down to the Portofino peninsula. Nervi itself, six miles from the city centre, is a quiet resort of considerable charm once away from the busy main road running above the town. None of its hotels is in the luxury class, but most are pleasant, especially the small Pagoda, in spite of its disappointingly utilitarian room furnishings. Lying in a small park on the edge of Nervi's public gardens, it even has its own path leading to the lovely seaside promenade. Camogli, 16 miles from Genoa and coming just before the Portofino peninsula, offers the Cenobio dei Dogi, a historic old hotel full of atmosphere overlooking the sea in its own grounds. Rapallo, Santa Margherita Ligure and Portofino itself are all on the eastern side of the peninsula, and offer a wide choice of hotels. Rapallo, with 26,000 inhabitants, is as much a small town as a seaside resort. Its leading hotel is the Grand Hotel Bristol, often confused with the hotel of the same name in Genoa. Built by the British early this century and expensively restored eight years ago, the Bristol is an unfortunate case of money ill-spent, Mirror glass cladding on the back and a range of garish colour schemes within may have been the last word in chic when commissioned. They could even become a 'feature' within a few decades. However, the effect today is pretty dire. Rooms are comfortable, with commanding views across the bay, and there are good meeting and conference facilities. Santa Margherita offers two luxury hotels, as well as a long list of more modest accommodation. Both the Imperial Palace and the Grand Hotel Miramare are set in fine grounds and face the sea. The town itself is first and foremost a resort, as evidenced by the many pleasure craft in its pretty harbour. However, it can become unpleasantly crowded on sunny weekends, and especially during the peak Sunday afternoon passeggiata. Three miles down the peninsula on a narrow, twisting road where drivers must fight the temptation to admire the view if they are to avoid head-on collisions, is Portofino. Called the Splendido, one hotel stands out above all else in the region, Genoa included. Justly feted in an industry known for its hype, the Splendido is one of those places guests do not want to leave. Set in a beautiful terraced garden high above Portofino, with views down to the harbour, sea and neighbouring hills, it is an ideal place to wind down - as witnessed by the large number of well-heeled Italians who regularly return at weekends. Of course, luxury accommodation, manicured grounds and a ratio of almost 100 staff for just 63 rooms do not come cheap. Yet the quality is so high and service so good as to make even the Splendido's extremely weighty bills seem reasonable in the circumstances. And guests can always console themselves that the hotel, now owned by the Venice Simplon Orient Express (VSOE) subsidiary of the Sea Containers group, is still appreciably cheaper than either the Cipriani in Venice or the Villa San Michele in Fiesole, VSOE's two other Italian hotels, both of which, especially the latter, are likely to provoke Latin American standards of debt for those contemplating an extended stay.</p>

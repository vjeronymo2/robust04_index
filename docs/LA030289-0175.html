			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH-PROFILE SOCIALITE IN JOHN TOWER'S LIFE  </P> <P> Most Cabinet designates bring one thing to their confirmation hearings: a good  lawyer. John Tower, in the words of one friend, "brought a blonde."  </P> <P> Dorothy Heyser, 63-year-old wealthy Dallas socialite, has been Tower's constant  companion since their first date, Jan. 25, 1986. She has been married three  times, is said to have been a Hollywood starlet who once dated Clark Gable and  is credited with injecting new pizazz into Tower's personality, described by  one friend as "stuffy."  </P> <P> She calls him "sweet peach." He calls her "dumpling."  </P> <P> But although friends say Heyser may be the best thing to have happened to the  twice-divorced defense secretary-designate, her presence at his confirmation  hearings is being privately criticized. Several of Tower's hometown friends  warned him not to bring Heyser to the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  room, but he ignored their advice. According to Martha Kirkendall, a longtime  Tower assistant who now resides in Dallas, Heyser responded: "Everybody in  Washington knows we go together. Why shouldn't I be there?"  </P> <P> Not only did Heyser's presence remind the Senate panel that Tower -- saddled  with allegations of "womanizing" -- was not a married man, but her highly  visible profile in Women's Wear Daily was said to be more Nancy Reagan than  Barbara Bush. "It was a disaster," one Tower adviser said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Others disagreed. "Dorothy is very much a lady," says one Washington socialite  and friend. "She's no blonde bimbo."  </P> <P> Now the couple are ensconced in adjoining rooms at the Jefferson Hotel, waiting  out the storm. They are said to be avoiding the social scene, dining quietly  with friends such as Rose Narva, managing director of the hotel.  </P> <P> Nancy Hamon, longtime Dallas friend and supporter of Tower, said Tuesday: "He  needs her companionship and her support. I think John is very much in love with  her."  </P> <P> Indeed, at one crucial point in the hearings, Tower playfully reached under the  table during lunch at the Jefferson one afternoon and said, "I'm going to  fondle you now."  </P> <P> Heyser -- who hobnobs with other socialites and European royalty -- has a  wicked sense of humor as well. "She teases him," Kirkendall says. "She keeps  him on an even keel."  </P> <P> "She is much older than she looks," Hamon said. "She takes very good care of  herself."  </P> <P> According to friends, Dorothy Gordon came from "modest means." She was born in  Tulsa, the youngest of three children. Her parents died while she was still in  high school. As a young woman, she left Oklahoma and went to the West Coast,  where she appeared in a few films. Friends say she had a small role in "Artists  and Models" (1955) opposite Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.  </P> <P> She married Jerry Huber and had one son, Jack. She married again, but friends  are hazy on the details. She moved to Dallas. A third marriage, to Estill  Heyser, a founder and past chairman of the board of the Bank of Dallas, ended  in 1983 with his death. He was said to be an alcoholic. "She's very sensitive  to the problem," Kirkendall says. "She certainly doesn't want to go through it  again." While Heyser likes to drink socially, "she can take it or leave it,"  according to Kirkendall.  </P> <P> Friends say Heyser -- who was not looking for another husband -- met Tower in  the fall of 1985, but didn't date him until the following January. Tower's  first wife, Lou, is also a friend of Heyser. "She's been very supportive of Lou  Tower," Kirkendall says. "That's been a wonderful relationship. She helped heal  the wounds" from Tower's second marriage to Lilla Burt Cummings.  </P> <P> During the inauguration, when asked about Tower's alleged drinking problem,  Heyser told a reporter, "He doesn't have a drinking problem. Everybody should  have that kind of problem that he doesn't have." And she laughed.  </P> <P> "She's tough," Kirkendall says. "She's very secure. I've never found any weak  spot in her or any kind of vulnerability. She can really laugh at a lot of  these things. She's not easily impressed with the trappings of power."  </P> <P> A snazzy dresser, Heyser is given to wearing red velvet strapless dresses with  dangling fur tips and is said to be extremely health conscious.  </P> <P> One mutual friend says Tower and Heyser have a lot in common. They both have  condos in the fashionable Turtle Creek area of Dallas and will return there if  he is rejected for the Cabinet post. They are both tough and are both short.  "She doesn't tower over him like a lot of women would," one Washington friend  says.  </P></p>

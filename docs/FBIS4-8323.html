			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Foreign  Minister Alexandr Vondra told journalists today that he did not  say anything about exports of Czech arms to Iran during his  three day talks in this country.    The Czech Republic had clearly said several times that no  arms were currently being supplied to Iran, Vondra said at a  press conference upon his return to Prague from the trip on  which he visited also Syria and Pakistan.    For many years Iran had been one of the most trustworthy  partners as regards payments, Vondra said, adding that only  during the last half year had some problems appeared. It  should, however, be noted that some minor problems had arisen  due to the transformation of the Czech economy and partly also  due to the inevitable change in Czech firms' behavior, Vondra  said.    There had been a considerable drop in oil prices recently  and  besides Iran had been handling the consequences of the war with  Iraq. All this was leading Iran to adopt a new economic and  budget policy which also concerned the Czech Republic as many  Czech companies were developing busy trade contacts with Iran  and participating in large investment projects there. Problems  with payments for Czech activities had appeared recently, Vondra  said.    "These are things which the Czech private sector should be  aware of and proceeding with utmost responsibility while  entering the Iranian market, which is a large one with good  prospects, " Vondra said.    He said that the Iranian Government started to negotiate new  payment relations with many countries at the beginning of this  year. These problems would probably also be discussed at the May  meeting of a Czech-Iranian joint commission established last  autumn, Vondra said.</p>

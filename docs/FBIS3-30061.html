Here is our comment.    In the past two years, Vietnam-Thailand relations have  consolidated and developed in many fields. Exchange visits by  many high ranking delegations have been made. On 15 October  last year, party General Secretary Do Muoi went to Thailand  after a visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. On 3 February this  year, President of the Thai Parliament Mr. Marut Bunnak visited  Vietnam, and, most importantly, Thai Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai said he will make an official visit to Vietnam.    During summit meetings within the two countries, mutual  understanding has been strengthened, contributing to the  development of bilateral relations in many fields. The Thai  prime minister as well as industrial, academic, and business  leaders in Thailand all expressed admiration for Vietnam  political developments and social stabilization. The coming  visit to Vietnam by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai comes  after lifting of the American embargo. He said: Relations will  be strengthened between the two countries.    In economic relations, Vietnam and Thailand have concluded  exchange agreements including agreements on avoidance of double  taxation and investment protection. Bilateral trade relations  have developed rapidly from $65 million in 1990 to $158 million  in 1993, and 30 Thai investment projects capitalized at over  $120 million have been licensed by Vietnam. Many Thai senior  government leaders have called on Thai businessmen to increase  investment and trade activities in Vietnam.    At a workshop held in Bangkok on Monday by the Thai  newspapers THE NATION and BANGKOK BUSINESS [KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT],  Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri called for closer  cooperation between his country's government and private sector  to improve Thai competitiveness in Vietnam and Indochina.    Meanwhile, Thai businesspeople in Vietnam urge the Thai  Government to promote an intergovernmental agreement on an  Indochinese fund to help Thai businessmen in their competition  and speed up the development of a system of road and maritime  transport linking Thailand and Vietnam in order to promote trade  and tourism.    The Vietnamese Ambassador Le Cong Phung told the Bangkok  workshop that the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo and step by  step moving towards normalisation with Vietnam would not derail  Vietnam foreign policy and its external economic relations,  particularly those towards countries in Southeast Asia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed Dominique Garaud: "Death on Board Nuclear </F> Submarine `Emeraude'"]    [Text] French nuclear-powered attack submarines [SNA's]  really have been dogged by bad luck. Until now, however, the  SNA accidents have not had fatal consequences. Yesterday  morning, at 1045 [0845 GMT], 10 submariners were in the SNA  Emeraude's turbo alternator compartment. According to Rear  Admiral Philippe Roy of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, the reasons  are still not clear: "A leak occurred. The immediate reaction  was the isolation of the cooling circuits. Steam poured into  the compartment and the 10 seamen were killed by asphyxiation or  burns." The explosion of one of the two condensers projected  steam at 250 degrees and 45 bars of pressure, and would have  resulted in instant death.    According to initial data released, the explosion caused no  damage to the vessel's structure and the disaster was restricted  to the compartment protected by two airlocks. The Defense  Ministry stated: "This accident in no way calls into question  the nuclear safety of the vessel." The 48-megawatt nuclear  reactor located next to the compartment is itself contained in a  sealed-off area. When the accident occurred, it shut down  automatically and was cooled by its own primary circuit. Unlike  missile-launching submarines [SNLE's], SNA's are equipped with  only conventional weaponry.    According to Rear Admiral Roy, the 10 submariners killed  "were from all categories of personnel." The victims included  two officers. While normally the turbo alternator compartment  is only subject to routine inspection, yesterday the Emeraude's  crew was carrying out a "section inspection" which is done at  six-monthly intervals on all naval vessels in the presence of  the captain or his second-in-command. According to a source  cited by AFP, the Emeraude's captain was among the victims,  although no conscripts were killed.    The Emeraude has a crew of 66, including eight officers and  two conscripts. Like all submarines, it has two crews, termed  "red" and "blue," alternating for periods of six weeks at a  time. Together with the SNLE's, part of the nuclear deterrent  force, the mission of the SNA's is to sweep the seas and oceans  to flush out intruders and, using highly-sophisticated  equipment, to monitor the activities of other vessels.    The incident took place during an exercise with surface  vessels (Casex, in NATO jargon), 50 nautical miles off Toulon in  the south of Corsica. Diving when the explosion occurred, the  Emeraude managed to make it back up to the surface. The bodies  of the victims were winched off by helicopter to one of the  accompanying frigates and then flown back in a helicopter to  Toulon. The Emeraude returned to Toulon yesterday evening at  low speed (four to five knots, instead of the normal 25 knots),  propelled by a backup electric engine.    A legal inquiry and a Naval Command inquest have been  opened.  At the same time, the Navy has decided to inspect the other  five SNA's currently in service. Three of these are out on  missions, two in the Mediterranean and one in the Atlantic.  They have been recalled to Toulon.    The Navy is already denying any comparison with the  accidents  on the SNA's Rubis in August 1993 and Amethyst last March. In  both cases, these incidents were collisions that could probably  be put down to navigational errors and which have already  resulted in reprimands. In the case of the Emeraude, it will be  necessary to essentially determine the cause of the problem,  unprecedented on this type of vessel which has been in service  with the Navy for six years.    Defense Minister Francois Leotard visited Toulon yesterday,  accompanied by the head of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, Alain  Coaranea. He restated that "there is no nuclear risk."  Stressing that the French people had to be informed of the  "responsibilities and the technical causes" of the accident, he  indicated that the conclusions of the inquiries will be made  public.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Technical Specifications of SNA Emeraude                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length                                |72.1 meters                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diameter                              |7.6 meters                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speed                                 |Over 25 knots (46 km/h)               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Surface displacement (weight)         |2,385 tonnes                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Depth                                 |Over 300 meters                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crew                                  |66 men, including eight officers      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weapons tubes                         |Four                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armament capacity                     |14 T-533 torpedoes or SM-39 missiles (|  |                                      |conventional weapons)                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Autonomous operation                  |60 days                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

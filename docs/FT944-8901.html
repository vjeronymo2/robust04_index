			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: French trading house joins DTB venture Trifutures, the French trading house, has become the second Paris-based participant in the joint venture between the futures and options exchanges of France and Germany. Another French company, Compagnie Parisienne de Reescompte, will start operating directly from Paris later this month. By February 1995, the DTB, the German futures exchange, expects to have 12 Paris-based members. Germany's screen-based DTB and France's open-outcry exchange, Matif, last year agreed to set up a co-operation programme, called Tradeus, which took effect this summer. The first phase of the co-operation involved the installation of DTB trading screens in the offices of Matif members. The second phase, which allows for two Matif products to be listed on the DTB, is expected to begin at the end of next year.</p>

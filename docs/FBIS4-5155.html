			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets staged a provocative air war  exercise against the North Wednesday with overseas-based KC-135  refueling tankers, F-15 fighter-bombers and AV-8 VTOL [vertical  takeoff and landing] assault planes and hundreds of  fighter-bombers, assault planes and observation planes belonging  to the U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet airforce,  military sources said.    The air war exercise in the skies above Chongju and Wonju  was  aimed at testing the capacity of the overseas-based warplanes of  the U.S. Airforce and Marines in non-stop quick deployment in  the operational airspace and surprise bombing on the North.    An overseas-based E-3 early warning plane, two RC-135  strategic reconnaissance planes, U-2 high-attitude strategic  reconnaissance plane, RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane and  three RF-4C airforce reconnaissance planes committed an aerial  espionage on the frontline area, coastline area, the inland and  strategic in-depth areas of the North.    Fifteen reconnaissance planes were involved in the aerial  espionage on the North in the South Korean airspace that day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The DPRK declared that it is willing to freeze its  nuclear program [haek kangnyong] and has informed the United  States. U.S. President Bill Clinton said during North  Korean-U.S. talks, Pyongyang will not conduct refueling  operations at its reactor in Yongbyon or reprocess [kagong]  waste fuel accumulated at the reactor.    International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts stationed  in North Korea will remain at its nuclear facilities [haek  taesang]. Responding to Pyongyang's freezing of its nuclear  program, Washington said that it will resume high-level talks  with the DPRK. The United States will not bring up the issue of  economic sanctions against the DPRK at the UN Security Council.    The acute situation over the DPRK nuclear program has  remarkably been eased. The situation was extremely aggravated  by Pyongyang's refusal of a complete inspection of its nuclear  facilities [haek taesange taehan sacharul wanjon surakhaji  anatkko] and its declaration on withdrawing from the IAEA.    Recent changes in the situation do not mean that a way to  the  complete solution of the North Korean nuclear problem has been  found, but necessary conditions for a solution to the problem  have been prepared.    The international community wants to assure that weapons of  mass destruction are not being produced on the Korean peninsula.  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said: If Pyongyang's  attempt to possess nuclear weapons is ignored, other countries  will try to possess nuclear weapons, following Pyongyang as a  model case. Its neighboring countries, such as the ROK and  Japan, will actively be engaged in developing nuclear weapons.    Therefore, Russia cannot help but carefully watch the  nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula. The situation in Northeast Asia  will be normalized only when Pyongyang's nuclear program is  clarified. Anyhow, Pyongyang's statement on freezing its nuclear  program will make South-North dialogue possible. A South-North  meeting is already under discussion. The easing of tensions  will make it possible to hold an international conference on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>

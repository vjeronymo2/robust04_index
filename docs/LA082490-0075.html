			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PAVES WAY FOR BUILDING OF TELESCOPES;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: STUDY OF IMPACT ON ENDANGERED RED SQUIRREL IS HELD NOT NECESSARY  FOR ARIZONA PROJECT. CONSERVATIONISTS WILL FIGHT THE RULING.  </P> <P> In a move sure to spark a challenge from environmentalists, the U.S. Forest  Service on Thursday cleared the way for the construction of three telescopes on  an Arizona mountaintop occupied by an endangered red squirrel.  </P> <P> After a lengthy review, the Justice Department told Forest Service officials  that they could issue a permit for the astronomical observatory without  requiring further study of its threat to the imperiled Mt. Graham red squirrel.  </P> <P> George H. Leonard, associate chief of the Forest Service, pledged that his  agency "will carefully monitor and report on the squirrel population" during  the construction of the telescopes.  </P> <P> Moreover, he said that the project will be shut down and re-evaluated if it  results in harm to more than six squirrels in a single year.  </P> <P> The University of Arizona, which has sought to build its $200-million Mt.  Graham International Observatory since 1984, heralded the decision and said  work to clear the site for the first telescope could begin next week.  </P> <P> "The astronomers are anxious to get started," university spokesman Steve  Emerine said. "They've been waiting a long, long time."  </P> <P> Reaction to the news from conservationists and other foes, however, suggested  that they may have to wait still longer.  </P> <P> "We'll be in court in the morning," warned Robin Silver, a Phoenix Audubon  Society leader.  </P> <P> "We consider this action a breach of public trust," Duane L. Shroufe, director  of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, added in a statement. "How scientists  who purport to be reaching for the stars can have so little foresight about  what is beneath their feet is beyond belief."  </P> <P> The Mt. Graham red squirrel, once abundant in the forests that cap the  10,700-foot mountain south of Tucson, has declined precipitately in recent  years, mostly because of piecemeal losses of habitat.  </P> <P> The shy half-pound animal was added to the nation's list of endangered species  in 1987. The species, found only on Mt. Graham, now numbers as few as 132.  </P> <P> Despite the listing, the university -- aided by such prestigious partners as  the Vatican and the Smithsonian Institution -- pressed forward with its  project, which includes one instrument billed as the world's most powerful  land-based telescope.  </P> <P> Initially, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists concluded that squirrels  and astronomy could coexist on Mt. Graham. But later, in depositions prepared  as part of a lawsuit seeking to block the telescopes, those same biologists  disclosed that they had been ordered by superiors to prepare documents that  supported the project.  </P> <P> That disclosure sparked a flurry of events ending with the formation of a  blue-ribbon panel of federal scientists to study the issue. Their report,  released earlier this month, concluded that a fresh assessment of the  observatory's threat to the squirrel was warranted.  </P> <P> But the Justice Department disagreed. A statement released by the Forest  Service said Administration attorneys believe a 1988 law that exempted the  telescopes from certain environmental reviews made additional study of the  project's impacts unnecessary.  </P> <P> The tug of war over Mt. Graham represents one of the nastiest environmental  battles in Arizona history. The squirrel became a national issue in May after  Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., in a comment that touched off a storm of  protest, said: "Nobody's told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black  one or a brown one. Do we have to save every subspecies?"  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Comex GOLD futures had rebounded by midday after early selling dried up, but the market appeared to be looking for direction. 'We're at a key point here. People are nervous about going long and about going short,' one New York analyst said. Producer selling depressed the market overnight, although buying out of the Middle East was seen providing some support. On the London bullion market business was relatively quiet. Dealers said the market had a more negative tone in the short term. 'One day it looks okay over Dollars 380, and then the next day, it looks bad Dollars 10 lower,' one commented. COPPER consolidated earlier gains on the LME, and ended firmer, while other base metals ended narrowly mixed after routine trading. Dealers said copper benefited from short-covering away from Dollars 1,800 a tonne for three-month metal, but did little to threaten the Dollars 1,850 target on the upside. Three-month ZINC spent the day trading just above Dollars 980 a tonne, where some support was expected. Dealers see the market building a base above recent lows of Dollars 970.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Gruzdilovich: "Bill Clinton: I Had Not </F> Expected Such a Hearty Welcome"]    [Text]The U.S. President was sincerely pleased.  Minsk residents, having touched him, were touched too.    I have managed to ask U.S. President Clinton about his  impressions on his visit to Minsk in the huddle on the Pobyeda  square, where, to the Minsk residents' delight, he boldly got  into contact with them, thus putting his "security" [precedent  word in transliterated English] men into a tight mess. Yet his  bodyguards have come out of this mess with credit. However, as  the President was approaching his limousine, I managed to elbow  my way through the crowd for a mini-interview. To the title  phrase of this report, Bill Clinton, while broadly smiling and  lifting his hands, added that he was sincerely pleased. One may  suppose, he was pleased not only with his visit results but also  with the Minsk residents' delight at seeing him.    Returning to that touching moment when the U.S. President  was  shaking hundreds of outstretched hands with particular attention  to the children, it should be said that this mutually friendly  disposition of Minsk residents and the President seemed to break  some invisible wall of grave officialdom, with which this visit  was surrounded; further, everything progressed in a more humane  fashion. I have in mind his meeting at the Academy of Science,  where Bill Clinton delivered a brilliant speech more in an  absorbed interlocutor's manner than in a lecturer's tone. I  mean also his visit to the Kuropaty burial ground where he was  all concentrated, but his accentuated concentration seemed to be  for his deep feeling, not for show. Well, it is remarkable when  an extremely official event on the political Olympus takes on  more human traits. This gives hope that documents are signed  not for documents' sake, and that the essence of those documents  are the people and people's predicaments. We have seen that the  U.S. President is capable of convincing not only American people  but also our citizens who by now are lost in heavy doubts as to  whether power is for the people or, per chance, against the  people.    I would like to focus on this aspect of Clinton's visit to  Minsk before touching upon the official results.  Unquestionably, it was a visit of support. Not only for  moderate reformers in the Supreme Soviet, whose efforts to  promulgate a new constitution and to launch new elections this  year were evidently supported and stimulated by Clinton. Not  only for the highest government officials who at last dared to  speak about our good interest in the common cause of nuclear  disarmament and who heard the U.S. President's positive  statements that were very close to guarantees. Not only for  industrialists, scientists, and entrepreneurs, for whom the  adopted documents -- agreements on the protection of  investments, on science and technology, on the creation of a  bilateral committee for developing business, on the  establishment of an American business center and regional  funding -- are of the greatest interest. Not only for  oppositionists who were able to impart their opinions on the  situation in the Republic to the U.S. President and received  moral support in his assertion that American assistance will be  rendered depending on the success of democratic processes. I  repeat -- not only for them. First of all, it was a visit of  support for everyone of us, for ordinary citizens who suffer all  the burden of the transition from one system to another. We are  confused, we are even shocked; only a few of us know how to get  out of this jam. President Clinton does not assume the role of  some messiah or commander, but he believes in our strength and  our ability to overcome difficulties which he calls "a pay for  hope." He believes that we will adopt a worthy constitution,  establish an economic basis for a worthy life and the economic  protection of the people, as well as elect a new legislative  body and create a system which will allow everyone to  participate in adopting the most important resolutions in our  Republic. He extends best wishes to this country which suffered  from ideological conflicts, war, and Chernobyl; he believes in  its citizens and wants to help them. Such were some of  Clinton's statements voiced in his speech at the Academy of  Sciences. It should be noted that his hope for holding new  elections in Belarus was rewarded by a special burst of applause.    What else can be included in a nonprotocol summary of this  visit? One extremely personal, but, it seems, significant  observation. The majority of the audience at the Academy of  Sciences -- mainly young scientists, young politicians and  journalists, and the cultural elite -- listened to the U.S.  President "live," whereas state officials clutched earphones  with a simultaneous translation. One should only agree with  Bill Clinton that this new highly educated and talented  generation is our greatest hope.</p>

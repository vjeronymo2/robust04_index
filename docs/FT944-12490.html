			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Lower financing costs help lift Nampak A lower effective tax rate and a reduction in financing costs allowed Nampak, the South African paper and packaging group, to increase its attributable profit for the year ended in September by 14 per cent to R350.9m (Dollars 100.2m) from R307.9m, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. The results do not include a further R10.5m in abnormal profit arising from the disposal of the Kliprivier brown paper machines. Operating profit rose by only 6 per cent to R549.7m from R517.9m on the back of a modest 5 per cent increase in turnover to R4.79bn from R4.5bn. However, a 68 per cent reduction in interest paid to R10.3m from R32.1m, combined with an almost unchanged tax bill at R201.4m, compared with R197.9m previously, helped improve the bottom line.</p>

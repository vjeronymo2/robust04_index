			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley static in chilly climate - Trading areas are 'battleground for market share' WOLVERHAMPTON &amp; Dudley Breweries, reporting a marginal increase in first-half profits, said yesterday that its trading area in the Midlands and north-west England had become, 'the battleground for market share' between the national brewers. 'We cannot avoid some of the effects,' said Mr David Miller, chairman. Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 28 edged ahead from Pounds 16.52m to Pounds 16.65m in a trading climate that was 'still pretty chilly.' Excluding property and investment disposals, profits declined from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 15.97m. Earnings per share rose slightly from 17.6p to 17.7p while the interim dividend is increased 9.3 per cent to 4.7p. Trading profit of Pounds 18.55m was 2.8 per cent higher on turnover 5.3 per cent ahead, at Pounds 107.3m, with a full contribution from the Camerons brewery acquisition, Beer volumes declined by 'a not discouraging' 0.6 per cent. Operating margins were under pressure from competition in the wholesale trade, and from rising costs of maintaining service standards to pub customers, but brewing costs were reduced. Trading margins fell from 17.7 per cent to 17.3 per cent. Mr Miller said:'We aim to avoid the disruption to margins in the wholesale trade arising from the larger brewers' market share ambitions. Improved profitability is much more likely to be achieved by lower production and distribution costs and an improvement in managed house throughputs than through the wholesale trade.' Margins improved in the tenanted estate, but pubs classified as 'boozers' suffered from the recession, particularly in the building industry. 'It is the skilled hourly-paid man who has been the backbone of trade in these pubs. For him, this recession has been interminable, and he is hard up,' said Mr Miller. Camerons expanded its distribution and pub estate in north -east England, but operating profits do not yet match the carrying costs of the acquisition made in January last year. Aggressive bidding for conference and business trade lifted hotels' turnover by 9.7 per cent. See Lex</p>

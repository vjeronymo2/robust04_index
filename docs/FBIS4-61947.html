			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sevastopol City Council Chairman Viktor </F> Mikhaylovich Semenov by G. Staroverov; place and date not given:  "Sevastopol and the Fleet Are Indivisible"]    [Text] [Staroverov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, how do you assess  the current situation in Sevastopol?    [Semenov] The situation in the city remains very tense.  First of all, this is explained by the still undetermined  status of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. A recent meeting  between Russian and Ukrainian military delegations in our city  devoted to the Black Sea Fleet issue did not produce any  positive results. On the contrary, they were a step backward.  The reason is that the Ukrainian side, in my mind, adopted a  destructive position and, in fact, avoided the Moscow agreement  on resolving the Black Sea Fleet issue step-by-step.  Nevertheless, the signature of Ukrainian President Leonid M.  Kravchuk is on this pact.    Participants in the recent session of the Sevastopol City  Executive Council have assessed the situation in the city. They  have decisively denounced the discord in relations between the  Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Black Sea Fleet. In our opinion,  this situation was triggered by the indecisiveness and  inconsistency of the moves by top leaders in Ukraine and Russia  to resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue, and their ignoring of  proposals from the Sevastopol City Council, the Crimean Supreme  Soviet, and the Crimean president.    [Statoverov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, you and Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov did not participate in this meeting between the  Russian and Ukrainian delegations.    [Semenov] To my regret, you are correct. Two seats at the  negotiating table were reserved for us. However, Ukrainian  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy categorically opposed our  participation in the talks. He explained his position by  discussing purely military-technical issues. Of course, this  was a lame excuse.    [Statoverov] What was the real reason then?    [Semenov] The negotiations reached a deadlock not on the  issue of dividing ships but on the location of the base for the  Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian Navy. This directly  addresses the core interests of all residents of Sevastopol and  Crimea. The position of the Sevastopol City Council and me, as  its chairman, is exact and explicit. We support the Russian and  Ukrainian presidents' decision on the impossibility of the  further joint stationing of two fleets at the same base and  issuing a proposal to the Ukrainian Navy to move its  headquarters and other facilities to places other than  Sevastopol. Our position is clear: Sevastopol and the Black  Sea Fleet are indivisible. For more than two centuries, they  shared their history, traditions, and goals.    [Statoverov] There is no more important issue for us, as  Sevastopol residents, than the clarification of the status of  our native city. On 26 June, when Ukrainian local  administration elections are held, we will conduct a poll of our  residents. The question will be as follows: Do you support the  status of Sevastopol as the primary Black Sea base for Russia,  as proceeding from the Russian-Ukrainian Protocol of 3 September  1993? The text of the Massandra pact will be printed on the  back of the ballot paper.    [Semenov] The location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet means  the resolution of socioeconomic issues for residents of  Sevastopol and Crimea...    [Statoverov] Of course. Currently, we are witnessing a sharp  drop in production. Many enterprises have no means even to pay  wages to their workers. Hidden unemployment is growing.  Currently, one in every three employed people is on unpaid  leave or is working part-time. Regular lack of energy resources  also adds to the overall social tension. Or, for example, the  city budget. The total sum of our expenditures adopted by the  Ukrainian Supreme Council stands only at 873 billion  karbovanetses. We need an additional five or six such budgets  to live at 1993 levels. Currently, our city cannot live at its  own expense.    At the same time, new prospects would open for us if the  Russian Black Sea Fleet base was located in Sevastopol. This  will provide us with guaranteed wages, resolve the issues of  unemployment, housing construction, health care, and culture.  Finally, this will have an impact on the development of the  spiritual culture of society, bringing up the young generation  on the heroic traditions of the Russian Fleet. This gives us  the opportunity to establish direct economic relations between  Sevastopol -- the chief Russian Black Sea Fleet base -- and  Russian cities and regions. By the way, we have already  established contacts with the Southern Rayon in Moscow and  Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon in St. Petersburg.    [Semenov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, the second round of talks on  the Black Sea Fleet have been scheduled. What would you wish  its participants?    [Statoverov] I would like that the Black Sea Fleet issue be  resolved as soon as possible. I would emphasize one more idea:  The definition of the status of Sevastopol is a prerogative of  the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, however, I cannot agree that  this issue can be resolved without the participation of the  Crimean Supreme Soviet and president, as well as the Sevastopol  City Council. The residents of Sevastopol hold out hope that  common sense will prevail over political ambitions, and the  negotiations will be held in the immediate future. I would like  to finish our interview with words from the appeal issued by the  Sevastopol City Council to the fraternal peoples of Russia and  Ukraine: "The Black Sea Fleet should belong to Russia!" "The  Black Sea Fleet Base should be located in Sevastopol!"</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Writing on wall for 'extravagant' salaries Sir, Some 20 years ago, when directors were less well remunerated, Lord Kearton, in support of more enlightened treatment, was reported to be advising British industry that 'if we pay peanuts we shall breed monkeys'. I wonder what suggestions Lord Kearton might offer today for dealing with a less acceptable species which has taken over. Roger Young of the British Institute of Management ('Executive pay rises attacked', April 27), quite properly draws attention to the inequity of a consenting system which apparently allows certain individuals to vote themselves extravagant rewards on the basis that they could do better abroad and the country would be worse off if they defected. At a recent annual general meeting it was noticeable that shareholders were already prepared to react strongly against this form of thinly veiled executive blackmail and I am delighted to see support for their views from Christopher Lorenz (Management: 'Lies, damn lies and directors' salaries', April 29) in the FT. The writing is on the wall. Neil Ostrom, Priestfield, Watts Lane, Chislehurst, Kent</p>

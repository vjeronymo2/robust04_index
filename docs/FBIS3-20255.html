			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Heidi Borud and Bard Idas report: "Few Doubts in Labor's </F> National Executive: Wants To Vote After Sweden"]    [Text] The Labor Party's leadership remains very firm that  Norway's EU [European Union] vote must come after Sweden's.    Both party leader Thorbjorn Jagland and Prime Minister Gro  Harlem Brundtland argued strongly for this at the extraordinary  meeting of the party's national executive in Oslo yesterday.  Parts of the meeting were open to the press. After  introductory remarks by the party leader and the prime minister,  members of the national executive were allowed to speak.    Storting deputy Hallvard Bakke, who leads Social Democrats  Against the EU [SME], was number two in the list of speakers,  and he launched a crass attack on the prime minister's arguments  on the EU.    Bakke also reiterated the demand the no side is making with  regard to the party's extraordinary national congress that will  probably be held on 18 and 19 June: The opponents of the EU in  the Labor Party must be given the same amount of rostrum time in  order to be able to put across their overall assessment of the  outcome of the negotiations.    Bakke himself is unwilling to comment on the result of the  negotiations before he has read the documents.    "I checked with the foreign minister today, and the results  of the negotiations will not be available to the rest of us for  many weeks."    Bakke added that judging from the newspaper reports the  results were more or less as expected.    He also asked the prime minister for a detailed review of  the  budgetary consequences of EU membership and wanted to know how  Norway's EU contribution of around 4 billion kroner is to be  covered.    The SME leader argued strongly against holding the  referendum  after Sweden.    "The result of the referendum could be of practical  political  significance. But I am not naive. Might is right. The final  outcome can probably be taken for granted," Bakke said.    The leadership of the Labor Party remains firm that Norway  should hold its referendum after Sweden and Finland. Party  leader Thorbjorn Jagland yesterday argued that there are  democratic and not tactical reasons behind the desire to hold  the referendum after those of our neighbors:    "We know that many people want to know the outcomes of the  referendums in Sweden and Denmark [as published] before they  make up their minds, and this is something we should take into  account. We cannot allow the danger of being accused of playing  a tactical game to prevent us from behaving in a democratic  manner. I will take that risk, and I believe I have support for  this view in the party, including among people on the no side,"  Jagland said.    Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland elaborated:    "There is a clear logic in Norway's holding its referendum  after the other countries. It was Sweden and Finland that  triggered off Norway's process toward the EU; both countries  sought membership before we did. And we have to remember that  it is not the case that it is Sweden and Finland that are  thinking about how we vote in Norway -- it is we who attach  importance to what the other two countries do," Brundtland  pointed out.    The prime minister stressed that Norwegian EU membership  will  help to unite the Nordic area, while a no could lead to a  situation in which the EU's external border follows the border  between Norway and Sweden.    "That is why knowledge of the Swedish and Finnish votes is  of such great importance to the decision we ourselves must  take," she said. Jagland said yesterday that the parties in the  Storting are hardly likely to meet to decide the date of the  Norwegian referendum until after Easter.    Thorbjorn Jagland made it clear that the leadership of the  Labor Party will not use the party whip on opponents of the EU  in the party in the run-up to the referendum.    "Both opponents and supporters have just as much right to  fight for their views on an issue that will be decided by the  people."    VERDENS GANG wrote in its editorial column yesterday that  "Bakke and Co. are moving ever closer to what has to be called  unadulterated splittism -- something that ought to be no joke in  the Norwegian Labor Party."    Jagland was unwilling to comment on this remark to  AFTENPOSTEN.    However, a clearly irritated Hallvard Bakke described the  article as "a load of rubbish."    In his introductory remarks to the national executive  meeting  Jagland stressed that other rules must apply when something is  put before the people in a referendum.    "Party discipline must apply in the Storting chamber -- not  out of respect for the party, but out of respect for the voters  who have supported the Labor Party's program. But once  something has been taken out of the Storting, it is the people  who decide," he said.    He also made it clear that SME is not considered to be a  part  of the party.    "This has been decided by a unanimous central executive.  What this organization then gets up to is not the  responsibility of the Labor Party," Jagland said.    The Labor Party is planning to arrange its extraordinary  national congress on Norwegian EU membership for 18 and 19 June.    "The date is dependent, however, on whether the EU is able  to  resolve its internal disagreements on voting rules. It will  therefore be the central executive who will fix the final date,"  party secretary Dag Terje Andersen said yesterday evening after  the national executive meeting.</p>

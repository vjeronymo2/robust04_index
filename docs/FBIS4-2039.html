			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of the report on the work of the Heilongjiang </F> Provincial Higher People's Court given by Tang Xianqiang,  president of the provincial Higher People's Court, at the second  session of the eighth Heilongjiang Provincial people's congress]    [Text] Fellow Deputies:    I now submit the report on the work of courts across the  province since the first session of the eighth provincial  people's congress for your examination and approval.    In 1993, after the convocation of the first session of the  eighth provincial people's congress, courts at all levels across  the province used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the  14th party congress as the guidance, conscientiously implemented  the guidelines of the resolution of the first session of the  eighth provincial people's congress on the work report of the  provincial Higher People's Court under the leadership,  supervision, and guidance of the party committees and the  people's congresses at all levels and the Supreme People's  Court, acted in close connection with the central tasks of the  party and the state, comprehensively strengthened all tasks  centering on judicial work, and provided effective legal service  and judicial guarantee for deepening reform and opening up and  for accelerating economic construction. These were manifested  in the following: First, courts at all levels across the  province upheld the viewpoint that handling more cases, handling  cases rapidly, and handling them well as the most direct and  effective service for reform, opening up, and economic  construction, further strengthened all judicial tasks, accepted  a total of 187,945 cases of the first instance, and completed  188,009 cases (including leftover cases from the previous year),  up 3.1 percent and 3.6 percent respectively over the previous  year. The rate of comprehensively winding up cases was 98  percent, 5,644 cases more were completed as compared with the  previous year; cases which were not completed showed a decline  of 5.7 percent from the previous year. This showed that new  progress was made in judicial work. Second, courts at all levels  across the province persisted in linking judicial work with  reform, opening up, and economic construction, gave prominence  to service on their own initiative, expanded the service sphere,  strengthened service measures, enhanced the service level, gave  simultaneous attention to the quality of handling cases,  efficiency, and results, and made new progress in making  judicial work serve reform, opening up, and economic  construction. Third, courts at all levels across the province  persisted in regarding forming an image of "listening to reason  while enforcing law, and performing their work most justly and  honestly" as their objective, regarded building spiritual  civilization as a motivation, and strengthened the ranks of  judicial personnel. Among the courts across the province, 195  had been named civilized units by their local party committees  and governments, accounting for 97 percent of the total number  of courts; among the court cadres and policemen across the  province, 2,856 cadres and policemen were commended and awarded,  accounting for 25.1 percent of the total number of cadres and  policemen. This showed that new progress was made in building  the ranks of policemen. The new progress in judicial work and  the self-development of courts across the province should be  attributed to our efforts to grasp the following three aspects  of work:    1. We unceasingly deepened the guiding ideology for judicial  work and conscientiously expanded the degree of serving reform,  opening up, and economic construction. Since the beginning of  1993, particularly after the issuance of the central major  policy decision on strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control and the "decision of the CPC Central Committee on some  issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure" adopted at the third plenary session of the  ah CPC Central Committee, the provincial court, on the basis of  conscientiously conducting investigation and analyzing the new  situation facing judicial work, successively held work meetings  and meetings of court presidents on three occasions to study  guidelines on how to consciously deepen judicial work and to  strengthen the work on serving reform, opening up, and economic  construction. The meetings set forth the necessity to  ceaselessly emancipate the mind; renew the idea of enforcing  laws; firmly foster the idea of taking the overall situation  into consideration, the idea of service, the idea of policies,  and the idea of accomplishing something; bring into full play  the legal means' key functions for strengthening the  macroeconomic regulation and control and standardizing the  socialist market economic operation; justly enforce laws;  improve work efficiency according to the policy on the inherent  efficiency of the socialist market economy; stress the benefits  from enforcement of laws; bravely eliminate the influence of the  local protectionism and the departmental protectionism according  to the requirements for the socialist unified, open-typed, and  large-scale markets; enforce laws in a unified way; accurately  handle the new-typed cases cropping up in the course of  replacing the old systems by the new and under the situation  that laws are not stipulated in explicit terms; persist in the  accurate law enforcement orientation; and provide effective  legal services and judicial guarantees for setting up the  socialist market economic system. Due to the ceaseless  deepening of the ideology for guiding the trial work, we  enhanced the awareness of regulating and controlling the  macroeconomy, developing the socialist market economy, and  serving the struggle against corruption and the safeguarding of  the social stability. First, we especially and concentratively  attacked criminal activities and expanded the dynamics of  dealing blows to various serious criminal offenders who  jeopardize social order. The courts at various levels across  the province unswervingly implemented the principle of sternly  and immediately punishing criminal offenders and sentenced  16,254 criminal offenders who caused legal effect, including  6,589 criminals who were sentenced to five years of imprisonment  or more or even to death, accounting for 40.5 percent of the  total. The courts got involved, in advance, in the cases  involving gangs of criminals and the major evil cases that  society and the masses paid attention to; and tried every  possible means to immediately try these cases. When waging the  province-wide "spring attack," "100-day fortified battle," and  "strict blow" struggles, we concentratively organized several  province-wide attacks and maintained the momentum of the  attacks. Second, we concentrated energy to try major and  appalling economic criminal cases and strengthened the dynamics  of strictly punishing economic criminals. The courts at various  levels across the province generally set up leading groups to  try major and appalling economic criminal cases and also set up  a perfect system to report and supervise the handling of major  and appalling cases. Persistently in line with the principle of  strict punishment according to laws, we sentenced 2,777  criminals who were guilty of corruption and bribery and caused  legal effect, including 884 or 31.8 percent of criminals who  were sentenced to five years of imprisonment or more and even to  death. According to the party Central Committee and the  provincial party committee's requirements for making  achievements in the current-stage struggle against corruption,  the provincial court concentratively organized forces and tried  two groups of criminals who were involved in the major and  appalling economic cases. In the forms of public trials and  public pronunciation of the judgment, we strengthened propaganda  and expanded the social effect of handling cases. Third, in  line with the demands for economic development, we strengthened  the dynamics of regulating, according to laws, the relationship  among various sectors of the economy. The courts at various  levels across the province positively explored new ways for  serving the economic construction and expanded the service  channels. The courts accepted and handled first rulings on  36,816 economic cases, and the lawsuits on these cases were  marked at 2.51 billion yuan, respectively increasing by 14.4  percent and 90.8 percent over the previous year. According to  the provincial actual conditions, the courts from higher levels  downward carried out the special service activities of clearing  up debts, defaulted taxes, and loans. By adopting lawsuit and  non-lawsuit means, the courts at various levels handled 17,979  enterprises' clearing-up cases, these cases were marked at 890  million yuan, and 358 million yuan were retrieved for  enterprises. By launching the activities that the tax affairs  organizations jointly investigated, handled, and cleared up the  cases of paying taxes and fines that should have been paid, 238  million yuan worth of defaulted taxes were paid. Actively  working in cooperation with the financial departments, the  courts examined and handled, according to laws, 4,965 cases of  withdrawing loans; and withdrew 265 million yuan of overdue  loans and idle funds. Thus, the courts played a positive role in  enlivening capital and promoting the development of the economy.    2. We persisted in enforcing laws strictly and strived to  upgrade the law-enforcement level. To safeguard the unity and  sanctity of law-enforcement and ensure impartial enforcement of  laws, courts at all levels in the province always regarded  strict law-enforcement and improvement of law-enforcement level  as a very important task. First, we further improved the  supervisory and restrictive mechanisms focusing on judicial  supervision. While paying attention to standardized management  of judicial work, strictly implementing the open trial system,  and conducting large-scale inspection on law- and  discipline-enforcement, we further improved the work mechanisms  that separate registration of cases from trial of cases, trial  of cases from law-enforcement, and trial of cases from  supervision, and we worked out corresponding work systems to add  impetus to the supervisory work and raise its level. Through the  judicial supervision, courts at all levels in the province  handled 13,144 appeals for reexamination and retrial, of which  4.3 percent, or 566 cases, had their verdicts changed according  to law. By strengthening judicial supervision, we corrected  improper judgments of cases and erroneous deeds in  law-enforcement. We also drew on experiences and lessons form  this to promote the law-enforcement level. Thanks to inspection  on law-enforcement, we attained an accuracy rate of more than 96  percent and 91 percent in enforcing substantive laws and  procedural laws, respectively. Second, we further strengthened  the systems to ensure the quality in handling cases, which is  focused on the system of investigating and affixing the  responsibility for wrong cases. The provincial court began to  experiment with this system in March last year at the courts at  two levels in Qitaihe and Harbin cities, Suihua Prefecture, and  state farms, clarified the scope of wrong cases, the major  persons to be held accountable, measures for punishment, and  procedures for handling, and established and improved relevant  supporting measures. This system helped effectively enhance the  sense of responsibility of cadres and policemen, improve the  quality and efficiency in handling cases, promote honesty in  performing official duties, facilitate the establishment and  improvement of the mechanism of competition for cadre  management, reform the patterns of trial, strengthen management,  and raise the overall level of judicial work. After  conscientiously summarizing the experiences of the experiment,  the provincial court in December last year held a work  conference on disseminating this system in the courts throughout  the province. It decided that this system be applied by the  courts at all levels in the province beginning 1 January this  year in order to improve the supervisory mechanism for handling  cases and the systems to ensure the quality. Third, we  strengthened guidance to lower levels, with the focus on  conducting investigation and study on implementation of laws and  policies. To correctly handle the new types of cases emerging  in reform, opening up, and economic construction in a timely  manner, the provincial court organized and concentrated efforts  to conduct investigation and study on how the seven intermediate  courts and 34 grass-roots courts tried the new types of cases on  bills, bankruptcy, and disputes over border trade and, in view  of the problems that existed, formulated and issued documents to  standardize the trials of cases on bills, bankruptcy, labor  disputes, and real estate, and cases involving foreigners.  These documents offered operable opinions on issues concerning  enforcement of policies and laws and standardized  law-enforcement activities.    3. Focusing on the anticorruption struggle, we greatly  improved the contingents of cadres and policemen. To  conscientiously implement the arrangements of the party Central  Committee, the provincial party committee, and the Supreme  People's Court on waging the anticorruption struggle and to  achieve success in the anticorruption struggle of the provincial  court, the provincial court formulated in a timely manner the  "opinions on the anticorruption struggle to be waged by all the  courts in the province in the near future" and the "work plan  for the organs of the provincial court to wage the  anticorruption struggle in the near future," clarified the major  problems to be addressed and the methods, steps, ensuring  measures, and basic requirements of the struggle, and thus  promoted the in-depth development of the struggle in the courts  at all levels of the province. First, we conducted extensive  and intensive education to oppose corruption and advocate  honesty among cadres and policemen. By carrying out ideological  mobilization and organizing outstanding judges to make mobile  reports on their deeds, the province conducted education among  cadres and policemen on the typical cases of violating the law  and discipline and better dealt with the ideological problems  committed by cadres and policemen with regard to "having nothing  to do with them," "implicating others and adopting a  wait-and-see attitude," " indulging in self glorification," and  of "being insufficient in confidence." Thus, the consciousness  and firmness of cadres and policemen in successfully waging the  struggle against corruption were enhanced. Second, clearing up  and consolidation were carried out. By persistently regarding  as an emphasis the work of encouraging cadres at or above the  section level to perform their official duties honestly and to  conduct self discipline, the province adopted the methods of  conducting self examination and inspection; setting up hot  telephone line and boxes for reporting cases; visiting the  departments concerned; and sending letters to solicit opinions  to deal with the problems in the following fields: Personnel in  charge of handling the cases accepted the treat given by the  offenders while taking food, boarding, and travel together with  these offenders. Personnel accepted the money of offenders for  paying their investigation expenses that are originally  official. Personnel handled the cases by accepting bribes  through doing the offenders a favor and giving a favorable  decision in line with personal relationship. Personnel accepted  bails and investigation expenses for probation by violating the  regulations. In line with the difference of these problems, the  province handled them respectively. Of the 37 offenders who  committed 35 cases by seriously violating the law and  discipline, 30 were imposed on with the sanctions of party and  administrative disciplines; and seven were transferred to the  procuratorial organs to pursue their criminal liabilities.  Those who accepted bails and investigation expenses for  probation were ordered to return the money within the given  date. Third, we further established or improved the systems of  performing official duties honestly. In line with the problems  exposed in the struggle against corruption, courts at all levels  across the province formulated or improved at their own level  the systems of enforcing the law honestly and encouraging  administrative honesty and anticorruption and further reinforced  the supervisory work. While deeply waging the struggle against  corruption, courts at all levels across the province also  further enhanced the ideological and political work and  extensively carried out the activities of fostering the fine  image of people's courts, tribunals, and judges who are "the  best in being impervious to reason, being justice, and being  honest". They also vied to carry out the activities of scoring  outstanding achievements and the emulation drive for carrying  out on-the-job training for personnel. All of these have led  cadres and policemen to foster their correct outlook on life and  value; vigorously encouraged the development of the spirit of  making selfless contributions, serving the people  wholeheartedly, and strictly enforcing the law; and vigorously  upgraded the political and professional quality of cadres and  policemen.    Courts across the province achieved new progress in various  work in 1993 and achieved larger progress in some fields.  However, in line with the demands cropping up in developing the  new situation and tasks, they still have some problems that  brook to be neglected, which chiefly are as follows: The  initiative of few courts in serving reform, opening up, and  economic construction is not strong; their ways to render  service in this regard are not wide; and their dynamics in this  regard is not enough. Problems of not strictly enforcing the  law and making unfair decisions in few cases still exist. Few  cadres and policemen lack the sense of public servants and adopt  a lukewarm, rigid, rude, and blunt attitude toward the masses.  Specific cadres and policemen often commit the problems of  handling the cases by doing a favor to offenders, giving  favorable decisions in line with personal relationship, seeking  personal gains by taking advantage of power, and violating the  law and discipline. Measures adopted by courts for self  improvement have been totally implemented. The supervisory  mechanism of strictly running the courts have to be further  improved and implemented. The interference of local and  departmental protectionism is still very serious. Difficulties  cropping up in enforcing the law have not been fundamentally  overcome. As for the existing and aforementioned problems, we  will adopt a seek-truth attitude and realistic measure to carry  out earnest study over them and to earnestly resolve them.    Fellow deputies, at present, China is in an important  historical period of deepening reform and comprehensively  accelerating economic development. In the whole process of  building the socialist market economic structure, we must rely  on law enforcement to guarantee the operation of the market  economy and use legal means to adjust all relations and disputes  in the market economic activities. The people's courts which are  holding an important status of enforcing law will face a higher  demand and more complicated tasks, and will play a more  prominent role and shoulder more important responsibilities. In  order to meet the need of the development of the new situation  in a better manner, we have defined the guidelines for the work  of courts across the province in 1994, which are: Use Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary session  of the 14th party Central Committee as the guidance,  comprehensively strengthen all judicial work, give priority to  trying major and appalling cases, persist in strictly enforcing  law, enhance the law enforcement level, realistically strengthen  self-development, strive to upgrade and improve all work, and  provide effective legal service and judicial guarantee for  accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic  structure and promoting an accelerated development in our  province's economy. The general demands are: We must create a  momentum in dealing blows to criminals, achieve effective  results in handling major and appalling cases, make big progress  in readjusting the relations in various economic sectors,  comprehensively enhance the law enforcement level, and achieve  new progress in all undertakings. To realize the aforementioned  guidelines and general demands, we must stress the following  five aspects of work: First, we should deal strict blows to  criminal offenses that seriously harm public security so as to  safeguard social stability. It is necessary to proceed the work  from the overall situation of providing a stable social  environment for the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, continue to uphold the strategic principle  of "taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with  both," resolutely deal blows to all kinds of criminals who  seriously harm public security, and do all we can to safeguard  social stability. We must maintain a momentum of dealing blows  to criminals, resolutely deal blows to such crimes as murder,  robbery, rape, hooliganism, serious theft, "bus and train  robbery and waylaying," and "six vices," particularly the crimes  committed by cliques involving the underworld society. We should  strengthen the degree of dealing blows, uphold the principle of  punishing criminals heavily and quickly in line with law, and  rapidly try and resolutely mete out heavy punishment for  criminals who seriously harm public security. It is necessary  to expand the effect of dealing blows, conduct concentrated and  special activities on dealing blows to criminals of different  scales, with different substance, and at different levels in a  timely manner, and give further play to the overall functions of  courts in joining the comprehensive management of public  security. Second, we should strictly punish serious economic  criminals, safeguard economic order, and promote the deepening  of anticorruption struggle. It is necessary to unceasingly  deepen understanding on the necessity of dealing blows to  economic crimes under the new situation and give priority to  dealing blows to state functionaries who abuse their posts to  engage in corruption, bribery, and misappropriation of public  funds; and resolutely deal blows to such crimes as smuggling,  cheating, making or selling fake or inferior products, and tax  evasion. We should uphold the principle of punishing criminals  strictly in line with law, resolutely resist and eliminate  interferences from all sectors, and resolutely mete out heavy  punishment to those who deserve heavy punishment and capital  punishment to those who deserve death punishment in line with  law. We should deepen anticorruption struggle through strictly  punishing serious economic criminals in line with law. Third,  we should regulate the relations in the economic sectors in line  with law and promote the sound performance of the social market  economy. It is necessary to proceed from the provincial  conditions and characteristics and give further play to the  functions and role of judicial work in regulating the relations  in various economic sectors. We should actively try all sorts  of cases on disputes emerging in the course of accelerating the  establishment of the modern enterprise system, on developing the  market system, on improving the economic regulation and control  system, and on improving the rural operational system and reform  of the foreign trade system in line with law and promote the  development of the socialist market economy.    Attention should be paid to trying and handling the cases  of new categories that have a direct bearing on the market  economy, such as the cases concerning stocks, bills, bonds,  futures agent, money-lending, and leasing. The research for the  application of laws and policies should be strengthened in a  timely manner in order to set forth standardized opinions. The  experiences that facilitate economic construction should be  summarized and deepened continuously, and such special service  items as the cleanup of defaulted debts, loans, and taxes should  be strengthened until good results are achieved. Fourth, the  disputes among the people should be handled appropriately, the  legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and  other organizations should be protected actually, and social  stability and unity should be guaranteed. We should  conscientiously handle according to law the frequently occurred  cases such as the cases concerning marriage, families,  compensation, inheritance, houses and grounds, as well as the  cases that involve many aspects and exert great influence, such  as the cases concerning mountains and forest, irrigation  facilities, and land. We should actively try and handle various  kinds of cases of new categories, such as the cases concerning  copyright, reputation right, portrait right, labor disputes, and  real estate, so that we can resolve contradictions in a timely  manner and promote stability, unity, and the building of  socialist spiritual civilization. Special attention should be  paid to handle in a timely and appropriate manner the cases with  regard to the reduction of peasants' burdens in order to  actually protect the legitimate rights and interests of peasants  and mobilize peasants' enthusiasm in production. Fifth, the  building of the ranks of court workers should be strengthened  further to ensure strict law enforcement. We should continue to  grasp the administration of justice with one hand and grasp the  building of the ranks of court workers with the other hand.  Efforts should be made to improve the political and  professional expertise of court workers in order to try and  handle cases more efficiently and in better quality and ensure  strict enforcement of laws. We should extensively and  profoundly launch the activities of fostering the image that  people's courts, people's tribunals, and people's judges are  most reasonable, most fair-minded, and most honest. We should  fully understand the importance, necessity, and urgency of  launching the activities under the new situation of building the  socialist market economic structure, and should attach high  importance on and do a solid job to launch the activities by  regarding it as the goal and guiding principle for the building  of the province's ranks of court workers. We should administer  people's courts and the police strictly, strictly enforce laws  and discipline, give rewards and punishments impartially, and  straighten out discipline and work style in a timely and  concentrative manner to prevent unhealthy trends from growing  and spreading. We should further expand the channels of legal  supervision, democratic supervision, and mass supervision,  profoundly launch anticorruption campaign, and continuously give  prominence to resolving such illegal issues as abusing one's  power to seek personal gain, accepting gifts and bribes,  practicing favoritism when trying cases, and unwarranted pooling  of charges in order to correct unhealthy trends of trades. The  discovered clues for resolving violations of laws and discipline  should be investigated through to the end, and once these  violations are verified, they should be dealt with severely  without any indulgence and accommodation. We should vigorously  strengthen the building of ideology and work style of leading  bodies, actually build leading bodies of people's courts at all  levels into a core of leadership that is tough in politics, good  in style of work, competent in work, honest and strict in  administration, and impartial in enforcing laws. So, we an  ensure the strict enforcement of laws.    Fellow deputies, under the new situation of accelerating  reform, opening up and establishing the socialist market  economic structure, all the work of people's courts in the  province are confronted with new challenges and tests. We  should further enhance the sense of mission and the sense of  responsibility, closely depend on the leadership of party  committees at all levels and on the supervision and support of  people's congresses at all levels to forge ahead and work hard  in order to provide effective legal service and judicial  guarantee for the province's reform, opening up, and economic  construction.</p>

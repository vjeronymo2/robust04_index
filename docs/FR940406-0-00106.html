			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturers commented that the puff loss test would provide no additional control over that achieved by the refueling test and the evaporative emissions rule requirement that tanks pressurized to over 10 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; (25 cm) H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O be vented to the canister upon cap removal. EPA disagrees with this assessment. The refueling test does not measure emissions from cap removal directly after vehicle operation. The evaporative emissions requirement allows for the venting of tank pressures under 10 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O to the atmosphere. These emissions can be appreciable. General Motors (GM) calculated that the puff loss from venting a 10 percent full, 20 gallon (76 liter) tank at 10 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O would be about 3 grams. EPA agrees with this estimate but disagrees with the contention that this is minor, given that this same vehicle would only be allowed to emit a little over 3 grams during the refueling test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM also argued that the execution of a cap-off test involving a warm-up drive followed immediately by a cap-off step in a SHED would be complex and formidable. EPA agrees with GM's contentions that hot soak emissions could confuse the puff loss measurement and that the time required to move a vehicle from a dynamometer cell to a SHED and remove the cap would be overly long compared to the actual in-use event, which typically involves less than a minute from key-off to cap-off. These two concerns would affect the measured emissions in opposite directions and would make it difficult to ascertain a puff loss emission corresponding to the in-use event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA remains concerned about puff loss emissions, particularly considering that the new evaporative emission control requirements may prompt manufacturers to rely more heavily on pressurized tank designs in the future. However, EPA believes it necessary to defer action on this issue so that an effective test procedure can be developed, involving more complete public participation. Therefore, EPA is leaving this portion of the rulemaking open for now and intends to take up this issue as part of the planned further action on pressurized designs announced in the evaporative emissions control final rule (58 FR 16012). However, it should be noted that the enhanced evaporative emissions rule will require controls for systems whose pressure exceeds 10 inches H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O, and thus control is already in place for these extreme situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Spitback Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes, and manufacturers' comments indicate, that vehicles would not be expected to comply with the refueling emission standard if they emitted significant spitback emissions during the refueling test. Fuel spilled on the side of the vehicle or in the SHED when the fuel nozzle shuts off will evaporate and be included as part of the refueling emissions. In recognition of this effect, this final rule also waives the spitback testing requirement for vehicles being certified to meet the ORVR requirements. Similar to the provision for ``inherently low refueling emission vehicles'' discussed above, manufacturers can, at their option, certify as part of the certification application, that they agree with EPA's assessment regarding the effect of spitback emissions on the ability to pass the refueling emission standard and that their vehicle passes the spitback test standard. Of course, manufacturers may elect to comply with the spitback test in lieu of using this waiver option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance with the spitback standard is still required, and EPA is retaining the spitback test and standard promulgated in the enhanced evaporative emissions control rule (58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). EPA may conduct or require manufacturers to conduct the spitback test to demonstrate compliance should concerns over vehicle spitback arise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Nozzle Geometry Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA asked for comment on the need for fuel nozzle geometry standards as part of an ORVR program, and suggested that auto makers and nozzle manufacturers undertake a voluntary initiative to develop national consensus standards in this area. This initiative is being undertaken under the auspices of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). An SAE technical committee, comprised of auto maker, fuel nozzle manufacturer, and other representatives, is considering revisions to SAE standard J285 ``Gasoline Dispenser Nozzle Spouts''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Unigate to float Black-eyed Pea UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, has filed a preliminary prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the public offer of its US restaurant chain. The float is expected to be priced at between Dollars 220m and Dollars 250m (Pounds 145m to Pounds 164m). Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, said that if there was a sharp fall in the stock market and the price had to be cut then Unigate would not proceed with the sale. But he said Unigate had 'a moral obligation to go forward if it is in the price range'. In February Unigate signalled that the business, called Black-eyed Pea Restaurants, was up for sale with a public offer under consideration. The restaurants offer 'home-style' cooking at value-for-money prices. Analysts said that the decision to go ahead with the flotation suggested no trade buyer had appeared at a high enough price. Mr Buckland said the proceeds would cover the cost of three recent acquisitions - the purchase of Clifford Foods for Pounds 50.4m, Glass Glover, the distribution company, for Pounds 54m, and some of the milk business of the Co-operative Wholesale Society for Pounds 17m. However, he said that if the float was pulled it would not put a strain on Unigate's balance sheet. He promised more activity on acquisitions and disposals. Last autumn Unigate sold its US cheese business for Dollars 75m (Pounds 37m at the time). One analyst estimated that the sale of the restaurant chain would cut Unigate's gearing by the end of the 1993-94 financial year to around 20 per cent. However, analysts also feared that the sale could dilute Unigate's earnings as the return on the cash would be less than the profit from Black-eyed Pea. In the 1991-92 financial year the restaurant business made an operating profit of Pounds 13.3m. The exit multiple on the indicated price range is 14.8 to 16.9. If the SEC approves the document, and the underwriters to the issue find sufficient interest from investors, the deal should go ahead in May. Unigate aims to sell the whole of its interest, but could retain up to 10 per cent to provide a 'green shoe' enabling the underwriters to supply extra shares if demand is strong. The capital employed in the restaurant business was shown in Unigate's 1992 accounts at Pounds 34.2m. See Lex</p>

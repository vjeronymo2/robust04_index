			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Commerzbank plans DM125m offering COMMERZBANK'S delayed capital-raising programme is to start next month with the issue of DM125m (Dollars 78.6m) of new shares. The issue, although smaller than expected, will bolster the bank's capital base, giving it more room for expansion within capital adequacy constraints. The bank yesterday declined to comment on the issue price. The move follows the issue of DM500m of profit-sharing certificates last month, which counts as Tier Two capital. Under European legislation, Tier One equity capital should be maintained at a minimum of 4 per cent of total assets. The distribution of the new shares, which will carry full dividend rights from January 1, will allow Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's top three banks, to expand. Although domestic economic conditions are difficult, the bank will be better placed to benefit from any recovery in the US, where it enjoys an A1+ rating. Commerzbank is expected to issue more shares during next year, although the timing and the size of of programme will depend on economic conditions and how well this initial tranche is received. The board, which was given shareholder approval earlier this year to issue 8m new shares up to the end of 1997, postponed an action planned for September which was designed to raise up to DM600m, assuming a price of DM200. The issue was withheld because of the weak state of the stock market. At the time Commerzbank's shares were trading close to the year's low at around DM220, compared with the year's high of DM273. They have recently steadied at above DM240. A group of institutional shareholders, including Dresdner Bank and Allianz, Germany's biggest insurer, are to pool their stakes in Veba, the energy-based conglomerate. They plan to set up a new company which will hold around 10 per cent of Veba's shares, at present widely distributed among more than 500,000 shareholders.</p>

[Begin Rao recording] I said we will have to deal with  terrorism, transborder terrorism, exported terrorism, all that  is going on there. We have to control it, create conditions of  law and order so that we could proceed toward a democratic  process, which that particular state has not had for some time.  [end recording]    Political activity has gained momentum in Jammu and Kashmir  with the former chief minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, returning  to the state after a stay in the United Kingdom. On his arrival  in Jammu today, Dr. Abdullah held detailed discussions with  senior party colleagues and reviewed the political situation.  Talking to newsmen, Dr. Abdullah said that he will reactivate  the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference in the state. He said  New Delhi has succeeded in exporting to the international  community Pakistan's role in aiding and abetting terrorism in  the state. Dr. Abdullah, however, said a lot still needs to be  done to fail Pakistan's designs on Kashmir.</p>

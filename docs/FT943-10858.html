			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UN shifts Rwanda aid focus The United Nations is planning a big shift in its humanitarian aid programme for Rwanda, from coping with 'immediate life-saving needs' - principally among the 1.2m refugees around the Zairean town of Goma - to creating the conditions for refugees to return home, Frances Williams and Leslie Crawford report. Addressing donor governments in Geneva at a meeting to pledge contributions to the UN's Dollars 434m Rwandan appeal, Mr Peter Hansen, head of the UN's humanitarian affairs department, said the Rwandan Patriotic Front government appeared committed to bringing Rwandans back and rebuilding the country. One element of the UN programme would be confidence-building, including deployment of international human rights monitors, to give returning refugees a sense of security. Another would be action to make sure there is no huge exodus of the 1.5m-2m displaced people now in the French-controlled humanitarian protection zone in south-west Rwanda. The 2,500 French troops are due to leave by late August. In Kigali, an advance party of British soldiers arrived to take part in the international relief effort. The 600-strong mission, codenamed Operation Gabriel, is the largest deployment of British troops in Africa since they oversaw Zimbabwe's first multi-racial elections 14 years ago. Medical staff hope to prevent the spread of cholera and dysentry in Rwanda by screening and treating returning refugees in Ruhengeri, close to the Zaire border. Engineers will be based in the northern town of Byumba to help rebuild bridges and repair roads damaged during Rwanda's civil war.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Personal View: Short-term view of broadcasting The government's policy on broadcasting is a fine example of short-termism. It has made clear, since the green paper on the future of the BBC was published in November, that it is in favour of retaining the licence fee when the BBC's charter is renewed in 1996. Its motive is clearly to avoid the controversy that would result from implementing the decision eventually to replace the licence fee with subscription, announced in the 1988 white paper on broadcasting in the 1990s. It has also showed that it has rejected advertising, the alternative source of finance to subscription, by the terms of the new franchises for the ITV network. As the government stated in the 1988 white paper, the licence fee will become harder to sustain as new television services proliferate, and as the BBC's share of the market declines. The number of new services will have multiplied by 1996, and still more before the new charter expires in 2011. Forecasts of the BBC's future share of the market can be little better than guesswork, but we can be sure that its share will fall as more alternatives become available. Collecting the licence fee must become more difficult and more unpopular as fewer viewers watch the BBC; long before 2011, the politicians in power will have to face the need to replace the licence fee. The case for moving from the licence fee to new sources of finance is not only that the licence fee will become unsustainable but that it represents an inequitable and inefficient method of financing a TV service. It is inequitable because it tries to force viewers to pay for the BBC whether they want to or not, and because it levies the same charge on all viewers, irrespective of their means. The licence fee is inefficient because it gives viewers no means of influencing the content of the programmes they are shown - a feature that seems to be regarded as a virtue by proponents of the BBC who endow its staff with the ability to supply viewers with programmes which they do not know that they want but which will improve their lives and society. This seems a vice to those who believe that individuals know best which programmes will most benefit them. Television can have a strictly educational role, which the government may finance; it can also bring the arts to people who would not otherwise have access to them, and the government might subsidise such programmes. But there are dangers to democracy in a broadcasting organisation that believes it can improve people; it may also try to influence political beliefs. A service that relies on the government for its funds must be susceptible to political pressure; the BBC is unlikely to do anything to offend the government until the terms of its new charter are fixed, and it would become more vulnerable to political pressure if the licence fee became more unpopular. The likely decline in the BBC's share of viewing must raise doubts about its ability to finance the present scale of service from subscription alone. While the size of any broadcasting system should reflect the demand for its services, in a libertarian society where the individual consumer is sovereign, the BBC would be unduly handicapped in competing with other services if it was barred from taking advertisements. In the long term this should be feasible without weakening the existing advertising-financed services in Britain, if the Treasury could be induced to surrender some of its gains from the recent changes to the ITV franchising system. The Peacock Committee had recommended in 1986 that franchises should be awarded by competitive tendering, to reduce the profits and to squeeze the costs of the ITV companies, but it envisaged that some of the proceeds should be used to finance public service broadcasting. In the event, the new ITV contractors will pay Pounds 250m more than their predecessors in 1993, but all of it has been swallowed by the Treasury. This sum represents nearly 30 per cent of the BBC's expenditure on television services. With some growth in advertising revenue and some willingness by the Treasury to reduce the levies, advertising could represent a significant part of the BBC's future income. The terms on which the BBC's charter is renewed in 1996 should follow from the recommendations of the Peacock Committee and the policies described in the white paper of 1988; the financial objective should be to replace the licence fee by subscription, but the BBC should also be given greater commercial freedom than envisaged in these documents. The overriding objective, however, should be to make the BBC wholly independent of government, so that it could never be used as a political tool. The author is an economic consultant</p>

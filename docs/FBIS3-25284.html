The devaluation of the CFA franc and its  consequences, backup measures to mitigate the negative effects  of this valuation, as well as the verdict of the International  Court of Justice of The Hague were undoubtedly at the center of  the discussions between the two heads of state.    It must also be noted that President Deby also held talks  with French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin.</p>

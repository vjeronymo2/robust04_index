			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LARRY CARLTON: LOOKING GOOD, SOUNDING GOOD;  </P> <P> JAZZ: THE GUITARIST-SINGER SEEMS FULLY RECOVERED FROM HIS GUNSHOT WOUNDS.  STANLEY JORDAN OPENS WITH A TRIO.  </P> <P> Larry Carlton is back and looking good. More than two years after he was shot  in the neck by an unknown gunman, the guitarist shows no signs of the trauma he  suffered in his voice and left arm.  </P> <P> Any questions to the contrary were quickly dispatched at his Universal  Amphitheatre concert Saturday night when Carlton opened his set with a  whimsical, hard-swinging vocal on "Crazy Momma." It was, he explained, the  first time he'd sung in public in three years, and his voice sounded firm and  clear -- a marked change from the whispery utterances that were all he could  manage in the first year after the attack.  </P> <P> Carlton's program stuck with the things he does best: one or two big, blowzy  blues to showcase his high-flying, tone-twisting guitar lines; funk-driven  night-music pieces like "All in Good Time," and a few Carlton standards like  "Smiles and Smiles to Go" and "Knock on Wood." All very predictable stuff, but  all done with the drive and enthusiasm that are Carlton's best qualities.  </P> <P> His one diversion from standard practices -- a rousing, up-tempo romp through  Miles Davis' "So What" -- provided the evening's most unexpected musical  sparks, both from Carlton and, especially, from the soloing of tenor  saxophonist Hollis Gentry and keyboardist Terry Trotter.  </P> <P> Guitarist Stanley Jordan, who opened the program with a trio, has firmly moved  his music into the arena of rock/funk/fusion. Working with a setup that allows  him to employ his unique, string-tapping technique on two guitars, one for each  hand, Jordan has become a virtual one-man orchestra. Using the guitars as  synthesizer controllers, he produced sounds ranging from massive orchestra  textures to small jazz-group timbres.  </P> <P> The results -- especially during Jordan's interaction with bassist Charnett  Moffett -- were startling, if at times so technical as to lack a sense of  emotional urgency. Jordan was far more moving when he encored with a  passionately probing solo reading of "Over the Rainbow."  </P></p>

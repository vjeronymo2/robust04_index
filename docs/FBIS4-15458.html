			<p>BFN     [Text] At a press conference at the end of his talks with  Swedish foreign minister Margareta af Ugglas in Pskov, Andrey  Kozyrev declared that Russia was not interested in having  military bases in Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia and that "no  document to this end exists."    Kozyrev called for "Latvia signing as soon as possible a  package of agreements with Russia so that bilateral relations  could be significantly improved and Russian troops pulled out of  that republic by August 31." He added, "we also expect Estonia  which has serious problems with Russia to move towards the  signing of agreements. The ball is now in the Estonians' court."    He said that Russia "would like to resolve the  Russo-Estonian  border issue through cooperation but we have had no positive  signals from the Estonian authorities.    The Swedish foreign minister emphasized her country's view  that the Russian troops had to be pulled out soon and completely  from the Baltic countries. "We also welcome Russia's desire to  have appropriate agreements with the Baltic countries. I hope  that such agreements will be reached with both Latvia and  Estonia. What is important is that it happens before August 31  which should become the final deadline for withdrawal of Russian  troops."    In her words, Sweden was prepared to help Russia with  housing  for the servicemen leaving the Baltic countries but would like  specific agreements on troop withdrawal come first.</p>

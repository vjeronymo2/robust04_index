			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Weak demand deflates yield hopes THE US Treasury cannot win. The recent furore about the yield curve and government funding policy created enough hot air to fuel an around-the-world balloon trip, and the Treasury - sensitive to criticism from both Wall Street and congress - felt it could not ignore the issue. The big question was whether the government should take advantage of an unusually steep yield curve by issuing less longer-dated securities and more short-dated paper. Some even went so far as to recommend that the Treasury should stop issuing new 30-year bonds altogether. The idea behind the various wheezes was to shorten the maturity on the national debt, which, because of the historically large spread between short and long-term interest rates, would cut funding costs for the taxpayer and force stubbornly high long-term yields lower. After thinking it over, the Treasury eventually decided to act. It said it would begin to issue less 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, and make up for the reduction by issuing more at the short end of the market. The reduction, however, would be by only a few billion dollars each refunding round. In the case of the first quarterly refunding programme of the year, completed last week, the reduction meant issuing Dollars 1bn less 10-year notes (Dollars 11bn instead of Dollars 12bn), Dollars 2bn less 30-year bonds (Dollars 10bn instead of Dollars 12bn), and correspondingly more three-year notes. This feeble compromise pleased few. Those in favour of more radical change said it would have no effect. Those against change said not only would it have no effect, but it would introduce an element of unwanted uncertainty to financial markets. The Treasury also left itself open to criticism that it was playing an interest rate speculation game with the national debt. Yet the changes were so insignificant that people wondered whether it was worth all the fuss. That the bond markets subsequently made a complete mess of the Treasury's carefully laid plans, seemed to be a measure of justice. Last week the Treasury issued Dollars 36bn of new securities. If the shift in weighting from the long to the short end of the maturity spectrum was meant to reduce the cost of financing the national debt cheaper, and put downward pressure on long-term rates, it failed miserably. Investor demand for all three issues was poor. This meant the Treasury had to pay a higher-than-expected interest rate on the money it borrowed, and it left interest rates higher at the end of the week. The yield on the 10-year bond jumped from 7.25 per cent to 7.38 per cent, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond (the main target of the Treasury's new, shorter-dated refunding policy) climbed from 7.76 per cent to 7.905 per cent. Of course, it was not the fault of the Treasury that its ambitions were thwarted. It was simply bad luck that the new policy was introduced in a week when the best economic news for a long time was released. It was not only good economic news, it was the right kind of good news. Economists have been arguing for months that the economic recovery would not get off the ground until consumers start spending, and last week they got evidence of just that. According to the data, January retail sales rose 0.6 per cent, well above market forecasts, while both November and December sales were up slightly, not lower as originally reported. Early February car sales also came in above consensus expectations. Just to complete the picture, initial jobless claims showed the second straight weekly decline in the number of people asking for state unemployment insurance. Together, the data hardly added up to much, but it was enough to put the wind up bond investors already unnerved by some unexpectedly positive noises emanating from the Federal Reserve. Statements from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated that the monetary authorities believe current monetary policy is sufficiently loose to allow room for a solid, if unspectacular, recovery by the second half of this year. Although Mr Greenspan says he is ready to ease monetary policy again if necessary, the Fed chairman appears satisfied that the December one-point reduction in the discount rate will prove enough. Judging by the direction of bond yields, the market is betting that the next time the Fed acts, it will put rates up, not down.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Last     1 week   4 wks  12-month 12-month                            Friday     ago     ago     High     Low  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly average)  3.88     3.62     2.00    11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  3.89     3.82     3.86     8.29     3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.03     3.89     4.01     7.70     3.89 Three-month prime CDs       4.15     4.02     4.12     7.17     4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     4.03     3.90     3.98     7.12     3.90 90-day Commercial Paper     4.05     3.92     3.94     7.02     3.92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Last     Change           1 week    4 wk.

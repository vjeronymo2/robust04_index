			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. INVESTIGATES DEATH OF MAN SHOT OUTSIDE STORE BY DEPUTY  </P> <P> The district attorney's office is investigating the death of a 28-year-old man  who was fatally shot by an Orange County sheriff's deputy during a  confrontation outside a convenience store, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Kenneth Wade Collins of Garden Grove was pronounced dead Wednesday night  outside a Circle K store on the 2200 block of Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said the shooting occurred about 10:45  p.m. after the deputy tried to question Collins as he came out of the store.  Olson would not say why police wanted to question him, but Collins' relatives  said they were told he was a robbery suspect.  </P> <P> Collins struggled with the officer and broke free, running south along Dale  Street, Olson said. The deputy caught Collins in the middle of the street, and  a second fight ensued, Olson said.  </P> <P> As Collins ran away a second time, he dropped a knife into the street, Olson  said. The deputy, who was not identified, shot Collins when he ignored orders  to stop running, Olson said.  </P> <P> Collins "was shot as he turned towards the deputy with his hands concealed,"  Olson said.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office, which investigates all officer-involved  shootings, declined to discuss details of the case.  </P> <P> The incident was the third officer-involved shooting this year, and the first  fatal one. The last shooting occurred March 4, when a man suspected of  commandeering a woman's car outside a restaurant was shot after he lunged  toward a Santa Ana police officer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Collins' family has contacted an attorney for a possible  wrongful-death suit, said his sister-in-law, Theresa (Lanette) Collins.  </P> <P> The sister-in-law and several other family members visited the scene shortly  after the shooting. Collins said witnesses told her the deputy beat Collins.  </P> <P> "I think he shouldn't have run, but I don't think they should have killed him  for it," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Chilean human rights group ends its watch CHILE'S best-known human rights organisation, the Catholic Church's Vicaria de la Solidaridad, closes its doors today after dedicating 16 years to the defence of victims of political repression. Monsignor Sergio Valech, the Vicaria's last head, said: 'The task is not finished. But the church believes it is now the duty of civilian society to safeguard the basic principles of human rights that it once lost.' While the closure of Vicaria, which won the UN peace prize in 1978, reflects the respect for human rights in Chile today, it also underscores difficulties in dealing with the legacy of the past. The Chilean military enjoys effective immunity from human rights violations committed during Gen Augusto Pinochet's rule. It has refused to disclose the fate of some 900 detainees who 'disappeared' under arrest. The International Commission of Jurists in Geneva this week urged Chile to prosecute military and police officials accused of torture and murder. It criticised President Patricio Aylwin's government for abandoning the pursuit of justice for the sake of political stability.</p>

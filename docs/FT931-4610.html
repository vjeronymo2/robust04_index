			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf moves ahead 16% Maple Leaf Foods, the food processing group 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown, reported profits of CDollars 69.2m (Pounds 38.8m), or 86 cents a share, for 1992, up 16 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens. Sales were CDollars 2.8bn, down slightly reflecting the group's withdrawal from the beef business. Fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations was CDollars 17.8m, or 22 cents a share, against CDollars 19.4m, or 25 cents a share, on sales little changed at CDollars 739m. The company said disposals, heavy investment in facilities and rising efficiency had created a sound base for future growth in Canada and the US.</p>

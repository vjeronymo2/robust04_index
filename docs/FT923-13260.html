			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Baker praises quest for progress MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, yesterday praised the Israeli prime minister's offer to go to Arab capitals in search of a peace breakthrough, Reuter reports from Washington. 'I think that any time Arab nations and Israel can sit down face to face and talk peace it is a very good thing,' Mr Baker said. 'Whether it is done in the context of the peace process which we have developed or whether it is done outside it, I think it would be a very, very good thing.' Asked if he still intended to proceed with the peace process that the US initiated with a Middle East conference last October, Mr Baker said: 'The point I want to make . . . is that we should not exclude anything that should lead to peace.' Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the administration was considering sending a senior official to Israel to prepare for a possible visit to Washington by Mr Rabin.</p>

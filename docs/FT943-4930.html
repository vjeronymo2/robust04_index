			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Speed urged in Bofors case: Hinduja brothers press for names to be cleared Mr Srichand Hinduja, chairman of the London-based Hinduja trading group, yesterday called on the Indian government to move quickly to complete its investigations into the 1987 Bofors scandal. In a statement issued in New Delhi Mr Hinduja said he and his brothers (Gopichand and Prakash), accused in the Rs14.5bn (Pounds 300m) Bofors gun payoff, were keen to clear their name. 'We have done no wrong and that is why we have committed an investment of more than Rs110bn in core sectors in India,' Mr Hinduja said. He urged the Indian government to make specific requests for documents from the Swiss authorities about the alleged payments from Bofors, the Swedish gun maker, relating specifically to the Indian gun deal in 1987, and not 'any payments from Bofors'. 'It is for this reason we have been compelled to be appelants in Switzerland to ensure that payments relating to such commercial transactions with the said group and unrelated to the gun deal does not get mixed up with the documents of the gun contract to be sent to India.' The Indian government's Central Bureau of Investigation had made public the names of seven persons, including the Hinduja brothers, and Mr Win Chadha, former Bofors agent in India, and Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, whose plea for secrecy about their involvement in the scandal was rejected by the Swiss Supreme Court last year.</p>

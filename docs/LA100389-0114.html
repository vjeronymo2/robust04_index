			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 12-YEAR-OLD'S VALUES ARE PUT TO TEST AFTER FINDING $1,000  </P> <P> Twelve-year-old Ryan Freimann spent a long weekend dreaming of at least a dozen  things to do with the $1,000 he found Friday in an Orange shopping center  parking lot. For example, there's that sports car he's saving for and hoping to  buy when he turns 16.  </P> <P> But on Monday the Newport Beach sixth-grader handed the 10 $100 bills over to  their rightful owner.  </P> <P> "It took some thought," the Andersen Elementary School student said. "But I  knew it was the right thing to do."  </P> <P> On Friday afternoon, after Ryan, his mother and twin sisters stopped at a  shopping center near Orange Avenue and Prospect Street, Ryan noticed a bulky  white envelope on the pavement near the family car.  </P> <P> "It was face up with a clear opening so I could see at least one $100 bill,"  Ryan said. "I picked it up and thought, 'Wow!' and then gave it to my mom."  Kerry Freimann, in turn, took the envelope, which also included a Santa Ana  Unified School District payroll stub, to her husband, Dave, who put the fate of  the money back in Ryan's hands.  </P> <P> "I wanted him to make the decision," Dave Freimann said. "I wanted to give him  a test to see if the values we've tried to instill in him had gotten through."  </P> <P> They had. Ryan decided that his family should first try to contact the owner,  but if they were unable to do so, he'd get to keep the funds.  </P> <P> "I did want the person who lost it to get it back," the boy said. "But there  was a part of me that sort of hoped we couldn't find the person. It was a long  weekend waiting to find out."  </P> <P> On Monday morning, Ryan's father contacted the Santa Ana school district, which  reached Michele Charlebois, a fifth-grade teacher at Garfield Elementary  School.  </P> <P> "She was ecstatic," Dave Freimann said. "She couldn't believe anyone would  return that kind of money."  </P> <P> After receiving the money at the Freimann home Monday afternoon, Charlebois  rewarded Ryan with an undisclosed sum of money for his honesty.  </P> <P> "I'd just completed teaching my kids lessons on honesty and good will,"  Charlebois said. "It's ironic that this would happen in the same week. I have  to thank his parents for raising such a great kid."  </P> <P> Ryan, who is running for student body president at his school this year,  admitted that when he told a few of his classmates of his good deed, they were  stunned by his honesty.  </P> <P> "But I told them if they were in the same situation and knew who the money  belonged to, they wouldn't be able to sleep at night if they kept it," Ryan  said.  </P></p>

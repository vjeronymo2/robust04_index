			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKSELLER SAYS POLICE INTIMIDATE;  </P> <P> PRO-COMMUNIST OUTLET ASKS PROBE BY COMMISSION  </P> <P> Saying its staff has been harassed, intimidated and spied on by police, a  bilingual revolutionary bookstore Tuesday asked the Los Angeles Police  Commission to investigate a series of alleged abuses that threaten to  permanently disrupt the store's activities.  </P> <P> The complaint was filed by the Southern California branch of the American Civil  Liberties Union on behalf of Libros Revolucion, a pro-Communist bookstore that  caters to Latino immigrants.  </P> <P> Libros Revolucion in the complaint claims that its workers have been detained  by police for political reasons and its patrons have been threatened and  discouraged from entering the store. Further, officers have followed people  leaving the store and mounted a stakeout in front of the building on 8th  Street, the complaint alleges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerns Cited  </P> <P> "These acts taken together raise serious concerns about an LAPD campaign to  undermine the bookstore's ability to operate freely, if not to operate at all,  and to prevent bookstore personnel from engaging in protected political  activity," the complaint said.  </P> <P> ACLU attorney Paul L. Hoffman, in a press conference, called on the Board of  Police Commissioners to investigate the allegations, punish any officers guilty  of abuse and disclose whether the Police Department is acting out an  orchestrated plan to make it difficult for the store to function.  </P> <P> "Police should not be engaged in harassment of this bookstore, or any  bookstore, or any individual engaged in political activity," Hoffman said.  "It's very important that a bookstore be protected in its ability to distribute  literature, free from harassment by the LAPD."  </P> <P> The case takes on significance because it represents the first formal complaint  the ACLU has filed to suggest that the Police Department may be violating a  1984 agreement that ended years of litigation and set guidelines to regulate  police intelligence gathering.  </P> <P> Under the guidelines, the police cannot gather intelligence on political groups  unless there is evidence the group is breaking the law. The agreement settled a  lawsuit by 131 plaintiffs who accused the police of illegal political spying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assertions Denied  </P> <P> Police Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth denied that the department  engages in "institutional" harassment, adding that all specific allegations  made by the ACLU will be investigated.  </P> <P> The manager of the bookstore, who uses the pseudonym Lucas Martinez, said he  believes that Los Angeles police are collaborating with federal agencies or  private groups to thwart political activity by bookstore workers.  </P></p>

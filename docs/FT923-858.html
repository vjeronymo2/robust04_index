			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (11): The luxury of staying at a small hotel - Nicholas Lander looks at a new phenomenon that has brought fresh blood into the market ALTHOUGH THE British Hospitality Association, the voice of the hotel industry, is eager to emphasise the importance of the large hotel c o r p o r a t i o n s - Hilton, InterContinental or Forte - it is also keen to stress that, despite these major players, most of the hotel industry remains small-scale and personal. Of the hotels in the UK, 62 per cent have fewer than 10 bedrooms and remain privately-owned. The vast majority of these hotels not only provide their owners with an income but also, invariably, a small part of the hotel to call their own. Over the past 20 years, however, there has developed a new phenomenon in the hotel market - the small luxury hotel. These have attracted new blood and new finance into the industry. Today, the most successful count as their managing directors a former TV presenter and an ex-management consultant. Some have been purchased with the proceeds from the sale of former businesses, some with the help of banks keen to lend on what seemed to be ever-increasing property values, others as a result of business expansion schemes. This new blood has also led to far more sophisticated marketing techniques. In the early 1980s, when the market was booming and Americans were eager to spend money in British hotels, restaurants and antique shops, many small hotels began to seek some form of association merely to handle bookings more efficiently. The year 1985 was the highpoint but there followed a series of events which shook the hotel industry: the bombing of Libya, Chernobyl, the Gulf War and now the recession. Today, the small luxury hotels need one of the three major marketing associations to massage the slowly reviving American market and to search out new customers from Europe and Asia. Of the three, Pride of Britain is the youngest. Formed in 1982 at the instigation of Mr Gerald Milsom, proprietor of Maison Talbooth in Essex, it now boasts 31 hotels and 13 restaurants, all based in the UK. Its emphasis is on small hotels with 30 rooms or less, which are in private hands and retain a strong degree of owner-involvement. From its inception, Pride of Britain targeted the American market via an association with Abercrombie &amp; Kent, the upmarket British travel agent based in the US. Every year Mr Tony Elliott, Pride of Britain's chairman, and Mr Michael Yeo, its chief executive, join the A &amp; K 'roadshow' which over three weeks takes them round the travel agents of 12 big US cities. Annual subscription for those accepted into Pride of Britain is around Pounds 7,000. The main marketing tool is a full colour brochure, which this year, its 10th anniversary, boasts a foreword by the prime minister. Some 150,000 copies are printed, of which 40,000 go to America and the rest to representative offices around the world. The association's London flagship, the Beaufort, received 10 per cent of its bookings last year as a result of its membership. Established in 1954, the Relais and Chateaux group is larger and more widely established - it boasts a print run of 1m copies for its guide and 387 member hotels and restaurants in 40 countries. Its French origins and its five guiding principles - Character, Courtesy, Calm, Charm and Cuisine - do mean however that for a small hotel membership can require considerably more capital investment. Once accepted, membership can be very influential. At Gidleigh Park in Devon the guide brings in 13 per cent of their resident business (worth about Pounds 120,000) compared to a total of 15 per cent as a result of inclusion in all other guides. The annual cost depends on the number of rooms and the shield rating (a highly complicated system based on size and facilities). At Gidleigh Park, with 15 rooms and a yellow shield, it is approximately Pounds 7,000; at Chewton Glen in Hampshire, with a gold shield and 58 rooms, the cost is Pounds 9,000 a year. Nor is this investment instantly rewarded. Last year when the Capital Hotel in London joined the group, Mr David Levin, its owner, was told that it could be three years before he noticed any new business as a result. Small Luxury Hotels of the World is an organisation which today represents over 80 hotels around the world as a result of the marriage in 1991 between the British-based Prestige Hotels of Europe and Small Luxury Hotels and Resorts of North America. Of the three organisations Small Luxury Hotels places the strongest emphasis on marketing to meet changing consumer demand. Its latest catalogue not only includes a number of cruise ships, an offer of special packages with travel incentives among member hotels but also a clear listing of conference facilities for their corporate clients. There is a minimum initiation fee of Dollars 5,000 to join and a minimum annual fee for hotels with fewer than 20 bedrooms of Dollars 7,500. All rooms above 20 are charged at Dollars 285 a room to a maximum of 150. Other small hotels have used the more personal marketing services of such firms as Payne and Dagworthy (he ex-Ritz, she ex-Savoy) who will charge Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 a year for their marketing services. And others have gone more directly to s o u r c e. For instance, Hartwell House in Oxfordshire has sought the advice of the Japanese Embassy in London not only to attract new custom but also to ensure that Japanese guests are treated as they expect to be with, for example, the men being served first at the dinner table. Price is another major marketing factor, but it is one less suitable for the small hotels. In the bigger, more impersonal hotels there is little chance of guests discussing their room rates but in the bar of a small hotel this can only too easily happen and lead to irate customers. But if discounting is not a viable proposition for the small luxury hotels, then possibly all-inclusive pricing may be. This has been the policy at the Beaufort in London since it opened in 1986: one price which includes bed, breakfast, a free bar and a long list of personal extras such as a restaurant guide compiled by the owner and membership of a local health club. Corporate clients over the past six months include IBM, N o m u r a a n d H a n s o n. Naturally delighted with this trend, the Beaufort's owner, Ms Diana Wallis, is only surprised that other hoteliers have not copied her.</p>

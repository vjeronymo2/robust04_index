			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Fashion: Where to find a good cup of coffee in the sales - Places to take the weight off your feet in London's West End SHOPPING in the sales can be exhausting as you lug heavy carrier bags from one overheated store to another. Desperate for something to eat and drink, you end up in the basement of a large department store, eating under-cooked and overpriced microwaved jacket potatoes. But you do not have to suffer: here are some suggestions on where to find the best snacks. In Oxford Street, the best in-store cafeterias are Selfridges and John Lewis's The Place to Eat. But it is often quicker and more pleasant to step outside. James Street, just north of Selfridges and round the corner from Nicole Farhi and Buckle My Shoe in St Christopher's Place has several cafes, including Cafe Rouge and Cafe Creperie. Five minutes' walk north of Selfridges is Maison Sagne, 105 Marylebone High Street. This is an old-fashioned, continental patisserie and is ideal for a late breakfast of strong, coffee and brioche, croissant, a fruit tart baked downstairs, or lunchtime omelette. A pot of filter coffee is Pounds 1.25, a croissant Pounds 1.10. It is open 9am to 5pm weekdays and to 1pm on Saturday. Close to the Loewe end of Bond Street is the Granary Restaurant, 39 Albermarle Street. If you are hungry this is the place to go, either for a huge salad, hot dishes with imaginatively cooked vegetables or old-fashioned puddings. Avocado stuffed with spinach and cheese or paella with chicken and mushrooms is Pounds 6.90. Staff are helpful, the self-service queue is short and children are welcome. A meal for one, with a glass of wine, desert and coffee is Pounds 11-Pounds 12. Open from 11.30 am to around 8pm on weekdays; Saturday to 4.30pm. On the edge of Knightsbridge is The Conservatory in the Lanesborough Hotel on Hyde Park Corner. It is not cheap but is worth a visit if just to see the lavish neo-Gothic design. The hotel staff are friendly, courteous and helpful and unsnooty. A large cup of cappuccino is Pounds 2.50; Caesar salad with is duckling Pounds 7.50. From 3-6 pm a pianist accompanies afternoon tea; scones, crumpets and clotted cream Pounds 5.00; full afternoon tea Pounds 13.50. It is open from 7am to 12 pm. A short walk away in Harvey Nicholls' basement is Joe's restaurant bar which does a tasty selection of light meals. The decor is black and grey, the clientele trendy, but less so than in Joe's on Draycott Avenue. Service is quick. The mushroom soup is good but is almost the cheapest item on the menu at Pounds 3.95. The sultana bread, provided free, is excellent and makes up for the Pounds 1 cover charge levied during lunch. Filling club sandwiches are Pounds 7.50; appetising salads start from Pounds 7.50. The restaurant is open for lunch noon Monday to Saturday (11am to 3.30pm Sunday) and dinner from 7pm, Monday to Saturday. Emporio Armani Express, 191 Brompton Road, does a tasty crostini - toasted bread with chicken livers, tomato and mozzarella, Parma ham and artichoke for Pounds 4. Cappuccino is good and creamy, but at Pounds 2 a cup it should be. Lunch includes Italian dishes and salads. Main dishes are Pounds 8 - Pounds 10.00. There are interestingly dressed people to stare at if you are eating alone. Open 10.00 am to 5.30 pm; lunch from 12-3.30. There is no shortage of choice in the Brompton Cross area. Near Beauchamp Place, Patisserie Valerie, 215 Brompton Road, offers a good breakfast until 11.30. At lunchtime, there are more substantial dishes, such as croque monsieur for Pounds 2.80, but the pastries and deserts should not be missed. Tarte aux pommes is Pounds 1.50; good capuccino Pounds 1.20. The tables at the back get busy but there is usually room at the counter. Service is quick and efficient. It is open 7.30am to 7pm Monday to Friday; to 7pm on Saturday and 9am to 6pm on Sunday. A favourite among shoppers is La Brasserie, 272 Brompton Road. Hot food is served all day including croque monsieur Pounds 2.50, spinach salad with feta cheese Pounds 4.80. A small pot of coffee for two is Pounds 1.60. It is open Monday to Saturday 8am to 12 pm and from 10 am on Sunday. For Sloane Square and the King's Road, Cafe de Blank in the basement and conservatory of the General Trading Company 144 Sloane Street is hard to beat. Breakfast includes kedgeree and omelette with herbs, or you can choose from a tempting selection of pastries and healthy-sounding cakes. At lunchtime, salmon cakes and dill sauce cost Pounds 6.95; home-made soup with cheese and onion bread Pounds 3.25, perhaps followed by Greek yoghurt, honey and almonds for Pounds 2.75. The staff are friendly and quick, the conservatory overlooking the small garden is light and pleasant. Open from 9am to 6pm. Serious shoppers often skip lunch and take tea instead. Brown's Hotel 30-34 Albermarle Street serves tea from 3-6pm every day. The lounge is warm, quiet, comfortable and highly soporific. I spotted two immaculately behaved toddlers among the predominantly American clientele. Customers may have to wait. Tea - a huge selection of cakes, scones and sandwiches is Pounds 12.95; high tea with a supper dish is also available. Gentlemen must wear jacket and tie. Tea is an equally well-established institution at The Hyde Park Hotel where the sounds of the pianist tinkle across the elegant Park Room Restaurant, which overlooks Rotten Row. Tea, sandwiches, scones and cream and cakes are Pounds 10.50 per person. There is a cloakroom where visitors can leave shopping. It is advisable to book. Tea is served daily from 4pm to 6pm.</p>

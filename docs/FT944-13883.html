			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Sri Lanka fears passions will erupt: Peace hopes are in doubt during run-up to poll for president Colombo, where Mr Gamini Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's opposition leader, and 50 other people were killed by a suicide bomber on Monday, returned to normal with almost unseemly haste yesterday. The curfew imposed immediately after the blast was lifted and banks, shops and offices were open. It appeared that after living through two political assassinations last year, Sri Lankans have grown used to the murder of their leaders. Yet deep concern exists on the island about the lasting effects of Mr Dissanayake's death. The fear is that the passions aroused by the murder of such a popular leader will sooner or later come into the open. They might erupt into street violence as early as the funerals which begin today and end with Mr Dissanayake's state funeral on Saturday. Or they could linger and affect politics and society in more subtle but equally disruptive ways. 'People may not show it, but they are very distressed,' Mr Neelan Tiruchelvam, a Colombo lawyer, says. The public distress is acute because it has come at a time of unprecedented hope about Sri Lanka's future, engendered by the efforts of Mrs Chandrika Kumaratuna, the newly elected prime minister, to end the island's civil war. Mrs Kumaratunga, who took power in August after 17 years' rule by Mr Dissanayake's United National party, started talks with the Tamil 'Tigers', fighting for an independent Tamil homeland. As Mr Tiruchelvam, a Tamil, says: 'In Sri Lanka we swing quickly from optimism to despair. Now we are in despair'. The key question is the impact of the assassinations on the peace effort. Even though the police have little evidence linking the attack to the 'Tigers', the general assumption in Colombo is that they carried it out. The 'Tigers' have denied responsibility for the assassinations, but their denials carry little weight in Colombo. The security forces believe that only the 'Tigers' command the fierce loyalty and access to high-quality explosives needed to organise a suicide bombing. The 'Tigers' have been linked to two deadly suicide attacks, on Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the then Indian prime minister, in 1991, and Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Sri Lankan president killed last year. In the weeks since her election victory, Mrs Kumaratunga had built broad-based support among the majority Sinhalese in favour of peace talks, but it seems certain this week's assassinations will undermine this consensus, though it is difficult to say by how much. 'The conditions for the peace talks were favourable. Now there will be great suspicion about the guerrillas' good faith. This is one of the worst consequences of the act,' a Colombo-based diplomat says. Mrs Kumaratunga has prudently postponed talks between government and Tamil representatives which started two weeks ago and were in progress near Jaffna, the Tamil stronghold in the north. She will now face calls for a long delay and for outright cancellation. Army officers, who claimed the government had made too many concessions, will now find it easier to criticise her. A crucial test of public opinion will come in the presidential election due to be held on November 9 in which Mr Dissanayake was challenging Mrs Kumaratunga. Mrs Kumaratunga had been expected to win, despite a strong campaign by Mr Dissanayake. His death should generate some sympathy votes for his party and votes from those wanting to protest at talks with the rebels. But the UNP could lose the support of Mr S. Thondaman, the powerful and politically volatile leader of the tea estate workers' union, wooed away from Mrs Kumaratunga by Mr Dissanayake but who could now swing his support back to the premier. On balance, Mrs Kumaratunga is still expected to win because the UNP lacks another candidate of Mr Dissanayake's stature. An unemphatic victory could stall the talks. Mr Desmond Fernando, a lawyer, says: 'I fear there could be a swing against compromise'. Sri Lanka has learned to live with political violence, especially in the past 18 months, which have seen three assassination attacks. Neither the death of President Premadasa, nor of Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, an opposition leader, provoked civil unrest or much social or economic disruption. Western tourists, sensitive to political violence, have continued to come to Sri Lanka. This time too, expectations are that little damage will be done to the economy. The Colombo Stock Exchange's all-share index fell by 31.74 points, 2.85 per cent, yesterday to 1,081.27, but stockbrokers said this was a reflex reaction. The economy remains strong and likely to meet the government's target of 6 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year, after a 6.9 per cent increase in 1993. Mr Kishan Vairawanathan, a manager at the Colombo office of Crosby Securities, the Hong Kong investment broker, says: 'A feeling of optimism has been shattered. That accounts for the fall. But I think the market will now stabilise'. But much will depend on the run-up to the presidential election and its outcome. If Mrs Kumaratunga fares badly, the hopes of peace vested in her may fade too.</p>

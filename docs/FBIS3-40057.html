			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lin Jian (2651 1017): "Such Having of Assets"] </F>   [Text] Some have advocated in recent years adding "having  assets" to the criteria for the new socialist man of "having  ideals, having morality, having culture, and having discipline,"  to make the "five haves." This so-called "having of assets" is  explained as referring to private individuals owning "the means  of production [capital goods] to be used directly for  production, as well as from which to derive economic benefit,"  such as individual employees holding enterprise shares. This  differs from the sense of "having assets" under socialism where  public ownership dominates in which all workers own the means of  production, as well as not being the meaning of "having assets"  in possessing individual income through the principle of  distribution according to work. According to this formulation, a  new socialist man must have (own) private assets such as shares,  which excludes from the ranks of the new socialist man not only  the majority of common employees who do not own such private  assets, but also even the many heroic models on all fronts. As  an echo to this, an award-winning article solicited recently by  a certain southern newspaper applauded the "having of assets,"  and was praised by the awards critic for "being more original  and forceful than the ordinary criticisms of all eating out of  one big pot (big-pottism)."    It is understood that the grounds for this award-winning  article being "more original and forceful" were found in "our  ancestor Marx" on "the ownership of assets." Ground one was that  the "Communist Manifesto" says that "Communism certainly does  not divest anyone of the power to own social products," with  ground two being the wording used in "On Capital" and other  works that Communism would "reestablish individual ownership."  While the award winning author came to the "original" deduction  on these two grounds that "not divesting anyone of the power to  own social products means not opposing private ownership or  individual possession of property rights," such an inference is  just too fantastic. All who have read the "Communist Manifesto"  know that it contains the famous remark that "Communists can sum  up their theory in one statement: The elimination of private  ownership." Does not "the elimination of private ownership" mean  the elimination of private ownership of the means of production,  or assets? Did not Communists call their party the "Communist  Party" because they wanted to "make a complete break with" the  traditional ownership system, or private ownership, to establish  a new society based on public ownership? In fact, this makes the  most rudimentary common sense not only for Communists, but also  for the ordinary citizens of a country like China that has  practiced socialism for over four decades. If this were not a  deliberate misinterpretation, it would be impossible to conclude  from the sentence that "Communism certainly does not divest  anyone of the power to own social products," that Marx did not  oppose private ownership of the means of production. The  "Communist Manifesto" repeatedly emphasizes the thinking that:  Private ownership of the means of production, as well as the  exploitation and pillage of the working masses by the  bourgeoisie that depends on its private ownership of the means  of production in fact divests the majority of the members of  society of their right to own the social products that are the  results of their own labor. Thus it is necessary to eliminate  private ownership of the means of production and practice public  ownership of the means of production in order to restore the  right of the workers who make up the vast majority of the  population to possess the products of their own labor; public  ownership of the means of production is the prerequisite and  guarantee for the realization of this right of workers. What  Marx said in On Capital and other works about  "reestablishing individual ownership," also refers to restoring  the [right] of workers to the fruits of their own labor premised  on public ownership of the means of production. Marx explained  this point very clearly in On Capital as follows:  "...while capitalist private ownership is the first negation  of private ownership for individuals based on their own labor,  capitalist production creates its own negation due to the  inevitability of the natural process, which is the negation of  negation. Such negation is a reestablishment not of private  ownership, but rather of individual ownership based on the  success of the capitalist age, or on the basis of common  possession of the means of production produced through  cooperation, land, and labor per se." (On Capital,  Volume 1, p 832.) It is thus obvious that turning Marx's  "Communism certainly does not oppose individual ownership of  social products" and "reestablishes individual ownership" into  "does not oppose private ownership of the means of production,"  is a deliberate distortion. So the "grounds" concocted through  such misrepresentation are a fake and shoddy commodity stuck  with a Marxist trademark.    It is said that this fake and shoddy commodity was created  as  a criticism of our traditional economic system's "big-pottism."  Is this really so? It is not. In fact, the above comment of  "more original and forceful" backed by such fabricated "grounds"  is directed certainly not at our traditional economic system's  "big-pottism," but rather at public ownership that is the basic  economic system of socialism and the basis for our formation of  a socialist market economy. Just take a look at the following  comment: "As having and not having are relative, ownership by  the whole people means ownership of assets by all the people, or  that if there are no people without property, there is no not  having, not to speak of having. Is this not a case of the  Arabian Nights?" In other words, ownership by the whole people  is equivalent to no ownership by the whole people. To put it  bluntly, as the logic of such a comment is impossible for anyone  with a normal reasoning capacity to follow, how could it not be  a case of the Arabian Nights! Ownership of the means of  production by the whole people means that the means of  production are owned by all members of society as a whole, not  by any individual or group among all members of society. This is  the essential feature of ownership by the whole people. Thus,  insisting that this joint possession of the means of production  by all of the people means no ownership by the whole people can  only show that the one who made this comment is looking at  public ownership through the eyes of the propertied  "private-slanted mindset" that the "Communist Manifesto"  ridiculed. Such a private-slanted mindset seems to regard  "ownership" only as putting things in one's own pocket. In  addition, "there is no not having, not to speak of having," is  even more revealing than the private-slanted mindset. What is  its message? As the one who made this comment found his grounds  in Marx, then let us cite Marx to reveal this message. Marx said  to the panic-stricken propertied in the "Communist Manifesto"  about the elimination of private ownership that: "While you are  alarmed when we speak about eliminating private ownership,  private property in your existing society has already been  eliminated as far as nine-tenths of your members are concerned.  As such private ownership exists precisely because private  property does not exist as far as nine-tenths of your members  are concerned, it is obvious that you are actually blaming us  for wanting to eliminate the kind of ownership that is premised  on the vast majority of the members of society not having any  property." In light of his "there is no not having, not to speak  of having," is not this commentator trying to turn the existing  ownership by the whole people into a certain kind of ownership  in which the minority "own property" premised on "the vast  majority of the members of society owning no property?"    This commentator goes on to say that: "The Chinese people's  right to the property owned by the whole people is in name but  not in reality." "It is such a blurring of name with reality  that has produced a prosperous Canada abroad but a China in  which all take from the state, a steadily declining production  zeal and initiative, and ever-lower efficiency." The solution to  these problems is allowing "citizens to own property." To sum it  up in a word, as his solution to poor efficiency is to turn  ownership by the whole people into private ownership, it is  obvious that the commentator believes that public ownership is  the root of poor efficiency. In fact, while the poor efficiency  noted by this commentator did exist in our traditional economic  system for quite a long time and on quite a broad scale, its  root was not public ownership, but rather that the inherent  demands of public ownership were not well realized in our  traditional system. For instance, while public ownership  requires rigorous and effective control of public assets, to  maintain and promote the overall interests of all the people,  our traditional system certainly did not evolve a system of  strict rights and obligations to achieve such control, leaving  production and management operations of public assets without  effective restraints. Taking another example, while public  ownership requires the application of the principle of  distribution according to work for various worker collectives  and working individuals, our traditional system was one of  production and operating units all eating out of the state's  "big pot," with employees all eating out of the production and  operating units' "big pot," leaving production and operating  units without motivation, and employees without production  initiative. Through reforming our traditional economic system to  practice a socialist market economy, these defects are gradually  overcome, leaving the inherent demands of public ownership bound  to be realized. As this sharply raises the efficiency of our  public economy, blaming the defects of our traditional system on  public ownership is unreasonable. The view that public ownership  is inevitably inefficient, and that only private ownership is  efficient, is even more absurd. Marx long ago refuted this in  the "Communist Manifesto": "Some have retorted that once private  ownership is eliminated, all activity will cease with the rise  of indolence. In which case, bourgeois society should long since  have withered away through indolence, as its workers do not  gain, and its gainers do not work." We need to understand that a  public economy is essentially more efficient than a private one,  as it has rooted out exploitation to better stimulate worker  initiative. Seizing on the problems encountered in the course of  development of the public economy that has a brief history of  only decades in China, and making an uproar about the view that  public ownership is inevitably inefficient, shows that the  private-slanted mindset created through thousands of years of  private-ownership history dominates the whole thought process of  these commentators. But strangely enough, the commentator  still says that "property ownership," or private ownership of  the means of production, "is unprecedented in China's thousands  of years of history." So it seems that in addition to  fabricating Marxist theory, the commentator also needs to  falsify part of the social development of mankind to support his  precious view about "more original and forceful." In fact, the  establishment of public ownership is the thing that is truly  unprecedented in China's thousands of years of history. No  matter how those gentlemen governed by the traditional  private-slanted mindset may curse public ownership--this new  thing in the history of mankind, Chinese Communists and the  broad masses will certainly be able to fully shine forth their  inherent vigor and vitality in the course of reform.    Finally, to avoid misunderstanding, we also need to point  out  that our opposition to the comments on the so-called "having of  assets," or on realizing private ownership, certainly does not  mean that our policy since reform of allowing the non-public  economy to exist and grow is wrong, or that people cannot hold  individual assets in forms such as shares, and even less so that  individuals cannot possess the means of subsistence [consumer  goods]. As China's level of development of the productive forces  is still quite low, in a multilevel and unequal state, an  appropriate development of the nonpublic economy is absolutely  essential to speed up the development of the productive forces  and supplement public economy inadequacies. Meanwhile, as  incomes rise, attracting funds in forms such as issuing shares  to supplement state construction-investment shortages, is also  absolutely essential. However, these differ substantively from  negating and trying to undermine the public economy, and the  Constitution of the PRC clearly provides for the dominance of  the public economy. As to those who would exploit the subject to  their own ends, twist Marxist theory, and thus set off a tide of  conclusions that private ownership should replace public  ownership, we will expose and attack them resoundingly.</p>

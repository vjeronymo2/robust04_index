			<p>BFN     [Text] The second round of Tajikistan's peace talks, which  were held in Tehran, have increased the hopes for a peaceful and  just solution to Tajik crisis.    The talks have been held with the participation of  government  representatives and Tajik opposition groups in the presence of  representatives from Russia and Central Asian countries and  under the supervision of an envoy of the UN secretary-general.  The aim of the talks is to find a formula to end the civil war  that began in Tajikistan approximately two years ago. This  crisis, which began after the collapse of the Tajik coalition  government, not only resulted in the loss of lives and homes of  thousands of Tajik people, but has also threatened regional  security. It could involve the United States and other foreign  countries, who are waiting for a chance to influence the region  and create discord among the Muslim nations in the regional  conflict.    Although the participation by the government and the  opposition groups of Tajikistan in the peace talks, by itself,  is considered appropriate, true progress in the talks requires  the official recognition of the Tajik people's right to  determine their own fate and a response to their wishes for a  democratic state based on accepted international norms and  standards.    The establishment of a real peace in Tajikistan will only be  possible if the Muslim Tajik nation builds the foundations of  its desired government based on its believed principles and  national and Islamic culture. It seems this need has been  accepted in general terms by the Russian Government and other  neighboring countries of Tajikistan and its own government.    In this regard the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular  has  played an important role in closing the gap between the stance  of the government and the oppositions of Tajikistan. The  Iranian Government began its efforts to seek peace at the  outbreak of the Tajik civil war. At present Iran continues to  play this sensitive and determining role by holding the second  rounds of talks in Tehran. Without doubt the results of Tehran  talks will pave the way for further developments in the third  round of talks, which will be held in Pakistan.</p>

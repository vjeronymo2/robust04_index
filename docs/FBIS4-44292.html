			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Evita Neefs: "Increased Hope of Solution to </F> Korean Crisis"]    [Text] There was great relief when U.S. President Bill  Clinton announced a "very positive development" in the Korean  conflict and the existence of "an opportunity to find a  solution." Clinton was referring to Pyongyang's readiness to  freeze its nuclear program, in exchange for which he has agreed  to renewed negotiations. Tension on and around the peninsula  has significantly decreased now that the United States has  suspended its attempts to impose sanctions against North Korea.    At a hastily organized press conference Clinton declared  that  North Korea was complying with U.S. conditions for the  resumption of high-level talks between the two countries.  During the talks no spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed for  the manufacture of nuclear weapons, no new fuel rods will be  loaded into the nuclear reactor, and international inspectors  can continue with their work. North Korea has also undertaken in  writing to respect all the stipulations laid down in the  Non-Proliferation Treaty.    The United States agrees to begin talks from the beginning  of  July in Geneva on the nuclear issue, together with "all  political, economic and security issues" of interest to the two  countries. For the North Koreans this implies a promise that  the Americans will not use an atomic weapon against them. They  also want to discuss the replacement of their obsolete core  reactors by light water reactors, the cost to be borne by the  United States.    In China, Clinton's decision met with approval. Beijing sees  it as confirmation of the course it adopted throughout the  conflict: no sanctions, but diplomacy.    American reporters recently granted a rare visit to the  Chinese-North Korean border have also been able to see how with  such a porous border sanctions would not prove very effective in  any event. In addition, the population of the Chinese border  region is 40 percent ethnically Korean. It is uncertain where  their loyalties would lie if a cordon was placed around North  Korea.  <H5>  Prosperity </H5>   The relief was particularly great in South Korea. After more  than fifty years of hardship the country is finally enjoying  considerable prosperity and, more recently, democratic freedoms.  All these achievements threatened to be reduced to nothing by  U.S. saber-rattling, increasingly backed up by West Europe and  Russia. In the name of the principle of nonproliferation.    Few people would deny that it is an important principle and  one that is worth defending. In addition, North Korea may be  seen as a test case for the treaty's renewal next year.    But those who have been stating over recent years that the  issue, in North Korea's case, was not worth going to war, have  some powerful arguments. The evidence against North Korea is  inconclusive. The country's exact intentions are unclear.    The United States is also unable to present any global  nuclear policy. Its position on countries such as Israel,  South Africa, and Pakistan for example contrasts sharply with  that taken on North Korea. And are countries such as India,  that take offense at the difference between the recognized  nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom,  France, China -- and other countries, altogether wrong?    Clinton, keen on a winner in the public opinion stakes after  several humiliating defeats, also seemed all too ready to embark  on confrontation. The visit by his predecessor Jimmy Carter to  Pyongyang showed that the opportunities for diplomacy had not  been exhausted. The conflict is not over and the President was  right to point this out. But at least dialogue is being given a  second chance.    Hopefully the meeting between Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song  --  the two Korean presidents -- will take place. It could bring a  breakthrough on a number of points, such as the reuniting of  families, or human rights in the North, all of which were  brushed aside as attention remained focused solely on the  nuclear issue.</p>

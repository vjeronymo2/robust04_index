			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGER NOTEBOOK / KIM Q. BERKSHIRE;  </P> <P> LONGSHOTS MAKE IMPRESSION ON HENNING  </P> <P> Some fringe players have caught the eye of Charger management enough that their  places on the roster should be secure when the final cut to 47 players comes  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Nevada-Reno's Henry Rolling, a free-agent linebacker who played in parts of the  1988 and 1989 seasons for Tampa Bay, has made some kind of impression on Coach  Dan Henning.  </P> <P> "I really like this Rolling," Henning said on the day the Chargers broke camp  at UC San Diego and moved their belonging out of the dorm there. "He looks like  a pretty good linebacker to me.  </P> <P> "He's a very pleasant surprise. When you get a guy like him from another team,  who has tools and intelligence, you always wonder, 'Hey, something's wrong.  Why's he here?' He's certainly passed the test of training camp."  </P> <P> Another defensive player who has made the Chargers do double- and triple-takes  is cornerback Donald Frank, a rookie free agent who started last Saturday  against the 49ers in place of Gill Byrd.  </P> <P> Henning said Frank, out of Winston-Salem State, has been a highlight of camp  but not the biggest surprise.  </P> <P> "Donald has shown up to be pretty capable in the secondary," Henning said. "He  has a long way to go, but while he's getting there, he's going to help us."  </P> <P> Another presence is cornerback Joe Fuller of Northern Iowa, a sixth-round draft  pick who intercepted a pass by Joe Montana in the Chargers' 29-28 victory over  San Francisco.  </P> <P> "Defensively, (Frank and Fuller) are coming along," Beathard said. "The coaches  certainly feel they're better than the backups last year."  </P> <P> Special teams have improved dramatically, and Henning said some players on the  borderline have made sparkling special teams plays to draw attention.  </P> <P> "We're much more stable in the special teams than we were," he said. "Of  course, we picked up some different people than we had last year in the same  spots. They're smarter, they're younger, their quicker."  </P> <P> Nate Lewis, a wide receiver out of Oregon Tech, has done a fine job on kick  returns.  </P> <P> "He has come on pretty strong in this camp," Henning said. "I was disappointed  with him in Phoenix (during scrimmages), but he's been looking good in  practice."  </P> <P> General Manager Bobby Beathard was talking about the first-year players, the  rookies, the unproven and how some players who seem to be goners could change  coaches' minds either during the little remaining pre-cut practice time or  Saturday's exhibition finale against the Raiders in the Coliseum.  </P> <P> "Some kids are still coming up, some kids have leveled off, and some kids are  on their way down," he said. "But this is their last test, and I hate to write  them off."  </P> <P> While the Chargers try and address the areas that need the most improvement,  there's a certain fire that can sometimes make up for little deficiencies.  </P> <P> "There are still a lot of questions," Beathard said, "but they've played well.  There's a lot of spirit. Sometimes when you have a lot of spirit and you play  hard -- that goes not just the Chargers but for any team -- you cover up some  weaknesses sometimes."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Make way: Wide receiver Elliott Searcy was waived Wednesday to make room on the  60-man roster for offensive guard Mike Zandofsky, who was acquired Tuesday from  Phoenix for a low draft choice. Zandofsky was expected to join the team late  Wednesday . . . Despite losing 35 pounds in the off-season, Coach Dan Henning  will dream of the training table offerings, especially the giant-sized  chocolate chip cookies. "I'm going to miss you boys," he said as he munched his  last cookie of training camp 1990.  </P></p>

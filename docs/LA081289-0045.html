			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-MENTAL PATIENT FACES MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> A former mental patient was ordered Friday to stand trial in the slayings of  two Universal Studios guards he reportedly said God told him to kill.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper ordered Nathan N. Trupp, 42, to stand  trial after a one-hour preliminary hearing in which a security guard and a  sheriff's deputy described the Dec. 1 shootings and recounted Trupp's  explanation.  </P> <P> Soper ordered Trupp to be arraigned Aug. 17 on charges that he killed guards  Jeren Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles after  they turned him away from the studio.  </P> <P> Trupp is also accused of slaying three people two days before the Universal  City killings. Those killings occurred in a bagel shop near where he lived in  Albuquerque, N.M.  </P> <P> Abelardo Solarez, another studio guard, testified Friday that Trupp casually  shot the two victims at the studio's main gate, shortly after they turned him  away when he asked to see actor Michael Landon. "He kept saying that someone  sent him to kill the two guards," Solarez said. "I asked him who it was and he  said, 'God.' "  </P></p>

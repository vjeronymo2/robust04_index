			<p>BFN     [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating has pledged  support for UN sanctions against North Korea. Linda Mottram  reports:    Shortly after arriving in London at the beginning of his  10-day visit to England and France, Mr. Keating released a  statement on the North Korea tension. He has reiterated  Australia's support for any action by the UN Security Council on  the issue. He says it may still not be too late for  negotiations, but Mr. Keating says increasingly it looks as if  the UN Security Council will have to consider further action to  indicate the depth of international concern.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Safety body 'undermined' EC health directive THE Health and Safety Executive never intended to implement fully a European Community safety directive and 'actively undermined' measures intended to protect people at work, a union claimed yesterday. A confidential policy paper, prepared by the executive's management board for the implementation of the main directive, shows how EC attempts to protect workers have been 'watered down', the GMB general union said. The framework directive spells out the general principles of health and safety regulations, many of which are implicit in the UK's Health and Safety at Work Act. It establishes five 'daughter' directives that would deal with, for example, regulations covering work with VDUs and manual handling of loads. The executive said the leaked document was 'old hat'. It said it was part of the 'normal thinking process' at an early stage in implementing directives. The union said the document was 'deeply disturbing'. The document says: 'We agree that we should not seek a 100 per cent cast-iron conformity with the directive and would indeed be unable to claim that the proposals to be put to the HSE would achieve this.' Mr Nigel Bryson, GMB health and safety officer, said he believed that was not adequate implementation. The document goes on: 'Thus we are proposing regulations only where they appear to be unavoidable. We are prepared to take a risk over several parts of the directive.' Apparently weighing the arguments against such a 'minimalist' role, the document adds: 'Ministers like to counterbalance the UK's poor image in the social field with our good reputation on health and safety. Furthermore, losing at the European Court of Justice may lead to changes more drastic than we can get away with now . . . ' The document indicates the executive's intention to rely on UK legislation in some areas where the 'directive appears to go further than existing law', including fire safety obligations.</p>

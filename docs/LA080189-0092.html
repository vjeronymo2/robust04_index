			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY KISSED EX-CLIENT, COURT TOLD  </P> <P> Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson was seen at least twice in public  kissing and hugging a woman who is suing him for legal malpractice, a friend of  the plaintiff testified Monday.  </P> <P> Mitchelson, 61, who introduced the term "palimony" to jurisprudence, testified  earlier in the day at his Los Angeles Superior Court trial that he could not  recall meeting the witness, Cheryl Christiansen. Christiansen testified on  behalf of her friend, Felicia Gordon, who is suing Mitchelson, accusing him of  bungling her multimillion-dollar divorce from businessman Robert MacDonald in  1982 and of taking advantage of her emotional and financial distress to  pressure her into having sex with him.  </P> <P> Christiansen testified that at a 1983 birthday party for Gordon in Beverly  Hills, she saw Mitchelson grab Gordon and pull her down next to him on a sofa.  "At the party," Christiansen said, "he was kissing her on a number of occasions  and he had his arm around her waist."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Two Kilos of Heroin Hidden in Broken </F> Down Car"]    [Excerpts] The drug trade has to accept the failure of  another billion-schilling deal: In a parking lot along the  southern highway near Graz, a Pole who had hidden 2 kg of pure  heroin with a black-market value of 8 million schillings in his  car was arrested. [passage omitted]    Andrzej G., 22, from Poland admitted that he was supposed to  take the drugs from Poland to Italy. His reward: 1,000 German  marks. It is currently investigated whether he had already made  "deliveries" along the way before being arrested.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 6 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- While Costa Rican  businessmen and government considered the signing of the Free  Trade Agreement (TLC) with Mexico a landmark in Costa Rican  history, union leaders expressed great reservations about this  economic opening and the consequences it will have for the  country.    The signing of the TLC by Presidents Rafael Angel Calderon  (Costa Rica) and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (Mexico) in Mexico  City yesterday, Tuesday, was given wide coverage by the Costa  Rican media. A television station even broadcast the event live.    Costa Rican businessmen and government officials estimate  that with the TLC, which has to be ratified by the parliaments  in both countries, exports to Mexico should go from $60 million  to $250 million in the next five years. This would make Mexico  Costa Rica's fourth commercial partner, after the United States,  the European Union, and Central America.    In its editorial today, LA NACION newspaper pointed out that  the signing of the TLC, considered to be one of the most  advanced of the ones signed in Latin America, "gives a greater  momentum to a new era of commercial opening," whose commercial  benefits "are as great as the challenges it poses." After  highlighting the benefits the TLC can bring to the country,  offering a market of more than 85 million people to the Costa  Rican producers, the newspaper warned, however, that "one cannot  rest on one's laurels because the challenges imposed by this new  reality are many." "More than ever before, it is necessary to  expand the economic modernization program," the newspaper  appraised. LA NACION published a big photograph of Calderon and  Salinas signing the agreement in its front page, two pages with  information related to the TLC, and one with the Costa Rican  president's speech.    The LA REPUBLICA newspaper, for its part, gave less coverage  to this story and published a small photo of Calderon and  Salinas de Gortari in its first page and highlighted that the  signing of the TLC opens a ""new era in the relations between  Costa Rica and Mexico." Costa Rican business sectors are  focusing on the possibility of developing joint investments,  starting next January, when the TLC, which will regulate the  trade in approximately 12,000 products, will go into effect.    Carlos Alvarado, the Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce  president, announced that this same week, Costa Rican  businessmen will start to make contacts in order to attract  financial investments.    Chamber of Industries President Samuel Yankelewitz said the  TLC "includes all the elements for things to go well" and  considered it was "just and balanced" for both nations.    Doris Osterlof, the executive director of the Export  Chamber,  asserted: "Our industry is prepared" to compete with the  Mexicans.    However, Albino Vargas, secretary general of the National  Association of Public Employees (ANEP,) questioned the Treaty  because the labor sector had not participated in the three years  of negotiations and also because the TLC does not state clearly  the workers' benefits.    Another union leader, Guillermo Garcia, told ACAN-EFE the  TLC  will benefit the country's development but said unions had  reservations about the new economic model (the commercial  opening) and the consequences it can have.    Garcia added that the Costa Rican Government will have to  abrogate protection measures for workers and labor organizations  because of the pressures the economic opening will have on Costa  Rican society.    The experience of the decades between the 1960's and the  1980's, Garcia underscored, left a negative balance because "we  were asked for sacrifice in exchange for future economic bonanza  and the economic models that were implemented prompted a larger  social gap and an unfair distribution of the benefits resulting  from production."</p>

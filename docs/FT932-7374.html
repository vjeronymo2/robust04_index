			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Kiss of life fof Ecu bond market DENMARK'S ratification of the Maastricht Treaty last week provided a welcome kiss of life for the Ecu bond market. And with the Danish referendum out of the way, the Ecu Committee of the European Bond Commission - an industry organisation - was quick to announce clarifications over the role of the Ecu as the single European currency for the benefit of market participants. Mr Bob Tyley, chairman of the Ecu Committee and an economist at Paribas Capital Markets Group, said the committee had received clarifications from the European Commission and the European Council on the role of the Ecu. 'We found that certain aspects of the Ecu were not very well understood,' he said, but added that the clarifications provide market operators with a 'concise and reliable reference for the development of the Ecu' which can be seen as an appendix to the Maastricht Treaty. 'With regard to the current basket Ecu prior to the commencement of European Monetary Union, its currency composition will be frozen once the treaty has been ratified,' Mr Tyley said. The European Monetary Institute, which will be set up on January 1 1994, will facilitate the use of the Ecu and oversee its development. The Ecu will lose its current basket nature and become a currency in its own right on the first day of monetary union, and rapid introduction of the Ecu as the single currency will ensue. On the first day of EMU, the exchange rates between participating national currencies and the Ecu will be fixed irrevocably, and the Ecu will rapidly replace those currencies. EMU will start on January 1 1999 unless another date has been decided beforehand. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EC, stressed in a letter to the Ecu Committee that this could take place well ahead of 1999. 'Sufficient conditions for this to be the case are that a majority of countries qualify for membership (on the basis of the convergence criteria) and that the European Monetary Institute has completed its work of preparation of Stage 3 (which it will start to do after its creation on January 1 1994 and must finish by December 31 1996 at the latest).'</p>

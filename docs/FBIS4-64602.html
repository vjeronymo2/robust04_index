			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>   [Excerpt] Oslo, 5 May -- Norway has decided not to send its  military contingent to Nagorno-Karabakh to take part in the  peacekeeping operation planned by the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe [CSCE], Kirsti Skjerven, an official  spokesperson of the Norwegian Defense Ministry, told ITAR-TASS  in an interview.    She said that the CSCE had appealed to Norway in March to  take part in a planned peacekeeping operation in  Nagorno-Karabakh. After studying this matter and taking into  account the situation in Bosnia, where Norwegian servicemen form  part of the UN peacekeeping force, Norway's Defense Ministry  considered it impossible to allocate a military contingent for a  peacekeeping mission in the area of the Armenian-Azeri conflict.  Kirsti Skjerven stressed: "The Ministry of Defense of Norway  believes that it is necessary to concentrate our peacekeeping  forces in one place and not scatter them about. The funds  earmarked by the Norwegian parliament for maintaining  peacekeeping forces abroad can thus be used in the best way."  [passage omitted]</p>

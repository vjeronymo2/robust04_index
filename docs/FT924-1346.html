			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / German takeover rules criticised THE chief of Germany's leading fund management company yesterday called for an overhaul of his country's corporate takeover rules. Mr Christian Strenger, chief executive of DWS, the Deutsche Bank fund management arm which has DM58bn (Pounds 23bn) under management, said that shareholders in German companies were disadvantaged because of the lack of a takeover code. He said German banks and companies should devise a code of practice on such issues as disclosure and the treatment of minority shareholders in takeovers. The call comes a week after Calpers, the big US pension fund, condemned voting rights restrictions at many large German companies, including Deutsche Bank, DWS's parent company. Companies said they needed these rules in the absence of formal takeover regulations. Mr Strenger said that once his proposals were adopted, it would be possible for companies to abandon their voting restrictions, which would be welcomed by domestic and foreign shareholders as a way of enhancing share prices. There are very limited rules for takeovers in Germany. Shareholdings need only be disclosed when they reach 25 per cent - in contrast to 3 per cent in the UK - nor is there is a requirement to treat all shareholders equally. This means that it is standard practice for companies to seek effective control of another company by acquiring a simple majority of shares or a blocking minority. There is no requirement for companies to pay a premium for corporate control, which Mr Strenger believes is to the detriment of shareholders. 'It would cost very little for companies to comply with such proposals, in relation to the damage that is done to the equity market as a result of the current state of affairs,' he said. Mr Strenger's remarks reflect his concern, as head of Germany's leading provider of investment funds to private individuals, that Germans are averse to investing in equities. Germans prefer buying bonds and only 10 per cent of DWS's DM58bn is invested in equities. Approximately half the shares in all Germany's quoted companies are owned by banks, insurance companies, families and other long-term shareholders.</p>

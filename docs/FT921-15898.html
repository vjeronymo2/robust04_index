			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (4): Battle to cut spending - The budget MORE AFRICAN structural adjustment programmes have foundered on budgetary problems than any other single obstacle. From 1985, when it launched its Budget Rationalisation Programme (BRP), Kenya has been grappling with the problem of excessive and inefficient patterns of public spending. The number of government ministries has increased from 19 in 1970 to 28; there are six ministries responsible for manpower training, and public sector employment has been expanding at over 6 per cent a year - faster than GDP. In 1990, there were more than 26,000 people employed in excess of establishment, costing 0.5 per cent of GDP. An important factor has been education. There are more than 5.6m pupils in schools compared with just over 900,000 30 years ago. Education spending accounts for more than 40 per cent of recurrent public expenditure. Much is rightly made of the contribution of education to economic growth, but the emphasis of Kenya's higher education programmes has been on turning out graduates qualified to work in the public sector. The government estimates that roughly two-thirds of graduates are best qualified to work in the public sector. A second striking feature is the distribution of civil servants across departments, with the Office of the President employing some 48,000 people - more than such ministries as health, agriculture and public works. The combination of rapid public sector employment growth, higher pay for civil servants, rapidly rising interest payments and slow-growing government revenue has undermined civil service effectiveness and created a destabilising fiscal situation. Public service efficiency is suffering from the shift in the pattern of expenditure in favour of wages and salaries, and away from goods and services. The share of non-personnel spending in the recurrent budget has fallen from more than one-third 10 years ago to less than a quarter today, with the familiar result of pupils without desks and books and agricultural extension officers without transport.

The 1991-92 budget projects a sharp reduction in the deficit, from KPounds 12.2bn to KPounds 4.6bn, to be achieved by holding expenditure growth to only 5.6 per cent. With inflation at current levels, this implies a double-digit decline in real public spending, while revenue increases 19 per cent. Revenue will rise, due mainly to the imposition of VAT on fuel in February 1991 for the full 1991-92 fiscal year, along with increases in indirect taxes. User fees are to be imposed on university students, and outpatients fees reintroduced at hospitals. The main challenge will arise on the expenditure side, where the government is committed to retrenching some low-paid employees while freezing new appointments. There will be no increase in the number of primary school teachers, meaning an increase in pupil-teacher ratios. University enrolments are being halved, and civil service pay awards will be phased in over three years. Development spending has been cut with the cancellation of some projects and restricting new projects to those wholly-funded by donors. Because public sector retrenchment and parastatal restructuring are running behind timetable, while inflation is ahead of forecast and economic growth slower than predicted, the 2 per cent of GDP budget deficit target for the year looks optimistic. There was a carry over of expenditure from the previous financial year, and the government has been forced to pick up the tab for parastatal debt-servicing to avoid default. Higher interest rates will push up the cost of debt service, and parastatals are going to need continued financial support from central government. Revenue is on target and in the absence of new public spending setbacks, always possible at a time of high inflation, the Treasury should manage to get the deficit close to 4 per cent of GDP, thereby convincing donors that Kenya is at last getting to grips with the problem of public expenditure.  ----------------------------- BUDGET DEFICITS (% GDP)  -----------------------------                 Exc.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Rodgers: "FELIX Opens for Business"] </F>   [Text] United Kingdom researchers are to receive 20  percent of the beam time on the FELIX free electron laser at the  Dutch Institute for Plasma Physics "Rijnhuizen" in Nieuwegein  for the next two years. The agreement was signed at the  inauguration of FELIX last month and the beam time is payment in  kind for two United Kingdom-built undulators. The undulators  were intended for a British free electron laser project that was  cancelled in 1987. The Rijnhuizen laboratory is part of the  Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM).    Work on FELIX started in 1987. The Dutch Ministry of  Education and Science paid 13.4 million Dutch guilders [FL]  (about 5.7 million pounds) capital costs and is spending another  FL4 million per year to turn FELIX into an international user  facility - the agreement with the United Kingdom is the first  step. FELIX actually started operating in 1991 and the first  experiments started late in 1992. According to FELIX project  leader Wim van Amersfoort, the facility is oversubscribed by  more than a factor of two. The plan is to operate FELIX 42  weeks of the year (16 hours a day, five days per week) and the  annual running costs are expected to be about FL3.5 million.    A free electron laser (FEL) is a cross between a synchrotron  and a laser. Synchrotron radiation is produced when a beam of  relativistic electrons is forced to oscillate in a magnetic  field. The core of a FEL is an undulator, a device that produces  more intense synchrotron radiation than other arrangements of  magnets. If mirrors are placed at each end of the undulator, the  radiation can be stored in the resulting cavity and made  coherent. Bunched electrons travel through the undulator,  amplifying radiation produced by previous bunches. One of the  mirrors is partially reflecting to allow the FEL radiation to  escape from the cavity.    FELIX operates between 6 and 110 microns in the infrared and  is used for experiments in atomic physics, molecular physics and  chemistry, solid-state physics, surface physics and chemistry,  medicine and biomolecular spectroscopy. The wavelength is tuned  by changing the electron energy or the magnetic field in the  undulator. It is tunability over a wide range of wavelengths  that give FELs their advantage over other radiation sources.    FELIX actually has two undulators and two linear  accelerators. Its output consists of micropulses - infrared  pulses with durations between 0.5 and 10 picoseconds and peak  powers of 10 megawatts. The micropulses are separated by 1  nanosecond and form macropulses which can last as long as 6  microseconds and contain thousands of micropulses. There are  between six and ten macropulses per second.    Twenty percent of the time on FELIX will be used for  studying  FELs themselves. The FOM group plans to produce micropulses  with durations of hundreds of femtoseconds and to extend the  wavelength range to 300 microns - shorter wavelengths in the 1  to 20 microns range are already covered by the CLIO free  electron laser at Orsay in France.    Rijnhuizen has also started work on a free electron maser  (FEM) as a megawatt source of tunable millimetre waves. This  would be used to heat and control magnetically-confined fusion  plasmas in tokamaks. Completion of the FEM project, which is  being carried out in collaboration with laboratories in the  former Soviet Union, Russia and Germany, is expected in 1995.</p>

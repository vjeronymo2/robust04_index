			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Takare rises 56% to Pounds 12m - Beds increase from 2,625 to 4,335 with a further 1,170 on the way TAKARE, the nursing homes group, raised profits by 56 per cent in 1992 to Pounds 11.8m, against Pounds 7.6m. Sales rose 62 per cent, from Pounds 29.7m to Pounds 48m. Operating profits rose 61 per cent to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 6.77m), and interest received was Pounds 941,000 (Pounds 823,000) after capitalising Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.1m) of interest payments. Earnings per share growth was slower, at 20 per cent to 12.1p (10.1p), because of the full year impact of the share issue in September 1991. A final dividend of 1.2p (0.6p) is proposed for a total of 1.8p. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the reforms to state funding of care for the elderly chronically ill, which take effect from April 1, were now clearer. Funding of Pounds 524m for 1993-94 was adequate, he said, with a majority commited to the independent sector. The principle of patient's choice of home had been enshrined in the reforms. Takare has been in talks with all the social security departments in areas where it has homes and expected to agree prices and admissions policies with them all before April 1, Mr Bradshaw said. It had also signed long term contracts with three health authorities since details of the new system were announced last autumn. During 1992 Takare increased its beds from 2,625 to 4,335 and has since opened another 450 with 720 under construction due to be completed by April 1. Gearing rose from 10 to 41 per cent. Mr Bradshaw said that although Takare could fund development costs of Pounds 75m over 1993 and 1994 from existing resources, that would take gearing to an unacceptable level. At the time of the last share issue Takare promised not to raise more equity for two years. He said the group was looking at fixing interest rates on its debt. COMMENT Takare's impressive growth continues, and there is no reason to doubt that it can take advantage of the opportunities its market offers. The community care reforms may cause some short term confusion, but should strengthen its hand. The only question is of funding the expansion, though even this should become less of a problem as the base gets larger. Taking capitalised interest into account, interest cover is slim, and there is every chance of a rights issue once the moratorium runs out in September. Even so, Takare has produced good earnings growth even with share issues, reflected in a prospective p/e of up to 17 on forecasts of about Pounds 14m pre-tax.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS GIVE BENGALS A COUPLE MORE KICKS TO WIN IN OVERTIME;  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE: RICE AND MONTANA SET UP COFER'S FIELD GOALS IN SAN FRANCISCO'S  20-17 VICTORY.  </P> <P> It keeps happening to the Cincinnati Bengals, but they're not getting used to  it.  </P> <P> Joe Montana's passes to Jerry Rice set up Mike Cofer's game-tying field goal  with 57 seconds left in regulation and Cofer's kick in overtime that gave the  San Francisco 49ers a 20-17 victory over the Bengals Sunday.  </P> <P> The Bengals' last four games against the 49ers have wound up last-minute  losses, including the Super Bowl two years ago, when Montana starred in a  decisive 92-yard drive.  </P> <P> "We beat that team," Cincinnati safety David Fulcher said. "It goes the same  way again. We beat them and then we give it up. We've got to do something to  stop people from doing what they do to us late in the ballgame."  </P> <P> The 49ers (12-1) were trailing, 17-14, when they got the ball with 4:11 left in  regulation. Montana passed to Rice for a 29-yard gain on the first play and  drove them to Cofer's game-tying 23-yard field goal.  </P> <P> The 49ers won the toss and took possession at their 19 at the start of  overtime. Montana connected with Rice with passes of 14 and 17 yards to cross  midfield, and converted a third-and-six situation with a seven-yard pass to  Rice to help set up Cofer's game-winning 23-yard field goal two plays later.  </P> <P> "We play our best football when everything's on the line," said Rice, who had  eight catches for 101 yards. "Once we got the ball, I knew we were going to  score."  </P> <P> The Bengals (7-6), who seemingly took control of the AFC Central Division by  beating Pittsburgh twice in the last three weeks, fell back into a three-way  tie for the lead with the Steelers and Houston.  </P> <P> Coach Sam Wyche wasn't in a mood to talk, cutting short his post-game press  conference.  </P> <P> "I'm getting tired," Wyche said.  </P> <P> The Bengals have lost their last seven against the 49ers, including their 20-16  Super Bowl defeat two years ago on Montana's pass to John Taylor with 34  seconds left.  </P> <P> In 1987, the last time they met in the regular season, the Bengals failed to  run out the clock, leaving Montana time for one play -- a scoring pass to Rice  to win the game.  </P> <P> These last-minute losses may be getting old to Wyche, but Montana, his former  pupil, enjoyed the repeat ending.  </P> <P> "I think the world of Sam," Montana said. "It's like beating your best friend.  You know how he feels, but in a lot of cases there's nobody you like beating  better."  </P> <P> Ickey Woods' one-yard touchdown run put Cincinnati ahead, 17-14, with 12:26  left, and the Bengals forced the 49ers to punt on their next possession.  However, Boomer Esiason and the Cincinnati offense couldn't score again, giving  Montana one last chance.  </P> <P> Montana completed 19 of 26 passes for 185 yards. On the tying and winning  drives, he took advantage of the absence of safety Rickey Dixon, who suffered a  broken leg in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> San Francisco also revived its ground game, with Roger Craig gaining 97 yards  in 21 carries.  </P> <P> It was the 49ers' 17th consecutive victory on the road, extending their NFL  record.  </P> <P> Esiason threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Craig Taylor on the Bengals' first  possession, but they couldn't find the end zone again until Woods' score.  </P> <P> Tom Rathman's one-yard touchdown run got the 49ers even, 7-7, but the Bengals  regained the lead on Jim Breech's 38-yard field goal in the third quarter after  Esiason's 20-yard scoring pass to James Brooks was nullified by an illegal  motion penalty.  </P> <P> The 49ers regained the lead, 14-10, on Harry Sydney's three-yard touchdown run  late in the third quarter.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Florov] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 1 TASS -- Representatives of  the U.S. business circles, accredited in St. Petersburg, have  assessed the statement made here at a business luncheon by U.S.  Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown as cautiously optimistic  about the possibility of expanding bilateral economic relations.  Brown described as not very encouraging the dynamics of the  development of the Russian market economy.    Nevertheless, he believes there are prerequisites for  stepping up bilateral cooperation in many areas, primarily in  space exploration, extraction and processing of oil and gas,  production of medicines, and development of communication  facilities.    Brown said that real chances to "advance to the Urals" had  appeared after his trip to Yekaterinburg. Offices of American  companies could be opened there.    The agenda of the stay in St. Petersburg of the American  delegation, which includes the heads of 28 key U.S.  corporations, is of an obviously business character. Brown had  a private meeting with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak  today morning.</p>

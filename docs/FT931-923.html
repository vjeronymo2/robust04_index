			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Vietnam looks to Tokyo for diplomatic help VIETNAM wants Japan to use its diplomatic influence to encourage Washington to normalise US-Vietnamese relations and allow international financial organisations to fund the country's redevelopment. Mr Vo Van Kiet, Vietnam's prime minister, in Tokyo on a five-day visit, told Japanese leaders the country is keen to resume normal ties with the US, whose economic embargo has limited Hanoi's access to foreign aid and investment. In Washington yesterday US secretary of state Warren Christopher suggested America might accelerate the normalisation of relations with Hanoi. But he gave no timetable. 'We certainly hope that we can continue on the road map (toward ties) and perhaps even at a somewhat accelerated speed with Vietnam,' he said. The visit was the first by a Vietnamese prime minister since 1973, and was seen as an indication of Japan's willingness to develop an Asia policy independent of Washington. The US is still inhibited by memories of the Vietnam war and is yet to be satisfied on the issue of military personnel still listed as missing in action. Tokyo has been wary of offending the US and until last year had asked companies to adopt a low profile in broadening business dealings in Vietnam. But after ending a 14-year ban on assistance last year, Japan is now confident that stronger ties with Hanoi will not compromise its US relationship. It plans to send a study team to Vietnam to devise an infrastructure development plan. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, said his government 'wants to co-operate' to ensure success of Vietnam's economic reform programme. Tokyo has offered two grants totalling Y684m (Pounds 3.95m) for medical equipment and forestry machinery, insisting that the machinery be used for cultivating new forests. Japanese officials also asked Mr Vo Van Kiet to exercise restraint over the recent killings of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia. United Nations officials are concerned that Vietnam may retaliate, complicating peace efforts in Cambodia. Meanwhile, Japan ann-ounced yesterday it would send about 50 military personnel to Mozambique as part of a UN peacekeeping mission. The decision has so far been uncontroversial, in contrast to the despatch of 600 personnel to Cambodia last year.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Emerging Investor: A sense of calm returns to Mexico The skilful management of events by the Mexican government and confidence in continuity of economic policy enabled Mexico's stock market to avoid the crash that had been predicted after last Wednesday's assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the governing party. On Friday, the first day of trading since the murder, the market index fell by less than 1 per cent. The emergence of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a former budget minister, as favourite to take over from Mr Colosio, and the Dollars 6bn line of credit arranged with the US treasury were particularly important in reviving investor spirits after the initial panic. Mr Zedillo is from the inner circle of President Salinas's advisers that have been managing economic and social policy for the past five years. Nevertheless, the assassination of Mr Colosio, who was heavily favoured to win this August's election, comes at a moment of extreme political uncertainty for Mexico, and may exacerbate an already tense political situation. Over the past three months there has been, apart from the assassination, a peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas, the head of the country's largest bank was kidnapped, and Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in Chiapas appeared to be on the verge of declaring as an independent candidate for the presidential elections. Elsewhere in Latin America the immediate effect of the assassination was to depress prices, while on the jittery US stock market the Dow Jones average fell by 1 per cent. Brazil's Sao Paulo stock exchange fell nearly 5 per cent on Thursday, but then bounced back with a gain of 6 per cent on Friday. Local fund managers and brokers are divided about whether the assassination will have a longer term impact on the traditionally volatile Brazilian market. The European investment community would adopt a wait-and-see attitude, with most fund managers cautious but not too worried, according to a Latin American analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London. In fact, last week's events might have the beneficial effect, he said, of getting rid of, or at least postponing, some of the more speculative new issues that had been planned for the coming months in Mexico. Forthcoming economic data in Mexico will be closely watched. The economy is weak, having shown two successive quarters of negative growth in the second half of last year. If the political uncertainty created by the assassination shakes consumer confidence, it could threaten to choke the economic recovery, and cut the earnings growth of quoted companies. However, several factors are working in favour of the market. Investors attributed some of the market's resilience to two decisions taken by the government. In closing the foreign exchange, stock and money markets on Thursday, the government prevented trading when the political situation was at its most tense. By arranging the line of credit with the US treasury, the finance ministry was able to make credible its commitment to defend the peso within the pre-set band. There was also a touch of good luck. The day after Mr Colosio was assassinated, the government completed negotiations to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Membership of the OECD, while largely symbolic, is seen by many investors as a sign of faith in Mexico by the world's industrialised nations. Some foreign investment houses have seen the crisis as an opportunity to buy back into the market. Mexican equities have already fallen in dollar terms by 10.2 per cent this year. Investment houses such as Goldman Sachs advised clients to buy stocks that were being sold in panic, in the expectation that when political uncertainty is resolved, stock prices will rise. Prospects for political stability quickly returning are mixed. Mr Colosio's assassination raised the spectre of turmoil as the ruling party chose its new presidential candidate. Yet in the longer run, some analysts argue, the killing might reduce political risk. Their belief is that Mr Colosio's death will cause the country to unite around the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and its new presidential candidate. He, it is assumed, will carry on the economic policies of President Salinas that have so favoured by foreign and domestic investors. 'The PRI is more likely to win now than before,' says Mr Jorge Mariscal, head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs. 'The tragic event will unify the party, force the opposition to tone down protests, and because Mexicans will rally around the flag, help the government'. Such a view has gained credence as Mr Zedillo emerged as the clear front-runner to succeed Mr Colosio as the presidential candidate. The killing also seems to have put an end to the political career of Mr Camacho, who had been viewed by some investors as the main destabilising force this year. If the political uncertainty is resolved, then the key element driving the market will be earnings growth of quoted companies, says Mr Timothy Heyman of Baring Securities. Baring reckons that earnings will increase by 21 per cent this year. Given that the price/earnings ratio of the Mexican market is 14.1 - compared to 16.2 in Argentina and 20.3 in Brazil - this would leave room for strong gains this year. Mr Robert J Pelosky of Morgan Stanley warns that earnings estimates may be cut if the assassination shakes consumer confidence. And if the recovery fails to materialise, this is sure to complicate efforts by the ruling party to win a convincing and trouble-free election this year.

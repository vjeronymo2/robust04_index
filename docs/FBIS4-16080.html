			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite substantial losses in men and materiel, the  Azerbaijani Army subunits are not desisting from attempts to  break through the defensive line of the Karabakh forces north  and northeast of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR].    NKR Army headquarters has reported that the Azerbaijani  formations, supported by air power and armored cars, have been  attacking Karabakh positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon since this  morning.    In repulsing all the enemy attacks, the Karabakh forces  launched counterattacks in certain sectors of the front and  occupied a number of advantageous positions.    The NKR air defense forces shot down an Azerbaijani attack  plane during the battles. Details are being determined.    After getting reinforcements, the Azerbaijani troops  launched  an offensive against Agdam on the same day. However, they were  forced to withdraw to their initial positions after suffering  losses.    Having failed on the fronts, the Azerbaijani Army has again  chosen to launch air attacks against the peaceful settlements of  the Republic. The Azerbaijani Air Force dropped bombs on the  residential quarters of the capital of the NKR at 0635 this  morning. Five residents were killed and nine were injured during  the raid, mostly women and children.    Frederick (Doneli) and Henri [last name indistinct] from the  French state television and two independent reporters [names  indistinct] from the United States, who (?were) in the city, are  ready to confirm the bombing of Stepanakert.</p>

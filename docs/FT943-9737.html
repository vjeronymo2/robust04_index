			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Overseas buying, New York gains lift bourses A healthier start in New York gave late-closing bourses a lift, and overseas buying also seemed to improve matters, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's winners and losers mostly reflected foreign investment interest as the broad market ended mixed in thin trading. The Dax index closed 0.09 down at 2,184.07, easing to 2,182.32 at the end of the afternoon. Turnover reverted to hiatus mode, DM4.7bn compared with the levels of around DM8bn seen at the peak of the bourse's excitement in the middle of last week. Daimler topped the active list, way ahead of the pack as it turned over DM1bn on its own and the shares rose another DM5 to DM840. Yesterday's other main theme was mobile telephone prospects, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The companies involved, Veba, Thyssen and Mannesmann, all made the top 10 turnover list as they rose DM5.60 to DM533.80, DM5 to DM315 and DM0.70 to DM450.20 respectively. Dealers associated the interest in Veba with the company's plans to link its Swiss cable operations with those of the Swiss cable television company Cablecom; forecasts for its first-half profits, due for release on Thursday, were also supporting the stock. Bayernverein reckoned that group net profits could rise by a third to DM420m. Thyssen, meanwhile, was supported by foreign buying. In an unrelated move, Degussa, the chemicals to gold refining group, advanced DM6.50 to DM507 after the company said it would announce its nine months' results today. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by anticipation of good results expected this week from major international companies such as Polygram, Philips, Royal Dutch, KLM and Reed Elsevier. The AEX index rose 1.69 to 421.36. Philips, which climbed 60 cents to Fl 56.40, compared with a Fl 1.40 loss to Fl 81.20 for its Polygram subsidiary, was rated a strong buy by Hoare Govett. The broker noted that the group had been a beneficiary of the higher dollar, an improvement in the US economy, and growth in sales. By contrast, it rated Polygram as a 'hold', believing that good results had already been discounted. The day's strongest performances came from Reed Elsevier, which advanced Fl 3.30 to Fl 173.10, and Unilever, up Fl 4.10 to Fl 200.10, the lat-ter due to report its second-quarter results at the end of the week. PARIS could find little incentive to act as turnover shrank to under FFr2bn and the CAC-40 index drifted down a marginal 0.73 to 2,106.34. Corporate news was also very limited, although Carrefour, the supermarket chain, managed a further rise of FFr14 to FFr2,096 on Friday's news of a gain in July sales. There was little reaction to Elf Aquitaine's gain of just under 3 per cent in first-half sales, the shares adding 40 centimes at FFr423.40. MILAN was subdued by the onset of the holiday season as the Comit index fell 8.21 to 695.75. Actinvest, the independent research group, noted yesterday that the major factor on the market's short term direction remained the uncertainty which continued to surround the government, together with real possibility that an early election could be called. However, it took the view that the political situation was unlikely to deteriorate in the next few weeks - partly as a consequence of this being the holiday season, but also due to the fact that there was currently 'the lack of a political alternative to Berlusconi'. This present calm would change in September, it added, with the presentation of the 1995 budget, which was likely to draw attention away from the half-year reporting season. Among share movements, Generali, the insurance group, shed L150 to L41,450 and Fiat added L20 at L6,810. ZURICH picked up after a sluggish start, and extended some of Friday's individual share price trends. Foreign buying was reported, leaving the SMI index 16.7 higher at 2,617.5. Foreign interest, too, was said to be behind the SFr100 rise to SFr5,700 in the certificates of Roche, the pharmaceuticals company, following gains on Friday on similar considerations. Nestle went along for the ride, closing SFr14 ahead at SFr1,192. UBS, weakened by aspects of last Friday's results, lost a further SFr10 at SFr1,140, recovering from an intraday low of SFr1,131. MADRID overcame late profit-taking to close with the general index 1.48 lower at 323.48. Turnover, inflated by technical factors, was Pta38.6bn. There was sector and individual stock selection. Construction shares continued their recent run of strength with a rise of 2.1 per cent, Bankinter outperformed the banking sector with a Pta100 gain to Pta12,440 and Acerinox, in stainless steel and a recent cyclical play, rose another Pta500 to Pta14,990. STOCKHOLM made a solid gain, although turnover was reported as being below average. The Affarsvarlden general index added 8.1 at 1,493.5. Esab B shares moved up SKr5 to SKr355, a year's high, as the welding equipment manufacturer reported a bigger than expected rise in six-month profits. TEL AVIV reinstated Sunday's sharp technical decline, boosted by historic moves toward peace with Jordan. The Mishtanim index rallied 4.88, or 2.6 per cent, to 190.26 after a fall of 4.50, or 2.4 per cent, a day earlier. Yesterday's gains followed Mr Yitzhak Rabin's visit to Jordan, the first public visit by an Israeli prime minister, and his meeting with Jordan's King Hussein.

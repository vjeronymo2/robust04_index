			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEC READY TO HELP RESTORE OIL PRICES TO KEY $18-A-BARREL LEVEL  </P> <P> In the midst of wild price swings in the oil market, OPEC President Sadek  Boussena said Thursday that the oil cartel is ready to act to restore prices to  their benchmark level of $18 a barrel.  </P> <P> Prices again dropped Thursday, following the wild session Wednesday that saw  prices plunge but then recover.  </P> <P> Spot crude oil closed 28 cents lower at $17.78 a barrel on the New York  Mercantile Exchange, adding to this week's setback of $4.  </P> <P> "The market is unhinged from its one-day rally, and there's some skepticism  about OPEC," said Andrew Lebow, analyst with E.D.&amp; F. Man.  </P> <P> An Energy Department report of a 7.2-million barrel buildup in crude stocks  last week also weighed on prices.  </P> <P> The markets are closed today.  </P> <P> May heating oil was the sole gainer, closing up 0.20 cent to 53.83 cents a  gallon. May gasoline eased 1.03 cents to 58.55 cents a gallon on selling fed by  market views that supplies will be plentiful as refiners process the huge  amounts of crude oil that are now swelling U.S. inventories.  </P></p>

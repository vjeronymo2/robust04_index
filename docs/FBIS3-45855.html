Governor Jia Zhijie, and  Vice Governors Li Daqiang, Wang Shengtie, Han Nanpeng, Meng  Qingping, Chen Shuiwen, and Su Xiaoyun attended the meeting.  [passage omitted]    Governor Jia Zhijie made an important speech in which he  first reviewed the 1993 economic work. He said: In 1993 the  province registered sustained and speedy economic development.  People throughout the province seriously implemented Deng  Xiaoping's southern tour talks and the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress, deepened reform and widened the scope of  opening up, seized the opportunity for faster development, and  blazed new trails in reform, opening up, and economic  construction.    Jia Zhijie focused on the target of endeavor for 1994. He  said: The general guiding principle for this year's economic  work is this: Under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, we will conscientiously implement the  instructions of the national economic work meeting and the Sixth  Provincial CPC Congress, comprehensively deepen reform, widen  the scope of opening up, bring into full play the leading role  of large and medium-sized enterprises, pay attention to economic  development, speed up the implementation of the scientific,  technological, and educational strategy, promote scientific and  technological progress and their structural adjustment, work  hard to improve our economic results, and bring about the  sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the province's  national economy. [passage omitted]    Jia Zhijie pointed out: In ensuring the fulfillment of all  national economic development tasks, we must break away from old  conventions, create new ideas, and make new moves and  breakthroughs. First, we must have new ideas in terms of  development. Fundamentally speaking, we must explore a  development method which requires little investment, produces  much, yields good quality and results, and accumulates fast.  Second, we must make a new breakthrough in terms of policy. At  present, we must speedily formulate a number of detailed  policies and methods for economic invigoration to encourage  grassroots enterprises and masses to develop the economy.  Third, we must have new moves in work. In other words, we must  resolve the main contradictions and weak links and do something  which can propel the overall situation forward. In this year's  economic work we must pay attention to one nucleus, materialize  five major breakthroughs, ignite three major projects, and  alleviate the four major contradictions.    Namely, we must do our best to improve large and  medium-sized  state enterprises; develop a diversified economy by breaking  away from old conventions, develop township and town enterprises  by breaking away from old conventions, develop tertiary  industries by breaking away from old conventions, develop  individual and private economic sectors by breaking away from  old conventions, and develop an export-oriented economy by  breaking away from old conventions; ignite the production of  automobiles, the transformation of the Wuhan steel factory, and  the construction of other projects in coordination with the  three gorges project; alleviate the fund shortage; and  strengthen energy, transportation, and telecommunications  construction.    Jia Zhijie said: According to these objectives and  development ideas, this year's economic development must focus  on the following aspects:    First, we must continue to strengthen the position of  agriculture as the foundation, focusing on increasing the  peasants' income and developing a diversified economy and  township and town enterprises. We will initially arrange a 6  percent increase over last year in the province's gross  agricultural output value; a 37 percent increase in township and  town enterprises' gross output value; a 100-yuan increase in the  peasants' per capita net income; set a target of 23 to 23.5  billion kg for grain output, and 500,000 metric tonnes for  cotton output. To fulfill these targets, we must adjust and  optimize the internal agricultural structure. [passage omitted]    Second, on the basis of improving economic results, we must  maintain a speedy growth in industry. We will initially arrange  a 15 percent increase in township industrial output value; over  95 percent for their production and marketing rate; an 8 percent  increase in budgetary enterprises' output value; and a 12  percent increase in their fulfillment of taxes and profits.  This year's tasks are arduous and we must take effective  measures to fulfill them. For this reason, we must make great  efforts to improve large and medium-sized state enterprises so  as to provide powerful support for the speedy growth of  industrial economy. [passage omitted]    We must increase the momentum of technological reform and  update textile and other light industries. We must strengthen  management over enterprises and improve their economic results.    Third, we must increase the momentum of investment, optimize  the investment structure, raise funds through various channels,  and make a success of key construction projects. The investment  structure in fixed assets must be adjusted this year. [passage  omitted]    Fourth, we must develop tertiary industries by breaking  away from old conventions so as to form a new pattern for  industrial growth. It is necessary to ensure an 11 percent  growth in output value and to surpass the indices set by the  plan. For this reason, we must develop industries which require  small investments, can produce quick and good results, can  provide adequate job opportunities, and have much to do with  economic development as well as the people's lives. In the  meantime, we must further stabilize our policies and support the  development of individual and private economic sectors.    Fifth, we must give prominence to focal points and speed up  market formation. 1) We must further improve commodity  markets. 2) We must speed up the establishment of financial  markets and gradually form regional financial centers. 3) We  must actively develop labor service markets. 4) We must  cultivate technology markets.    On expediting reform, Jia Zhijie said: This year, the  macroeconomic and microeconomic fields, the economic base, and  the superstructure will be reformed. We must actively and  steadily carry out macroeconomic management system reform and  ensure the smooth implementation of central reform measures. We  must deepen enterprise reform with focus on the establishment of  a new enterprise system. We must reform the social insurance  system and the housing system, and we must speed up  institutional reform. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Trade rivalry divides Brazil and Mexico Relations between Latin America's two biggest economies, Mexico and Brazil, are coming under strain as the battle to head the future World Trade Organisation intensifies. The candidature of both Mexico's President Carlos Salinas and Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister, may split the Latin American vote and help their rivals. The differences over Latin America's choice follows competition over leadership of the trade issue in South America. This may be felt more strongly in Brasilia than in Mexico City. Brazilian officials have watched with discomfort as Mexico, after securing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada, have signed free trade accords with South American governments. The latest, the Group of Three accord with Colombia and Venezuela, was signed last week. Brazil has responded with its own proposal for a South American free trade zone but the attraction has been limited by Brazil's economic instability. Put baldly, the Brazilian view is that Mexico has abrogated its right to speak for Latin America and the rest of the developing world by signing up to Nafta. In the more diplomatic language of a finance ministry official, Mr Ricupero could provide a 'third way' between the choices of the EU and Nafta trade blocs. A Brazilian foreign office spokesman insisted that Brazil believed Mr Ricupero remained a strong candidate. Mexico's foreign ministry argues that Mr Salinas' record as president of Mexico, strong commitment to free trade, and apparent support from most of Latin America, the US and Canada makes him by far the stronger of the two regional candidates - and the only one with a chance of winning. Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, firmly denies that the rift between Mexico and Brazil reflected a wider struggle for Latin American leadership. He says the two candidates should be judged on individual merit. Mr Tello made little secret of his disappointment that Brazil has not backed down. Mr Tello said Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, told him on May 30 that Brazil would reconsider proposing Mr Ricupero if Mr Salinas chose to run and that Mr Amorim had said the Mexican president's candidacy was 'a very good idea'. Brazilian officials denied this version, however. According to them, Mr Amorim told his Mexican counterpart and Mr Salinas on May 30 that countries would need to 'examine the situation' if a president - meaning Mr Salinas - became a candidate. This was, they say, diplomatic language and never intended as an indication that Mr Ricupero's candidacy could be withdrawn. In the absence of President Itamar Franco of Brazil, the Latin American participants of the Ibero-American Summit last week in Colombia backed the Salinas candidacy. According to Mr Tello, President Carlos Menem of Argentina first proposed that the heads of state should endorse Mr Salinas, arguing that the chance of an important international position for a Latin American should not be missed. Brazil's anger led to an embarrassing about-turn by Buenos Aires and Argentina issued a diplomatic letter stressing its support for Mr Ricupero. Mr Hugo Herrera Vegas, undersecretary at Argentina's foreign ministry, said: 'It was all a misunderstanding. It has been clarified. It was a mistake. These are the dangers of high level diplomacy, the diplomacy of chefs d'etat, which have their advantages as well as disadvantages.'

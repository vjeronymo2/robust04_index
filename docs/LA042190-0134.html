			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAYER'S ATTACK LED TO SHOOTING, AUTHORITIES SAY  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton football player shot and wounded by an off-duty  Pasadena police officer outside a popular nightclub allegedly attacked the  officer before he was shot, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> "We've determined that (Clarence) Siler was participating in the assault on the  officer," Fullerton Police Sgt. Danny Becerra said.  </P> <P> Siler, however, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he is an  innocent victim of circumstance.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old Titan defensive end said he was not involved in the Thursday  morning fight and was only trying to get a teammate away from the crowd when  the officer drew his weapon.  </P> <P> "The next thing I knew, everybody started running past me. I looked back and  saw this guy with a gun in his hand. . . . I didn't know he was an officer, I  just thought he was some guy going crazy."  </P> <P> Siler said he "started to join the pack and run when, bam!, I got shot in the  back." He fell to the ground and braced himself with his left hand, he said,  "when, boom! I got hit in the arm. I keep trying to run and then, boom! boom!,  two more shots were fired. This guy was trying to kill me. I don't why. I think  he was just picking out the biggest guy in the crowd."  </P> <P> Siler stands 6 feet, 4 inches and weighs 240 pounds.  </P> <P> After the 2 a.m. incident outside the Carnivale Club at 1401 S. Lemon St.,  police arrested Titan players Andrew Fears, 21, and star running back and  National Football League prospect Mike Pringle, 22, on suspicion of assaulting  the officer. Both players have been released on their own recognizance.  </P> <P> Becerra said he expects similar charges to be filed against Siler and other  players when the investigation by the police and the Orange County district  attorney's office is completed.  </P> <P> Police said Pasadena Police Officer Darin McBride was tackled and kicked in the  head by five or six people, most of them football players, after he tried to  break up a fight between two women in the bar's parking lot.  </P> <P> While he was on the ground, McBride apparently grabbed his concealed  .380-caliber pistol and fired three or four rounds, Becerra said.  </P> <P> Police are investigating whether the off-duty officer was in a life-threatening  situation at the time of the shooting. He sustained minor head injuries during  the scuffle.  </P> <P> School officials have declined comment on the incident.  </P> <P> Gene Murphy, head football coach at Cal State Fullerton, said he is waiting for  the police to complete their investigation before he disciplines any players  for alleged violations of team rules.  </P> <P> After an incident two years ago when an El Toro Marine was beaten to death in a  barroom brawl with two Titan players, Murphy declared in the team playbook that  "local bars are off-limits" to team members.  </P> <P> "The punishment is up to me. It could vary," he said. According to the  playbook, players can be thrown off the team for violating the "no-bars" rule.  </P> <P> In a fight at the school pub last month, two players were suspended from spring  practice, which is now under way. Fears was one of those players.  </P> <P> Several students around campus said they were annoyed by the behavior of some  members of the Titan football team.  </P> <P> "I'm tired of reading about football players (in fights). If they're part of a  team, they should have a certain amount of responsibility to the school," said  Emily Messamer, a senior dance major.  </P> <P> Kevin Chase, a sophomore business major, had a similar reaction.  </P> <P> "It seems like there have been quite a few incidents involving athletes around  here," he said. "It reflects poorly on the school. A lot of people perceive Cal  State Fullerton as a school that is losing credibility, losing its potential.  You never hear anything like this going on at UCI or UCLA, but you always hear  things about CSF athletes."  </P> <P> Not all people on campus were critical of the football players.  </P> <P> Jack Bedell, professor of sociology and Academic Senate chairman, said he  didn't think the athletes' personal lives should be so closely scrutinized.  </P> <P> "Any time anyone is hurt it's a tragedy, but this happened on their own time,  it wasn't on university property. Frankly, it's none of our business," Bedell  said. "If it reflects poorly on the school, that's not fair because these  people are private citizens. If these were art students, would anyone pay any  attention to this?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A few days ago, the municipal intermediate  people's court held an open trial meeting to strictly punish a  group of serious criminal offenders sabotaging social order.  Four criminal offenders guilty of the most heinous crimes,  namely Zheng Yunfeng, Peng Liping, Li Jian, and Yang Wenbo, were  escorted to the execution ground and were executed by shooting.  They were guilty of murder, robbing persons of their property,  unlawfully purchasing and marketing of firearms and ammunitions,  stealing goods, indulging in corruption, and acting indecently.  Eleven criminals, namely Wu Tao, Zhang Jianguo, Guo Qinghua,  Zhao Jun, Sui Baosheng, Guo Yaohui, Yu Xiaoyan, Yang Sheng,  Huang Jianguo, Wu Jin, and Wang Hui, were sentenced to death  through first rulings and deprived of their lifelong political  rights. They were guilty of looting, murder, acting indecently,  intentionally harming persons, stealing goods, and committing  arson. Strict sanctions were also imposed on their companies.    Zheng Yunfeng, a jobless person in the municipality, was  executed. He had once been imprisoned for committing crimes.  Around 1400 on 15 May in 1993, together with his companions,  Zheng, carrying knives, sneaked, as premeditated, into an  apartment located on the east street of Guanganmen station of  Xuanwu District. Posing as a repairman, he opened the door of  Liu's house in the apartment. He killed Liu and robbed Liu of  250 Yuan, video recorders, gold ornaments, and some other  materials.    Criminal Peng Lipeng, who was executed, had been released on  bail for medical treatment. He had been punished by security  organs on several occasions for violating laws and committing  crimes. While released on bail for medical treatment in March  of 1992, he unlawfully purchased eight individual-made firelocks  and ammunition with killing and wounding capacity. At about  1600 on 16 April 1992, criminal Peng, carrying the firelocks,  sneaked into a residential house located on Guanganmenwai Street  of Xuanwu District and looted 1,000 yuan. On the afternoon of 6  May in 1992, Criminal Peng ganged up with Li Fusheng, a jobless  person (who was sentenced to life imprisonment), carried  firelocks and sharp knives and sneaked into the No. 214  residential house on Guanganmenwai Street and looted more than  100 yuan. On the afternoon of 3 May 1992 at a Sichuan food  store and a Shandong food store, criminals Peng and Li, carrying  firelocks and knives, picked quarrels with two young men, beat  them, and robbed them of their 60 yuan. [passage omitted]    Wu Tao and Zhang Jianguo, who were sentenced to death  through  first rulings, had once been punished by security organs for  violating laws. On the morning of 25 June in 1993, Criminals Wu  and Zhang, carrying daggers and some tools for criminal  purposes, sneaked into a room of a certain building in the  municipality and robbed Lodgers Kang and Li of their money.  These two criminals threatened the lodgers with knives and  robbed them of $30,000 and $10,000 Renminbi Yuan, two mobile  phones, and gold ornaments. To do away with the witness,  Criminal Zhang used the fire extinguisher in the room to beat  Kang and Li to unconsciousness and also ganged up with Wu Tao to  kill them with knives.

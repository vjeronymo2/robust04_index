			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: VTech held back by personal computers VTech Holdings, the Hong Kong-based electronics, computers and telecommunications group which is listed in London, saw pre-tax profit drop from Dollars 28.4m to Dollars 24.6m (Pounds 13.5m) in the year to March 31. The outcome included Dollars 7.1m (Dollars 4.7m) exceptional credits comprising Dollars 16.8m surplus on the sale of 35.5 per cent of its holding in Central Point Software, less Dollars 9.7m costs involved in merging the computer distribution operations in the US. Mr Allan Wong, chairman, said the results were also affected by conditions in the US personal computer market, but the diversified nature of the group's products enabled it to weather the effects of that. Although sales of personal computers increased, substantial losses were incurred in the second half bringing that side of the business to break even over the year. Under the reorganisation it was decided to focus only on higher end personal computer products on which improved margins could be obtained. Turnover rose to Dollars 560.6m (Dollars 398.2m) with personal computers accounting for 64.7 (62.1) per cent. Nearly 23 per cent came from electronic toys and games, which had a successful year following the introduction of new products. Diluted earnings per share were 14.6p (14.3p). The final dividend is 4 cents, payable August 4, to make 7 cents for the year (7.2 cents included special bonus).</p>

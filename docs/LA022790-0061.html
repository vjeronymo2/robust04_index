			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CENTER OFFERS MIXED PLATE SO FAR  </P> <P> Although the downtown restaurant industry has been licking its chops in  anticipation of extra business from the newly opened San Diego Convention  Center, industry analysts believe the fate of most restaurants will be  determined by how well they attract local patrons.  </P> <P> Observers say it is too early to know how the Convention Center will affect the  restaurant industry. The center's first two months of business have elicited  mixed reviews from local restaurateurs.  </P> <P> The opening of the Convention Center has had "a positive effect, and most  restaurateurs feel it's doing them some good," said Paul McIntyre, executive  director of the San Diego Restaurant Assn. "But, when you get down to asking  for numbers, the reviews are too mixed to put a count on it. In the opinion of  many restaurateurs, there has been too much anticipation of how much business  will be provided by the Convention Center and how many restaurants can be  supported by it."  </P> <P> Some restaurateurs have noted an increase in business during some of the  recently scheduled trade shows and conventions, which have attracted an  estimated 50,000 out-of-town visitors since it opened in early January.  </P> <P> "Since the opening, business has been exceptional," said Salvatore Gangale  owner of Salvatore's, an Italian restaurant that opened more than two years ago  on Front Street in downtown San Diego. Gangale said business was so good during  one convention last week that he ran out of tables and had to turn away  patrons.  </P> <P> But not every restaurant can expect to benefit equally from every convention,  experts say. The style, tastes and income level of Convention Center visitors  will determine which restaurants fill up and which close early.  </P> <P> Lubach's, an upscale, continental-style restaurant on North Harbor Drive,  seated many conventioneers in mid-February during a convention for the National  Assn. of Secondary School Principals, but it didn't serve a single patron from  the Action Sports Retailer trade show two weeks earlier.  </P> <P> "Not every type of group is going to be my type of clientele," said Bob Lubach,  who now runs the restaurant his father opened 34 years ago. "You're not going  to generate revenue out of every group that comes to San Diego."  </P> <P> Although analysts say restaurants as far away as University City might attract  Convention Center business, the center will have the biggest impact on the  downtown Gaslamp Quarter, which has been the focus of intense redevelopment  during the past few years.  </P> <P> Since 1986, the number of Gaslamp Quarter eateries, ranging from fast-food  outlets to trendy full-service restaurants, has nearly doubled to 50, said  Louise Miesfeld, marketing director of the Gaslamp Quarter Merchants Assn.  During a one-week period last December, four new restaurants opened in the  Gaslamp.  </P> <P> The openings have been exciting to local palates in search of exotic tastes,  but they have also been troubling to established restaurateurs competing for a  limited number of patrons.  </P> <P> "The perception I have from the restaurant people this year is that this has  been a tough year in the restaurant business because of the tremendous growth  in the restaurant industry," said San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau  spokesman Al Reese. "The growth in restaurants has been pretty rapid, and more  rapid than the growth in visitors this year. There just hasn't been enough . .  . growth in patronage."  </P> <P> That conclusion is supported in a study released last week by the accounting  and consulting firm of Laventhol &amp; Horwath. According to the study, while  food and beverage sales in restaurants throughout the city of San Diego  increased 9% between 1987 and 1988, average sales per outlet increased only 3%  over the same period.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is sales per outlet is good, but it hasn't grown a lot more  than the inflation rate," said Todd Wynne-Parry, a restaurant and food service  consultant for Laventhol &amp; Horwath. "But, when we get information from 1988  to 1989, I think we'll see strong growth."  </P> <P> Restaurateurs who want to make the most of Convention Center traffic can pay a  fee to advertise on a classy restaurant kiosk set up at the entrance to the  center. Reidy O'Neil's, a new restaurant and bar in the heart of the Gaslamp,  is among more than 50 restaurants that so far have taken advantage of the  kiosk. Larry Moss, the restaurant's managing partner, said business booms when  a convention is in town.  </P> <P> Still, the Gaslamp's future won't be determined solely by the Convention  Center, experts say. Equally important are redevelopment efforts that observers  believe will increase the downtown population and turn the area into a bustling  nighttime entertainment center rivaling New Orleans' French Quarter.  </P> <P> However, the financial health of downtown businesses could be hurt by poor  lighting and state laws that restrict amplified music and the amount of alcohol  revenue a downtown restaurant can earn, said Michael McDade, a San Diego  attorney who chairs the Gaslamp Quarter Council, a merchant planning group.  </P> <P> Downtown restaurateurs have complained that the music ordinances, which cause  problems for establishments with entertainment, interfere with their ability to  attract patrons. In December, city officials agreed to issue special permits to  downtown restaurants that hoped to circumvent an ordinance prohibiting them  from serving more alcohol than food. But the state Alcoholic Beverage Control  Department has been citing some restaurateurs for violating the music  regulations.  </P> <P> Still, most restaurateurs who opened their doors before the restrictions were  lifted and who struggled to pay their bills while the Convention Center was  being built remain optimistic that the center will attract patrons to the  Gaslamp Quarter and eventually boost business.  </P> <P> "I think everybody realizes that it's not a gravy train, but from what I've  seen so far, it's going to be a positive," said Chuck Kovar, co-owner of 2  1/2-year-old Cabo Cabo Grill and Hotel Bar downtown. "You still have to be  good. You still have to show up at work and do a good job. Reputation is  something you have to earn and keep. . . . I don't think the Convention Center  is a quick fix for a bad operator."  </P></p>

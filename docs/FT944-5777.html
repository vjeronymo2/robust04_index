			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (19): Catalyst for change - Integrated packages / Lift-truck maker Lansing Linde has moved its operations on to a single system Lansing Linde seems to be on an endless quest for perfection in its manufacturing systems and the business organisation and procedures that surround them. The UK arm of this international manufacturer of lift-trucks was moving from bespoke systems on ICL and Data General computers to a single ICL mainframe package when it was taken over by the German Linde group in 1989. The UK company has factories in Basingstoke, Wigan and Newport. But after reviewing business and systems strategies, Linde decided to move its German, French and UK manufacturing operations from different computers and software to the same system. It chose the R/2 mainframe package from SAP, running on IBM-type central computers. Paul Goode, leading the UK project as manufacturing systems manager, says R/2 was chosen because it integrated many business functions, thus allowing data sharing and eliminating duplication. In addition it handles different currencies and languages and can accommodate individual companies' needs through the use of tables of options. In the next six to nine months, the UK operation will complete the installation of R/2 modules running everything from sales order processing to scheduling, product costing, capacity planning and manufacturing control. But Mr Goode believes the whole system will be looked at again once it is installed. And he is already looking forward to evaluating the follow-on product: this is R/3, a so-called client-server system which runs on networks of PCs and small computers. 'There are so many things we can do with such an integrated system that if we tried to introduce them all while we were implementing the system we would never get there,' Mr Goode says. 'We have to keep the business running while the system goes in. Once it is fully live, I believe we will review everything again to get still more benefits.' At national level, those benefits come not least from the integrated nature of the system, which means everyone uses the same information. Mr Goode says this integration also demands discipline in data management, which initially raised new issues as well as benefits. 'It's very important that everyone uses the same data, but that in turn makes the data very important,' he says. 'Before, different functions had their own data on the ICL or Data General systems. But now, for example, as soon as a delivery is recorded by goods inward, finance knows it's there and can immediately see if the price is correct. This means all data entry has to be accurate, which is a great benefit, but it can cause problems of discipline in data handling in the early days. At international levels, the use of the same system in different countries means that each national company can link up through the group network to check stocks in other countries to meet orders. A co-ordinated bill of materials means the company can have a single product list across Europe which accurately reflects all the products available from any site. Mr Goode says that in the UK the system has been a catalyst for change. Lansing Linde has built a new Pounds 43m factory in Basingstoke and introduced new products as well as the computer system in the past four years. 'Introducing a package like R/2 demands that you look at all your business processes, which we had to do anyway,' he says. 'The system has therefore been an enabler in that exercise.' Supplier profile SAP: formed in Germany in 1972 and in the UK in 1988. Product: R/2, an integrated package covering everything from accounting and human resources to logistics and manufacturing. It was launched in 1980 and the current release was announced in 1993. Lansing Linde expressed uncertainty about the future of this mainframe product, especially after the introduction of the R/3 client-server version in 1992; SAP says it is committed to R/2 until well into the next century and that this is reflected in the fact that it is working on a new release. Turnover: DM1.1bn in 1993 with net profit DM146.2m. UK turnover was Pounds 10.8m. Employees: 4,000, including 75 in the UK. Hardware and operating systems: IBM mainframes. Number of users: 1,950 worldwide, including 25 in the UK. Price: on application. Sales and support/maintenance: maintenance is 10 per cent of the software price. Contact: UK head office.

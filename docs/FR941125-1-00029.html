			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The AOV and AOP tests have been clarified and reaffirmed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the specification. Note that no alternative procedures have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been approved for the AOV and AOP, even though manufacturers may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be using alternatives. The specification clearly states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative procedures require approval by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, source owners and operators must obtain approvals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an alternative procedure prior to seeking a site-specific COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Performance Specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The major change to the PS&hyph;1 demonstrations from the 1983 specification occurs in section 7, Performance Specification Verification Procedures. The proposal requires that testing be conducted at the affected facility. Current practices have allowed verification tests to be conducted at the COMS manufacturers' facility. However, the 1983 specifications intended verification testing to be performed at the affected facility to ensure that the entire COMS system was evaluated for the specific installation. The current practices have resulted in excluding the data recording portion of the system used at the installation under normal measurement conditions and, thereby, limiting assessment of the COMS for the specific installation. For this reason, the proposed specification clarifies where the required PS&hyph;1 testing of section 7 is to be conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also simplifies procedures for calibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attenuator selection. The COMS's have been typically required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate a certain degree of calibration error over a range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions specified as the span value. This span value may or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not correspond to the actual instrument range (0 to 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent opacity). The primary concern of COMS data users is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of the instrument to measure accurately opacities at,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or near the applicable standard. Once the opacity level exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard, the magnitude of the emissions tends to be of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lesser concern than the duration of the operation. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal includes selection of appropriate attenuators and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration error test for the applicable opacity emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specifications recognize the need to set a surrogate emission limit for purposes of conducting the calibration error test. This is due to the fact that some authorities set opacity limitations of zero percent, and the specification must assess calibration accuracy and linearity around the standard. Attenuator opacity values are specified in terms of optical density (or transmittance) which exhibits a logarithmic relationship to opacity. Because of the nonlinear nature of this relationship, COMS calibration at high opacity values becomes more difficult. At the low opacity emission limitations of current regulations, e.g., 20 percent, the nonlinear relationship of opacity and optical density is not severe and is within the error specification in this proposal. Therefore, a surrogate limit for purposes of the calibration error test would continue to assure acceptable COMS accuracy, even though the actual emission limitation was below the surrogate value. Consequently, where emission standards have been set at 10 percent opacity or less, the proposal specifies a surrogate 10 percent opacity limit for purposes of conducting the calibration error test. The EPA contacted attenuator manufacturers who indicated that certifiable low opacity, i.e., 2 percent opacity (98 percent transmittance) attenuators, necessary to comply with the required testing, are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where dual standards are specified, e.g., a 10-percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opacity limitation with an allowance for one 6-minute period in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an hour not to exceed 40 percent opacity, the calibration error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test must be conducted over the full range of standards. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test may be conducted as a three-point calibration error test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the range, i.e., 10 to 40 percent opacity, or separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-point calibration error tests around each requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal describes procedures for setting the instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero and upscale calibration values and zero alignment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal specifies that a check of the adequacy of the zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting with the alignment must be made. If discrepancies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between measured values exist, they should be resolved prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stack installation. At this time (if part of the system), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero-jig zero setting also should be adjusted to coincide with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instrument zero for the monitor pathlength, recorded and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently set.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1983 specifications did not specify the use of secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments to establish secondary attenuators for calibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> error tests. Today's specification provides a procedure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying a secondary instrument. The conditioning period has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been incorporated into the operational test period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational test period is now a 336-hour test period during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the maintenance and operational restrictions, that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required of both conditioning and operational periods in the 1983  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications, still apply. An additional test has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included to address short-term diurnal fluctuations in COMS's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opacity output readings. This 1-hour drift test and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification are designed to assess and limit the amount of zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and upscale calibration value drifts due to operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions occurring during a 24-hour period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

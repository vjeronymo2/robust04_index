			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: 'Street Scene' lives up to its promise - The Coliseum has got it right this time round that Street Scene, termed a 'Broadway opera' by its creators, is one of the key achievements of Kurt Weill's opera-composing career and thus of our century; that the ENO remains a company capable of incomparable ensemble work; and that all David Pountney's 1989 production needed was the paring-away of its bedizening excesses to afford an evening of musical theatre on the highest level. Under the care of the revival producer, Nicolette Molnar, the show has been pruned, tightened, focused. The plethora of 'freezes', tricks with cut-out props during the Ice Cream Sextet, jokey curtain calls and other examples of excrescent business have gone, leaving a concentration on character-observation and a fine meshing of the personal with the communal that do more than any producer's underlining of detail ever could to reveal the fierce vitality and integrity of the opera's musico-dramatic fabric. Thus handled, Street Scene emerges as one hoped it would first time round at the Coliseum - as a startlingly original masterpiece, a finely planned and executed meeting-point of 'popular' and 'serious' rarely achieved in our categorised, compartmentalised century, a work of luminous humanity whose vision of life at the lower end of the city is at once a period piece and piercingly, at times painfully modern. In 1992, indeed, with hard times, vagrants in city doorways and house repossessions all around us, the 'relevance' of the work might be thought too grim to bear. But of course it is not like that at all: the multifariousness of the musical idiom, and the determination of Weill and his librettists to please and to move but never to lecture their audiences, ensure that one leaves the theatre uplifted in spite of the threadbare setting and the tragic finale. The conductor, James Holmes, is another notable improvement. He keeps the action fluent, the colours bright, the pace cumulatively building. In this difficult-sized and -shaped theatre, balance between voices and instruments is still uneven (might the company not consider experimenting with a smaller-sized pit band?), but the problem has diminished under Mr Holmes's care, and his comprehension of the score's marvellous unity-through-variety is impressively evident. The cast is filled with newcomers - Meriel Dickinson's magnificently implacable Mrs Jones, Anthony Mee's ebullient, ice-cream-apostrophising Lippo Fiorentino and Terry Jenkins's fire-breathing Mr Kaplan are the most important revenants from 1989. There are too many keenly acted and sung cameos to list: the Henry of Keel Watson, Greta Fiorentino of Christine Bunning and Harry Easter of Richard Halton demand particular mention, but so do the raucously exhilarating Dick and Mae of Philip Gould and Caroline O'Connor - their showstopper did just that - and the excellent contributions from all the children. The principals come fresh to their roles. Mrs Maurrant affords Janice Cairns one of her finest achievements on this stage: powerful of voice, artlessly sympathetic and shining with womanly candour, she takes her proper place as the opera's tragic heroine. Mark Richardson finds the right raw physical and vocal intensity as her violent, inarticulate husband. As Abraham Kaplan, the conscience of the piece, the young American tenor Kevin Anderson (British debut) lacked a little in mellifluousness but nothing in naive passion - this was another acutely physical performance. Lesley Garrett may have seemed a surprising piece of casting as Rose Maurrant; in the event, she subdues her natural attention-grabbing tendencies to eloquent and touching purpose. Her New York accent needs more work. This revival, sponsored by BMW, has been pitched at special low prices. In crude value-for-money terms - and in other, nobler ways as well - it represents, therefore, one of the greatest bargains the London theatre currently has to offer.</p>

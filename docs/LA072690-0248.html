			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAX VENABLE RETURNS TO HIS FIELD OF DREAMS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THE ANGEL LEFT FIELDER CAME BACK AFTER A FULL YEAR AWAY FROM THE  GAME, AND BUCKING THE ODDS, HE'S PLAYING BETTER THAN EVER.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Max Venable made what seemed to be a wise decision. He quit  playing baseball.  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles helped him reach that decision, releasing Venable at the  conclusion of spring training. At age 30, he reluctantly accepted his lot and  took a job working construction in Marin County.  </P> <P> Last year, Venable made what seemed to be an unwise decision. After sitting out  the entire 1988 season, he signed a contract with the Angels. So rather than  spend more time at home with his wife and three young children, he spent the  spring playing baseball in Triple A Edmonton.  </P> <P> For players such as Max Venable, professional baseball is a numbing succession  of trips back and forth between the majors and the minors. At some point, a  player decides enough is enough. Venable reached that point, then changed his  mind.  </P> <P> "Kids dream of playing in the big leagues," Venable said. "It's hard to pull  away from a game you've played most of your life."  </P> <P> But Venable's dreams often are fragmented, and so it was last year when the  Angels called him up in July. Venable collected 10 hits in 20 at-bats and was  promptly issued a return ticket to Edmonton.  </P> <P> In other words, nothing had changed.  </P> <P> Until this year.  </P> <P> Venable has spent all or part -- mostly part -- of 11 professional seasons in  the big leagues. But never has he done anything even remotely comparable to  this season.  </P> <P> He is batting .304, more than 60 points above his career average. He is playing  good defense in left field, as he showed Tuesday night here against the A's  when he threw out Jose Canseco and Ozzie Canseco at second base in separate  innings. A left-handed hitter who platoons with Dante Bichette, Venable will  almost certainly avoid banishment to Edmonton.  </P> <P> Having completed his stretching exercises at the Oakland Coliseum before  Wednesday's 13-3 loss to the A's, the loudspeaker blaring that old Doors  classic "Break on Through," Venable was asked to describe how it must feel to  have this sort of success after all he has been through.  </P> <P> "It's just one of those years when things go right," he said. "I have a manager  who believes in me. You could say I'm finally in the right place at the right  time."  </P> <P> Angels Manager Doug Rader has little to smile about these days, his team  languishing in fifth place, 15 1/2 games behind the A's. But the mention of  Venable's name lights up his weary face.  </P> <P> "I admire him a tremendous amount," Rader said. "He's got a very strong  character. That's almost unheard of, sitting out a year at his age and then  coming back. But he has done everything he could possibly do to get to this  point."  </P> <P> That's the way it has always been, ever since Venable signed with the Dodgers  in 1976 after initially accepting a football scholarship from the University of  Utah.  </P> <P> This is his fourth port of call in the majors. Just twice -- in 1983 with the  San Francisco Giants and in 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds -- has Venable lasted  an entire season in the bigs. He is making $250,000 this year with the Angels,  with possibly even richer prospects for the future.  </P> <P> "If I finish out well, I don't know, it might get me another year or two,"  Venable said. "But I do know I want to stay in baseball in some capacity. It's  a game I won't be able to pull away from until the day I die."  </P></p>

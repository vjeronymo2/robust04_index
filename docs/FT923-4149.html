			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Uneasy peace reigns at Thailand's national airline - The fragile rehabilitation by technocrats of a company accustomed to military control With less than a week before Thailand's general election on Sunday, the caretaker government yesterday wrested control of Thai Airways International (Thai), the partially privatised national airline, from the air force and installed its own nominees on the board. An extraordinary shareholders' meeting at Thai headquarters yesterday proved a victory for the technocrats who want the airline, capitalised USDollars 3.5bn, to be more professionally managed. Stockbrokers and Thai executives believe it will take time to put the troubled company back on a sure footing. The vote, and subsequent board meeting, which elected Mr Pandit Bunyapana, the finance ministry permanent secretary, chairman and Mr Chatrachai Bunya-Ananta, Thai's marketing chief, president, followed a dramatic and sometimes farcical few weeks of public resistance from the senior air force officers who have made Thai their fiefdom. Air Chief Marshal Weera Kitchathorn, the president ousted yesterday, had signed a resignation letter prepared for him by the government and then retracted it. Air Chief Marshal Gun Pimarnthip, previous chairman of the board, had infuriated the government by abruptly closing an earlier meeting designed to replace the directors. Even yesterday's meeting faced a vain, last-minute legal challenge from shareholders complaining that 14 days' notice had not been given. Neither of the two air chief marshals attended. When the general meeting ended yesterday, the shareholders crowding the conference room applauded. The old board was voted out with 1.3bn shares in favour of the move - most of them representing the finance ministry's 93 per cent stake - and only 7,000 against. Thai shares closed up Bt2.5 at Bt63 yesterday, having risen 22 per cent during the past week, in response to government action against the air force. That topped the Bt60 price at which the first 7 per cent tranche of the company was sold to the public earlier this year. Two clouds, however, hang over Thai's new board. The first is that a coalition government emerging from next Sunday's general election might be sympathetic to the military and yield to attempts by the air force to regain control of the airline. Air Chief Marshal Gun was quoted as saying last week that the air force would bow to pressure for the moment, but 'we will change it later'. Air force officers are also thought to be behind corruption charges which have been levelled at Mr Chatrachai, the new president, and which will weaken his authority until an investigation is concluded. The second and more immediate worry is that the new board, however professional, will find it difficult to return Thai to healthy profitability. Thai has previously massaged its profit figures by selling aircraft and leasing them back, and stockbrokers suspect it was planning to do the same this year. Such ploys make its figures difficult to interpret, but one stockbroker estimates that net profits for the year to September 30 will reach only Bt2.4bn, well below the company's forecast and the previous year's Bt3.5bn (USDollars 139m). Morale among the 18,000 employees has been affected by the crash in July of a Thai Airbus bound for Kathmandu, in which all 113 passengers and crew were killed, and by the disagreements between supporters and opponents of the air force; most of the 500 pilots of Thai nationality are former air force personnel. At a news conference yesterday, Mr Pandit announced plans to tighten financial controls at the company, to improve the airline's international image, and make decisions more transparent. Unnecessary investments, he said, would be postponed and the performance of various divisions closely monitored. Mr Pandit said all airlines had suffered in recent months, but insisted that Thai was operating profitably. Thai's performance, however, remains bound up with politics. Occupancy rates plunged and flights were cancelled when troops shot dead at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok in May and frightened away thousands of tourists. Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, then supreme military commander and chairman of Thai by virtue of being the air force chief - in accordance with the company's old articles of association - was widely held responsible for the killings. When an interim civilian government was appointed by royal decree in June to defuse the political crisis, Mr Anand Panyarachun, prime minister, moved quickly to reduce the military's influence in politics and business. That included enterprises controlled by the state (such as the telecommunications authorities) and Thai. In theory, the finance ministry, as holder of most of the shares, could have done what it wanted with the company at any time. In practice, Thai was always controlled by air force officers with few business qualifications, even if the day-to-day running of the company was usually handled by professionals. It was left to Mr Anand and Mr Nukul Prachuabmoh, his combative transport and communications minister, to demilitarise Thai. They did so yesterday, but until the airline is fully privatised, the risk remains that Thai may again fall victim to greedy politicians and military men. Asked what there was to stop a new government reversing the board revolution at Thai yesterday, a senior executive said: 'Nothing.'</p>

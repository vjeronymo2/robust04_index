			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL BACKS DOUBLING CAPACITY OF LANDFILL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles city panel voted Friday to recommend nearly doubling the capacity  of the controversial Lopez Canyon landfill in Lake View Terrace and setting up  a $5-million fund for amenities such as parks in the adjacent community.  </P> <P> The Board of Public Works endorsed an expansion aimed at reducing the noise and  unsightliness of the dump by relocating the access road used by city garbage  trucks.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials said those revisions would cut into the landfill's  capacity and shorten its usable life span by several years.  </P> <P> The expansion of the city-owned facility would allow the number of trucks using  it every day to increase from 400 to 650 and would extend the working life of  the dump through the year 2005. The expansion would nearly double the dump's  capacity to 26 million tons.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sanaa, April 29 (AFP) -- The authorities in  northern Yemen Friday accused southern troops of leaving a camp  south of Sanaa and escalating tension following fierce tank  battles which left more than 100 dead.    President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's General People's Congress  (GPC) said a southern brigade had deployed in the Dhamar region,  100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Sanaa, on the orders of the  GPC's southern rival, the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP).    The GPC said it feared "more widespread clashes" between  rival northern and southern forces.    A military mediation committee was trying to "persuade the  commanders of the Ba'Sahib brigade to return to their camp and  eliminate military tension in the Dhamar region," the GPC said.    On April 6 the GPC accused the same brigade of shelling  official buildings, including Republican Guard and police  headquarters, in the Dhamar region.    YSP military officials said Friday a southern armoured  brigade had retreated to the mountains around 'Imran north of  Sanaa, following the latest fighting.    The officials said the 1,200 troops pulled out after  reinforcements of northern troops, including elite Republican  Guards, arrived at 'Imran, 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of  Sanaa.    Yemeni journalists who visited the scene said the northern  troops gained the upper hand in the fighting, and the southern  forces sought refuge with an allied tribe, the Bakil.    The GPC said searches were under way for Colonel Sayf  al-Baqri, commander of the southern armoured brigade held  responsible for the bloody clashes in 'Imran. [passage omitted]</p>

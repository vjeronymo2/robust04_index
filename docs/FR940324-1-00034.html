			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's current policy permits entry to certain vehicles on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-by-case basis. EPA proposes to formalize this policy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant exemptions to individual owners (individuals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses) to import their personal vehicles ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , vehicles not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for the purpose of resale), provided they have proven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that their vehicles were: (1) Originally manufactured to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle described in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OEM's application for certification, or (2) modified to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical in all material respects to a vehicle described in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OEMs application for certification. EPA is not proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change individual vehicle owners' responsibility for payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any Gas Guzzler taxes applicable to vehicles they import.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's proposal also offers individual importers the option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of having an ICI import their vehicle or engine for the purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of modifying it to be identical in all material respects to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or motor vehicle engine certified by the OEM for sale in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States. Vehicles imported under this option must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified by the ICI according to OEM instructions, but do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be tested. EPA is confident that detailed instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by an OEM specifying parts to be installed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments to be performed will be sufficient to make a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or engine identical in all material respects to a certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine, because these modifications will result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine having the same parts and parameters as are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the OEM's application for certification, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes the vehicles or engines produced by the OEM within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given certified engine family. Individual vehicle owners who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might otherwise have to incur the greater expense of ICI testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a vehicle they wish to import may benefit from this option,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if modification instructions can be obtained from the OEM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Emission Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today, EPA is proposing to delete the requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonconforming light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1505 or 85.1509 meet current year emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Instead of meeting current year emission standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these vehicles will be allowed to meet emission standards (with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable deterioration factors applied) that were in effect at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of original vehicle production, with a few exceptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These vehicles must, however, meet such emission standards using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the currently applicable testing procedures, and must meet all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable current model year fuel economy requirements. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not proposing to change ICIs' status as small volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and they must comply with corporate average fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy (CAFE) requirements as imposed by the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation (DOT). This revision would give owners of older  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicles a way to import their vehicles. Many of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are now effectively excluded from importation due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high cost of modification to meet current model year standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which may be greater than the value of the vehicle involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal does not change the emission standards for new motor vehicles imported by the original equipment manufacturers. This proposal changes only the emission standards for motor vehicles that were originally produced in earlier years than the model year of importation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA would continue, as under current regulations, to define  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the useful life of imported nonconforming vehicles as a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time or mileage of use in the United States, beginning with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date and mileage at the time of a vehicle's release to the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or purchaser. Consequently, this proposal would not affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranty and recall requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1508 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85.1510 or any other requirement under that subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Precertification Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposal revises the precertification exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to ICIs pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(3) for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation of nonconforming prototype vehicles for use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification. Presently, the ICI must obtain written approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Administrator prior to importing such nonconforming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicles, must use the vehicle to obtain a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity, and must obtain a certificate of conformity within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 180 days of importation. In this rulemaking, EPA retains these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, and proposes additional requirements regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of precertification exemptions given to an ICI at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given time and EPA's criteria for granting precertification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(3) while other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precertification exemptions are pending. In addition, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is made for extension of the 180 day time limit under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain circumstances. A precertification exemption allows an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICI to bring a vehicle or engine into the U.S. for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining a certificate of conformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim  yesterday told the West to stop lecturing and hectoring  developing countries.    "Give us a break," he said. "To allow ourselves to be  lectured and hectored on freedom and human rights after 100  years of struggle to regain our own liberty and human dignity,  by those who participated in or benefited from our subjugation,  is to willingly suffer impudence."    Datuk Sri Anwar was speaking at The Asia Society's business  conference at Shangri-La Hotel. He said that the debate between  the developed and developing world had not achieved anything  because of the "cultural arrogance" of the West. "There are  those who consider they still have a civilising mission in Asia,  namely to sermonise Asians about freedom and human rights."    Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, acknowledged  that Asia had to catch up in many areas. Countries like China  and Vietnam had adjusted to join the world community. But  Europe and North America had to contend with a host of economic,  social and political problems in recent years, he said.    "While Asian countries have made the necessary adjustments,  the West too need the will and vision to steer their societies  out of the present morass."</p>

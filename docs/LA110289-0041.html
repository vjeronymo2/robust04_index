			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: SPECIAL VERSION OF WILD RICE DISH  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: This rice dish is one of my favorites for the holidays or for any  time of year.  </P> <P> I wondered if you could decrease its calories and cholesterol.  </P> <P>  -- MARY, Buffalo Grove, Ill.  </P> <P> WILD RICE CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 1 cup wild rice  </P> <P> 1 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> 3/4 cup long-grain white rice  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sliced almonds  </P> <P> 3 cups chicken broth  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups whipping cream  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Wash wild rice and cover with boiling water. Soak 1 hour, then drain. Saute  mushrooms and onion in 1 tablespoon butter.  </P> <P> Combine wild rice, white rice, sauteed mushrooms and onion, 5 tablespoons  butter, salt, pepper, almonds, broth and whipping cream. Place in greased  2-quart casserole.  </P> <P> Bake, covered, at 350 degrees 1 1/2 hours. Remove cover, top with Parmesan  cheese and dot with butter. Bake at 425 degrees 5 minutes more. Makes about 7  cups.  </P> <P> DEAR MARY: This is an excellent recipe. However, if you want to enjoy this  casserole often, there are some changes that will make that possible without  compromising your family's health.  </P> <P> The changes I have made result in a lighter and more delicately flavored dish  that is much less greasy and far better for you. For example, by toasting the  almonds before adding them to the casserole, you can get by with half as many  without losing their wonderful flavor.  </P> <P> I used long-grain brown rice instead of white in my revision because I like its  nutty flavor, but long-grain white rice also works.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> REVISED WILD RICE CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 1 cup wild rice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sliced almonds  </P> <P> 1 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 3/4 cup long-grain brown rice  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 3 cups defatted chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups evaporated skim milk  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Wash wild rice, cover with boiling water, soak 1 hour and drain. Toast almonds  at 350 degrees 7 minutes.  </P> <P> Saute mushrooms and onion in 1 tablespoon margarine until onion is tender.  Drain liquid. Spray 2-quart casserole with non-stick vegetable coating.  </P> <P> Combine wild rice, almonds, sauteed mushrooms and onion, remaining 1 tablespoon  margarine, brown rice, salt, pepper, chicken stock and milk and place in  casserole.

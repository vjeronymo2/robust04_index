The president was talking to  the chairman of All Party Parliamentary Human Rights Group of  Britain, Lord (Eric Evory) in Islamabad today. The president  said that the only way to resolve the problem is to give the  people of Kashmir their inalienable right of self-determination.  Referring to the gross violations of human rights in the  occupied Kashmir, the president said that Pakistan would  continue to utilize all diplomatic channels to awaken the world  conscience against continuing repression in the occupied valley.  Lord (Evory) told the president that the UN ability to help in  the resolution of the problem has been stymied by the Indian  reluctance to cooperate.    Lord (Evory) also called on Senate Chairman Mr. Wasim Sajjad  in Islamabad today. The Senate chairman drew the attention to  the fact that since the Kashmir issue has its roots in the time  of British India, it is special responsibility of the Great  Britain to influence the world opinion for peaceful solution of  the issue. Expressing his deep concern over the situation, Lord  (Evory) said that the magnitude of atrocities being committed by  the Indian forces has no match in the past.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BONITA  </P> <P> A Carlsbad chiropractor pleaded not guilty Tuesday to setting a fire at a  Bonita store on which swastikas were spray-painted before the business was  torched.  </P> <P> Douglas Wofford, 41, was ordered held in County Jail in lieu of $250,000.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Lamborn said Wofford "was caught literally in the act  of setting a fire at a store in Bonita."  </P> <P> After his arrest Friday by a passing sheriff's deputy, Wofford told the deputy  that the Iraqi store owner was "evil," Lamborn said in the courtroom of  Municipal Court Judge John Thompson.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Wofford told the deputy: "I'm not your average arsonist.  There's more than meets the eye. I had a reason for doing this."  </P> <P> Lamborn said the remarks were made while Wofford was being taken to jail after  his arrest near the Bonita Market.  </P> <P> A flammable liquid had been poured inside the store on newspapers piled up at  the entrance and ignited, according to Lamborn. Damage to the store and a  neighboring Catholic church was $200,000.  </P> <P> Thompson set a bail review for Friday and a preliminary hearing for Aug. 7.  </P></p>

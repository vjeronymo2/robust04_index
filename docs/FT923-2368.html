			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Holiday prices may rise soon TRAVEL companies, ever eager for early cash, are encouraging customers to book their summer 1993 holidays now. Bargain-hunters should do so. Holidays prices will probably not rise over the next few months. But if the pound remains weak until Christmas, foreign holidays may become more expensive and some operators might abandon their no-surcharge policy. The big tour operators began selling their summer 1993 holidays last month, most undertaking to honour brochure prices and not levy surcharges. Many took advantage of the dollar, then weak, to offer cut-price holidays to the US and the Caribbean. The weak US currency helped to keep down the price of holidays to other destinations, as airline fuel is priced in dollars. Mr Keith Waller, marketing director of Owners Abroad Holidays, the second-biggest UK travel group, says the large companies all bought US currency forward when the dollar stood at about Dollars 1.90 to the pound. A stronger dollar will not immediately add to the cost of providing holidays. Even relatively small holiday companies see forward buying as an essential part of their operation. Mr Noel Josephides, a director of Sunvil Travel, the specialist operator, says that before this week's currency turmoil he had bought forward three quarters of the dollars he needed for the next year at Dollars 1.92. He had also bought forward a third of his Greek drachma and half his Portuguese escudo requirements. Mr Andrew Wilson, commercial director of travel agents Thomas Cook, says most companies' forward buying arrangements account for only 65 per cent to 70 per cent of their total requirements, so that a stronger dollar might eventually place some upward pressure on prices. The large companies will issue new editions of their brochures towards the end of the year. Smaller companies publish brochures for the first time in November. Mr Wilson says that if the pound remains weak relative to the dollar, prices may go up. Some companies might not offer a 'no surcharge' guarantee with the new brochures, industry officials believe, although the Association of British Travel Agents code of practice stipulates that companies must absorb increased costs up to 2 per cent of the holiday price. If costs rise further they may levy a surcharge of up to 10 per cent of the holiday price. Abta members need the association's approval to levy surcharges. Of the 665 Abta tour operators, only five currently have permission to levy additional charges.</p>

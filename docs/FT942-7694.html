			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rothmans in ADollars 60m capital return Rothmans Holdings, the Australian cigarette group 50 per cent owned by Rothmans International, announced a ADollars 60.9m (USDollars 44.3m) capital return following a rise in earnings for the year to last March. Net profit jumped 82 per cent to ADollars 73.7m from ADollars 40.5m on a 5 per cent sales rise to ADollars 1.56bn from ADollars 1.48bn, and the annual dividend is to be raised to 40 cents a share from 33 cents. The improved bottom line mainly reflected a clean slate on abnormals, following a ADollars 29.9m abnormal loss the previous year. Profit before charges was almost static at ADollars 132.3m. The latest result excluded a ADollars 12.6m extraordinary loss on withdrawal of operations from the Philippines. Directors said the decision to make a capital return, which will halve the par value of the company's shares to 50 cents, reflected three main factors: the Philippines closure, high cash balances and low interest rates. Net cash held jumped by ADollars 67m to ADollars 186.5m in the year. Directors said future earnings would not be affected by the capital return. But earnings would be boosted following removal of the Philippines operations, which lost ADollars 18.1m in the latest year, compared to an ADollars 32.5m loss previously. The company would continue its concentration on operating efficiencies to help offset new tobacco marketing restrictions. The result followed tax provision of ADollars 54.8m (ADollars 53.5m previously) and depreciation ADollars 29.5m (ADollars 30.9m). Interest expense fell from ADollars 11.9m to ADollars 4.5m.</p>

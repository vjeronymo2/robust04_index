			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Jibril al-Rujub, official in charge of </F> Palestinian Preventive Security in the West Bank, in Jericho on  22 May -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] I dare say that the reception  my colleagues and I were accorded at the headquarters of the  Preventive Security was a virtual plebiscite on the popularity  of Fatah, the PLO, and Yasir 'Arafat and his political program.  This is a great thing in which I take pride and which  encourages me and my colleagues to stick to our political and  organizational program. What has been achieved thus far is just  one step on the road to the establishment of our independent  Palestinian state.</p>

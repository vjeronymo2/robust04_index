			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Hosokawa begins moves to salvage political reform Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday made no headway in trying to salvage an agreement on political reform before his time runs out at the end of the week. Parliamentary officials of the ruling seven-party coalition last night met members of the opposition Liberal Democratic party to try to form a joint panel of the upper and lower houses, as a forum for hammering out a compromise. They failed to agree, and plan to meet again today. The LDP blamed 'co-ordination' problems. The party is divided between a minority who seek a watered-down version of the political reform plans - the leadership's official line - and a majority who have strong reservations over the proposed abandonment of Japan's multi-seat constituency system. In one small sign of possible progress, the leadership of the Social Democratic (socialist) party, the largest coalition partner, said it was ready to meet the LDP. There proved to be more anti-reform socialist rebels than had been expected, and it was their defection which resulted in the upper house voting down the reform plans last Friday. If, as is likely, Mr Hosokawa fails to get an agreement by the end of this parliamentary session on Saturday at midnight, the bills will expire. Mr Hosokawa will then be under pressure to carry out his implied promise to resign, despite the fact that he is Japan's most popular politician. The Keidanren, the leading business federation, yesterday called on him not to dissolve parliament and call a snap general election. Prolonged political uncertainty would further damage the economy, warned Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the Keidanren's chairman. He called on the government and opposition to join forces to enact political reform and to complete a long-delayed economic stimulus package forthwith. Political observers believe that if Mr Hosokawa does resign, he would hand over the prime ministership to a leading member of the seven-party coalition, rather than calling an election straight away. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and leader of the Japan Renewal party, set up last June by defectors from the LDP, or Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of the New Harbinger party, another former LDP splinter group, are mentioned by Japanese political commentators as front-runners for the job.</p>
